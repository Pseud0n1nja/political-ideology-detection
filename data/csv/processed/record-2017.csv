0,House,115,0.312,4,2017-01-04,Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia.," Mr.  Speaker,  in this new year, we must  make things right for our miners and  their widows. We must act now to keep  the promise. We must honor their work  in the mines by protecting the pensions  and healthcare benefits they worked  their whole lives to earn.  We must pass legislation I have cosponsored to protect these hard-earned  benefits  for  families  like  Rita  Blankenship of McDowell County who  wrote me asking for help. Here is what  she said:  ‘‘My husband was promised  healthcare coverage  in 1975 when he  went to work in the mines and joined  the union. I am asking if you could do  everything possible to get this passed  so we will have health  care,’’  she  wrote.  These miners and their families deserve no less than what they worked  their entire lives to earn: the peace of  mind that comes with a pension and secure health care.  I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting legislation to protect our  miners, their widows, and their families. We owe it to them to keep our  word.  f  RECESS  ",2017
1,House,115,0.566,4,2017-01-04,Mr. CARTER of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Jimmy  Burnsed, who has served as chairman  of the Bryan County Board of Commissioners for the past 12 years.  On December 31, 2016, he officially retired from serving on the board. Beyond serving as chairman, Mr. Burnsed  has dedicated an admirable amount of  his  life to public service. Nearly 40  years ago, he began serving on the City  Council for Garden City, Georgia, before serving 4 years as mayor. In 1989,  he moved from Garden City to Bryan  County. In 2005, he ran and was elected  chairman of  the Board of Commissioners.  Mr. Burnsed’s accomplishments on  the board since that time are numerous. He worked to build a new administrative building for the county to hold  meetings and other events; he managed  and  planned  the  infrastructure  for  Bryan County, which has grown more  than 50 percent in size during his tenure; and he helped to upgrade Bryan  County’s trails, parks, and recreation  centers. Mr. Burnsed always put the  community first and performed his duties in a way that would make any constituent very proud.

It is truly bipartisan and bicameral. It is a good bill. I thank Senator JAMESLANKFORDof Oklahoma for  his work on the Senate side, and we do  hope  that  it will make  it  swiftly  through the Senate.  The Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act  provides the public and Congress with  increased transparency about Federal  programs,  including how much they  cost and any benefits that they provide. It sounds like a good and worthy  thing to do, and it passed the previous  Congress. I urge my colleagues to vote  in favor of it here in the 115th Congress, and I am glad it is one of the  first things that we are doing.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2017
5,House,115,0.6,11,2017-01-04,Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee.," I thank  the chairman for yielding to me and for  his support of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, this is very simple, bipartisan legislation that would require  organizers of Presidential libraries to  disclose the identities of donors and  the amounts  they give.  It wouldn’t  limit any donations; it would simply  require disclosure.  I  introduced  this  legislation several Congresses ago because I felt then and feel now that the  public should be made aware of possible conflicts of interest that sitting  Presidents can have or may have while  raising funds for their libraries.  First of all, I thank Ranking Member  for again cosponsoring this  very important legislation and making  it bipartisan. The legislation is so bipartisan that, after the first time we  passed the bill—and it passed 392–3—it  was taken over, at my request and with  my agreement, by then-Chairman Waxman, who made it his bill. We passed it  once again, and we passed it in the last  Congress by a simple voice vote, so  there is a lot of support for this bill. In  the Senate, it was introduced by Mr.  CARPERand Mr. Coburn, when he was  in the Senate.

6,House,115,-0.658,25,2017-01-04,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, how  much time remains on each side?  ",2017
7,House,115,0.505,25,2017-01-04,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  My  colleague  from Tennessee has  been a good friend on many issues. I  know he  is passionate about regulations and laws that he would like to  have passed, and so am I.  All of us in Congress have seen that  it is extremely easy—the longer you  are here, the more you will see it—it is  extremely easy to stop something here.  The same is true about those 61 or so  regulations. Any combining of regulations, unless they are overwhelmingly  disapproved,  actually makes  them  harder to pass. We are not going to put  61 pieces of legislation, each of which  has at least one or two or three or a  dozen Republicans who vehemently oppose that regulation being rescinded.  The fact is it is only the worst of the  worst  that are going  to be  stayed  through this process and then reevaluated by the new administration.  I will mention, though, for my colleagues on the other side of this debate  today, that we do appropriations every  year. The American people, and for the  freshmen who haven’t voted on appropriations yet, think of appropriations  as somehow different than the law. It  really isn’t. Appropriation is simply a  law that provides funding.  Every appropriation bill during the  entire nearly  8 years  of President  Obama has been some form of a continuing resolution or an omnibus. But  as my colleague from Tennessee knows,  every one of those has had dozens to  hundreds of laws attached to them. We  call them riders. We have terms for  them. The fact is that a single appropriations bill, often done just before  the end of funding of the government,  always—always—has  dozens,  if  not  hundreds, of laws attached to it.  So the idea that we don’t group together things which are relatively noncontroversial, that will cause someone  to still vote for the bill in spite of it  being in there, would be to be dishonest  to the freshmen who need to know that  we do  for efficiency bring  together  things that we can pass en bloc, and we  do it all the time—and even major legislation. I dare say, the Affordable Care  Act and others are, in fact, multiple  in  pieces of  legislation put together  one package.  So lest our freshmen who are about  to take their first vote on a piece of  legislation—or one that could have a  major  impact—misunderstand, bringing together multiple pieces into one  bill is common, but it is always done in  order to gain votes or to maintain  votes. In fact, you do it at your folly if  you lose votes.  I would say to my friend and colleague from Michigan that there is no  likelihood that 61 pieces of regulation  will be put together because there is no  chance that there would be 61 pieces  that even all Republicans would agree  should be revoked. I would imagine the  number would be less. I suspect that if  my bill said 2 or 5 or 10, it would still  be opposed for the same reason, which  is that it creates inefficiency if there  are multiple  generally  agreed  bad  pieces of legislation that need to be  considered.  Lastly, and I am not closing, but I  think this may be one of my closing remarks,  for  freshmen  to understand,  this isn’t even about the House. We  have the procedures in the House where  we could put these together. This is  about  the Senate  that can  take  60  hours, 60 legislative hours or more, to  do one piece of legislation. We know  that the Senate has confirmations to  do of  judges and appointees  for the  Cabinet, and they have other legislative work, and we cannot afford to  have them backed up now or in the future if there are multiple regulations  that need to be rescinded.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2017
8,House,115,-0.451,25,2017-01-04,Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in opposition to H.R. 21, the so-  called Midnight Rules Relief Act,  which amends the Congressional Review Act. The Congressional Review  Act allows Congress to overrule regulations promulgated by  the executive  branch. That law expects a deliberative  approach to considering each and every  rule.  H.R. 21 would allow Congress to consider a  joint  resolution  to  simultaneously disapprove of multiple regulations all at once when such rules are  issued in the last 60 legislative days of  a session of Congress during the final  year of a President’s term. In this case,  the  60  legislative  days  reach-back  would apply to rules issued as far back  as June of last year, almost 7 months  before the end of the President’s term.  To call rules issued that long ago a  midnight  rule  is  a  particular misnomer.  This bill puts in place an indiscriminate process to eliminate rules, many  of which have been under development  for years—or even decades—to protect  consumers, working families, and students. This bill denies Congress the opportunity for a careful, individualized,  case-by-case review that is appropriate  for a reasoned, decisionmaking legislative body.  Under the Congressional Review Act,  if a rule is eliminated, such rule can  never be taken up again  in similar  form without  additional  legislation  overriding the restriction, even if the  undesirable rule turns out, upon further reflection, to have been the best  alternative.  Some of the rules that could be impacted that are just under the jurisdiction of the Education and the Workforce Committee include the Department of Labor’s rule requiring Federal  contractors to provide up to 7 days of  paid sick leave annually for their employees;  the  upcoming OSHA  rule,  which has been under development for  18 years, which would protect workers  from exposure to beryllium, a metal  that can cause lung disease, resulting  in a victim essentially suffocating to  death; the Department of Education’s  rule involving the borrower’s defense,  which helps student borrowers who are  defrauded by their universities; and the  Department of Education’s K–12 accountability rule, which involves the  implementation of the Every Student  Succeeds Act, making sure that all students can graduate ready for success  for college and career.

9,House,115,-0.439,25,2017-01-04,Ms. CASTOR of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition  to  the Republicans’ Midnight  Rules Relief Act.  The bill is an unnecessary abdication  of legislative responsibility by the Republican-led Congress, and it is very  poor public policy. The bill short-circuits open debate and public participation. It is also very wasteful because it  jettisons  carefully  and  long-crafted  policies that protect American families  from threats to their economic security, their health, and their safety.  Under the U.S. Constitution, after  Congress passes a law, agencies craft  rules to implement that legislation. If  Members of Congress want to clarify or  change executive branch regulations,  they have a responsibility to address  the matter in a transparent way and  through open, regular order. Republicans don’t want to do that, however,  VerDate Sep 11 2014  05:30 Jan 05, 2017 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K04JA7.046 H04JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 2 8 0 Q L G 3 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2017

11,Senate,115,-0.325,53,2017-01-04,Ms. STABENOW.," Mr. President, first  let me comment on what my friend,  the distinguished Senator from Texas,  said. If my car goes into a ditch, the  first thing I don’t do is dismantle the  car. That doesn’t help me get anywhere  in terms of transportation.  First of all, let me speak on process  before talking about the substance of  what we are really talking about and  how it affects people. We have a bill in  front of us that creates a process for  the majority to be able to unravel and  repeal  essentially our whole health  care system. You pull a thread and it  goes through not only employer-based  care, patient protections, people who  have  insurance, Medicare, Medicaid.  All of it begins to unravel. Interestingly, also in this bill, in the text it  adds $1 trillion to the deficit—$1 trillion to the deficit in the bill that our  colleagues  just voted  to proceed  to  pass.  We need to be very clear on this: If  colleagues want to work with us to fix  problems and improve health care, we  can start this afternoon. It is almost  3:30. By 4 o’clock we could put together  a group of people. I am sure our distinguished Democratic  leader  on  the  Budget Committee would be happy to  sit down and work together on ways to  make health care reform better and  make health care more affordable and  make it more available to people. If  that is what we want to do, count us  in, but that is not what we are talking  about here. We are talking about this  crazy idea that no one in their real life  would do.  It is like deciding you want a new  house, so you tear down the old house.  That is the easy part. Then your family is homeless. Then you say: Well,  gosh, you know, maybe I better have a  plan to get a new house for my family  and figure out a way to pay for it, to be  able to afford it.  Nobody would do that. Nobody would  start by saying: We are going to rip  apart the entire health care system  and create chaos. We are going to undermine Medicare. We are going to undermine Medicaid. We are going  to  take away patient protections for everybody who has  insurance  through  their employer, and then we will figure  out later what we are going to do to replace it, if anything.  I know there is a division on the Republican side. Certainly Members  in  the House don’t think it should even be  replaced at all.  It  is  interesting. We  are  talking  about one-sixth of the economy that  would be destabilized. There is no question that if you do a repeal and insurance companies don’t know what  is  coming—I have talked to hospitals, and  they don’t know what is coming—behavior will begin to change. Rates will  begin to go up. Different decisions will  be made because, as businesses, they  will not know how to plan. Their investors will not know how to plan.  There is no question about it. When  you repeal without creating certainty  in the marketplace, you begin a process that results in chaos.  We have an interesting example, one  that I have been involved with for a lot  of years, where we wanted to change  just one piece of the health care system,  the  reimbursement  system  for  doctors.  I was in the House when they passed  Medicare changes. We put in place a  new policy. We were going to write a  new policy to reimburse physicians for  quality instead of quantity. It makes  sense. It took 18 years to get agreement. We got agreement last year. It  doesn’t even take effect for 4 years.  Everybody here knows about  this  thing called the doc fix. It is an inside  term—or SGR, which is even more insider. The truth is, we were trying to  change just one thing and could not get  agreement to do it for 18 years.  Anyone who  thinks  that  there  is  going to be a repeal without an ACA  extender going on has not looked at  past processes.  What is most important, though, is  what this means to real people.

Throughout his  tenure, Supervisor Kinsey has been  steadfast and passionate in his pursuit of social equity, protection of the agricultural landscape and historic  ranching  community  in  West Marin, and improved transportation infrastructure and services, among many other  noble causes. Most importantly, he has been  productive  through  the  decades,  accomplishing many victories  for  the people and  places of Marin.  Born in Wilmington, Delaware in 1952, Supervisor Kinsey earned his B.A. in Architecture  from Arizona State University. He moved  to  Forest Knolls in 1978 where he raised a family, owned and operated his own design/build  business for 18 years, and volunteered in the  community. As a member of the Marin Conservation League Board of Directors, he was  recognized  for promoting water conservation  strategies and advocating for a Bayland Corridor to increase protections for bayside wetlands. A stalwart public school advocate, he  secured for the Lagunitas School District funds  for  facilities  improvements and school-based  health and support services  for  its students  and families.  Elected to the Board of Supervisors in 1996,  Supervisor Kinsey  took office on January 7,  1997, and served for five terms, representing  all of  the coastal areas of Marin County as  well as several bay side communities. As an  elected official, including five times as Board  President, he focused on watershed and fishery restoration, sustainable agriculture, the integration of transportation and land use planning, and sound fiscal management. He championed the needs of children and families, and  has worked closely with communities of color  to reduce the barriers to equal opportunity.  He served on the boards of numerous organizations including the Board of the Marin Agricultural Land Trust, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Marin Transit, and the  Transportation Authority of Marin, which he  chaired from 1998 to 2011. He joined the California Coastal Commission  in 2011, was  its  chairman  three  times, and  served on  the  board of the California State Coastal Conservancy.  Under his leadership, Marin has become a  national leader in biking and walking, including  Safe Routes  to School, and established  the  Bay Area Ridge Trail. During thirteen years as  Chair of Marin’s Transportation Authority and  Congestion Management Agency, Supervisor  Kinsey led Marin’s efforts to improve mobility  along the 101 corridor and throughout his district. Drawing on his consensus-building skills,  he secured community support and funding for  voter-highway improvements in the Twin Cities  area, and extending the Sonoma Marin Area  Rapid Transit (SMART) train to the ferry.  It has been my honor and pleasure to join  with Supervisor Kinsey to solve significant and  complex community  issues. From defeating  the proposed expansion of Death Row at San  Quentin State Prison in 2011, to procuring affordable  housing  in  surplused U.S. Coast  Guard  facilities  in West Marin,  to crafting a  long-term solution to traffic congestion in Muir  Woods and Muir Beach, to fighting to protect  continued historic  ranching  families  in Point  Reyes National Seashore, and to ensuring the  upcoming SMART  system  reaches  its  intended breadth of service up and down  the  line, Supervisor Steve Kinsey has been a tireless strategic and practical thinker, and an effective civic representative.  Steve Kinsey’s legacy is one of dedicated  service  to  the environment and health and  well-being of Marin County. Please join me in  congratulating him on his retirement, expressing deep appreciation for his long and exceptional  career and outstanding  contributions  throughout the County, and wishing him well  in his next adventure.  f  HONORING OUR NATION’S  VIETNAM VETERANS  HON.

This  resolution  recognizes November 13,  2013  through November 11, 2025, as  the  commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the  Vietnam War. It is important that we recognize  our Nation’s heroes who served with valor and  honor  through  this  long war, which  in many  ways defined an entire generation of Americans. By the end of the Vietnam War, nearly  3 million American servicemen and servicewomen had served within the borders of Vietnam in some capacity. We would like to take  this time to honor all Vietnam veterans and,  especially, the more than 58,000 patriots who  paid the ultimate sacrifice during this difficult  and painful period of war.  Of  the millions of Vietnam veterans who  served our country, over 106,000 reside in my  home State of Louisiana. Though we remain  thankful for all of those who have served our  great Nation, we would like to take this time to  remember  the 50th Anniversary of  the Vietnam War.

18,House,115,-0.428,2,2017-01-12,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, it  is heartening that a few of our Republican colleagues are urging caution on  the reckless approach to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They are acknowledging that the only reasonable way to  proceed—if that is the objective—is to,  at the same time that they repeal, provide the American people with a replacement, a replacement that meets  their criteria.  One reason they have not done so is  that Republicans don’t really agree,  don’t really know how to do that. The  new President promises that a repeal-  and-replace program will be better. It  will have lower costs and better coverage—a tall order—and we have seen  no details.  The troubling  fact  for the Republicans bent on repealing the Affordable  Care Act is that the ACA is working,  and most of the major provisions are  wildly popular: no lifetime limits on  health care; no denial for preexisting  conditions to almost 130 million Americans who would otherwise have their  health care at risk; allowing children  to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they are age 25; not charging  women higher premiums than men simply because of their chromosomes.  These elements are absolutely essential going forward, and the American  public wants this to continue. Sadly,  even if they do slow down and try to do  it right, there is much damage that is  being done with the uncertainty in the  air. They have unsettled 18 percent of  our economy—over $3 trillion of annual  expenses—disrupting  the  6 years  of  progress in making the system work  better.  I have been talking to people in my  community, finding out about some of  the damage that is being done, their  concerns and apprehensions. The largest employer in the city of Portland is  Oregon Health & Science University.  They already have felt compelled to  implant a hiring freeze, dial back some  of their programming, trying to reconfigure, preparing for the worst.  The  local  government,  partnering  with the private sector to treat the  poor and the elderly, people with mental health issues, are having their important reforms put at risk, and they  are scrambling to try and figure out  how to do it.  The State  of Oregon, not unlike  many States around the country,  is  facing  some budget  challenges, and  there is a $1.7 billion question dealing  with  the uncertainty going  forward  with Medicaid.  Rural hospitals are especially vulnerable, and they will explain it to any  Congressman who chooses to ask. Most  important for many of them is the fact  that this approach that is being pursued on Capitol Hill with this question  mark puts at risk one of the greatest  achievements of the Affordable Care  Act. The vast amounts of money spent  on uncompensated care, charity care,  has been dramatically reduced. People  are getting their health care earlier,  and it is being paid for. And those uncompensated  care  levels are  falling  dramatically. They are getting better  care, more timely.  The health providers in my community are concerned they are still going  to have to provide the care, but it will  be done later in an emergency room,  not in a clinic setting, and they are left  holding the bag financially. It is not  hard to find out how damaging this approach has been.  Certainly, the Affordable Care Act  could use  refinement  and  improvement. We have been trying to do that  for the last 6 years. The local medical  associations, community clinics, hospitals, health plans are all willing to  say how that could be done; but at the  same time, they will explain what is at  risk and why we owe it to them and the  people we serve to understand the damage that is being done and try and minimize it.  The course that is being followed will  make America sick again, and that is  not the way to start a new administration, a new Congress. We should do  what we should have been doing for the  last 6 years: working together, cooperatively, to build upon, refine, and improve the Affordable Care Act and give  the American public the health care  they deserve.  HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE  OF RURAL HEALTH CARE  ",2017
19,House,115,0.307,2,2017-01-12,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.,"  Mr. Speaker, before I was elected to  serve in the House of Representatives,  I spent nearly 30 years in the nonprofit  healthcare field assisting those individuals who were facing life-changing diseases and disability. Additionally, as a  member of my home community,  I  have volunteered  for decades as an  emergency medical technician, serving  my neighbors in their time of trauma  or medical emergency needs.  I am acutely aware of the challenges  many face when it comes to obtaining  reasonably priced health care. It is especially critical for rural America, like  much of the Fifth Congressional District of Pennsylvania.  We are facing a healthcare crisis in  our Nation’s rural areas. These often  disadvantaged  populations  are  still  struggling to access affordable, quality  care. Many remain uninsured. Many  find themselves newly uninsured as a  result of the pressures and the demands  and the mandates of the Affordable  Care Act. Most are underinsured; however, access to quality care really does  remain the largest challenge.  Even when people gain access  to  health insurance or coverage, it does  not equal access to care. Rural hospitals across the country are closing,  leaving  patients without  access  to  their emergency rooms and long-term  care facilities. When you close a hospital in a rural area, the result is a  commute that means the difference,  frequently, between life and death.  Eighty rural hospitals have closed  since 2010. One in three rural hospitals  are financially vulnerable. At the current closure rate, more than 25 percent  of rural hospitals will close in less than  a decade.  As this Congress examines ways to  improve our Nation’s healthcare system, we must not  forget that rural  health care is unique and requires different programs to succeed.  In addition to hospital closures, a  workforce  shortage  plagues  rural  America; 77 percent of more than 2,000  rural counties in the United States are  designated as having a  shortage of  healthcare professionals. Recruitment  and retention of experienced professionals, including primary care physicians, is an ongoing challenge.  b1015  Mr. Speaker, no matter how you pay  for health care, if there are not qualified and trained professionals in those  communities, healthcare access does  not exist. Congress must act to stop  cuts to rural hospitals and strengthen  the healthcare workforce  in underserved areas.  Furthermore,  the  opioid  epidemic  that is sweeping the Nation has ravaged our rural communities,  leaving  VerDate Sep 11 2014  05:21 Jan 13, 2017 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K12JA7.013 H12JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o r e c n e p S S         ",2017
20,House,115,-0.379,9,2017-01-12,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise out  of a deep concern, not just for the 30  million Americans who will lose access  to health coverage and the tens of millions of others who will see their costs  rise if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement,  but as well for every American because  the repeal will affect every American,  including  every American who  has  health  insurance  through  their  employer.  Let  there  be  no mistake. Every  American will be adversely affected by  the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.  The repeal and delay plan ought to be  called repeal and deny, deny health  coverage to tens of millions, deny tax  credits  to  small businesses  to help  them  cover  their  employees,  deny  those with preexisting conditions protection from high premiums and coverage denials, and deny parents from  covering their children under age 26  through  their own  insurance plans.  Every American will be adversely affected if we repeal the Affordable Care  Act.  I heard recently through social media  from a woman in my district whose  family was able to save more than  $1,200 a month because of the ACA marketplace. Another wrote  to  tell me  that the ACA made it possible for her  to sign up for coverage for the first  time in years since she lost her job and  her employer-based  insurance. When  she needed  to  be hospitalized  this  spring, having coverage saved her life.  Repeal and deny would be a disaster  for our people and our economy. I urge  my Republican friends to instead work  with the Democrats to improve the Affordable Care Act.  f  CAMERAS IN THE U.S. SUPREME  COURT  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2017
21,House,115,0.593,9,2017-01-12,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  Americans nationwide are interested in  watching the Supreme Court at work,  but only a handful on any given day  are allowed to have access to the courtroom. The courtroom is small and seating is limited. Well, why not give the  public  the ability  to view  the proceedings in their entirety on television  or through live streaming?  Public court hearings are the bedrock of American justice. Americans  want to know what is going on behind  those closed doors. A simple nonintrusive camera would allow  for greater  transparency and greater faith in the  decisions made by the most powerful  Court in the world.  I was one of the first judges in Texas  to allow cameras in the courtroom. All  the naysayers said: oh, it won’t work.  But it did. It benefited everyone.  The gentleman  from Virginia  (Mr.  CONNOLLY) and I are once again cosponsoring a bill to allow cameras in the  Supreme Court. It is better to show all  of the proceedings to the public than to  rely on a 30-second sound bite from a  news reporter on television during the  6:00 news. It is time for cameras in the  Supreme Court.  And that is just the way it is.  f  KEEP AMERICA HEALTHY  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I  rise to keep America healthy, saving  the Affordable Care Act.  I rise in the name of Cynthia Perry,  facing a life-or-death scenario. Without  the law in place, Cynthia Perry would  also be facing life or death. Perry suffers from an immune deficiency that  requires her to take medication she estimates costs roughly $40,000 a year.  Cynthia, who lives today.  I rise to keep America healthy. Kathryn Will, terrified about losing access  to  treatment,  terrified because  she,  herself, at 28 years old, was diagnosed  with stage III breast cancer.  I rise to keep America healthy because a Senator from Kentucky said we  need to think through how we do this,  and it is a huge mistake for Republicans if they do not vote for replacement on the same day they vote for repeal.  I rise to keep America healthy and  not give hundreds of billions of dollars  in tax breaks to insurance companies  and drug manufacturers while eliminating tax credits for millions of working Americans.  I rise to keep America healthy. Vote  to save the Affordable Care Act.  f  SOUTH  CAROLINA  FIFTH  MOST  POPULAR STATE FOR NEW RESIDENTS  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2017
22,House,115,0.547,9,2017-01-12,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, last week The Post and Courier  of  Charleston  announced  that  South Carolina is the fifth most popular State for new residents. In an annual study conducted by United Van  Lines, South Carolina achieved being  in a top place for people looking to relocate, whether for a job, retirement,  or temperate climate.  The Post and Courier detailed that  the moving company this week said 60  percent of the trucks in South Carolina  dropped off household goods for newcomers, placing it among the top destinations  for  those  seeking  a  new  home. The article also reveals that recent data from the Census Bureau confirms the Palmetto State  is gaining  significantly.  I am grateful  to Governor Nikki  Haley,  incoming  Governor  Henry  McMaster,  Secretary  of  Commerce  Bobby Hitt, and everyone who works  each day to promote South Carolina as  a great place to live, work, and raise a  family. We have a probusiness mindset.  We are military friendly. We have communities that promote job creation. We  have a State that is ready to welcome  transplants.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and may the President, by his actions,  never forget September the 11th in the  global war on terrorism.  f  LET’S WORK TO IMPROVE OUR  HEALTHCARE PLAN  (Mr. SCHNEIDER  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2017
23,House,115,-0.169,9,2017-01-12,Mr. SCHNEIDER.," Mr. Speaker, in his  farewell speech, President Obama said  that if anyone can put together an alternative healthcare plan that is demonstrably better and covers as many  people at less cost, he would publicly  support it. I feel the same way.  The ACA is not perfect, and anyone  who is serious about working to improve our healthcare  system  should  count me as a willing partner. But that  is not what we have heard from President-elect Trump and my Republican  colleagues. Their irresponsible plan is  to repeal ObamaCare and then figure  out what comes next. That  is  like  jumping ship without a life raft or a  plan.  Repealing ObamaCare will leave 1.2  million people  in my State without  health insurance, allowing insurers to  again deny  coverage based on preexisting conditions or put annual and  lifetime caps on coverage, and deny  young people the option of staying on  their parents’ plan. This will hurt real  people who depend on the Affordable  Care Act.  I urge my colleagues to join me in  finding ways to improve our Nation’s  healthcare system rather than burning  it down.

25,House,115,-0.146,16,2017-01-12,Mr. PETERSON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in opposition to this bill. The  bill last Congress went too far; and the  one in this Congress, in my opinion, is  going too far as well. The Commission,  in my opinion, just needs a simple reauthorization. I urge Members to consider this when deciding how to vote on  the amendments that will be debated  here on the floor.  Title II actually makes it more difficult for the Commission to function,  and I am also concerned that title III’s  cross-border rulemaking mandate will  result in a race to the bottom for multinational banks in the swaps market,  which is a global market.  On top of that, this bill caps the  agency’s yearly budget at $250 million  for the next 5 years, and it does this  when every single witness before the  Agriculture Committee last year told  us  that  the agency needs more  resources to do its work. Well, maybe  that is the whole point—that this bill  will  leave  the agency  to not doing  much, and I think that would be a mistake. We tried that once before, and we  found ourselves in a real mess.  Since we last discussed reauthorization,  the  market  situation  has  changed, and the CFTC has addressed  many of our concerns through rulemaking. Yet,  the Agriculture Committee wasn’t given the chance to consider these issues before the bill was  rushed to the floor here today. So we  are moving forward, once again, without regular order.  Again, I oppose this bill and urge my  colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2017
26,House,115,0.378,16,2017-01-12,Mr. CRAWFORD.," Mr. Chairman, 5  years of bipartisan committee work  has contributed to the drafting of H.R.  238, the Commodity End-User Relief  Act. It is time we passed it for the sake  of businesses across the United States  who need greater certainty  in managing their risk.  In advance of writing this legislation  to reauthorize the CFTC, the House  Committee on Agriculture held 22 hearings on the future of the Commission  and the state of the derivatives industry. I mention the number 22 to highlight how extensive the data collection  and deliberation has been.  To make  this  reauthorization  as  complete and  thorough as possible,  those 22 hearings collected  feedback  and testimony from every segment of  the futures and swaps markets, from  end users to regulators. We have used  the testimony to draft legislation that  will make derivatives markets work  better for those who need them most:  businesses trying to manage their risk.  But not only is this reauthorization  language exhaustively  researched,  it  has also already been approved by this  Chamber multiple times, starting  in  the 113th Congress.  In the 113th Congress, the Committee  completed H.R. 4413, which passed the  House with strong bipartisan support.  In the 114th Congress, we put forward  the Commodity End-User Relief Act of  2015, which was very similar to H.R.  4413, and also passed the House with  support  from both parties. Now, not  only is H.R. 238 virtually identical to  the reauthorization bill, which passed  the House last Congress, H.R. 238 also  includes  the amendments  that were  adopted on the House floor during debate.  I will turn my focus toward the people that this tested and proven language will help, largely end users. Although end users are not  investors,  speculators, or risk takers, they have  borne the brunt of many of the consequences of new regulations.  Derivatives are used by a huge swath  of businesses for risk management purposes, including manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and other businesses that  buy or sell products overseas, pension  funds, insurance companies, and others  who face risks that the prices for their  business inputs and outputs frequently  fluctuate.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues  to support this long overdue legislation.  ",2017

29,House,115,0.469,37,2017-01-12,Mrs. WAGNER.," Mr. Chair, I thank  Chairman HENSARLING, the gentleman  from Texas, for his leadership on this  issue and on so many regulatory reform issues that we will be addressing  this week and in the future.  Mr. Chair, I am proud to sponsor and  bring to the floor H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act. This legislation fits perfectly with the theme of  the week here in the House to advance  key  regulatory  reform  ideas  as  a  change of pace from the outgoing administration.  For the past 8 years, the amount of  regulatory burden that has been placed  on Americans and small businesses has  been crushing. In 2015, Federal regulation cost almost $1.9 trillion. That is  nearly $15,000 per household in a hidden  compliance tax.  The Obama  administration  issued  over 600 economically significant rules,  which are those that have an economic  impact of over $100 million. As a result  of this wave of regulations, we have  been part of the slowest economic recovery in our lifetimes.  We now have an opportunity to enact  policy that ensures smart regulation  going  forward so that we are doing  things in the best and most efficient  way. The  people have  spoken, Mr.  Chair. Business as usual in Washington  is over and it is time to do things differently. There is, indeed, a better way.  This legislation is really about what  everyday Americans do when they are  making major life decisions in weighing the costs and the benefits, the pros  and the cons. Whether it is buying a  car, buying a home, deciding whether  to take out a loan to go to school, everyone must consider  the core economic factors when making important  life decisions.  The SEC Regulatory Accountability  Act places statutory requirements on  the SEC when issuing rulemaking that  ensures that, first, they identify the  problem that regulation is trying to  address; second, they weigh the cost  and benefits to ensure that the benefits  justify costs of compliance; and thirdly, they identify and assess whether  there are any available alternatives to  rulemaking.  Additionally, this bill contains a provision that requires the SEC to review  its existing regulations every 5 years,  at the minimum, to determine whether  any such regulations are outdated, ineffective, or excessively burdensome,  as well as requiring the SEC to modify,  streamline, repeal, or even to expand  regulations based on that review.  As a regulator of our capital markets, the SEC has an immeasurable influence on our economy and the ability  of small business and entrepreneurs to  be able to access capital in order to innovate, grow, and most of all, create  jobs.  I strongly believe that this legislation is nonpartisan and common sense  and what our government regulators  should have been doing  in the  first  place. The American people deserve a  break from the irresponsible regulation  they have grown accustom to over the  past 8 years. There is a better way.  I ask my colleagues to support this  commonsense piece of legislation and  urge passage of it through the House.  ",2017
30,House,115,-0.368,37,2017-01-12,Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas.," Mr. Chairman, I support the regular review of  regulations to ensure that they are  still  relevant  to  our  ever-changing  economy.  Unfortunately, the retrospective review requirement in H.R. 78 is counterproductive and places heavy administrative burdens on the Securities and  Exchange  Commission,  an  already  overburdened and underfunded  regulator.

32,House,115,0.455,44,2017-01-12,Mr. TIPTON.," Mr. Chairman, the SEC  Regulatory Accountability Act  subjects the SEC to enhanced cost-benefit  analysis requirements and requires a  review of existing regulations.  By promoting economic analysis requirements during the regulatory process, this bill ensures that regulation  writing is data driven and not done on  an ad hoc basis with little thought to  the true impact the expanding regulatory net has on businesses and the  economy.  It is a mistake for regulators overseeing our  financial system and the  capital markets, including the SEC, to  promulgate regulations without fully  considering the costs and benefits, as  well as all of the available regulatory  alternatives.  This bill also takes the commonsense  approach  of  requiring  the SEC  to  evaluate whether a proposed regulation  is inconsistent with, or duplicative of,  other Federal regulations. When our  businesses are being overwhelmed by  compliance obligations  that demand  more and more time and resources, it  is crucial that our regulators do everything in their power to ensure that regulations are effective, streamlined, and  nonduplicative to minimize impact.  It is important to note that this legislation does not limit the SEC’s rulemaking authority in any capacity. The  bill  appropriately  strengthens  the  SEC’s existing cost-benefit-related requirements to ensure that the true impact of regulations can be calculated.  To advocate for the status quo and  against this legislation shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the financial system and the regulatory process.  This legislation is a vote of confidence  that, with the appropriate tools and a  data-driven approach, our regulatory  agencies can create a  framework of  safety and soundness that does not unduly burden our economy.  I am happy to lend my support to  this bill and encourage my colleagues  to support this commonsense measure.  I, again, thank the gentlewoman from  Missouri for her efforts on this legislation.  ",2017
33,House,115,0.674,44,2017-01-12,Mr. LOUDERMILK.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, Americans have heard  time and time again over the last 8  years that our economy is in the slowest recovery since World War II. Why?  It is because unelected bureaucrats bypass this body of Congress and continually push out hundreds of burdensome  regulations  onto American  families  who are struggling just to get by.  The onslaught of regulations by this  administration has proven to kill jobs,  shut down businesses, and stifle our  economic growth. But now it is time to  make good on our promise to make a  brighter  future  for Americans  and  begin to turn this Nation around.  Just as the American people expect  us to know what it is in a bill before we  vote on it, it is equally important to  know what is in a regulation.  Most Federal agencies are required to  conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis of each regulation before finalizing  it. But this isn’t always the case for  the Securities and Exchange Commission. While the SEC is subject to some  cost-benefit requirements when a new  regulation could have an overbearing  impact on our marketplaces, they are  exempt from having to identify alternative policies.  I rise today in support of the SEC  Regulatory Accountability Act because  it will require the SEC to follow its  own core principle of disclosure that it,  in itself, enforces on the securities industry in this Nation. This bill would  require the SEC to disclose all the  costs and benefits of each proposed regulation to the public.  We must not allow regulatory agencies to be a roadblock to job creation  by failing to consider the impact proposed rules would have on our securities market. Additionally, this bill requires the SEC to clearly identify the  nature of the issue before establishing  a new regulation.  Mr. Chairman, our economy cannot  flourish without healthy capital markets. We must hold regulatory agencies  to strict standards, just as they do the  businesses  they  regulate across  this  Nation. This  bill  takes meaningful  steps toward achieving these goals, and  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’  ",2017
34,House,115,0.774,44,2017-01-12,Mr. BUDD.," Mr. Chairman, the debate  over  financial regulation  is not  just  about more versus less. It is also about  the idea that financial liberty and personal liberty are connected, and they  have been for most of history.  This goes back to the Middle Ages,  when widespread use of a bill of exchange—basically, a  check—made  it  much more difficult for government to  wrongly take people’s wealth. That development was one of the first building  blocks of limited government.  Now, today, we see a similar principle at work in global capital. Like  the bill of exchange placing gold or silver out of the reach of government, the  connected global economy allows capital to flow away from harsh regulation. Countries that get it right are the  ones that win.  There are a number of statistics that  suggest that we are getting the short  end of the stick in this arena. We are  losing our  financial competitiveness.  For example, nearly 10 percent of foreign  companies  left  the New York  Stock Exchange this year, almost double the historic average. Finally, from  2010 to 2016, the United States slipped  from 6th to 11th in the Index of Economic Freedom.  While this problem has a number of  causes, the Securities and Exchange  Commission  Regulatory  Accountability Act will help improve our economic  competitiveness  by  requiring  that  the  SEC  put  its  regulations  through a strong cost-benefit analysis  and review regulations that are just  plain outdated.  I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.  ",2017
35,House,115,-0.549,51,2017-01-12,Mr. RASKIN.," Mr. Chairman, I think  we have arrived at what the difference  is between me and the gentleman from  Michigan.  The regulation, as he reads it, applies  only to the Chair. This amendment  would  extend  the  ethics  training,  which he seems to support, to all of the  members of  the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It  is  true  that  they all have to do a filing, as we all  do, about our various finances, but that  is not the comprehensive ethical training that all of us need to get in order  to avoid conflicts of  interest. So,  if  that is something that is good enough  for the Chair, it is, presumably, good  enough for all of the members of the  SEC.

40,Senate,115,0.375,93,2017-01-12,Mr. PORTMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today  during  Human  Trafficking  Awareness Week  to  talk about  the  scourge of human trafficking, and, specifically, about an investigation that  the Senate has  just concluded  that  matters  to  every  single State  represented in this Chamber and to every  American.  We are told now that human trafficking, including sex trafficking, is a  $150  billion  a  year  industry. That  makes it the second largest criminal  enterprise  in  the world, behind  the  drug trade. Unfortunately, it is happening in all of our States, including  my home State of Ohio. It is growing  as a problem.  A couple of weeks ago, two people  were arrested in my home town of Cincinnati  in connection with sex trafficking. Police charged a women with  luring an underage girl to commit a  sex act with a 56-year-old man.  That was just 2 weeks after police in  Blue Ash, OH, just up the road, broke  up what they said was a sex trafficking  ring at a hotel. Police said that two  men and two women rented two rooms  at a hotel, paying cash, and forced four  different women to perform sex acts.  The women were given crack cocaine  and heroin, presumably to keep them  dependent on their traffickers.  This is what I am hearing back home  a lot when I talk to victims of sex trafficking. Typically, drugs are involved.  In Ohio,  it  is usually heroin. These  cases are alarming, and, unfortunately,  we have reasons to believe that the  problem is getting worse not better.  The National Center for Missing and  Exploited Children, really, the expert  on this issue, particularly of kids who  get involved in sex trafficking, reports  an 846-percent increase in reports of  suspected child sex trafficking  from  2010 to 2015. That is an over 800-percent  increase just in those 5 years.  The organization found this spike to  be ‘‘directly correlated to the increased  use of the Internet to sell children for  sex.’’ So it is kind of the dark side of  the Internet, isn’t it. What I am told  sometimes by survivors of trafficking  is that they say: Rob, this has moved  from  the  street  corner  to  the  cell  phone. There  is widespread evidence  that  sex  trafficking  is  increasingly  doing that all over our country.  In order to confront this problem, as  chairman  of  the  Permanent  Subcommittee  on  Investigations,  along  with my colleague and ranking member  Senator  I  MCCASKILL,  CLAIRE opened a bipartisan investigation into  sex traffickers and their use of the  Internet.  This  investigation  began  about 2 years ago. The National Center  for Missing & Exploited Children says  that  nearly  three-quarters—73  percent—of all suspected child sex trafficking reports  it receives  from the  general public through  its cyber tip  line are linked to one Web site—a single Web site. That Web site is called  Backpage.com.  According  to  a  leading  anti-trafficking  organization  called  Shared  Hope  International,  ‘‘[s]ervice  providers working with child  sex  trafficking victims have reported that between 80 and 100 percent of their clients have been bought and sold on  Backpage.com.’’ Eighty to 100 percent  of their clients have been bought and  sold on Backpage.com.  Again, that is consistent with everything I have heard when I have been  back home and spoken to and met with  sex  trafficking  survivors. Backpage  now operates in 97 countries, 934 cities  worldwide. It is valued at well over half  a billion dollars. According to an industry analysis, in 2013, 8 out of every  10 dollars spent on online commercial  sex trafficking  in the United States  went to this one Web site, Backpage.  Others, by the way, have chosen not  to engage in this. There have been a  number of cases around the country,  including in Ohio, where Backpage.com  was used by traffickers to sell underage  girls for sex.  Last spring, in my own State of Ohio,  a man, who by the way has nine children of his own, was sentenced to 12  years in Federal prison for trafficking  four underage girls who had run away  from home in Akron and Canton, OH.  He kept them locked in a hotel, supplied them with drugs like marijuana,  heroin, and ecstasy, and sold them for  sex on Backpage.com. When he was arrested, by the way, he was found with  more than 8,000 bags of heroin.  Just this week, or a week later after  that, a man from Fort Wayne, IN, was  charged with human trafficking and  child prostitution after he was arrested  on his way to Ohio. His intention, police say, was to traffic a 14-year-old  girl whom he had met on Facebook,  raped, and whom he planned to sell on  Backpage.com.  Backpage says it leads the industry  in its screening of advertisements for  illegal activity. In fact, Backpage’s top  lawyer has described their screening  process as the key tool for disrupting  and  eventually  ending human  trafficking via the World Wide Web.  But despite these boasts, this Web  site and its owners consistently have  refused to cooperate with our investigation, with other investigations relating to lawsuits around the country.  With regard to our situation, we subpoenaed them for the documents, and  they still refused to provide the documents or to testify. As a result, as my  colleagues will remember, this body,  the Senate, for the first time in over 20  years, voted unanimously to pass a  civil contempt citation to require them  to supply the documents, to come forward with this information.  In August a Federal court order rejected Backpage’s objection  to  that  subpoena and compelled the company  to turn over the subpoenaed documents  to  the  subcommittee. Backpage appealed that and asked for a delay in  that order. They took it all the way up  to the Supreme Court of the United  States. But their request was rejected.  Since then, the subcommittee has been  able to review the documents that have  been submitted—over 1 million documents—including emails and other internal documents.  What we found was very troubling, to  say the least. After reviewing the documents, the subcommittee published a  staff report on Monday of this week  that conclusively shows that Backpage  has been more deeply complicit in online underage sex trafficking than anyone imagined. We reached three principle findings: first, that Backpage has  knowingly  covered  up  evidence  of  criminal activity by systematically editing  its so-called adult ads; second,  that Backpage knows that it facilitates  prostitution and even child sex trafficking; and third, that despite the reported sale of Backpage to an undisclosed foreign company in 2014, taking  them outside of the United States, the  true owners of the company are the  founders—James  Larkin,  Michael  Lacey, and Carl Ferrer, their chief executive officer.  First, on the editing of ads, our report shows that Backpage has knowingly covered up evidence of crimes by  systematically deleting words and images suggestive of illegal conduct, including of child sex trafficking. That  editing process sanitized the content of  millions of advertisements in order to  hide important evidence from law enforcement.  In  2006, Backpage  executives  instructed staff to edit the text of adult  ads, not to take them down but to edit  them, which is exactly how they facilitated this type of trafficking, including  child sex trafficking. By October 2010,  Backpage  executives  had  a  formal  process in place of both manual and  automated deletion of  incriminating  words and phrases in ads.  Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer personally  directed his employees to create an  electronic filter to delete hundreds of  words indicative of sex trafficking or  prostitution from ads before they were  published.  Again, this filter did not reject the  ads because of the obvious illegal activity. They only edited the ads to try  to cover it up. The filter did not change  what was advertised, only the way it  was advertised. So Backpage did nothing to try to stop this criminal activity. They facilitated it knowingly.  Why did they do that? Backpage executives were afraid they would erode  their profits. It  is a very profitable  business. In Ferrer’s words, they were  VerDate Sep 11 2014  00:49 Jan 13, 2017 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G12JA6.020 S12JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 2 B H P B C B K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2017

42,Senate,115,0.342,100,2017-01-12,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, for  too long, American families, farmers,  and job creators have suffered under  President  Obama’s  regulatory  onslaught. His administration threw caution to wind, pumping out regulation  after regulation and further entangling  the government into Americans’ daily  lives.  In November, the American people  issued a strong rebuke to President  Obama’s overreach and his administration’s way of doing business.  They want a new direction. They  want more accountability. They want  more transparency. They want the government off their backs so that they  can get back to making this country  great again.  President-elect  Trump  has  committed to working with Congress to  roll back the regulatory overreach of  the Obama  administration,  and  to  making the government more answerable to the people.  So, I rise today to introduce an important piece of legislation that will  help achieve these goals and ensure a  more accountable and transparent government going forward.  typically  By some estimates, Federal Government regulations impose over $2 trillion in compliance costs—on the American economy. The cost of complying  with all these regulations falls particularly heavy on small businesses.  It is no wonder why many American  businesses have shut down or moved  overseas.  How  many  innovators  dreamed of starting a small business  but decided against it when faced with  the burden and uncertainty of our regulatory state?  We have to do better.  The Federal Government should do  everything possible to promote job creation. To accomplish  that, common  sense would tell us that the government needs  to  remove bureaucratic  barriers rather than put up new ones.  But as we all know, the Obama administration showed time and again  that it would rather push forward with  its regulatory agenda than ease the  burden on our economy and job creators.  Adding insult to injury, the Obama  administration often kept folks in the  dark about new regulatory initiatives.  Through secretive litigation tactics,  the  administration  took  end-runs  around our nation’s transparency and  accountability laws. It is a strategy  known  as  sue-and-settle,  and  regulators have been using it to speed up  rulemaking and keep the public away  from the table when key policy decisions are made.  Sue-and-settle  similar pattern.  First, an interest group files a lawsuit against a federal agency, claiming  that the agency has failed to take a  certain regulatory action by a statutory deadline. The interest group seeks  to compel the agency to take action by  a new, often-rushed deadline. All too  often, the plaintiff-interest group will  be one that shares a common regulatory agenda with the agency that it  sues, such as when an environmental  group sues the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  Next, the agency and interest group  enter into negotiations behind closed  doors to produce either a settlement  agreement or consent decree that commits the agency to satisfy the interest  group’s demands. The agreement  is  then approved by a court, binding executive discretion.  Noticeably absent from these negotiations, however, are the very parties  who will be most impacted by the resulting regulations.  Sue-and-settle  tactics  undermine  transparency,  public  accountability,  and the quality of public policy. They  can have sweeping consequences. For  example, the Obama administration’s  so-called Clean Power Plan, which is  the most expensive regulation ever to  be  imposed on the energy  industry,  arose out of a sue-and-settle arrangement.  These tactics also undermine congressional intent.  The Administrative Procedure Act,  APA, which has been called the citizens’ ‘‘regulatory bill of rights,’’ was  follows  a  VerDate Sep 11 2014  00:50 Jan 13, 2017 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A12JA6.017 S12JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 2 B H P B C B K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2017

47,House,115,-0.279,13,2017-02-07,Mr. POLIS.," Mr. Speaker, over the  last few years, one complaint I have  heard over and over is how inconsistent  education policy has been. States have  been using waivers at the discretion of  the Department of Education. Finally,  educators, school board members, families, hope that ESSA, the Every Student Succeeds Act, could provide more  stability. Unfortunately  for  States,  undoing the accountability CRA would  only reenergize that uncertainty.  For months, States have been working on their State plans, and I have had  the opportunity to join our Colorado  group that has been working on that  plan as required under the Every Student Succeeds Act. We have had guidance  from  the Department of Education since  last November, and we  have been writing our State plans with  that in mind. Now, if this regulation is  overturned, it would pull the rug out  from States that have been working  diligently to enact their plans.  FORTENBERRY).  Likewise, H.J. Res. 58, another education-related bill  that would occur  under this rule, would effectively unravel the Department of Education’s  teacher preparation regulations. In the  Higher Education Act, States are required to assess the effectiveness of  teacher prep programs, and this regulation simply provides guidance for how  States can do that, making sure our  teacher training programs work, making sure that we are  improving the  quality of our public educators.  This  provision  also  requires  that  TEACH grant recipients attend high-  performing teacher prep programs. It is  not a matter of picking winners and  losers; it is making sure that our taxpayer dollars are used effectively to  train high-quality educators.  If money is going to be invested in  future teachers at high-needs schools,  we want to make sure that teachers  are attending the highest quality programs available. At the end of the day,  a great education starts with a great  teacher in the classroom, and this requirement ensures that even the neediest students have access to a great  teacher. Taken  together,  these  two  bills represent a strategic attempt by  Republicans to undermine public education.  The other CRA, which is completely  unrelated to the two education-related  CRAs,  is actually related to a  land  management issue. I want to describe  why that is a bad idea as well.  I come from a Western State. My district that I represent is over 60 percent  public lands, so this BLM plan will actually affect my district, and that is  why I am so impassioned to speak here  today and listen to others in my State  about this rule.  A revision of this BLM plan is long  overdue. Few plans or rules can remain  relevant for decades, and BLM’s planning was last drafted in 1983. Needing a  new planning system may not sound  like the most exciting thing  in the  world, but it is actually critical because it can impact everything from  cultural to environmental resources, to  jobs  in the economy  in our district  which relate to our use of public lands.  That is why I have been contacted by  groups of sportsmen, county commissioners, outdoor recreation groups, and  conservationists asking how Congress  can be wasting their time repealing  something that makes BLM’s process  more transparent and conclusive.  Local control and constituent input  are top priorities for those of us who  live in and around public land, particularly in the West, so it makes sense  that many counties and groups in Colorado who have worked with BLM offices on land use are pleading with Congress not to use a CRA to repeal this  commonsense rule and join their voices  with ours in opposition to this rule and  this bill. The kinds of groups opposed  to this bill include the International  Mountain Bicycling Association  because they know that, even though the  planning process isn’t perfect and, of  course, can be refined, it would be a  huge mistake to throw out the whole  thing and bar the BLM from making  necessary modernizations moving forward, especially when the Republicans  are in the driver’s seat.  Hunting and fishing groups and outdoor industry businesses, like the Outdoor  Industry  Association,  Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and  the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation  Partnership, know that this planning  process will give them the voice they  need in the planning process without  diminishing anyone else’s role. I believe that those who have actually experienced and been part of the process  are the voices that need to be heeded  when we are determining if the planning has been a success.  Here are a few of the quotes from  some counties in Western States that  have been part of the process and support the new planning system. From  Lewis and Clark County in Idaho:  A great example of the potential of Planning 2.0 can be found in eastern and central  Idaho, where the BLM is preparing to engage  in a land use planning process for public  lands from the big desert to the benches of  the Salmon River. At the behest of local  BLM leadership, which has already been operating under the spirit of Planning 2.0, a  number of sporting groups, conservation organizations, and Salmon Valley stewardship  have reached out to a wide-ranging constituency of ranchers, loggers, motorized users,  sportsmen, and other groups. The benefit of  this early conversation can be very valuable  to sportsmen. Take the Donkey Hills at the  headwaters of the Pahsimeroi River as an example. There  has  been  near  unanimous  agreement that the critical elk calving area  in the Donkey Hills needs thoughtful consideration as a critical wildlife area.  From Missoula County, Montana:  Western Montana, where  the Missoula  BLM field offices engaged in a land-use planning revision process for public lands from  the John Long Range to Joshua Park all the  way to the Garnet Range, through this process, BLM has piloted the steps in Planning  2.0 to further engage the public in land management decisions.  I include in the RECORD letters from  both of these counties, as well as a letter from a group of outdoor industries  asking  for  this body  to oppose  the  CRA.

49,House,115,-0.39,20,2017-02-07,Mr. BEYER.," Mr. Speaker, I think the  real question for the majority is: What  do you have against Secretary-elect  RYANZINKE? He is being given a brand-  new rule and the keys to the castle. He  has a clean slate to develop the playbook for a hugely impactful planning  process and free rein to make it what  he wants.  Yet, one of the first moves the majority is making, before Mr. ZINKE has  even been confirmed, is to undo Planning 2.0 and leave the agency with a  planning process that was written before my staff was born. In other words,  the majority  is  tying Mr. ZINKE’s  hands.  Quite simply, the majority is laboring under the  false  impression that  Planning 2.0 makes the BLM’s planning  process worse when, in fact, it makes it  better. Under the current regulatory  framework  for resource management  plans, it takes BLM an average of 8  years to update and revise a plan, and  this matters because, by the time the  plan is completed, it is almost already  out of date. Significant public involvement doesn’t happen until the end of  the process. There is often litigation  which stalls the process even more.  This is a huge waste of government resources and taxpayer money.  Mr. Speaker, as Ranking Member  GRIJALVA said earlier, the use of the  Congressional Review Act to revoke  BLM Planning 2.0, or any other Federal  regulation, is a radical step. That is  the reason why the Congressional Review Act has only been used once before this year.  Once Congress approves the Congressional Review Act resolution, the agency can never issue a similar rule. So  this is an extreme overreach in general, but especially for something like  BLM’s Planning 2.0, which is designed  to enhance efficiency and make BLM  more responsive to public input.  Isn’t our goal to improve how government works and make  it more efficient? This  resolution will  permanently lock us into an old rule that  didn’t work for anybody.  I know House Republicans and President Trump are eager to roll back regulations,  but we  should  pump  the  brakes on this particular resolution. A  lot has changed since 1983.  ",2017
50,House,115,0.532,20,2017-02-07,Ms. CHENEY.," Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Virginia may not be completely aware of the  implementation  and the effect of this rule in Western  States like Wyoming where, for example, the process that has been described  as an open process  is,  in  fact, one  where, in my State, our Department of  Environmental  Quality  on  another  BLM rule was in a position where they  agreed to be a cooperating agency and  then did not hear from the BLM for 4  years.  When you are talking about our very  livelihood, you are in a situation where  we simply can’t run that risk. We cannot adopt a rule or let a rule stand that  expands  that kind  of  authority  in  Washington,  no matter who  is  in  charge in Washington.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON).  ",2017
51,House,115,-0.358,20,2017-02-07,Mrs. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition  to  this  resolution which  would do away with the new procedures  established under BLM Planning 2.0.  Planning 2.0 encourages, at its foundation, early and frequent public input.  By rolling back this planning effort,  public  input—in  particular,  tribal  input—will be removed.  Federally recognized tribes have the  right to engage in government-to-government consultation, and, under Planning 2.0, tribal rights to participate in  the planning process are clearly enumerated and protected.  By introducing the resolution we are  considering  today,  the majority  is  making clear  it doesn’t value tribal  input in the development of BLM’s resource management plans. In this updated  planning  process,  the  BLM  worked hard to ensure government-to-  government consultation was accomplished. Tribes were encouraged to submit  comments  through  the  formal  comment period and through government-to-government consultation. But  BLM recognizes the hard work of tribes  and has been inclusive of tribal concerns.  In fact, BLM has recognized the quality and value that tribes’ traditional  ecological knowledge brings to planning efforts. It is important to incorporate this  information to avoid resource conflicts and to protect hunting  and fishing grounds.  In many areas, the BLM and tribes  actually have to manage resources together. How can they do this when  tribes are not invited to be a part of  the consultation process? By including  government-to-government  consultation early in the planning process, all  taxpayers benefit in the long run because we can develop a stronger plan  that doesn’t end up in court being litigated.  We want BLM to be an agency that  actively embraces the people who live  on and use the land they manage. By  formalizing the tribal consultation role  and recognizing the value tribes bring  to the planning process as Planning 2.0  does,  the BLM  is  taking  important  steps to fully engage with all their constituents.  Land management is about looking  at the bigger picture, and tribes understand that more than anyone. They deserve to be recognized in the planning  process, and Planning 2.0 does that.  Repealing this rule through the CRA  is shortsighted and wrongheaded.

",2017
54,House,115,0.641,34,2017-02-07,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank my colleague Mr. ROKITA for  yielding time and for handling this on  the floor today.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of H.J. Res. 57. For years, the Federal  Government operated under the flawed  idea that Washington knows best when  it comes to education. Policies put in  place  in  recent  decades  vastly  expanded the Federal footprint in the K–  12  schools and prevented State and  local education leaders from delivering  the high-quality education all children  deserve.  Something needed to change. Yet,  under the Obama administration, the  problem only got worse. For years, the  last administration used regulations,  waivers, and pet projects to unilaterally exert its control over education.  Its heavy-handed, one-size-fits-all policies only increased the Federal role in  America’s  classrooms, moving K–12  education in the wrong direction. That  is why Republicans  and Democrats  came together to pass the Every Student Succeeds Act.  Enacted just over a year ago, the law  was built on  three  important principles: empowering parents, reducing  the Federal role, and restoring local  control. It sent a clear message that  the American people were done with  the top-down approach to education.  Unfortunately, the previous administration didn’t get the message. The Department of Education continued using  rules and regulations to push its failed  education  agenda—the  same  agenda  Congress rejected with overwhelming  bipartisan support. We are here today  to put a stop to two of those rules.  The resolution under consideration,  H.J. Res. 57, will roll back a regulation  implementing  accountability  provisions in the Every Student Succeeds  Act. The law empowers States to develop ways to hold schools accountable  to the students and parents they serve,  and ensure taxpayer dollars are being  spent  responsibly. The Department’s  accountability rule, however, does the  exact opposite. Not only does it impose  prescriptive  accountability  requirements on State education leaders, but  it also violates specific prohibitions  the law places on the Secretary of Education’s authority.  We also considered, a few moments  ago, H.J. Res. 58, which will block implementation of a regulation that significantly expands the Federal Government’s involvement in teacher preparation.  Yet, another example of Obama overreach, the teacher preparation rule essentially creates a Federal system for  evaluating  teacher  performance.  It  would be virtually impossible to implement and could lead to fewer teachers  serving low-income students.  Together, these two resolutions of  disapproval will move us towards limiting the Federal role in education and  protect the local control promised with  recent education reforms.  I want  to  thank Representatives  ROKITAand GUTHRIE for their work to  fight against the flawed policies of the  past and for leading the way in delivering a more positive, more limited,  and more responsible Federal role in  education.  I urge my colleagues to support both  resolutions.  ",2017
55,House,115,0.438,41,2017-02-07,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House  Joint Resolution 57.  I am  pleased to join Congressman TODDROKITAas  an original cosponsor.  As a parent, I know that success looks different  for each child.  I  frequently hear  from  parents,  teachers, and school boards  in my  district that with more local flexibility, they can  better meet the needs of local students. This  is why  the Every Student Succeeds Act replaced the one-size-fits-all approach to K–12  education, and gave power back to states and  school districts. Unfortunately,  the previous  administration used executive authority to impose an  inflexible accountability system and  take away  the  local voices; voices  that are  critical in determining how schools should be  held accountable. Local  schools,  teachers,  and  parents,  not Washington  bureaucrats,  know best what success looks like.  Mr. Speaker, let’s return authority where it  belongs—with  teachers, schools, and school  districts.  Success and accountability should be about  meeting students’ needs, not Washington’s  mandates.  I urge my colleagues  to support  passage of House Joint Resolution 57.  ",2017

Doyle on the  occasion of the City of Camden, New Jersey  naming a street in his honor on Monday, February 6, 2017. This street is in proximity to Sacred Heart Church, which Father Doyle has  shepherded since 1974.  Monsignor Doyle is a man of conviction who  was born in Ireland in 1934 and came to the  United States of America by boat. He chose  the Catholic Diocese  of Camden  for  his  priestly vocation in the late 1950s and started  serving the City of Camden in 1967. Before  taking  the helm at Sacred Heart, he  taught  students in Diocesan schools.  Always willing to fight for what he believed  was  right, Monsignor Doyle  helped  plant  crosses memorializing Camden City’s murder  victims in front of Camden City Hall when he  felt more could be done to stem rampant violence. In the 1970s, he was a staunch opponent of the Vietnam War. He ’s known to those  in his parish as someone who is not afraid to  fight for peace.  Monsignor Doyle is also known for his service to the poor, as well as his poetry. Actor  Martin Sheen narrated a documentary entitled  ‘Poet of Poverty’ ’ which focused on Monsignor  Doyle’s poetry and letters to his congregation.  While  the City of Camden has  its challenges, Monsignor Doyle chooses to focus on  the beauty of the community he calls home.  His congregation consists of people from the  City, but also a  large number of  individuals  visit Sacred Heart from surrounding suburbs.

Ms. Redgate has  been a counselor at Santa Fe High School for  35 years and is an inclusive and caring support system for her students. She has dedicated her life to empowering students and instilling in them the values of selflessness and  giving, and she has made a tremendous impact on the lives of every student she meets.  In addition to her position as counselor, Ms.  Redgate serves  in many  leadership roles at  Santa Fe High School. She has been  the  leading  representative  for  the school’s anti-  drunk driving program  ‘Every 15 Minutes,’ ’  leading parent debriefs  for  the parents of  those who participated. She designed Parent  Education Day and the Service Learning Program, which acknowledges students for their  participation  in community service and  reinforces her dedication to teaching the values of  selflessness and giving.  Ms. Redgate has devoted her life to helping  others. She  founded  the Christmas Family  Program to provide gifts for those in need during  the holidays, and  the Serenity Center  which acts as a safe zone on campus where  licensed clinical social workers are available  for students.  Santa Fe High School is a special place because of dedicated professionals  like Ms.  Redgate, and  I couldn ’t be more proud  to  honor her today.

JOHN GARAMENDI  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 7, 2017  ",2017
60,,115,-0.313,76,2017-02-07,Mr. GARAMENDI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to recognize the investments in flood control  infrastructure made  by  local  flood  control  agencies in California, as well as by the State  itself. Water  in California  is  feast or  famine.  For the last five years we have had a famine,  and now we have a feast.  During  the massive California  floods  of  1997, 9 lives were lost, 120,000 people were  evacuated and  roughly 23,000 homes and  businesses were damaged across  the state.  The greater Sacramento area, part of which I  represent, is the 2nd most flood prone region  in the United States, behind only New Orleans. Mr. Speaker, my constituents take flood  protection very seriously.  Because of this, there are many local agencies spearheading critical projects throughout  my district that I’d like to recognize, including  the Sutter Butte Flood Control Agency,  the  Yuba County Water Agency,  the Marysville  Levee District, the City of Woodland, the City  of West Sacramento, Reclamation District  2140, the State of California, and the Central  Valley Flood Protection Board. The U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers has also played a pivotal  role  in all of  these projects and should be  commended.  Mr. Speaker,  floods do not recognize  the  boundaries of congressional districts. Therefore, Congressman LAMALFA and Congresswoman MATSUIshould also be praised for their  work on flood control as many of the projects  undertaken by the agencies I mentioned have  a footprint in all of our districts.  There is no question that investment in flood  control pays dividends. In 2006, California voters passed Proposition 1E which provided  $4.09 billion in flood control infrastructure. To  date, almost all of that funding has been allocated. These bonds,  in  tandem with  investment from local flood control agencies and the  federal government, have  funded significant  improvements in many, but not all of, the levees that protect my constituents.  Those  improvements were highlighted  this  winter, when almost all of  the state’s rivers  and reservoirs were filled to capacity. Statewide rainfall between October and December  of 2016 was 143 percent of the historical average while combined inflows to California ’s reservoirs were the 2nd highest in recorded history. Yet the levees held and we were able to  avoid any major flooding.

At SAR High School in my district, one  such educator, Dr. Mark Shinar, has been  changing the lives of his students in just such  a profound way.  Abraham Joshua Heschel said that ‘ ‘It is the  personality of the teacher which is the text that  pupils read; the text they will never forget.’ ’ As  Director of General Studies at SAR High  School, Dr. Mark Shinar embodies this quote.  He has proven to be a mentor and champion  to his students both in and out of the classroom. He is deeply invested in their academic  and  long  term personal growth which continues even after they leave SAR. His is the  voice in their ear, the text they will not forget  as they make key decisions in the future. Mark  brings an infectious energy and enthusiasm to  the classroom  that energizes both students  and faculty. He leads by example and listens  to concerns of colleagues, peers and students  always trying to improve the learning process.  This is the true definition of a teacher. ‘ ‘The  classroom is air to me and the students are  part of my family. It’s a joy and remarkable  privilege to teach at SAR. ’ ’  When not changing lives in the classroom,  Mark enjoys spending his  time  just being a  husband and dad. He and his wife, Lauren,  are parents to four wonderful children, Aiden,  Joseph, Samuel, and Ilan. The Shinar family  are members of YIOZ in Riverdale, and will be  making aliya at  the end of  the current academic year.  This year, SAR. is honoring Mark at the organization’s 48th Anniversary Dinner with the  Audrey Schurgin Memorial Faculty Award.  They could not have picked a more deserving  honoree. Congratulations again to Mark on receiving  this well-deserved  recognition, and  thank you for all of your amazing work in the  community.  f  RECOGNIZING THE EXPANSION OF  CYPRESS BAPTIST CHURCH  HON.

For over  thirty years, Cypress Baptist has  blessed the lives of many in our region. Most  recently, God has blessed Cypress Baptist  Church with the means to expand their sanctuary to grow their ministry.  Their mission,  ‘to help people come  to  know Christ and to grow in Christ,’ ’ has been  modeled by the church’s faithful congregation  and their commitment to the Lord is unwavering. Because of their continued stewardship,  more and more people are answering the call  of God by being baptized and carrying out critical mission work.  Over the past two years the communities of  Benton and Bossier City and  surrounding  areas have come  together  to help Cypress  Baptist in its mission. This church has touched  the lives of so many, and is growing exponentially, and  it  is only  fitting  that God rewards  them with the blessing of more space to carry  out their service.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States  Congress, I am priviledged to recognize Cypress Baptist Church and congratulate this pillar of our community on its continued dedication to the Kingdom. Their new sanctuary will  be a true blessing to the people of our community. My wife, Kelly and I pray that the Spirit  of the Lord continue to bless the congregation  of Cypress Baptist Church.  DR.

63,,115,-0.256,83,2017-02-07,Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire.," Mr.  Speaker, I include in the RECORDan op-ed by  Dr. Oglesby Young as published in the Concord Monitor.  MYTURN: PAIDFAMILYLEAVEISTHE  INVESTMENTOFALIFETIME  A pediatric colleague once said, ‘‘We can  invest in early childhood or we can build  more prisons 20 years later at a much greater cost to society.’’  A bill, presently before the state Legislature (HB 628), is a plan for an Employer  Based Insurance Program to provide ‘‘paid  family leave.’’ I believe this is an opportunity to invest in early childhood in order  to create a healthier, more productive and  caring society.  Barry Brazelton, now a 95-year-old Boston  pediatrician and researcher, established a  half-century ago how critical newborn bonding is for the baby and the parents. The development of ‘‘attachment’’ from the start of  life, profoundly affects the relationship between the child and his or her new parents.  It follows that the first few years, even the  first few months, of life lasts forever. We  have a compelling biologic model of why  kids who have experienced the toxic stress of  neglect—the absence of love, as simple as  cuddling—have trouble learning. A Harvard  pediatrician, Jack Shonkoff, states simply,  ‘‘We can modify behavior late, but we can’t  rewire disrupted brain circuits.’’  Years ago,  I remember seeing the MRI  scans of the brains of children who were  completely neglected  in an Eastern European orphanage. There were large areas of  atrophy (no brain tissue), which had resulted  from a lack of love and stimulation of these  children early in their lives.  As obstetricians, we see new moms routinely for their postpartum visits six weeks  after the delivery of their babies. Most are  just learning how to be a parent. Their bodies are still healing, while they are torn between the challenges of being a new mom  and returning to the demands of an old job.  I realized early in my career that we could  devote ourselves to delivering healthy babies, but it would mean nothing if we did not  care for the mom and newborn when we sent  them home from the hospital. Those of us  who have children know that no matter how  well-educated or how well-motivated, the experience of having a first child at times can  be overwhelming.  Babies are not born with instructions. We  all want to be good parents, but not all of us  have had good modeling, and not all of us  have the resources to be the parents we want  to be.  Many new moms are single today with no  support. Grandparents work and they often  live elsewhere. In my lifetime neighborhoods  have changed. There is no longer a woman  down the street who has had six kids and  welcomes the opportunity to help a new  mom as she was once helped. For these reasons,  20  years  ago, we  established  the  Healthy Beginnings Endowment at Concord  Hospital, raising $1.3 million to award grants  annually to Concord area programs that support and educate new parents.  Physicians have been the most generous  donors to this endowment because they understand the wisdom of investing in early  childhood to prevent adult problems. The  upshot is that children who are undermined  VerDate Sep 11 2014  05:15 Feb 08, 2017 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A07FE8.032 E07FEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o r e c n e p S S ‘ ‘         ",2017
64,House,115,0.354,3,2017-02-14,Mr. ZELDIN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor Brookhaven National  Laboratory on its 70th anniversary.  The United States is the greatest Nation in the world, and one of the reasons why is Brookhaven National Laboratory. Their science research is aggressively pursuing cures to illnesses,  protecting our national security, and  increasing our energy independence.  Imagine  being  able  to witness  a  recreation of the very beginning of our  universe, a replica of the primordial  soup which once comprised all that had  existed right before your very eyes.  Also  imagine  that  this  very  same  equipment could be used to find cures  to illnesses such as cancer and heart  disease.  I am proud  that Brookhaven National Laboratory  is  located  in  the  greatest  congressional  district  in  America, the First Congressional District of New York.  For nearly three-quarters of a century, Brookhaven has stood as a world-  class  research  center  that  conducts  groundbreaking studies within the scientific community. Brookhaven asks  the big questions that scientists have  been researching for generations, and  has allowed us to look into the building blocks of our world.  Between  preservation  of  our  ecosystem, studies on the environment,  and researching new forms of sustainable energy, Brookhaven  is a world  leader in scientific research.  There is also incredible cultural and  historical  relevance  of  the  site  of  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory.  There was once a World War I Army  training center called Camp Upton located where Brookhaven stands today.  It was at this camp that Irving Berlin  wrote ‘‘God Bless America’’ while serving in the U.S. Army.  Brookhaven is not only a local and  regional treasure, but also a national  asset. The machines  in Brookhaven  have been utilized by the most brilliant  minds in America, from the scientists  of MIT and Yale to the engineers at GE  and IBM.  While  there  are  17 national  labs  across our great country, Brookhaven  is a unique user facility which focuses  in a number of disciplines, not limited  to particle physics, chemical engineering, and systems engineering and integration.  In previous Congresses, critical funding has been provided in support of the  ARPA-E  program  for  several  of  Brookhaven’s phenomenal projects on  energy production and storage, and so  much more.  There has been discussion in the past  to cut  funding  for Brookhaven’s nuclear physics program to levels that  haven’t  been  seen  since  2008. This  would be a mistake.  Brookhaven  features  some  of  the  most important scientific efforts in the  world, with assets  like the National  Synchrotron Light Source II, or NSLS-  II. NSLS-II has allowed for incredible  advancement in the research and development  of  super  conductors, which  have the potential to revolutionize energy consumption in the U.S. and save  into the billions for the American people and American businesses.

66,House,115,0.542,10,2017-02-14,Mr. WESTERMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to recognize a milestone for  Little River County, Arkansas. On  March 5, the county will celebrate its  150th birthday.  According to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas, Little River County came into  existence following an act of the Arkansas General Assembly,  officially  separating from Hempstead and Sevier  Counties in 1867.  During its century and a half, the  citizens of Little River County have  shown  resilience  and  innovation  as  they weathered the Great Depression,  sent its men to fight in World War II,  and grew the  local economy  in the  years  since.  In  recent years, Little  River County has withstood  severe  flooding, but  they have come back  strong and resilient.  Little River County is blessed with  natural resources, including forestry,  agriculture, and minerals that all provide the inputs for manufacturing jobs  that play a big role in the local economy, and will continue to do so in Little River’s next 150 years.  I am proud to call Little River County part of the Fourth Congressional  District, and I congratulate its citizens  on 150 years of progress.  f  b1215  RESIGNATION OF MICHAEL FLYNN  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2017
67,House,115,-0.403,10,2017-02-14,Mr. DEUTCH.," Mr. Speaker, Michael  Flynn’s resignation does not close the  book on the administration’s coziness  with Russia.  It confirms the urgent  need for a bipartisan investigation of  Russia’s ties to the Trump administration and its ongoing influence. It confirms the urgent need for the President  to release his tax returns so the American people can see any business ties  that the President has to Russia.  We need a full, independent inquiry  into not just the actions of Michael  Flynn  in one conversation with the  Vice President, but the ongoing connections between  the administration  and Russia, because the one thing we  know for sure is it doesn’t stop there.  President Trump’s  fawning praise of  Putin and the previous resignation of  other aides over  their Russian  ties  made it clear that this is a problem  that goes beyond General Flynn.  What we have learned over the past  24 hours is that colluding with a foreign government or lying to the Vice  President  and  others  is  not what  brought Flynn down. It seems that it  was only the disclosure of those lies  that made it untenable for Flynn to remain. The White House was apparently  okay with everything until the American people found out.  We need to find out what else the  White House  and President Trump  doesn’t want us to know about their  connection to the foreign power that  interfered with our election, and we  need to start today.  f  IT IS THE MEDIA’S CHOICE  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2017
68,House,115,0.425,10,2017-02-14,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  the  liberal national media have two  choices.  First, they can continue their dislike—some would  call  it hatred—of  President Trump that results  in severely slanted coverage. This  is the  road to self-destruction. The media’s  credibility has hit a record low, and  the American people soon will stop  looking to them for news.  Or, second, the liberal national media  can start covering President Trump objectively. This means not portraying  his actions in the worst possible light  but sometimes giving President Trump  the benefit of the doubt. It means giving his side of the story. It means,  most of all, recognizing that President  Trump represents the legitimate hopes  and fears of millions of Americans.  If the  liberal national media continue to treat President Trump unlike  they would a Democrat, the public will  grow tired of the double standard.  The American people have an innate  sense of  fairness, which  the media  should not ignore. For their own sake  and for the sake of our democracy, the  media should change their ways.  f  REPEAL WITHOUT REPLACEMENT  WOULD BE DEVASTATING  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

69,House,115,-0.565,17,2017-02-14,Mr. HASTINGS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding to me the customary  30 minutes for debate.  I rise to debate the rule for consideration, which bundles together two completely unrelated pieces of legislation.  One is a joint resolution disapproving  of a Department of Labor rule that relates to the drug testing of unemployment  compensation  applicants. The  other, as the gentleman just described,  is the Red River Gradient Boundary  Survey Act.  There  are many more  important  issues, in my opinion, that face this  country at the moment, and for the life  of me, I cannot figure out why my colleagues across  the aisle  think  that  ceding Bureau of Land Management  survey authority over federally owned  land to the States and impugning the  integrity of those who rightfully seek  unemployment  insurance are on the  same  list of  important matters this  body should be addressing.  First, I would note the odd events  that brought us here today as we operate, once again, under a closed rule. I  just heard the debate on the previous  rule, and I was illuminated by the gentleman  from Alabama, on the other  side, who  indicated  that  the  rule  wasn’t closed because we had a debate  in the Rules Committee yesterday for 1  hour. A closed rule is a closed rule. It  means that other Members of this body  do not have an opportunity to have  their amendments heard and/or made  in order. We are now entering our 13th  of these closed rules in a body that  claimed that it was going to have open  rules and regular order.  On February 3, Congressman MCCLINTOCKwrote to Chairman Sessions, asking  that  the Red River Gradient  Boundary Survey Act be heard under a  structured rule, which still  isn’t an  open rule. An amendment deadline was  set,  and  two  germane  amendments  with no budgetary  issues were  submitted. Nevertheless, my Republican  colleagues shut down the process and  reported a closed rule. As of today,  two-thirds of all of the rules issued this  session by the Rules Committee have  been closed rules. We should not be  conducting the people’s business this  way.  I call on my Republican colleagues to  put their unfounded fear aside and let  this body operate under regular order,  under open rules, or, at the very least,  under structured rules.

Friends, we may have vastly different views on how best to create a  more perfect Union, along with different  styles  and  different  temperaments, but we all share a commitment and, frankly, a responsibility  to bring the voice of the people to  Washington, D.C.  I am honored to represent much of  Pinellas County and my hometown of  St. Petersburg, Florida, and I promise  to fight for the needs of my home. But  I pledge to do so in keeping with what  is known as the Golden Rule: Do unto  others as you would have done unto  you. This is a rule that I strive to live  by every single day.  Poll after poll shows that Floridians  and, frankly, all Americans are fed up  with  the divisiveness and  rancor of  Washington. As we move forward debating the issues of the day, let us be  FITZPATRICK mindful of the words of President Abraham Lincoln:  ‘‘Though passions may  have strained, it must not break our  bonds of affection.’’  b1730  I am proud that our freshman class—  yes, this awesome freshman class—has  put forward its commitment to civility. It states that, despite our political  differences, at the end of the day we  must work together to move our country forward, putting people over politics and treating one another with mutual respect and much more grace even  when we may disagree.  I thank, again, the gentleman from  Louisiana and the gentlewoman from  California for their leadership and for  their  friendship, putting people over  politics. God bless you all, and God  bless America.  ",2017
76,House,115,0.223,38,2017-02-14,Mr. FITZPATRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I  would like to thank all the members of  the freshman class—members of both  political parties and of every political  background—who have  joined us tonight in signing the commitment to civility pledge: love thy neighbor, no exceptions. Seeing  46 Republicans and  Democrats make this public commitment is encouraging for this Chamber  and for the constituents that we serve.  We can all agree that our Nation is  facing some serious challenges. From  increasing opportunity in an evolving  economy to keeping our families safe  from threats at home and abroad, the  list  in  front of  this body  is heavy  enough, and the last thing we need is  to make  that problem-solving  even  tougher. A statement made on the Senate floor last week offered a stark message: it is simply not possible to exist  as a nation when half of its citizens  hate the other half. If we are willing to  end  friendships or block our  family  members because of Facebook posts,  we are not heading in the right direction.  Despite the incredible responsibility  entrusted to each of us by those whom  we represent, this Congress has not  been immune to the hardening of political division. However, we must not accept our current discourse as the new  normal.  Yet there is hope. There is hope because the Members standing with me  tonight and those who have joined our  pledge are willing to say, first and foremost, we are Americans, and the person I may disagree with—even vehemently—is still an American. Just because someone has different viewpoints  or policy priorities or a different letter  next to their name does not make them  our enemy.  This Congress can and must play a  part in restoring the civility and respect that makes productive dialogue  possible. I am not saying we’ll agree on  everything, but a spirit of mutual understanding, mutual respect, and mutual cooperation  is  the bedrock  for  making our government and our communities work.  Whether we  are  elected  officials,  moms,  dads,  neighbors,  community  leaders, students—or anyone—we must  remember  that  there  is more  that  unites us than divides us. That is a  commitment I am willing to make my  colleagues  and  constituents  this  evening.  Again,  I want  to  thank my  colleagues, the gentleman from Louisiana  and the gentlewoman from California,  for all their work. I look forward to  working with our awesome freshman  class going forward.  ",2017

Two others were attached  to the Trump campaign: his manager,  Paul Manafort, and Russian energy adviser, Carter Page.  Meanwhile, Russia’s Putin  is  the  same KGB thug he always has been,  continuing to invade countries in eastern and  central Europe and propagating a war  in Syria as well as a  bloody war against Ukraine.

78,House,115,-0.368,45,2017-02-14,Mr. AL GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, on May 17, 1954, Chief Justice Earl  Warren delivered the shock that was  felt across the Nation.  This was done when, on behalf of a  unanimous  Supreme  Court,  he  announced:  ‘‘We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate  but equal’ has no place. Separate educational  facilities are  inherently unequal.’’  These 24 words, Mr. Speaker, had a  far-reaching impact upon our Nation.  These words ushered in an era of de  jure desegregation that has changed  the course of history that has created a  new  sense of destiny, and  literally  these 24 words opened doors that were  closed to many persons and created  new opportunities.  Mr. Speaker, before I go on, let me  thank the many cosponsors of H. Res.  79, which recognizes the significance of  Black History Month, and H. Res. 17,  which honors the National Association  for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, on its 108th anniversary. I thank the many cosponsors and  the many persons who have worked on  these issues.  I have a staff that has worked tirelessly to make sure that we have these  resolutions prepared, such that they  could be filed timely. I am grateful to  my staff. One such staff member  is  with me tonight. My legislative director, Ms. Amena Ross, is in the Chamber  with me. I am appreciative that on  Valentine’s Day she has chosen to be  here as opposed to where she probably  could be and will probably be going  shortly.  Mr. Speaker,  given  that  in  this  month, the month of February, we celebrate Black history as well as the  founding of the NAACP, I think that it  is appropriate for me to speak on the  topic from desegregation to resegregation. Mr. Speaker, it can happen.  Mr. Speaker, while Brown v. Board of  Education has not produced the utopian society many hoped  for—it has  not ended the de facto segregation that  many prayed for. It has not engendered  the quality education for all children  and has not transformed public schools  into perfect schools or equal schools—  I still contend and firmly believe that  we are a much better nation with  Brown v. Board of Education  than  without it.  Mr. Speaker, I think that it is important for us to give empirical evidence  of these words that I have just spoken,  my positions, if you will. I would like  to do so by allowing the words of a  Southern judge. I would like to allow  his words to speak for themselves.  This is a message that was delivered  by a Southern judge on October 4 of  1957. Mr. Speaker, I shall not call his  name. I do not want to embarrass his  family. But he was the vice president  of a bar association. He was a circuit  court judge. He received his BA from a  prestigious institution, and he taught  sociology.  Mr. Speaker, please hear now his  words so that people may understand  why Brown v. Board of Education was  so important to so many in this country. These are his words:  ‘‘Segregation in the South is a way of  life. It is the means whereby we live in  social peace, order and security.’’  Mr. Speaker, I trust that many people can understand why persons of my  generation are concerned when we hear  the terms  ‘‘law’’ and  ‘‘order,’’ terms  that  indicate  law  enforcement will  take law into its own hands by some  standards.

81,Senate,115,0.496,73,2017-02-14,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, for the  last several weeks, we have been doing  all we can to take up and consider the  President’s nominations for his Cabinet, even though we have had little or  no cooperation from the other side of  the aisle.  Last night, we confirmed the President’s  top  economic  adviser—something you would think people would  think was pretty important—the Secretary of the Treasury, and we did confirm the President’s Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Ironically, the vote for  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs was  100 to 0. So maybe somebody can explain to me what was the necessity of  delaying the confirmation of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for 3 weeks,  leaving that important agency without  a  designated  and  Senate-confirmed  head?  Earlier  today, we  considered  the  nomination of Linda McMahon to serve  as the next head of the Small Business  Administration, to help our country’s  job  creators  reach  their  potential.  Again, we had an overwhelming vote  for Linda McMahon for the SBA. So,  again, my question is, What purpose is  served by delaying, by foot-dragging,  and  by  obstructing  the President’s  choice of his Cabinet members?  We are glad we  finally confirmed  them, but to be honest, it is not much  to celebrate. By carrying out this unprecedented  obstruction  of  qualified  nominees, our friends across the aisle  are simply precluding the Senate from  considering other acts of  legislation  that would actually be helpful to the  American people. From my vantage  point, it is pretty clear. While they are  headed down this self-destructive path,  our  friends  continue  to  listen and,  sadly,  cater  to  radical  elements of  their own party that simply haven’t  gotten over the election and have decided to obstruct the President and his  agenda at all cost.  But we know for a fact, from our private conversations, that our Democrat  friends are not—well, they are  fractured. Some of them remembered what  happened in 2014, when, under the leadership of then-Majority Leader Reid,  essentially everybody was frozen out of  offering legislation or amendments to  legislation  on  the  floor,  including  Members of the majority party—then,  Democrats, at the time. That strategy  really backfired, resulting in a huge  Republican class of outstanding Senators in 2014.  People don’t  like  that across  the  country. They think we are sent here  to solve problems, and we work together and make progress on behalf of  the American  people. This  sort  of  mindless obstruction or foot-dragging  for foot-dragging’s sake doesn’t make  any sense to them, and it doesn’t make  any sense to me either.  Now, I realize the minority leader—  the Democratic  leader—probably has  the toughest job in Washington, DC—to  try to keep the far left fringes of his  party happy, while trying to do the  work of the American people who sent  us here to legislate. I do know that  there are Members of the Democratic  caucus who are very interested in trying to demonstrate their effectiveness  by working on bipartisan legislation.  Some of them happen to be running for  election in 2018 in States carried by  President Trump. You would  think  they would be incentivized to tell the  leadership of their own party—or the  far left of their party, which wants to  do nothing but resist the Trump agenda and our bipartisan agenda in the  Senate—to stand down or that they are  not going to participate in that sort of  mindless obstruction, because I think  their  enlightened  self-interest  tells  them that not only is this what the  American people sent us to do—to be  productive on a bipartisan basis—but it  is also in their electoral self-interest,  as well.  As long as the Democratic leader caters to the fringe of his own party and  resists any sort of cooperation, I think  they can expect the same sort of results after Senator Reid led his party  down that path in 2014. We are now  headed into the fourth week of the new  administration, and we have only confirmed a handful of this President’s  Cabinet picks. That is bad news not  just for us but for the American people,  as well.  Surely, after the election of November 8, when President Obama said he  wanted to make sure he participated in  a peaceful transition of power to the  next administration, he was appealing  to the better angels of all of those who  perhaps were disappointed by the outcome of the election.

He has worked for the city court  as a liaison for 11 years; he advises alumni of  the Buffalo City Drug Court and is also a patient health navigator at GBUAHN.  Stan is an important leader and role model  for community youth. He spends his weekends  and the summer months working with young  men volunteering with None Like You Outreach Program and other agencies that focus  on children. He is always eager to teach youth  valuable life skills all while building their confidence and character. Stan takes great pride  in passing along his wisdom about maintaining  and beautifying properties throughout the city.  Mr. Simpson’s help is also crucial in executing None Like You ’s Thanksgiving and  Christmas dinners. He always makes himself  available to aid in organization, arranging volunteers and personally cooking and preparing  food. He  is often vice chair  for community  meetings. Each week he picks up and delivers  food and clothing to those in need, and has  helped with many United Way Day of Caring  projects. In 1996, Stan’s commitment was vital  to  the  restoration of multiple properties on  Southampton  and Sycamore Streets. Stan  prides himself in the way he has changed his  own  life and encourages others  to do  the  same by getting  involved  in  the community  and seeking out ways to give to others.

85,House,115,0.343,3,2017-03-08,Mr. MAST.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today because there have now recently  been at least 100 threats made against  more than 75 Jewish community centers across the country. These threats  and the recent vandalism of Jewish  cemeteries are despicable. I can probably find much more harsh language to  use, but we probably shouldn’t use it  here on the House floor.  Community  centers  of  all  faiths  should be places where people can find  peace and not feel targeted for their beliefs. As a nation, we have to demonstrate that we will do everything  within our power  to prevent  future  threats and stop potential attacks.  One of my first acts as a new Member  of Congress was to join the bipartisan  task force to combat anti-Semitism. I  am sad that we even have to do this.  Our group works across the aisle to  combat global anti-Semitism. I have  also cosponsored the Combating European Anti-Semitism Act, which  instructs the Secretary of State to track  anti-Semitism in Europe.  But it is clear from these attacks,  Madam Speaker, that we must also do  far more here at home to combat anti-  Semitism. In the coming days, I will be  working with my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, to determine  the additional steps that we can take  to combat anti-Semitism in the United  States and keep our communities safe.  I make this encouragement. I encourage all of my colleagues to ask themselves one question: What if it were  their child’s elementary school? What  if it were their child’s daycare? What if  it were their child’s afterschool program that had the threat of a bomb,  just like the one that took my own  legs?  f  RESIST APPEAL PROPOSAL  ",2017
86,House,115,-0.332,3,2017-03-08,Mr. BROWN of Maryland.," Madam  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  speak out  against the proposal offered by the Republican majority to replace the Affordable Care Act.  After nearly 7 years of repeal votes,  House  Republicans  finally  released  their healthcare proposal on Monday.  Simply stated, this proposal is bad for  seniors, it is bad for the poor, and it is  bad for the sick. It costs more and offers less. It raises cost on middle class  Americans  while  giving  huge  tax  breaks to the wealthy and to special  interests.  Madam Speaker, more than 12,000 of  my constituents receive financial assistance to buy health insurance on the  exchange in the commercial market.  Almost all of them will get less help  under the Republican proposal.  Why is that?  Because the proposed tax credits will  vary by age and income, which means  premiums will be unaffordable for the  low- to moderate-income families and  seniors. As  premiums  go  up with  healthcare costs over time, these tax  credits don’t rise, making  insurance  less affordable year after year.  Regarding  the  individual mandate,  while removing it may be politically  popular, experts who have studied this  expect premiums to increase 25 percent  when the individual mandate is eliminated. When the employer mandate is  eliminated under  the GOP proposal,  fewer employers will offer insurance to  their employees.  Furthermore, Madam Speaker, I am  opposed to the GOP proposal because it  will  significantly  raise  healthcare  costs on individuals in their fifties and  sixties.  And why is that?  Because the plan will allow insurers  to charge them five times more than  younger policyholders. In fact, if you  are 60 years or older and making an average income, under the GOP proposal  your insurance bill will go up by $3,200  each year while you lose $6,000 in tax  credits and subsidies.  Madam Speaker, nearly 30,000 men,  women, and children in my district are  currently covered by the Medicaid expansion provisions of the Affordable  Care Act. Each of them now stands to  lose coverage if the Republican Congress eliminates Maryland’s Medicaid  expansion. Even our Republican Governor understands that much.  The GOP plan to so-called modernize  Medicaid essentially turns the program  into a block grant program that shifts  the costs to States. States simply cannot afford that. As a result, we will  eventually see massive cuts to this  cost-efficient program.  This plan to turn Medicaid into a  block grant program would hurt the  working poor, children, seniors, and  people with disabilities that rely on  this program. This is wrong and disgraceful.  And why do Republicans want to cut  Medicaid, Madam Speaker?  I am not sure, but I do know they are  also proposing huge tax cuts for the  wealthy.  Under Monday’s midnight proposal,  we now see that the 400 wealthiest  households in America will receive annual tax cuts of $7 million. The proposal also includes a tax break for insurance companies that pay their CEOs  over half a million dollars a year.  Madam  Speaker,  the Republicans  kept this proposal under lock and key  for a reason. They scheduled a committee markup without a single hearing or even a CBO score.  The American people and their Representatives deserve to see the numbers. That means every Member of this  Congress needs to hear from the Congressional Budget Office: How much  will it cost taxpayers? How will it impact our hospitals and health centers?

It does not have to  do with the gentleman’s healthcare replacement act or his thoughts on the  healthcare replacement act, insurance  executive’s  compensation,  individual  mandates, tax cuts for the rich, Russia,  Iraq, although I did appreciate the gentleman’s memories from law school the  year that I was born.

88,House,115,0.586,17,2017-03-08,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, it is a  delight for me to join the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) on a piece of  legislation that actually has his name  on  it, he  is  responsible  for, understands, and is prepared today to fully  debate.  I would also like to thank the gentleman from Florida, a member of the  Rules Committee, for not only coming  down to offer his argument against the  facts of the case as they reside today  on this important piece of legislation,  but I also want to acknowledge that I  know the frustration.  I know there is a lot of frustration.  There is a lot of frustration from our  colleagues who have  lost the House,  the Senate, and the Presidency. They  are in the middle of what might be  called wandering, as they have called  it, in the darkness or in the doldrums  of being deep in the minority.  With that said, there is an agenda  that is being laid out before the American people. It happened, Mr. Speaker,  directly as a result of what we call an  election—an election where all these  issues, or most of them that have been  discussed by the gentleman, were fully  debated not only in a theater near you,  but directly in congressional contests,  in senatorial contests and the debates  for the President of the United States.  The facts of the case are really pretty simple. The Republican Party will  be talking about all the issues that the  gentleman brought up today right before our eyes. Probably on C–SPAN,  trying to compete against us, is a hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee.  The gentleman, GREGWALDEN, the  chairman of the committee, over the  weekend released the text of the chairman’s mark, the ‘‘bill’’ of the Republican Party of how we are going to look  at health care.

Nearly all the facilities within this  project were already transferred to the  Arbuckle Master Conservancy District  in 2012, after the district finish repaying what it owed to the Federal Government  for  construction.

127,Senate,115,0.455,367,2017-03-08,Mr. GARDNER.," Mr. President, looking at today’s headlines and listening  to the news, it may seem as if colleagues from across the country—Democrat, Republican—don’t always agree  on some things, let alone anything. I  think we are starting to see a consensus emerge—a very good, genuine  agreement emerge between liberals and  conservatives, Democrats and Republicans on at least one matter in Washington,  DC,  in  the  Senate:  Neil  Gorsuch. That agreement  is on Neil  Gorsuch.  Neil Gorsuch is an exceptional nominee  for the U.S. Supreme Court. In  fact,  Judge Gorsuch  is,  by many  extents and by many commentators,  arguably one of the most talented jurists we have nominated to the Court  in a very long time, at least in modern  history.  As the Denver Post in Colorado said:  ‘‘Gorsuch  is a brilliant  legal mind’’  who has a reputation for ‘‘[applying]  the law fairly and consistently.’’  You can’t ask for much more than  that—somebody who will apply the law  fairly and consistently. However, this  shouldn’t surprise anyone who knows  Judge Gorsuch. Judge Gorsuch has always enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan  support. All we need to do to see that  is to look back to 2006 when we could  see that most clearly in the U.S. Senate.  In  2006, when Judge Gorsuch was  unanimously confirmed to the Tenth  Circuit Court, 12 current Democratic  Senators, including the minority leader and Senators LEAHY, FEINSTEIN, and  DURBIN, all were  in office. It was a  nomination  in 2006 that was unanimous, a nomination that went by voice  vote.

128,Senate,115,-0.249,381,2017-03-08,Mr. COONS.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to join with my colleague from  the great State of Maryland and to  commend him for his leadership on the  Foreign Relations Committee and on  the floor today, as well as his great  work with the Helsinki Commission,  his tireless bipartisan work with our  committee chairman, and with many  others.  We have just heard detailed, in terms  of the legislation he has put forward,  the effort, the time, and the engagement he has put forward in terms of  standing up. I think it is important for  all of our colleagues and the American  people to hear us working together to  push back on Russian aggression and  on Vladimir Putin’s regime for its interference in our most recent election  and its long and sad record of appalling  human rights violations.  In 1950, the CIA delivered a report to  then-President Harry  Truman  that  outlined two key goals of the Soviet  Government. The first goal was  ‘‘destruction of the unity among the Western countries,  thereby  isolating  the  United States.’’ The second goal was  ‘‘alienating the Western people  from  their governments so that the efforts  of the Western countries to strengthen  themselves would be undermined.’’  Nearly 70 years later, the regime of  Vladimir Putin in Russia remains fundamentally committed to these same  two goals, but today his government  has a whole new arsenal of cyber tools  and information tools which it uses to  interfere in democratic elections here  in the United States and across Europe—among the nations that are our  vital allies—to launch propaganda and  misinformation campaigns that spread  falsehoods and  create a  climate of  doubt and uncertainty among citizens  and democracies around the world.  Last week, on this floor, I rose to  speak with my friend and colleague,  Senator MARCORUBIO, to highlight the  threat that we know Russia poses to  the American-led,  rules-based  international order that has been sustained  by both Republican and Democratic  Presidents and  leaders  in this body  since the Second World War.  Just yesterday, several of us participated in a hearing of the State and  Foreign  Operations  Appropriations  Subcommittee,  chaired  by  Senator  LINDSEYGRAHAMof South Carolina. We  heard directly from representatives of  the Governments of Ukraine, Poland,  Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. All of these nations know better  than any others just how serious the  Russian Government  is  today about  fulfilling the goals the CIA quoted and  outlined in that report from the 1950s.  Russian troops today are massing on  the borders of many of these countries.  In the case of Ukraine, Russia has recently invaded and continues to illegally occupy Crimea while arming and  supporting separatists in the eastern 20  percent of the country.  Russia previously invaded Georgia in  2008 and continues to occupy about  one-fifth  of  its  territory,  backing  rebels  in  the breakaway  regions of  South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The Russian Government has tried and, in several  cases,  succeeded  in  executing  cyber attacks against these countries’  governments, most  famously against  Estonia  in  2007.  Its  ongoing  disinformation campaigns have created  widespread doubt about Western institutions  like  NATO,  the  European  Union,  the OSCE—institutions  that  have helped to maintain a stable and  peaceful world for seven decades.  These Ambassadors and the Foreign  Ministers who testified yesterday before our appropriations subcommittee  made clear their countries depend on  the United States not just for leadership, not just for military strength but  for leadership and our commitment to  effective foreign assistance. These are  the same requests I heard last August  from Eastern European leaders, when I  led a bipartisan congressional delegation—two Republican House Members,  two Democratic Senate Members, and  I. The five of us went to Ukraine, Estonia, and the Czech Republic, and we  heard exactly the same message—that  they are threatened by a constant wave  of  attacks  of  disinformation,  both  overt and covert efforts  to  subvert  their democracies and to change the direction of their nations.  Maintaining our forms of American  leadership, our support for the democracies, the civil societies, and the military, and the strength of these nations  in Eastern Europe is not charity. A  world committed to democracy and the  rule of law is a more stable world. A  stable world means Americans  are  safer and more economically secure.

Both John and Suzanne were 1989 graduates of Boardman High School and high  school sweethearts. John graduated magna  cum  laude  from Wake Forest University  in  1993 as a CPA and member of Sigma Phi Epsilon  Fraternity.  Suzanne  graduated  from  Youngstown State University with a Bachelor’s  Degree in social work. They were seventeen  year residents of Columbus.  John worked for almost 30 years for the Superior Beverage Group in Columbus and the  beverage distribution industry. He was incredibly successful, rising to President and Chief  Executive Officer. In addition to his influential  leadership in his career, he was a leader in  his  community. He actively  volunteered at  nearby charities, and was a yearly supporter  of the Dublin Irish Festival. Above all, he was  known for being a family man.  His wife Suzanne was a devoted mother  and passionate supporter of Juvenile Diabetes  Research Foundation,  the  leading  funder of  type 1 diabetes  research. Their oldest son  John was a sophomore at Oletangy Liberty  High School where he excelled academically  and was  an Ohio  sports  enthusiast. His  younger brother Andrew attended  the Ohio  State School for the Blind in Columbus. Like  his brother, he too was an avid supporter of  sports, and he also participated  in Special  Olympics. This family will be greatly missed by  their family, friends, colleagues, and their community.  I extend my condolences to their family and  friends. These wonderful people will be dearly  missed.  f  REMEMBERING JUSTICE ‘‘JAY’’  SMYTH, III  HON. BRADLEY BYRNE  OFALABAMA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 8, 2017  ",2017
131,,115,0.538,409,2017-03-08,Mr. BYRNE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  the  life and  legacy of Mr. Justice  ‘Jay’ ’ Smyth, III, who passed away on February 10, 2017 at the age of 62. Jay was a  loving  father, son, brother, uncle, and husband. To me, he was a dear classmate, colleague, and friend for more than forty years.  Jay attended both undergraduate and  law  school at the University of Alabama, where he  was involved in the Student Government Association and Theta Chi Fraternity. During his  time in school, he was inducted into numerous  honor  societies  such  as  JASONS Senior  Men’s Honorary and Delta Theta Phi Legal  Honorary.  After graduating  from  law school  in 1980,  Jay practiced law in Montgomery, Alabama for  nineteen years before moving to Tuscaloosa.  Jay was a skilled and thoughtful lawyer who  earned  tremendous  respect  from  his  colleagues. As a true testament to his personality  and legal knowledge, Jay was also beloved by  his clients; an anomaly for most in the legal  community.  Jay was a skilled writer who excelled at telling stories and always took great interest in  politics and history. He  loved spending  time  outdoors and grilling out at home. He was a  dedicated  fan of  the Alabama Crimson Tide  and greatly enjoyed attending games with his  family. Jay was delighted  in spending  time  with his wife and children, whom he  loved  dearly. Most importantly, he was steadfast in  his  faith  to God and served as a pillar of  Christ in his family and his community.  So, to his wife, Rushan, and sons, Justice  and Jeff, I want to extend my deepest sympathies. May you  take comfort  in  the warm  memories of Jay and  the  lasting  impact he  had on so many.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE BURBANK  UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  HON. ADAM B.

132,,115,-0.348,409,2017-03-08,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay special recognition to the Burbank Unified  School District as  it celebrates  its Ninetieth  Anniversary.  In 1927,  the Burbank Union High School  District  (BUSD)  and  the Elementary City  School District unified to become the Burbank  City School District, which served approximately  1,000  students.  The  name  later  changed to Burbank Unified School District to  reflect state educational standards.  Today, BUSD’s total enrollment is approximately 15,000 students, who attend grades K–  12 at three high schools, three middle schools,  and eleven elementary schools. The District  also has an Alternative Education Program, an  Adult Education Program which serves more  than 5,000 students, and numerous district  child care centers serving preschool or school  age children.  The Burbank Unified School District’s mission statement reflects its purpose by building  partnerships with parents,  families, students,  and the community and promises the effective  use of all available resources to create, provide, and support quality  instructional programs, services, and environments. The District strives to ensure that every student develops the skills, knowledge, attitude, and behavior in order to be a responsible, productive citizen and  lifelong  learner  in a diverse and  changing global society.  BUSD is proud to have had seven of its elementary schools named as 2016 Gold Ribbon  recipients as well as all  three of  its middle  schools and  its comprehensive high schools  recognized  as  California  Distinguished  Schools. Five elementary schools have earned  the distinction of being named 2016 Academic  Achievement Award winning schools and four  are designated as having Exemplary Arts programs. In addition, the District’s continuation  high school, Monterey High, has been selected as a state model school, and the Burbank Adult School has been honored as a  Program of Excellence by the State of California.  I ask all Members to join me today in honoring the Burbank Unified School District upon  the celebration of  its Ninetieth Anniversary.  The entire community joins me in thanking the  past and current School Board Members, Superintendents, Teachers, Administrators and  Support Staff of Burbank Unified School District for the outstanding educational opportunities they have provided for the youth of California’s 28th Congressional District.  f  WESTERN NEW YORK COMMUNITY  UNITY  HON.

133,,115,0.366,409,2017-03-08,Mr. COLLINS of New York.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to commemorate people in my district coming together to take a stand against  bigotry, racism, and acts of hate. On March 7,  2017, members of  the Muslim Public Affairs  Council met with members of the Jewish community at  the Jewish Community Center  in  Getzville, NY. Both groups sat down together  to take a stand against recent threats towards  the Jewish community in Western New York.  This act of solidarity  is an example of a  community coming together despite their different backgrounds and beliefs. This type of  collaboration in the face of hate is a model for  the rest of the country.  During my recent meeting with the Muslim  Public Affairs Council, we discussed the importance of uniting behind our shared American values, such as inclusivity and tolerance.  The recent demonstration of unity by members  of the Jewish community and the Muslim community demonstrates  that despite any differences, we are all Americans and must join  together  in condemning hateful acts  in our  community.  For  their demonstrated  leadership,  I commemorate the groups and individuals working  to bring unity to Western New York.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

134,,115,0.596,416,2017-03-08,Mr. ROKITA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor a prominent Hoosier  leader and my  dear friend, Mr. Maurice L. (Mauri) Williamson  who passed away on January 30, 2017 surrounded by his loving family.  Mauri was born  in Economy,  Indiana and  spent his childhood participating  in 4–H. He  served in the Navy Medical Corps until 1946,  after which he received his undergraduate degree from Purdue University in 1950. He was  known throughout the state as the executive  secretary of the Purdue University Ag Alumni  Association, a position he held for 37 years.  During his Purdue career, Mauri helped found  the National Ag Alumni Development Association (NAADA) and started the Ag Alumni Fish  Fry.  Mauri put a lot of care and dedication into  his work. After graduating from Purdue, he returned to the family farm, but he soon found  he was better suited spending his time with  people rather than with plants and animals. In  1961, he founded the Pioneer Village at the  Indiana State Fair to preserve and display the  history of Indiana agriculture. Mauri held court  there each summer, visiting with his ever-expanding legion of friends acquired through his  lifetime commitment  to Purdue and  to agriculture. He had a deep love for the Indiana  State Fair and only missed attending while  serving in the Navy during World War II.  I was first introduced to Mauri when I served  as  Indiana ’s Secretary of State. He made  it  clear to me, in the way only he could do, the  importance of farming and agriculture community to the past, present and future of Indiana.  Even today, my family, and especially my two  young sons, enjoys the fruit of his labor each  August when we visit the Pioneer Village at  the best State Fair in the nation. As a member  of Congress, I continue to keep our past conversations in mind when voting on agriculture  issues.  Mauri leaves June, his beloved wife of 68  years,  two children,  three grandchildren and  five great grandchildren to carry on his legacy  of service  to  fellow Hoosiers.  I believe  this  world is a better place because of his compassionate service  to our community, state and  nation. Rest in peace, Mauri. He will not be  forgotten.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE  MICHIGAN STATE POLICE  HON. JACK BERGMAN  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 8, 2017  ",2017

136,House,115,-0.444,3,2017-03-15,Mr. LOWENTHAL.," Mr.  Speaker,  today I rise to stress the importance of  maintaining Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,  commonly known as  DACA.  DACA recipients were brought here  to the United States as children, and in  most cases America is the only home  they have ever known. They want to  contribute to our economy, to our society, and our country; and they will, unless we are  foolish enough  to  stop  them.  Taking any step against DACA would  not  only hurt DACA  recipients,  it  would hurt the United States. Let’s  protect  these  promising  youth  and  keep  this program  intact while we  work out a humane path to citizenship.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE  of Texas).

140,House,115,0.545,17,2017-03-15,Mr. FERGUSON.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank my colleague from New York for  her very candid remarks. As you can  see, she touched on many important  issues—the unfairness of the system  that we have now, but also the importance of protecting our Medicaid safety  net.  What we have seen under the Affordable Care Act is that we have seen our  safety nets eroded. We are diverting resources away from the people that need  them the most—the poor, the elderly,  the blind, the disabled, children, and  pregnant women—and we are pushing  those resources to able-bodied men and  women who do have  the ability  to  work.  It is important to recognize that our  legislation is probably the largest entitlement reform program in a generation. Our  legislation  puts Medicaid  back on a budget for the first time in  history.  It provides  enhanced  flexibility to the States to allow them to  design effective and financially sound  programs to meet their population’s  unique needs.  Our plan also ensures that Medicaid  prioritizes care for the most vulnerable, who  it was originally  intended  for. We must do this because there are  so many Americans,  unfortunately,  that have to depend on this safety net  for their health care.  I understand this. In my hometown,  in my dental practice, I treated patients who relied on Medicaid for their  healthcare coverage. It was an honor to  take care of them and to have very real  discussions  about  their  healthcare  needs.  I understand  this vulnerable  population because they were a vital  part of my practice, and it was truly  my pleasure to take care of them. I understand  the  unique  circumstances  that cause many of these individuals to  be on Medicaid and to need this valuable safety net.  But we have to have an honest conversation about that. We have to be  able to provide that safety net. And as  we put more and more able-bodied men  and women without children on that  safety net,  it  is diverting resources  away from those that need it the most.  That is not right and that is not the  American way. We are fighting to protect  and  strengthen  this  Nation’s  healthcare safety net.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL). Dr. Marshall knows  firsthand  about health  care. He was a practicing OB/GYN, a  board chairman of a hospital, and he  has served our Nation in the United  States Army.  ",2017
141,House,115,0.534,17,2017-03-15,Mr. MARSHALL.," Mr. Speaker, I am  so proud to stand shoulder to shoulder  with people  like my  colleague, Dr.  DREWFERGUSON, from Georgia.  I am so proud to stand tonight with  the President of the United States. I  know that tonight Mr. Trump is speaking loudly on behalf of our healthcare  bill. Mr. Trump is ready to take the  fight on with us who feel like we need  to move this health care forward.  I am not sure how many of you grew  up without power steering in your vehicles, but if you know anything about  the lack of power steering—and I think  back to the tractors I drove growing  up, and that tractor, you could not  turn that wheel until you started the  tractor moving—or if you had a Ford  truck or a Dodge truck or a Chevy  truck and it didn’t have power steering, you couldn’t turn that truck until  it started moving.  Mr. Speaker, it is time to get this  bill moving. We have to move health  care forward. I am so tired of the rhetoric of repeal and replace. I am telling  you, my constituents sent me here to  fix health care. Forget the political  rhetoric. I am ready to fix health care.  I am ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with Republicans, with Democrats,  with people down the aisle, across the  aisle, and with our President to get  this healthcare bill passed.  Unfortunately,  ObamaCare  has  failed. When this first came about, I  was so excited. I was hoping that this  would be a healthcare bill that would  work. But, unfortunately,  it  is true  that this healthcare bill is dying very  quickly.  One-third  of  counties  across  this  country no longer have a provider to  take care of the exchange. My own  State of Kansas is down to one provider. Today,  even more  insurance  companies are bailing. This bill  is  dying. Doing nothing is simply not an  option, Mr. Speaker.  b2045  As I visited with thousands of patients over the last several years and  thousands of my  constituents,  they  said there are several things that they  thought were important that we save  from this healthcare bill, the Affordable Care Act, and I think we have  done just that:  Number one, we have protected the  preexisting issue conditions;  Number two, we are letting children  stay on their parents’ health insurance  until age 26;  Number three, we are ensuring that  women are not charged more for health  insurance  just  because  they  are  a  woman; and  Number  four,  we  protected  the  doughnut hole and kept it closed for  Medicare.  So I think we have saved the best  things of the Affordable Care Act.  So what  have we  removed? Mr.  Speaker, we removed almost $1 trillion  of taxes. This is the most significant  entitlement reform in our generation,  the most significant entitlement reform since the 1960s started Medicaid.  What can we expect out of this bill?  We expect premiums to decrease by  10 percent.

170,Senate,115,0.529,38,2017-03-15,Mr. BARRASSO.," Mr. President, joining my colleague here on the floor, I  agree with all of the comments the  Senator from Arizona has made. They  are interesting because as to the history of the State of the Senator from  Arizona and his family history, Judge  Gorsuch has a similar history, to the  point that his great-grandfather built a  hotel  in Wyoming  called  the Wolf  Hotel, in Saratoga, WY. I found a picture of that hotel from 1878, which was  12 years before Wyoming became a  State.  I got  that picture  from  the  American history museum at the University of Wyoming and got a copy of  the  picture  and  gave  it  to  Judge  Gorsuch.  In front of the hotel in 1878, there  was a stagecoach with six horses lined  up ahead of it. The Wolf Hotel was a  halfway stop on the stagecoach line between a couple of communities in Wyoming. They were about 40 miles apart.  So that  is the heritage  from which  Judge Gorsuch comes.  I think that western heritage is important. But I think that additionally  important is what the Senator referred  to—his  judicial  temperament,  being  such a mainstream member of the judiciary, and this general belief inherent  within him that the role of a judge is  to apply the law, not to legislate from  the bench.  We have seen so much  legislating  from the bench. I think you just don’t  get that if you take somebody from the  Rocky Mountain West who has this  view of  the Nation and an understanding of the rule of law and the Constitution.  So I think we are going to see that  when the Senate Judiciary Committee  begins its hearings next week on Judge  Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme  Court. I visited with him, reviewed his  writings, and then compared it to what  I  saw when  I visited with Justice  Scalia when he came to Wyoming. The  Senator from Arizona mentioned the  picture of the two working together,  fishing together.  I just think he is the right person to  continue that incredible legacy of Justice Scalia.  ",2017

173,,115,-0.428,73,2017-03-15,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, March 13  through  17,  2017  commemorates  Brain  Awareness Week, which presents an  important opportunity  to educate  lawmakers, students, and  the broader public about brain  science, and its many impacts and benefits.  This is critical when you consider that brain  disorders and diseases affect  the  lives of  nearly  100 million  Americans—from  Alzheimer ’s to ALS to mental illness.  Neurological  and  neurodegenerative  disorders are among the leading causes of disability  in  the United States and around  the  world—greater than heart disease and cancer  put together. As society ages, this number will  increase exponentially as will the cost to the  healthcare system and to the economy. Yet,  the underlying causes of most neurological  diseases remain unknown.  Neuroscience is the next great frontier. Research and work being done in this field needs  to be front and center in both the private world  and Congress.  The bipartisan Congressional Neuroscience  Caucus’ mission is to build awareness of the  intrinsic  role brain  research plays  in understanding ourselves and our society. As  the  Co-Founder and Co-Chair, I am committed to  working on these important issues and hope  my colleagues will join our efforts as members  of the Congressional Neuroscience Caucus.  SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS  Title  IV  of Senate Resolution  4,  agreed to by the Senate of February 4,  1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized schedule of all  meetings and hearings of Senate committees, subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference.  This title requires all such committees  to notify the Office of the Senate Daily  Digest—designated by the Rules Committee—of the time, place and purpose  of the meetings, when scheduled and  any cancellations or changes  in the  meetings as they occur.  As  an  additional  procedure  along  with the computerization of this information, the Office of the Senate Daily  Digest will prepare this information for  printing in the Extensions of Remarks  section of the CONGRESSIONALRECORD  on Monday and Wednesday of each  week.

174,House,115,-0.491,3,2017-03-23,Ms. PELOSI.," I  have told Mr. HOYER in a direct dialogue that we had that I would do my  best to make sure that we answer the  questions that would be necessary. The  gentleman, Mr. MCGOVERN, who very  MCGOVERN.  ably represents his party, understood  that I did not have all the answers that  I needed.  So we are here today with the opportunity to say we are going to do a  same-day rule. We are going to try to  pass this rule. We are going to try to  explain what we are doing. We are  going to allow my team, our Republican Conference, to get back together  today because they, too, want to know  what is the final deal.  That is what my conference is doing  right now. They are in this building,  several hundred Members of Congress,  talking, debating, understanding,  listening, compromising, yes, on a way  that we can approach a chance  to  change what we see as one of the most  devastating pieces of legislation to the  economy,  to  the healthcare  system,  and, quite honestly, to the standing of  America as the greatest country in the  world. We  think we have  to make  changes.  But today we are here right now to  say that we don’t have all those answers. A complete agreement was not  available by the time I chose to end the  matter last night in the Rules Committee. So rather than staying up all  night, we are here today. We will be  back here today. This is not the debate  about  the bill. More  information  is  needed. An agreement is needed from  my party. And when we reach that  agreement, I will then come back.  But make no mistake about it, Mr.  Speaker, my party  intends to bring  forth an agreed-to bill that we will be  able to show to the American people,  and we will own it. We are very capable  of saying that we believe that market  forces, we believe that free right of individuals, we believe that free physicians  and  opportunities  exist  and  abound, and we will bring that to the  floor, and we will openly debate it.  Much is being said about a Congressional Budget Office report that has  caused much  fear. Unrightly? No,  I  can’t say that. But it is certainly explainable.  Mr. Speaker, I will start right now.  The bottom line is that there are some  30 million people who are uninsured in  the United States of America, 30 million people who did not find a home or  chose not to take a government-provided available system that is called  the Affordable Care Act. Even more  people included within that are paying  a penalty of several thousand dollars  rather than taking that healthcare system, that availability. So we believe  the right thing to do is not to force  anybody, not to have mandates, not to  penalize people, but, rather, to make  available to them opportunities where  it is their decision about what they  would do.  The corresponding facts of the case  are  real  simple. The Congressional  Budget Office said: Fine, if you don’t  force people to do it, then some 24 million people won’t do it within the next  7 years.

175,Senate,115,-0.328,24,2017-03-23,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to talk about a bill that I have  introduced.  I have  introduced  it  in  prior Congresses. But I think it is particularly important in this Congress. It  is  the  End  Racial  and  Religious  Profiling Act of 2017. I am proud to  have many of my colleagues as cosponsors of this legislation, including Senators BALDWIN, BLUMENTHAL, BOOKER,  BROWN, CANTWELL, COONS, DUCKWORTH,  DURBIN, FEINSTEIN, FRANKEN, GILLIBRAND,  HARRIS,  HEINRICH,  HIRONO,  KAINE, MARKEY, MENENDEZ, MERKLEY,  MURPHY, MURRAY, SANDERS, STABENOW,  UDALL, VANHOLLEN, WYDEN, and WARREN.  In the House of Representatives, the  bill’s principal sponsor is Congressman  CONYERS. It is needed now more than  ever before. I say that for many reasons, one of which is that we have seen  a large increase in hate crimes in our  community. Yesterday I was on the  phone with  a  father  from Harford  County, MD, whose son was the victim  of a hate episode related to that person’s religion and ethnic background.  We have seen in our community a  large increase in hate crimes against  the Jewish  community. There have  been a lot of bomb threats that have  been called into Jewish schools and to  the Jewish Community Centers. We  have  seen physical attacks and  the  desecration of cemeteries. So the minority community feels threatened.  That has been escalating as a result  of the actions of our President and his  Executive orders. The Executive orders—he has issued two now that are  dealing with the  immigrant community—do raise the temperature in our  community and  the concern  in our  community  that  people  are  being  threatened because of their religion,  threatened  because  of  their  ethnic  background,  threatened  because  of  their status as part of an immigrant  community.  All of that has added to the concerns  in America today. The legislation that  I have introduced would make it illegal  for discriminatory policing—for police  to use as an indicator for their actions  a person’s  race,  religion, or  ethnic  background.  Discriminatory policing  is against  our values. Quite  frankly,  it  is not  what we stand for as a nation. We don’t  target people because of their religion.  I will always remember that shortly  after the Trayvon episode, I met with  community  activists  in  Baltimore.  Many told me examples of how they  were with their parents when the police stopped them randomly, for no reason at all, but solely because of the  person’s race and how communities felt  threatened as a result of it.  It is not what we stand for as a nation. It turns communities against police, rather than working with the police. It is a waste of resources. It does  not work. It can be deadly as we have  seen in too many communities in our  Nation. In my own city of Baltimore,  we had the episode concerning Freddie  Gray, who died in police custody.  I went to Sandtown, where Freddie  Gray came from, shortly after that episode and met with the community, and  I heard comparable stories about how  good  community  activists  felt  like  they were betraying their community  if they worked with the local police,  because they said the system was just  stacked against their community and  their race.  So let me, if I might, quote from the  Department of Justice report on the  Freddie Gray case. Our congressional  delegation asked for a pattern or practice investigation. In part of that investigation, they came out with this  finding:  There is overwhelming statistical evidence  of racial disparities in Baltimore Police Department’s (BPD’s) stops, searches, and arrests.  . . . BPD officers  subject African-  Americans to a disproportionate number of  pedestrian and vehicles stops on Baltimore  streets and search African-Americans disproportionately during these stops. . . . The  policing practices that cause the racial disparities in BPD’s stops, searches, and arrests, along with evidence suggesting intentional discrimination against African-Americans, undermine the community trust that is  central to effective policing. . . . Indeed, we  heard from many community members who  were reluctant to engage with the officers  because of their belief that the Department  treats  African-Americans  unfairly.  . . .  These concerns were acknowledged by BPD  leadership and officers, who explained that  lack of trust—particularly in many of Baltimore’s African-American communities—inhibit officers’ efforts to build relationships  that are a key component of effective policing. . . .  I say that because racial profiling—  discriminatory profiling—is ineffective  and is counterproductive. It actually  makes communities less safe. I have  the honor of being the Special Representative for Anti-Semitism, Racism  and Intolerance in the OSCE, or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly.  In that capacity, I have  identified  four major areas of concern within the  57 countries that represent the OSCE,  including the United States. Those priorities  are  discriminatory  actions  against the Muslim community, the  rise of anti-Semitism, the concerns of  discrimination against the immigrant  community, and also the concerns on  discriminatory policing.  Discriminatory policing is very much  engaged in our concerns about the rise  of anti-Semitism, racism, and intolerance. Now, I want to make it clear: The  overwhelming majority of people  in  law enforcement are good people. They  are professionals. They are trying to do  their  job. They  are  against  racial  profiling. But we need to protect the  professionalism within the police departments and establish a national policy against racial profiling.  My legislation is supported by over  1,150 organizations. Let me just, if I  might, mention a couple of those, by  quoting their leaders. Wade Henderson,  president and CEO of the Leadership  Conference on Civil and Human Rights,  who supports this legislation said:  Discriminatory profiling is wrong, fosters  distrust between law enforcement and the  communities they serve and puts public safety at risk. Racial profiling infringes on civil  liberties and squanders resources that should  be used instead to catch criminal perpetrators. We urge his colleagues to join Senator  Cardin and stand for effective law enforcement by supporting [this legislation].  Jennifer Bellamy, the ACLU legislative counsel, who also supports this  legislation, said:  For  centuries,  discriminatory  profiling  practices have harmed communities of color.  It is not enough to be ‘against’ racism and  racial profiling, we need national leaders to  end discriminatory practices. We know that  profiling of any kind is ineffective and diverts law enforcement’s time, money, and  energy away from actual threats. The time  is now to end racial profiling once and for  all.  Then, lastly, Hilary Shelton, the director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and the senior vice president for  policy and advocacy said:  This important legislation takes concrete  steps to put an end to the insidious practice  of profiling individuals by federal, state and  local levels based on physical attributes or  an individual’s religion. It is difficult for our  faith in the American criminal justice system not to be challenged when we cannot  walk down the street, drive down an interstate, go through an airport, or even enter  into our own homes without being stopped  merely because of the color of our skin, who  we are perceived to be, or what we choose to  wear.  I could mention many of the other  groups and many other quotes. This  legislation is pretty straightforward. It  establishes a national uniform standard against discriminatory profiling at  all levels of law enforcement—State,  local Federal.  For example, it tells us that we can’t  use as descriptors a person’s race. We  can do so when we are using it to describe a particular crime, but not as a  predictor of  future  crimes. Let me  close by quoting from Ron Davis, the  former police chief of East Palo Alto,  CA, where he said:  [T]here exists no national, standardized  definition for racial profiling that prohibits  all uses of race, national origin, and religion,  except when  describing  a  person.  Consequently, many state and local policies define racial profiling as using race as the  ‘‘sole’’ basis for a stop or any police action.  This definition is misleading in that it suggests using race as a factor for anything  other than a description is justified, which it  is not. Simply put, race is a descriptor not a  predictor. To use race along with other salient descriptors when describing someone  who just committed a crime is appropriate.  That is what this legislation does. It  establishes a national definition.  It  prohibits it in any form of policing in  our country. It provides for training. It  provides Federal grants for best practices. It requires the Attorney General  VerDate Sep 11 2014  01:40 Mar 24, 2017 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G23MR6.003 S23MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 2 B H P B C B K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2017
176,Senate,115,-0.374,38,2017-03-23,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, Senate  will soon vote on the nomination of  David Friedman to be U.S. Ambassador  to Israel.  I oppose his nomination.  Mr. Friedman has made a career of  derogatory  and  inflammatory  statements about U.S. policy in the Middle  East, about former U.S. officials, about  the Palestinians, and about American  Jews who have views that differ from  his own.  He has written falsely that President  Obama and Secretary Kerry engaged in  ‘‘blatant anti-Semitism,’’ that liberal  American Jews are  ‘‘far worse than  kapos,’’ and that they ‘‘suffer a cognitive disconnect in identifying good  and evil.’’  He has accused the State Department  of a  ‘‘hundred-year history of anti-  Semitism,’’  apparently  because  diplomats in both Republican and Democratic administrations have not always  agreed with the actions of some of  Israel’s leaders.  Those comments alone should disqualify him for this sensitive position.  Mr. Friedman has also raised millions of dollars for Israeli settlers and  bragged about leading the effort to remove the two-state solution from the  Republican Party’s platform.  Regarding the two-state solution, he  wrote that it is ‘‘an illusion that serves  the worst intentions of both the United  States  and  the Palestinian Arabs.’’  That renunciation of longstanding U.S.  policy should also, by itself, disqualify  him  for  the  job of Ambassador  to  Israel.  Mr. Friedman is certainly entitled to  his own views as a private citizen, even  if they are offensive and counter to  U.S. interests and values. But can anyone honestly say that this nominee is  qualified or  suited  to  represent  the  American people in Israel?  Five  former U.S. Ambassadors  to  Israel, who served under Republican  and Democratic Presidents going back  as far as President Reagan, say the answer is no.  An alliance as longstanding as ours  with  Israel, which has  far-reaching  consequences  for  the  entire Middle  East, requires effective daily management by an experienced diplomat who  not only has knowledge of the region  but the temperament and appreciation  of our short- and long-term interests.  I do not see how anyone could conclude that Mr. Friedman possesses the  requisite temperament or objectivity.  The record is devoid of evidence that  he appreciates the critical distinction  between the  interests of the United  States and the parochial interests of an  extreme constituency in Israel that he  has  fiercely advocated  for over  the  course of his long career.  Mr. Friedman’s confirmation hearing  provided him the opportunity to assuage concerns about his divisiveness,  including  the many disparaging  remarks he has made and his close identification with and support  for, the  Israeli settler movement.  During the hearing, he disavowed his  past undiplomatic statements, saying  he was speaking as a private citizen.  Mr.  Friedman’s  remarkable  confirmation conversion falls far short of  convincing evidence that changing his  title to ‘‘Ambassador’’ will cause him  to divorce his life’s work and objectively serve the interests of the American people.  We all want what  is best  for the  American people.

177,,115,-0.329,66,2017-03-23,Mr. KEATING.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of Frederic B. Presbrey on the occasion of his retirement from the Housing Assistance Corporation  in Hyannis, Massachusetts.  Frederic, or Rick as he is known to friends,  family, and colleagues, founded the Housing  Assistance Corporation in December of 1974  with the intention of finding and securing housing for those who need it most. Rick’s advocacy has not only helped to create five shelter  programs and 484 units of affordable housing  across the Cape and Islands but led to the establishment of  the Consumer Education Department. This department has been  instrumental  in educating  first-time home buyers  since 1990.  In addition, Rick  created  the  Housing Consumer Education Center to give  Massachusetts  residents access  to housing  counselors  for  vital  information on buying,  owning, developing or renting real estate. Further, Rick’s astute leadership has led to the  creation of over thirty programs and services  aimed not only at helping  individuals  find  housing but also to maintain secure, safe, and  stable homes.  Rick has shaped how we on Cape Cod and  in the Commonwealth view housing needs. He  has personally worked with state,  local, and  federal officials and other community stakeholders  to help  resolve numerous housing  concerns and has served as an invaluable resource  for policymakers and home seekers  alike.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Frederic  B. Presbrey for his service and achievements  on this occasion. I ask that my colleagues join  me  in wishing him a happy  retirement and  many more years of health and happiness.  f  DOWN RIVER EQUIPMENT  HON.

178,,115,0.565,66,2017-03-23,Mr. KELLY of Mississippi.," Mr. Speaker,  today I rise in memory of Army Sergeant First  Class (SFC) Christopher Lee Robinson who  paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our  nation on March 25, 2006, during Operation  Enduring  Freedom.  SFC  Robinson  was  wounded during an ambush in Helmond Province, Afghanistan. Master Sergeant Reese  Robbins, a Pelahatchie resident, who was injured during the attack, accompanied Robinson ’s body back  to  the United States. SFC  Robinson was  the  first Mississippi National  Guard soldier to die in Afghanistan.  SFC Robinson was assigned  to  the 27th  Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group, Mississippi Army National Guard, Jackson, Mississippi. SFC Robinson, a Madison County  resident, joined the Army after graduating from  Madison-Ridgeland High School in 1987. He  followed in the footsteps of his father, George  Robinson, who also served in the Army. SFC  Robinson was previously deployed with his  Special Forces unit  to Haiti, Honduras and  Panama among other countries.  ‘We once again are painfully reminded of  the high cost of freedom,’ ’ Major General (ret.)  Harold Cross, Adjutant General of  the Mississippi National Guard, said. ‘ ‘Chris was one  of our state’s and nation’s finest, and he will  be greatly missed.’ ’  He is survived by his wife, Tamara Robbins  and their children Savanah and Patrick. ‘ ‘He  just  loved everything about military service,’ ’  Tamara said. ‘ ‘He wanted to do something for  our  country. There was never a question  about it. Our children are so proud of him.’ ’  SFC Robinson devoted his life to the safety  of our nation. He will always be remembered  for his service and deep love for family and  friends.  ‘Chris consistently displayed bravery by volunteering  for  hard  deployments  and  dangerous missions,’ ’ said Sergeant Major (ret.)  Mike Patterson, who served with SFC Robinson. ‘ ‘Chris had the ability to handle combat in  a very deliberate way, yet  remain compassionate  for people and  the unintended consequences of war thrust upon human beings.’ ’  The first sentence in The Creed of the Noncommissioned Officer, ‘ ‘No one is more professional than I ’ ’, describes the level of competence and professionalism that Chris maintained throughout his life in and out of uniform.  As a Special Forces, Green Beret soldier,  SFC Robinson was truly the best of the best.

179,,115,-0.317,1,2017-04-04,Mr. QUIGLEY.," Mr. Speaker, there  has been a lot going on around here  lately. We have been conducting investigations, holding hearings, and some  of us have even tried and failed to fundamentally change the way we provide  health care in this country.  It has been easy to get distracted by  the dozens of different headlines and  breaking news  stories we  see  each  week. But no matter what else is going  on here in Washington, one thing continues unabated: each day, the United  States,  like every other country on  Earth, continues to release tons and  tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and now we are starting to see  the effects.  Over the  last couple of years, the  U.S. has joined 20 other countries from  around the world in growing its economy while reducing its annual emissions into the atmosphere. This is not  a small feat, and decoupling emissions  from growth is the first step toward  the substantive action needed to address the growing climate crisis. But I  find this concept of reducing emissions  can sometimes be a little misleading.  In the last few years, the U.S. has reduced the rate that it emits greenhouse  gases. But even if we are doing it more  slowly, we are still emitting harmful  pollution into our air.  Imagine, Mr. Speaker, standing at  the edge of an empty swimming pool  with a garden hose. For a while, water  was spewing out of that hose at a torrent; and each year, the volume got  greater and greater. Now, the water is  still running, but we have begun to  turn the speed down. However, even if  we manage to slow the rate of water  going in, the pool still has more water  than when we started and is still filling  up.  Our atmosphere  is  that pool. For  nearly 100 years, it has been filling up  with greenhouse gases. And they don’t  just go away when the calendar flips.  Reducing the annual emissions is vital,  but we can’t lose track of all the gases  that have been accumulated year after  year.  If we are going to hit the  international  goal  of  limiting  climate  warming to 2 degrees Celsius, we need  to start acting now. Yet, this august  body has been behind the curve on this  issue for years.  Our colleagues seem content to ignore the climate crisis, to hold hearings  with  discredited,  crank  pseudoscientists bought and paid for by  corporate  interests, or  to deny  the  value of scientific thinking altogether,  an approach that is all too familiar  given  the  post-research,  post-intelligence, post-truth mindset  that we  have  seen  from  this administration.  They have adopted a ‘‘hear no evil, see  no evil, speak no evil’’ approach to climate change, hoping they can ignore it  until it goes away. Sadly, that is not  the way the world works.  We  can’t unfill  the pool by pretending there is no such thing as water.  This form of denial has been evolving  over time. First, we heard that there  was no way that climate is changing at  all.  Now that the changes in the atmosphere are beyond doubt, we are starting to hear that climate is changing  but there is nothing we can do about it.  In addition to being flat out false, that  type of thinking is unbecoming of a nation that put the  first man on the  Moon, pioneered  instantaneous communication, and has led the world in  the fight against countless deadly diseases.  Last month, we heard the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency question the very fundamentals of atmospheric science, a particularly dismaying thing from the man  charged with leading the fight against  climate change. This type of willful  scientific  ignorance has serious consequences. It will cost lives.  Children will be exposed to harmful,  asthma-inducing pollution because we  didn’t act fast enough to clean our air.  They will die because crops that could  be counted on for generations will no  longer grow. They will be forced from  their homes because melting polar ice  is driving sea levels higher and higher.  We cannot deny these impacts. We  cannot continue to hear no evil and see  no evil when these changes are happening all around us, resulting in devastating consequences that affect every  aspect of our life.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

181,House,115,-0.341,8,2017-04-04,Mr. PRICE of North Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the University of North Carolina at  Chapel Hill’s men’s basketball team for  winning the 2017 NCAA Division I National Championship, in the face of a  spirited challenge from Gonzaga University.  As a proud alumnus of UNC-Chapel  Hill, the Nation’s first public university, I was delighted to cheer on the entire team—players, coaches, and staff—  during their outstanding performance  yesterday in the Nation’s most competitive and most popular collegiate  athletic tournament.  The Tar Heels have now played in a  record 20 NCAA Final Four games, the  most of all time, and last night marked  their sixth NCAA National Championship  and  seventh  overall National  Championship. The years  1957,  1982,  1993, 2005, and 2009 are seared in the  minds of North Carolina basketball  fans, and I know I speak for our entire  State when I say how delighted we are  to add 2017 to that list!  The teamwork, camaraderie, and determination of this year’s team were  evident throughout the entire season  as they struggled to overcome their  heartbreaking defeat in the last seconds of the 2016 National Championship  game. While their tournament finishes  may have been a little closer than we  wished, the team managed six wins  against a  formidable  slate of opponents.

182,House,115,-0.399,36,2017-04-04,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  H.R.  1343,  Encouraging  Employee  Ownership Act of 2017, eliminates important disclosures that private companies must provide to their employees  in the event they are compensating  those employees with stock.  This bill would limit transparency. If  companies want to pay their employees  in stocks, they should have to simply  disclose to their workers the risks associated with those investments.  Currently,  private  companies  can  provide up to $5 million worth of stock  compensation annually to their employees and are not required to provide  any  financial  disclosure.  This  bill  would lift that cap to $10 million.  If companies choose to provide an  employee with  stock  compensation,  they should be required to inform that  employee of the appropriate financial  information, benefits, and the risks associated with that investment, including 2 years of company financial statements. All of this information is commonly available to typical investors.  Let’s be clear: this stock  is compensation  for their work. Employees  deserve  to understand  the value of  their compensation prior to accepting  it. They deserve the same protections  that other investors would get.  I  agree  with  Professor  Mercer  Bullard, who is a professor of law at  the University of Mississippi School of  Law, who testified before the Capital  Markets, Securities, and Investments  Subcommittee  voicing  his  concerns  about the bill. In his testimony, he  noted that to take advantage of the  terms of  this  legislation, an  issuer  would have to have at least $34 million  in total assets. Surely, such minimal  disclosures are not too burdensome for  those sort of companies.  I do also understand that some proponents of this legislation argue that  such an exemption is needed because  disclosure of company information to  employees runs the risk that confidential  information could be  leaked to  competitors.  Employees with access to such information could simply be subject to nondisclosure agreements, which are typical today. Indeed, nondisclosure agreements are a simple solution that protects the company, but does not deny  the employees the right to understand  the worth of, or the risks associated  with, the compensation they are receiving. Unfortunately, this bill would  limit that transparency and those protections.  Mr. Speaker, I oppose this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.  ",2017

I believe that employee ownership  opportunities should be made widely  available to all employees of a company, from the boardroom to the shop  floor.  As the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  POLIS) stated, this legislation is an important  step  forward  to  increasing  ownership opportunities and gives companies more flexibility to make those  opportunities available.  We should understand how this legislation would help increase participation for employees at all key levels. A  study will help us understand what we  can do in the future to incentivize employee  ownership  and  increase  employee ownership participation.  If the gentleman would withdraw his  amendment, I would like to work with  him in requesting GAO to carry out  this study.  ",2017

So  I  think  it’s a cost benefit ratio. The  more that we put into the State Department’s diplomacy, hopefully  the  less we have to put into a military  budget as we deal with the outcome of  an apparent American withdrawal from  the international scene.’’  That  is  from Secretary of Defense  Mattis. I couldn’t agree with him more.  Now,  I  believe  that  development  helps to lift countries and communities  up today so they can become strong  partners on the global stage tomorrow.  A lot of us think we have a moral obligation to help cure disease, improve  access  to  education,  and  advance  human rights. But even if it were not  the right thing to do, it would be the  smart thing to do because those efforts  lead to greater stability, more responsive governments, and stronger rule of  law—populations that share our values  and priorities. Poverty and lack of opportunity, on the other hand, provide  fertile ground for those who mean us  harm.  All these efforts, by the way, cost  cents on the dollar compared to military engagement. People think international affairs and foreign aid are a  massive chunk of the Federal budget,  but the chart right over here next to  me shows how it actually stacks up: 1.4  percent. And we make that sliver of  the pie even smaller. It will come back  on us in spades. 1.4 percent of our Federal budget goes to all these programs.

I think it is crazy  that we are considering confirming a  lifetime Trump nominee to the Supreme Court at a moment when the  President’s  campaign  is  under  the  cloud of an active, ongoing FBI counterintelligence  investigation  that  could result  in  indictments and appeals, that will go all the way to the  Supreme Court, so that Trump’s nominee  could be  the deciding vote on  whether Trump or his supporters broke  the law and will be held accountable.  That is nuts. I believe we should tap  the brakes on any nominee until this  investigation is concluded.  But even if none of that were happening, I would still oppose the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch. My objection  is  based  on  Judge Gorsuch’s  record, which I have reviewed in detail.  Judge Gorsuch’s nomination is the latest step in a long political campaign by  rightwing groups and their billionaire  backers to capture our courts.  Over the last 30 years, as the rich  have gotten richer and working families have struggled to make ends meet,  the scales of justice have been weighted further and further in favor of the  wealthy and the powerful. Those powerful interests have invested vast sums  of money into reshaping the judiciary,  and their investment has paid off in  spades. Recent Supreme Court decisions have made it easier for corporate  giants that cheat their customers to  avoid responsibility. Recent Supreme  Court decisions have  let those same  corporations and their billionaire investors  spend unlimited amounts of  money to influence elections and manipulate the political process. Recent  Supreme Court decisions have made it  easier for businesses to abuse and discriminate against their workers.  Giant  corporations  and  rightwing  groups have notched a lot of big wins  in the Supreme Court lately, but they  know  their  luck  depends  on  two  things—first, stacking the courts with  their allies, and second, stopping the  confirmation of judges who don’t sufficiently cater to their interests. That is  part of the reason they launched an all-  out attack on fair-minded mainstream  judges—judges like Merrick Garland, a  thoughtful,  intelligent,  fair  judge to  fill the open vacancy on the Supreme  Court.  These very same corporate and rightwing groups handed Donald Trump a  list of acceptable people to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, and as a Presidential candidate, he promised to pick  a Justice from their list. Who made it  onto that rightwing list? People who,  unlike Judge Garland, displayed a sufficient allegiance to their corporate  and rightwing interests. Judge Gorsuch  was on that list, and his nomination is  their reward.  Even before he became a Federal  judge, Judge Gorsuch fully embraced  rightwing, pro-corporate views. He argued that it should be harder, not easier, for shareholders who got cheated to  bring fraud cases to court.  On the bench, Judge Gorsuch’s extreme views meant giant corporations  could run over their workers. In Hobby  Lobby, when he had to choose between  the  rights  of  corporations  and  the  rights of women, Judge Gorsuch chose  corporations. In consumer protection  cases, when he had to choose between  the  rights  of  corporations  and  the  rights of the consumers they cheated,  Judge Gorsuch chose corporations. In  discrimination cases, when he had to  choose between the rights of corporations and the rights of employees who  had been discriminated against, Judge  Gorsuch chose corporations. Time after  time, in case after case, Judge Gorsuch  showed a remarkable talent  for creatively interpreting the law in ways  that benefited large corporations and  that  harmed  working  Americans,  women, children, and consumers.  When it comes to the rules that prevent giant corporations from polluting  our air and our water, from poisoning  our food, from cheating hard-working  families, Judge Gorsuch believes that  it should be easier, not harder,  for  judges to overturn those rules—a view  that is even more extreme than that of  the late Justice Scalia.  Republicans  assert  that  Judge  Gorsuch is a fair, mainstream judge,  but  rightwing  groups  and  their  wealthy,  anonymous  funders  picked  him for one reason: because they know  he will be their ally. And that is not  how our court system is supposed to  work. Judges should be neutral arbiters, dispensing  equal  justice under  law. They should not be people handpicked by wealthy insiders and giant  corporations.  For the working families struggling  to make ends meet,  for people desperately in need of healthcare, for everyone fighting for their right to vote,  for disabled students fighting for access to a quality education, for anyone  who cares about our  justice system,  there is only one question that should  guide us in evaluating a nominee to sit  on any court: whether that person will  defend equal justice for every single  one of us. Judge Gorsuch’s record answers that question with a loud no.  Republicans have a choice. They can  tell President Trump to send a new  nominee—a mainstream nominee who  can earn broad support—or they can  jam through this nominee. If they do  jam through Judge Gorsuch, the Republicans will own the Gorsuch Court  and every extreme 5-to-4 decision that  comes out of it. Republicans will own  every attack on a woman’s right to  choose, on voting rights, on LGBTQ  rights, on secret spending in our political system, and on freedom of speech  and religion. Republicans will be responsible for every 5-to-4 decision that  VerDate Sep 11 2014  02:42 Apr 05, 2017 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G04AP6.029 S04APPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P V 5 K S D n o r e t t o l         ",2017

193,,115,0.56,148,2017-04-04,Mr. LONG.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Springfield News-Leader and  its  dedication to 150 years of excellence in journalism.  The Springfield News-Leader was first published on April 4, 1867, and has been a vital  part of  the Springfield, Missouri, community  ever since. After 150 years,  the Springfield  News-Leader has reached almost 55,000 consecutive days of print, for both morning and  evening newspapers.  In January of 1927, after several changes in  name and ownership, the newspaper was officially known as  the Springfield Daily News.  120 years later, in 1987, after printing both a  morning and evening edition,  the afternoon  edition of  the newspaper was discontinued  and consolidated with the morning edition to  become the Springfield News-Leader.  Today, the Springfield News-Leader is combined with a number of other print publications, websites and digital marketing services  as part of the News-Leader Media Group. This  group is the largest multi-media marketing solutions company in southwest Missouri, serving  the  local and regional business community.  For 150 years, the Springfield News-Leader  has caught the moments that have shaped our  nation, Missouri and Missouri’s 7th Congressional District. I am confident that in the next  150 years  the Springfield News-Leader will  continue to be the newspaper that keeps the  people of the 7th District informed and up-to-  date. Congratulations to the Springfield News-  Leader.  f  RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND  SERVICE OF MARK V. DENNIS  HON. CHARLIE CRIST  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 4, 2017  ",2017
194,,115,-0.205,148,2017-04-04,Mr. CRIST.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor  the  life and  service of  fallen Navy  Hospitalman, 3rd Class, Mr. Mark V. Dennis.  Mr. Dennis was born on September 21,  1946,  to  Charles  and  Vera  Dennis  of  Miamisburg, Ohio, where he grew up with his  brother and two sisters. He went on to serve  in the United States Navy in a Marine unit as  a medical corpsman during the Vietnam War.  A man of strong faith, Mr. Dennis also served  as  acting  chaplain  for  his  unit,  and  had  dreams of being a missionary after completing  his service.  Sadly, those dreams would not be realized.  He was killed  in action when his helicopter  crashed after taking enemy fire in South Vietnam in the summer of 1966. At such a young  age, 19 years, Mr. Dennis made the ultimate  sacrifice in service to his country.  In 1970, a photograph in Newsweek magazine showed a Prisoner of War with an uncanny  resemblance  to Mark. Devastated by  the loss, and plagued by nagging doubt, his  family, led by his brother Jerry, began a quest  for answers as to what happened to Mark.  Last August,  the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency released a report determining  through DNA testing that the remains from the  deadly helicopter crash are those of Mr. Dennis. Thanks to the Dennis family’s determination, and work by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, we now know conclusively  that Mr. Dennis died while serving and protecting his country.  Mr. Speaker,  the Dennis  family has been  through a lot over the years. I pray that they  will now have the closure they so deserve. Mr.  Dennis will soon be laid to rest alongside his  parents at the Garden Sanctuary Cemetery in  Seminole, Florida, with full military honors.  I am humbled to honor the life of this young  man, and all of our servicemen and women  who were taken from this Earth too soon. May  he, and his family, now finally find peace.

Led by Coach Matt Desrosiers, the Golden  Knights defeated the number one seeded Wisconsin Badgers  for  the championship  title.  This is the team’s second Division I title, with  the Golden Knights being the only team outside of the Western Conference to ever win  the championship.  Under  the  leadership  of  seniors Corie  Jacobson,  Jessica  Gillham,  Genevieve  Bannon, McKenzie Johnson and Carly Mercer,  the team was able to regroup from a rough  early season and achieve this impressive victory. Junior goaltender Shea Tiley was an instrumental part of  this victory, allowing zero  points against the strong Wisconsin offense.  In New York’s 21st District, we are incredibly proud of all of these women and their incredible achievements. I hope that their hard  work and dedication serve as an inspiration for  generations to come.

196,,115,-0.306,155,2017-04-04,Mr. CONNOLLY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my constituent Deputy Sheriff PFC  Kevin Davis  for being named Outstanding  Deputy Sheriff of the Year by the Rotary Club  of West Springfield. PFC Davis  joined  the  Sheriff’s Office in 2009 after retiring from the  U.S. Marine Corps as a gunnery sergeant.  PFC Davis works in the Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office Civil Enforcement Branch, where he  is responsible for the processing and service  of civil documents on behalf of the courts and  is assigned to West Springfield and Burke in  Fairfax County.  PFC Davis and  the other deputies have  spearheaded efforts, both on and off the job,  to help victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. This past summer they partnered  with 17 Starbucks stores  to collect  toiletries  and baby care items for Artemis House, Fairfax County’s only 24-hour domestic violence  shelter. PFC Davis volunteers for many other  Sheriff’s Office activities beyond his  regular  job assignment. He is a member of the award-  winning Honor Guard  team. He also participates in Project Lifesaver, which assists families and caregivers of individuals with autism  spectrum  disorders, Down  syndrome, Alzheimer ’s, and related conditions and disabilities. During National Night Out he visited several community gatherings in West Springfield  and Burke and made an especially positive  impression on young children and their families. Upon graduating from the Fairfax County  Criminal Justice Academy, he was elected  Class President by his peers and received the  Instructor’s Award for his outstanding leadership.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in congratulating PFC Davis and in thanking  him for his years of service to Fairfax County.  He has demonstrated exceptional dedication  to public safety and  the mission of  law enforcement, and for that, we owe him a special  debt of gratitude.  f  HONORING MRS. KATIE FRIAR  HON. BENNIE G.

197,,115,0.272,9,2017-04-12,Mrs. COMSTOCK.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to  recognize  a  boys’  basketball  team  from  Loudoun Valley High School,  in our Tenth  Congressional District, who recently won the  4A State Championship. Their dedication, hard  work, and perseverance, along with guidance  and direction of head coach, Chad Dawson  and  assistant  head  coach,  Josh Mallory,  helped earn  their school’s boys’ basketball  program its first state championship title.  The Loudoun Valley Vikings opened  the  state  tournament with an  impressive 83–61  win over the 2016 state champions, the Monacan Chiefs of Chesterfield, in the quarterfinals.  The Vikings  then prevailed over  the George  Washington  Eagles  of  Danville  in  the  semifinals. The game was initially close as the  Vikings were only leading by eight points at  the end of the first half, but they persevered  as their endurance led the Vikings to yet another victory. In the state championship game,  the Vikings  faced  the Eagles of Jamestown  City County who entered the game with a remarkable 27–3 record for the season. While  the Eagles were a formidable opponent and  should be applauded  for  their effort,  the Vikings handily won the game as the skills that  their coaches  instilled  in  them shined  from  start to finish. The Viking’s championship victory marked the conclusion of an impressive  30 –1 team record for the season. We are all  proud of these young men and their coaches.  Loudoun Valley High School’s basketball  team, their coaching and athletic training staff  as well  as School Athletic Director, Kris  Kelican, have made Loudoun County and Virginia ’s Tenth Congressional District proud.  Winning a state championship is an extraordinary achievement and it attests to the team’s  noteworthy athletic talent, laudable work ethic,  commitment to teamwork, tireless dedication,  and determination to succeed. I also want to  commend the Vikings’ excellent coaching staff,  as without  their mentorship  this would not  have been possible. The Loudoun Valley basketball program has certainly earned this distinct honor, and the leadership that sports instill and the sportsmanship these young men  have acquired in their athletic student careers  will valuably serve  them  in  their  future academic endeavors and dedication to athletics.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join  me in congratulating the Loudoun Valley Vikings on winning the 4A State Championship  and  representing Virginia’s Tenth Congressional District with such distinction. I am proud  to represent these students and wish them all  the best in their future endeavors.

198,Senate,115,0.585,13,2017-04-24,Mr. RUBIO.," Mr. President, as a part  of my office’s ‘‘Expression NOT Oppression’’ initiative, I come to the floor  today to highlight once again both a  good news story with regard to human  rights and a continuing challenge.  First let me begin by highlighting  the good news. Aya Hijazi, whom  I  have spoken about before on the floor,  is an American-Egyptian citizen whom  Egyptian officials had imprisoned on  trumped-up charges almost 3 years ago.  She was released, and she was able to  return home to the United States last  week. I am pleased that she was set  free, as are many of my colleagues in  the Senate who had been calling for the  Egyptian authorities to release her. I  know this was a topic of conversation  during Egyptian President Elsisi’s visit  to the United States 3 weeks ago.  I want to also take this moment to  thank the Trump administration  for  working to ensure her freedom. They  were instrumental—in fact, they were  key in this being possible. They made  it a priority in their private engagements with regard to President Elsisi.  Sadly, there are still many more political prisoners who remain jailed in  Egypt. We here in Congress as well as  the administration should continue to  raise these issues with the Egyptian  Government until all of them are released, regardless of their citizenship  status.  As the leader of the free world, the  United States must work to safeguard  the freedoms and liberties of all people.  We must speak frankly with our allies,  with our partners around the world,  and we must work with governments to  improve their human rights records.  It  is ultimately  in America’s national security interests to have stable  democracies that observe the impartial  rule of law and that respect the rights  of their people.  CHECHNYA  Mr. President, I would like to highlight the horrific reports on the pro-  Russian Chechen Government’s brutal  campaign against LGBT people and  others over the last several weeks.  Human Rights Watch  recently  reported that ‘‘law enforcement and security agency officials under control of  the ruthless head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, have rounded  up dozens of men on suspicion of being  gay, torturing and humiliating the victims.’’  There are reports that at least 100  men have been arrested. At least three  men have reportedly been killed since  the campaign began. Chechen LGBT individuals, as well as those suspected of  being gay, have been taken to unofficial secret detention facilities where  they have endured heinous abuses.  They also face the danger of so-called  honor killings committed by their own  relatives.  Instructive in that vein is a statement  from  a  spokesman  for  the  Chechen leader. Here is what he told  the Russian  news  agency,  talking  about gay men, in particular, in the  LGBT community: ‘‘If such people existed  in Chechnya,  law enforcement  would not have to worry about them,  as their own relatives would have sent  them to where they could never return.’’  Unfortunately, this is not a new reality for those living under the brutal  tyranny of the Chechen leader who, by  the way, happens to be a loyal ally of  Vladimir Putin. There have been reports in the past of similar abuses, although these reports seem to be the  most brutal and should provoke anger  in all of us.  We  should  never,  ever  tolerate  human rights violations against any  person for their political views, their  religious beliefs, or their sexual orientation.  According to reports today, Russian  Foreign Minister Lavrov said that Russian officials had not seen information  to confirm the reports. Additionally,  Putin’s spokesman said: ‘‘We have no  reason not to trust the head of the republic’’—talking  about  the Chechen  Republic—‘‘until there are actual complaints  in this regard, not abstract,  anonymous but actual complaints.’’  Well, the actual complaints are all  around us. They have been well documented in publications throughout the  world, but instead, Vladimir Putin is  choosing  to  prop  up Kadyrov,  the  Chechen brutal dictator, and prop up  his brutal regime  instead of holding  them accountable.  The United States and other responsible nations should do more to ensure  that all people are protected and those  who harm them are held responsible.  We should use our voice on the global  stage to call attention to these horrifying acts and to ensure that they are  condemned in an appropriate way, ultimately in the hopes that they will be  stopped.  TRIBUTETOALEXBURGOS  Mr. President, before  I yield  the  floor, as a matter of privilege, I am  joined by a long-time staffer of mine  who, in about 20 minutes, will end his  employment with our office.  Alex Burgos has worked for me since  2009, when he left a stable job with a  stable paycheck to go work for an underdog candidate with no chance to win  in the U.S. Senate race in Florida.  For the last 8 years, he has been a  critical member of our team. We are  proud that he has moved on and  is  going to be working in another place  outside of government, where he will  be quite successful. We have watched  him grow both in his professional career as well as his family.  We are very proud of Alex because he  is also from South Florida. He grew up  in a household in the community where  I grew up, in a story we are quite familiar with.  We are very grateful for the service  he has provided to the State of Florida,  to my office, to my campaign before  that, and we are proud of what I know  he will achieve  in  the months and  years to come.  Given all the leadership he has provided our office over the years, I am  grateful he had a chance to be on the  floor with us for this speech.  With that, Mr. President, I yield the  floor.

201,House,115,-0.403,22,2017-05-01,Mr. VEASEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for all of her hard work on this  Special  Order  hour.  I  enjoy  coanchoring with the gentlewoman because of her commitment and wanting  to get out these important messages.  I think the message we want to talk  about today is the first 100 days. I don’t  know about you all, but  I am disappointed in these first 100 days.  There were a lot of things that we  were told were going to happen, and  many of those things just hadn’t happened. There has been a lot of flip-flopping. I know that you have seen that.  We saw  it on Syria. We saw  it on  NATO. We saw it on many other things  that there was a whole lot of talk that  happened  in 2016, but there ain’t a  whole lot of walking that has happened  in 2017 as far as follow-up is concerned.  That is the sort of thing that all Americans should be worried about in these  first 100 days that ended on Saturday.  Many of us hoped that the rhetoric,  that the foolishness, the tweeting, that  those types of things would stop. That  hasn’t stopped.  A lot of us actually hoped that—hey,  if you want to talk about bringing  some jobs back to somebody, I am for  bringing jobs back. I am more committed to jobs and having jobs here in  this country, and he hasn’t done anything when it comes to jobs.  There has been absolutely no follow-  up whatsoever when it comes to helping the American man and woman reopen factories, when it comes to helping the American man and woman help  pay for their child care. When it comes  to things like Davis-Bacon and putting  more money on the table at the end of  the night and in the bank accounts, absolutely nothing has been done, and  that is what we should be concerned  about.  The President promised on the campaign trail that he was going to help  these hardworking Americans that I  talked about earlier. One of the things  that he  talked about was  the Buy  American, Hire American. Ain’t nothing happening on that. We know that  not only did Trump fail to deliver on  these promises, but that he has actually worked against the best interests  of American workers.  He has also gone on to contradict  himself on his  commitment  to  job  training. Instead of  investing  in  job  training and these crucial programs,  the Trump  administration has  proposed $2.5 billion in cuts for the Department of Labor. We have, by many  estimates, about a half a million or  more  jobs  in this country that are  high-skilled manufacturing  jobs that  we can’t fill. These are jobs that could  fill factories back up in the Rust Belt.  These are jobs that could fill factories  back up in Texas. These are jobs that  could be filled up in other parts of the  country.  You want to cut back on job training  when we need to be training people for  these new jobs? These are new manufacturing jobs that deal with robots,  deal with programmers and different  areas like that where the young people  don’t necessarily have the skills that  they need to be competitive.  You hear about these companies that  have come  to America,  they  locate  here—foreign car manufacturers,  for  instance—and they have to work with  the local community colleges to get  the kids on par to work these new manufacturing jobs. Now is not the time to  cut back on job training. So that is  what bothers me in these first 100 days.  The administration has rolled back  worker protections that keep Americans safe while on the job. Last month,  President Trump changed the law so  that  employers  now  only  have  6  months to report workplace  injuries  and illnesses instead of the previously  required 5-year reporting window. Scaling back  the  requirement does not  allow the Department of Labor to get a  full picture of a given workplace. It  makes it more difficult to spot a trend  of endangering employees.  Trump also gutted another worker  protection that would have made  it  harder for companies to secure Federal  contracts  if they have a history of  labor law violations. That protection is  now  gone.  It  is  gone.  It has  disappeared.  Above all else, President Trump has  still not put forward a single, concrete,  job-creating bill like he pledged. He betrayed his promise to make rebuilding  America’s infrastructure a top priority  of this administration. He has failed to  mention a word about protecting the  Davis-Bacon Act which, as you know,  would ensure that workers are paid  fairly  should  an  infrastructure  bill  come together.  Again, when you are talking about  money, I mean that is a very serious  topic. Money decides whether or not  you can pay your bills, whether or not  you can put food on the table, whether  or not you can buy your kids clothes,  whether or not you can make the car  payment.  The Davis-Bacon Act is a basic fundamental. If you cannot protect that,  those prevailing wages that give people  the opportunity to earn a good income,  again, then you are just talking and  you ain’t walking. That is what I am  worried about in these first 100 days.  You are going to hear a lot from the  Congressional Black Caucus  tonight  about how the President has failed to  deliver on so many of his campaign  promises, how he  is trying to take  away  health  care  from  24 million  Americans. High-risk pools are absolutely terrible.  One of the things the Obama administration did was it gave people who  have preexisting conditions the chance  to have affordable healthcare  insurance. Thinking about taking insurance  away from 24 million people, thinking  about taking those protections  from  individual families that have those preexisting conditions, I think, is absolutely terrible.

203,,115,0.445,50,2017-05-01,Mr. LUETKEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to honor a constituent of Missouri’s  Third District, Coach Craig Engelbrecht, who  was  inducted  into  the Missouri Basketball  Coaches Association Hall of Fame on Saturday, April 22, 2017 at the Missouri Sports Hall  of  Fame  in  Springfield,  MO.  Coach  Engelbrecht dedicated 33 years of his life as  an educator at Eugene High School, and has  spent 27 of  those years coaching. Coach  Engelbrecht recently celebrated his 500th varsity win, and is deserving of membership in  the Hall of Fame.  Coach Engelbrecht’s childhood was spent in  the Eugene area and he always wanted to return to that area to plant his roots. He grew up  in a family that served the community by working in the school system. His mother taught in  Russellville for 31 years and his Father was a  custodian after a career at MFA Feed Mill in  Eugene. After graduating from high school in  1979, Coach Engelbrecht spent his college  years at University of Central Missouri  in  Warrensburg. In 1983, he graduated with his  degree in Physical Education and a minor in  speech/drama.  In 1984, Coach Engelbrecht  started his  teaching  career at Russellville and  shortly  thereafter began his coaching career. During  his time at Eugene, he taught many subjects  including English, Speech, and Drama, and  was even responsible for putting on the annual spring play with his students. Eventually,  Coach Engelbrecht began  teaching Physical  Education, and knowing  the  importance of  being physically active, he always encouraged  his students to participate in all activities and  classes.  In 1990, Coach Engelbrecht became  the  head varsity boys basketball coach. He knew  it was vitally  important  to establish a stable  and hard-working program that would lay the  groundwork  for success on  the court. The  mantra for the Eugene basketball team is this:  ‘we play hard, we play smart, we play  together, and we play fast. ’ ’ Coach Engelbrecht  encourages his teams to use this mantra on  the basketball court and in real life. He has instilled in his students and players a mentality  to never quit and to always strive to achieve  their goals. Coach Engelbrecht has built many  relationships with his students and enjoys seeing many of them take his words of encouragement  to heart and apply  it  to  their daily  lives. Additionally, he enjoys seeing  former  students and players begin basketball coaching and refereeing careers of their own.  Coach Engelbrecht’s  family  is  involved  in  the education field as well. The Eldon Career  Center is currently under the direction of his  wife, Kelli. The Eldon School District is where  his son, Christian, is a paraprofessional. His  daughter, Katelyn has played basketball and  after her graduation will attend college at her  father ’s alma mater, University of Central Missouri—Warrensburg.  Throughout his 33 year career in education,  Coach Engelbrecht has seen God take care of  him. He acknowledges the great support system he has and knows that without that support, he would not have achieved his level of  success on the basketball court.  With his  retirement  from  teaching, Coach  Engelbrecht will be able to spend more time  with his  family. Kelli, Christian, and Katelyn  will enjoy  the additional moments  they have  with  their beloved  father. Despite his retirement  from  teaching, Coach Engelbrecht has  not decided  to hang up his coaching  jersey  just yet as he is continues to coach boys varsity basketball at Eugene High School.  I ask you to join me in recognizing Coach  Craig Engelbrecht on  this  induction  into  the  Missouri Sports Hall of Fame by the Missouri  Basketball Coaches Association and on his retirement from teaching after 33 years of improving the daily lives of all those at Eugene  High School, whether it be in the classroom or  in the gym.  f  TRIBUTE TO CINDY AND DICK  RYBA  HON.

206,Senate,115,-0.245,18,2017-05-10,Ms. KLOBUCHAR.," Mr. President, I  join in the minority leader’s remarks  and his plan for moving forward, which  is a bipartisan plan and a plea for our  colleagues to work together.  America is not like some countries  where people are all of the same ethnic  background or practice the same religion. America is an idea. America is an  ideal. America  is something that  is  grounded in our democracy.  Way back centuries ago, our Founding Fathers were concerned about foreign influence on our democracy. They  were  concerned  at  the  time  about  Great Britain. Well, now we have another concern, and that concern is Russia. It is not just the Democrats’ concern. As one of our colleagues, Senator  RUBIO, has noted in the past, maybe  this election was an attack on one political candidate in one party, but next  time it will be the other party. That is  why we must join together and handle  this correctly and in the spirit of our  democracy and our Constitution.  I have known Director Comey for a  long time. We were classmates at the  University of Chicago Law School. He  was well  liked  in our class, and he  earned the respect of the agents he supervised and the law enforcement he  worked with. I made it clear to him  that I didn’t agree with how he handled  the email investigation regarding Secretary Clinton, but nevertheless this  man is a hard worker and someone of  integrity.  Just  because  someone  doesn’t agree with how an investigation is handled, even if it is in a big  way, doesn’t mean this person should  be fired.  FBI Directors have 10-year terms for  a reason; that is because we want them  to be independent from political influence.  All Americans, including those who  have  criticized Director Comey  for  whatever reason in the past, should be  very troubled by the timing of this firing.  Let’s  look at  the past week. We  started  the week on Monday, when  Former Director Clapper testified  in  great detail about the Russian threat  to our democracy and the fact that the  Russians feel empowered and that he  believes  they will do  it again and  again. We also were on the heels of the  French cyber attack, where their elections were attacked and where Russia  was trying to get  involved  in their  elections.  Former Acting Attorney General  Sally Yates testified, and she made  very clear that she had not just given  a heads-up to the administration that  their National Security Advisor was  compromised by the Russians—no. She  had two formal meetings over at the  White House. She outlined  in detail  how she had gone over to the White  House and voiced her concerns.  When I asked both Former Director  Clapper and  former Acting Attorney  General Yates whether this was material for blackmail—when you have a  high-ranking official saying one thing  on a tape recording that the Russians  knew he had said and then another to  the Vice President  of  the United  States—if that was material for blackmail, they said yes, definitively yes,  that he had been compromised.  Yet, as it became clear, the White  House then allowed the National Security Advisor, General Flynn, to stay on  for 18 days, including being part of an  hour-long  conversation  between  the  President of  the United States and  Vladimir Putin. So that is what happened on Monday.  We know what was going to happen  tomorrow, Thursday, which is that Director Comey was going to testify in  his capacity as the FBI Director  in  front of the Senate Intelligence Committee. We know questions were going  to be asked about Russia. Of course, I  commend Senators BURRand WARNER  for inviting him again next week in his  capacity now as a private citizen.  Yet, when you look at what has happened here—the Yates and Clapper testimony on Monday, the Comey testimony expected on Thursday—what is  sandwiched in between? It is the firing  of the FBI Director. By the way, this is  the same FBI Director who had the audacity to tell the truth before Congress  when he was asked whether President  Obama  had wiretapped  the Trump  Tower, as alleged by President Trump  in a tweet at 6 in the morning. The FBI  Director truthfully answered, no, that  it did not happen. That is also something that has happened in the past  month.  Today we learned that just days before he was fired, Mr. Comey asked senior officials at the Justice Department  for more resources in order to carry  out the Russia investigation.  Now, what are my colleagues saying  about this? I think it is very important  to note that the two Senators who are  privy to the most classified information—Senator MCCAIN, as chair of the  Armed Services Committee, and Senator BURR, as chair of the Intelligence  Committee—have both expressed serious concerns about what has happened.  Senator MCCAIN said he was disappointed, and Senator BURR, the Republican chair of  the Senate  Intelligence Committee, said:  I am troubled by the timing and reasoning  of Director Comey’s  termination.  I have  found Director Comey to be a public servant  of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.  Senator FLAKEsaid:  I have spent the last several hours trying  to find an acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey’s firing. I just can’t do it.  BURR The reasoning the White House  is  using for Director Comey’s firing is bizarre, and that is why I believe Senator  said that his dismissal further  confuses an already difficult investigation.  The memo provided by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein cites old justifications. These are quotes from letters that I remember from the Presidential campaign, and they are used in  the letter as a justification.  If the administration found Director  Comey’s conduct during the election to  be  so problematic, why now—right,  smack in the middle of the advancements of this Russia investigation?  The answer, I believe, is that the justification that is provided in the memo  is a pretext. The fact that President  Trump’s termination letter to Director  Comey  strangely  discusses  the  fact  that Director Comey  informed  the  President that he was not under investigation in the context of the Russia  investigation sheds light on what this  is really about; that Director Comey  was seeking the truth.  Senator BURR said  that Director  Comey  has  been more  forthcoming  with information than any FBI Director he can recall in his tenure on the  congressional intelligence committees.  In firing Comey, President Trump has  cast doubt about the independence and  viability of any further investigation  into the foreign interference of our democracy.  Why was Attorney General Sessions,  who had recused himself from the investigation on Russian  interference,  able to influence the firing of the man  at the helm of the Russia investigation?  That is one of the questions we want  answered and why, by the way, we believe it is important to have a closed-  door briefing with the Deputy Attorney  General and his predecessor.  Did Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein act on his own or at the direction  of Attorney General Sessions or the  White House?  Are reports that the President had  been searching for a rationale to fire  the FBI Director for more than a week  true?  Was his firing influenced by any recent developments  in  the  investigation, like the issuance of grand jury  VerDate Sep 11 2014  02:23 May 11, 2017 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10MY6.025 S10MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o r e c n e p S S         ",2017

209,House,115,0.495,19,2017-05-18,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, Federal law provides a  list of 16 aggravating factors a jury is  required  to  consider when  deciding  whether a death sentence is warranted  in a Federal capital case. These factors  include whether the defendant acted in  an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner; whether the defendant  engaged  in substantial planning and  premeditation; whether the victim was  particularly vulnerable; and whether  the victim was a high public official.  High public official, as defined in the  statute, includes a litany of high-ranking public persons from the President,  to a foreign head of state, to a judge or  law  enforcement  officer.  Currently,  however, the law only contains specific  protections  for Federal officers, not  State and local officers.  H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act, introduced  by  my  colleague,  Mr.  BUCHANAN, amends Federal law to add  the killing of a State or local law enforcement officer as an aggravating  factor for a jury to determine during  the sentencing phase of a trial, when  the jury is considering whether a sentence of death is justified.  This  legislation  enjoys widespread  support in the law enforcement community. And, Mr. Speaker, we can all  understand why. In recent years, police  officers across our Nation have  laid  down their lives in the service of their  communities, often with little recognition or support.  According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 17  police officers have already died as a  result of gunfire this year. Most recently,  2  days  ago, Deputy Sheriff  Mason Moore of the Broadwater County, Montana, Sheriff’s Office was shot  and killed during a routine traffic stop.  We honor Deputy Moore’s  sacrifice,  which is a stark reminder of how a routine event can quickly turn fatal for an  officer of the law.  Now, Mr. Speaker, it is true that the  scenarios where the provision in H.R.  115 applies may be limited. It is true  that  the vast majority of homicide  cases are prosecuted in State courts. It  is also true that the circumstances  where a defendant killed a State or  local  law enforcement officer during  the commission of a Federal capital offense are probably limited.  But H.R. 115 is, nevertheless, vitally  important  in the scenarios where  it  will apply—for example, in many terrorism cases. My colleagues may not  remember  that  the  terrorist  who  bombed the Boston Marathon also murdered an MIT police officer during  their  flight  from  the  law. H.R.  115  would also apply to situations where a  State or local officer is killed serving  as a member of a Federal task force.  And it would cover volunteer first responders, who are, of course, authorized by law to carry out their duties.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation sends a  simple message: The stalking and killing of law enforcement officers will not  be tolerated.  H.R. 115 is straightforward, commonsense legislation that will provide all  the men and women of law enforcement, who serve and protect our communities every day, with the support  they deserve.  As we conclude the 2017 National Police Week, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  letters in support of the bill.  NATIONALASSOCIATIONOF  POLICEORGANIZATIONS, INC.,  Alexandria, VA, January 5, 2017.  Hon. VERNBUCHANAN,  House of Representatives,  Washington, DC.  DEARCONGRESSMANBUCHANAN: On behalf  of the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to you to express our strong support for the Thin Blue  Line Act.  NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations  from across the United States  that serves to advance the interests of America’s  law enforcement  through  legislative  and legal advocacy, political action, and education. Founded  in 1978, NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and associations, including the Florida Police Benevolent Association, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and more than 100,000 citizens  who share a common dedication to fair and  effective crime control and law enforcement.  The Thin Blue Line Act increases penalties  on those who harm or target for harm public  safety officers by making the murder or attempted murder of a local police officer, firefighter, or  first responder an aggravating  factor in death penalty determinations.  This bill is critical, as law enforcement officer assaults, injuries, and deaths have increased  sharply  in  recent years.  In  2016  alone, ambush-style killings of law enforcement officers increased by 167 percent. Establishing stricter penalties for those who  harm or target for harm law enforcement officers will deter crime. Any persons contemplating harming an office must know that  they will face serious punishments. NAPO  strongly believes that  increased penalties  make important differences in the attitudes  of criminals toward public safety officers,  and ensure protection for the community.  We thank you for your continued support  of the law enforcement community and we  look forward to working with you to pass  this important legislation.  Sincerely,  WILLIAMJ. JOHNSON, ESQ., CAE,  Executive Director.  NATIONALFRATERNAL  ORDEROFPOLICE,  Washington, DC, 9 January 2017.  Hon. VERNONG. BUCHANAN,  House of Representatives,  Washington, DC.  DEAR BUCHANAN:  REPRESENTATIVE I am  writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our  strong support for H.R. 115, the ‘‘Thin Blue  Line Act.’’  The ‘‘Thin Blue Line Act’’ increases the  penalty for an individual who targets, kills,  or attempts to kill a person who is a law enforcement officer, firefighter or any other  public safety officer, while he or she was engaged in the performance of his or her official duties, because of the performance of his  or her official duties, or because of his or her  status as a public official or employee.  Law  enforcement  officers  have  always  faced threats while on duty but within the  past few years, officers have become a target  for violence solely because of the uniform  they wear. As you know, the FOP has called  upon Congress to expand the current Federal  hate crimes law to include law enforcement  officers for this very reason.  Of the 63 deaths by gunfire suffered by law  enforcement in 2016, 21 of them—that’s 33%—  were ambush killings. These were deliberate  and sadly successful efforts by individuals  who set out to kill a police officer:  The ambush attack against the Dallas Police Department; the deadliest day for law  enforcement since 9/11 that saw 5 officers  killed from gunfire;  The ambush attack against members of the  Baton Rouge Police Department that saw 3  officers killed from gunfire;  The ambush attack against 2 Iowa police  officers, Scott Martin and Anthony Beminio  who were killed as they sat in their respective patrol cars;  Officer Thomas Cottrell of the Danville Police Department (OH) was killed by ambush.  All of these officers died because of the  uniforms they were wearing. Those in our  profession have always been in harm’s way.  It is our job to protect others but it should  not be ‘‘part of the job’’ to be a target of  someone who is looking simply to kill a cop.  We do not accept that our uniforms alone  make us targets because someone was driven  to rage over a perceived injustice or desires  to strike a blow against our civil government.  On behalf of more than 330,000 members of  the Fraternal Order of Police, I want to  VerDate Sep 11 2014  05:30 May 19, 2017 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K18MY7.036 H18MYPT1 ",2017
210,Senate,115,-0.438,61,2017-05-18,Mr. BROWN.," Mr. President, our law  enforcement officers and the families  who support them give so much  in  service to our communities. As we were  tragically reminded again last week—  and  this happens  in  far  too many  places, in far too many States—some  make the ultimate sacrifice to keep us  safe.  Last Friday in Kirkersville, OH, Police Chief Steve DiSario responded to a  report of a man with a gun at a nursing  home. Chief DiSario did what so many  first responders do when most of us in  the public run away from danger: He  ran toward it. He arrived at the Pine  Kirk Care Center to protect his community and was killed in the line of  duty by a gunman who also took the  lives of two nursing home employees.  Chief DiSario was 36. He had six children and a seventh on the way.  Our thoughts and our prayers are  with Chief DiSario’s  family and the  families of all of our first responders,  who worry each day that their loved  ones may not  return home. Think  about that. For soldiers, marines, sailors, police officers, and firefighters, so  often when they kiss their spouse goodbye and go to work, there is always the  anxiety at home. It is not just the sacrifice that our soldiers and our military personnel and our police officers  make; it is the sacrifice their families  make too.  Sadly, Police Chief DiSario wasn’t  the only Ohio officer to lay down his  life this year. In January, Officer David  J. Fahey of the Cleveland Police Department was working the scene of an  accident on I–90 and was struck and  killed in a despicable act of hit-and-  run.  This week in Washington, we honor  the five Ohio officers killed in the line  of duty last year. Aaron Christian of  the Chesapeake Police Department was  killed in a car accident while on patrol.  While conducting traffic, Trooper Kenneth Velez of Elyria was killed by a  driver under the influence of drugs. Officer Sean Johnson was the first officer  to be killed in the line of duty in the  town of Hilliard when he succumbed to  injuries  from a motorcycle accident  during a training exercise. Officer Steven Smith was shot and killed during a  SWAT standoff  in Columbus. Officer  Thomas Cottrell, Jr., of Danville was  killed in a heinous and cowardly ambush. Each of these losses is a tragedy  for a family, for a community, and for  fellow police officers.  As we honor the work and sacrifices  made by law enforcement throughout  Police Week, we need to offer more  than kind words; we need action to  support law enforcement as they work  to keep our communities safe.  Yesterday, I was talking to Police  Chief Richard Biehl of Dayton and  Youngstown Police Chief Robert Lees  about what more we should do to support officers and their families. This  week, we have unanimously passed several pieces of bipartisan  legislation  that will provide new support to the officers who protect us and the families  who sacrifice alongside them.  The Public Safety Officers’ Benefits  Improvement  Act,  which  Senator  GRASSLEYintroduced, will put pressure  on the Bureau of Justice Assistance at  the DOJ to speed up claims processing  so families of disabled officers or fallen  officers get their benefits more quickly.  We  passed  the Law Enforcement  Mental Health and Wellness Act, introduced by Indiana Senators DONNELLY  and YOUNG, to help law enforcement  agencies establish or enhance mental  health services, like peer monitoring  pilot programs and crisis hotlines, for  their officers. I learned about this bill  from my  friend Jay McDonald  from  Marion, OH, whose advocacy for police  officers and  their  families makes a  huge difference for Ohio’s law enforcement communities. He has been the  president of the Ohio Fraternal Order  of Police for some time.  We approved Senator CORNYN’s American Law Enforcement Heroes Act of  2017, which would allow local police departments to use Federal grant money  to hire veterans as law enforcement officers. It is a bipartisan, commonsense  idea that would open new doors  for  those who served our communities and  our Nation in the military and who  have accrued and developed skills that  will serve well their communities in  police work.  We have a solemn obligation to the  children of fallen officers whose lives  are forever changed because of the heroism of their mother or father. The bipartisan Children  of Fallen Heroes  Scholarship Act—which I have introduced with Senators CASEY and DONNELLY, two Democrats, as well as two  Republican Senators, TOOMEYand COLLINS—would  increase access  to Pell  grants for the surviving children of law  enforcement who lay down their lives  for their communities. It would ensure  that all children of fallen officers are  eligible for the maximum Federal Pell  grant. Of course, we can’t repay the  debt we owe these families, but we can  ease the burden on their children as  they prepare for their future.  We need to do everything we can to  ensure that officers and family members get the benefits and help they deserve. We also need to do more to give  officers the tools they need to protect  themselves. This week, I joined a group  of Senators calling for full funding of  the Bulletproof Vest Partnership.  I have written to the Department of  Justice thanking them for their work  so far and urging them to speed up distributing funding we passed as part of  the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. The bipartisan bill created  the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant  Program to provide funding to police  departments to train first responders  as they deal with opioid-related incidents.

211,,115,-0.187,75,2017-05-18,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  urge my colleagues to act to improve the sad  state of our nation’s infrastructure.  This week  is national  infrastructure week,  where we recognize America ’s infrastructure.  Sadly, what we have to recognize isn’t particularly positive.  This year’s  infrastructure grade  from  the  American Society of Civil Engineers is a ‘ ‘D+.’ ’  Sound infrastructure is literally and figuratively  the  foundation of our nation’s economy. We  must do better than a D+.  We know from our country’s history that infrastructure projects move forward most effectively when  local, state, and  federal governments all do their part.  We, in California, are no strangers to infrastructure problems caused by a lack of investment, but we are stepping up to make crucial  improvements. In my district, Merced, Madera,  and Fresno counties have all increased their  local sales  taxes  in order  to pay  for crucial  road repairs, new roads and highways, and  other essential  transportation projects. Last  month California enacted a bill to increase the  state gas tax and vehicle fees to pay for road,  bridge, and other transportation improvement  projects. Clearly these tough decisions come  with policy implications and political risks. This  includes Governor Brown’s decision to pursue  high speed rail, which the President supports.  There is a reason we are no longer investing in our infrastructure, and it is lack of political will.  Now it is time for the federal government to  face this challenge head on, and we know we  can because we have begun the process in  California.  In the Valley, we have serious challenges  with our water infrastructure. We need significant improvements to our water storage, water  delivery, and drinking water systems. We have  taken some initial steps to resolve these challenges, by acting at  the state and  federal  level. In 2014, California passed Proposition 1,  which authorized $7.12 billion for state water  infrastructure projects. Late  last year, after  years of hard work by myself and my colleagues in the California delegation, the Water  Infrastructure  Improvements  for  the Nation  Act, or the WIIN Act, became law. This law  authorizes  vital water  projects  across  the  country, including projects in the Valley, such  as additional storage at the New Exchequer  Dam and San Luis Reservoir in Merced County and  increased  funding  for water recycling  projects, like the North Valley Regional Recycled Water Program, which will provide 50,000  acre-feet  of  new water  for Merced  and  Stanislaus counties.  Although more must be done  to  improve  California’s infrastructure, this good first step  demonstrates  the  type of success we can  achieve when all levels of government work to  do their part on a bipartisan basis.  President Trump has stated that significant  investment in infrastructure is one of his Administration’s highest priorities. This is an opportunity for Congress and the Administration  to work together on a bipartisan basis to invest in the future of our nation.  But he must be more specific about  the  breadth and width of his vision. He needs to  answer the following questions: How much will  it cost? Where will  the money come  from?  How will he incentivize state and local governments  to come up with matching  funds and  get the private sector to invest? Equally important, what will the breakdown of investment be  in the various types of infrastructure, such as  transportation, port and harbor, and water infrastructure?  If  the President works with members of  Congress to create a serious and smart plan  here,  there  is great possibility  for bipartisan  support because no bridge, road, or dam is  Democratic or Republican.  RECOGNIZING AND CELEBRATING  THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF LA  PORTE, TX  HON. BRIAN BABIN  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 18, 2017  ",2017
212,,115,0.718,75,2017-05-18,Mr. BABIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 125th Anniversary of  the City of La Porte, in Harris County, Texas.  Located  just south of where  the Houston  Ship Channel meets Galveston Bay, La Porte  is a small Texas town, rich in history, and built  on community. French for ‘ ‘The Door,’ ’ the City  of La Porte was incorporated on August 10,  1892. The city  founder ’s vision  for La Porte  consisted of four objectives: the establishment  of a great commercial center and leading harbor on the coast of Texas; the establishment  of a natural summer and winter resort area;  the building of a manufacturing center for the  Southwest; and the establishment of an education center second  to none  in  the Southwest.  Today, La Porte is known as a sleepy escape from the big city and is home to numerous, shipyards and petrochemical manufacturing plants which play an inviable role to our  nation. Its community remains steeped in history, which still plays a vital role today. Two of  Texas’ most treasured historic landmarks are  in present-day La Porte, the Battleship Texas  and the San Jacinto Monument. La Porte sits  just eight miles from the San Jacinto Battleground, where Texas gained its independence  from Mexico.  Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize and celebrate  the 125th Anniversary of  the City of La Porte. May God continue  to  bless La Porte in these next 125 years.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF ANTONIO  ‘‘TONY’’ ORENDAIN  HON.

213,,115,-0.368,75,2017-05-18,Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to honor the life of civil rights leader  Antonio ‘ ‘Tony’ ’ Orendain, who passed away  on April 12, 2016.  Antonio was born on May 28, 1930,  in  Etzatla´n, Mexico. At the age of 20, armed with  little more than a sixth-grade education and an  unwavering desire  to succeed and sustain  himself, he pursued a brighter  future  in  the  United States. Soon after arriving, he moved  to Los Angeles where he worked in the fields  of California and met Ce´sar Cha´vez.  Inspired by the teachings of Cha´vez, Antonio became a lifelong activist, fighting to ensure that farm workers would one day be allowed to put a fair price on the sweat from  their own brow. Antonio advocated for agricultural workers across  the country, calling  for  higher wages and better working conditions.  He later joined the Community Service Organization, a coalition dedicated to civil rights.  In  the summer of 1969, Antonio and his  family moved  to  the Rio Grande Valley.  In  1975 he established the Texas Farm Workers  Union, an organization dedicated to shortening  the 14-hour workday and increasing wages for  VerDate Sep 11 2014  04:47 May 19, 2017 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K18MY8.003 E18MYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 7 K S D n o r e c n e p S S         ",2017

When he was a boy, he always wanted to  make it big as a baseball player, but had a different destiny instead.  He became the father of Bubba Trammell, a  star Major League Baseball player for several  major league teams.  Mr. C.L. Trammell is retired from teaching  now, but is still very active.  Among his hobbies is the writing of poetry.  One day he shared with me a poem he wrote  about America’s Pastime that I thoroughly enjoyed.

215,,115,-0.345,82,2017-05-18,Mr. COURTNEY.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise  to honor Mr. Yale Cantor from Ellington, Connecticut for his lifetime of public service, and  I enthusiastically endorse his enshrinement on  the Ellington Wall of Honor.  Yale has been on Ellington’s Democratic  Town Committee for over 60 years, and has  served as a mentor to generations of residents  who have sought to become involved in local  government. His decorated career  includes  more  than a decade as Democratic Town  Chairman, being named a  Justice of  the  Peace, a year on  the Board of Selectmen,  membership and chairmanship of the Human  Service Commission, and more than 20 years  on the Hockanum Valley Community Council,  where he also served as president.  In  the  town of Ellington, Yale is always ready to get  involved in improving the community, and he  created a large local footprint and legacy due  to his efforts. Yale also had a long record of  service as a  teacher, and  improving quality  and access of education at all levels is one of  his abiding passions.  During his years of service, Yale had a  major personal hand  in  launching  the campaigns of many distinguished public officials  from  the state of Connecticut,  including my  predecessor Sam Gejdenson, who served 20  years in the U.S. House of Representatives. I  too can attest to Yale ’s political legacy. When  I began my political career as a candidate for  state representative in the town of Vernon in  1986, Yale was right there to give me wise  counsel and support. In every campaign since  for  the General Assembly, Lieutenant Governor and U.S. Congress, Yale has always  been there, loyally supporting my efforts. He is  a true blue friend and a passionate advocate  for democracy,  fairness and civility. Those  qualities are exactly what our nation needs  today.  I would ask the chamber to please join me  in congratulating Yale and his  family  for all  they have done in Ellington, Connecticut and  the nation over the years.  f  RECOGNIZING COMMUNITY ACTION  MONTH  AND  THE  SARATOGA  COUNTY  ECONOMIC  OPPORTUNITY COUNCIL  HON.

237,House,115,0.275,26,2017-06-13,Mr. BARLETTA.,"  But  I  remind our colleagues  that  twice the Government Accountability  Office looked at eligibility within the  Affordable Care Act. In 2014, they used  fake identities to see if they could obtain ObamaCare coverage on the exchange, and in 11 out of 12 applications—some with no data at all—the  GAO was granted subsidies for people  who don’t even exist.  So you say: Well, that is 2014. Certainly, things got better.  Well, last year, they ran it again in  the special enrollment period, and in  this test, the GAO was able to obtain  coverage for imaginary people in 9 out  of 12 cases.  We are told today that our taxpayer  dollars aren’t being wasted. Well, the  American  public knows better,  and  they  know  this  because we  have  worked for 7 years to oppose what we  knew would be a failing law. We held  more than 200 congressional hearings.  We had 65-plus hours of open debate on  the American Health Care Act, and 37  bills passed the House that were ultimately,  in one  form or another,  included in the Republican bill.  The bottom line is this, Mr. Speaker:  Our Democrat  friends are  in denial.  ObamaCare is collapsing. Prices have  more than doubled. They haven’t gone  down. They have more than doubled for  most Americans; in some States more  than tripled, and those rates aren’t  going down. They are skyrocketing.  People aren’t getting more choices of  healthcare  plans.  They  are  disappearing.  Texas has seen nine insurers abandon  our State—I think more than any other  State—and  it  is  getting  fewer  and  fewer. It is occurring across the country.  You are not able to see more local  doctors and go to more local hospitals;  just the opposite. It is fewer, and that  is  hurting  everyone  in  America.  ObamaCare is a sinking ship, and it is  taking  some  very  good Americans  down with it.  The question is: Do we begin to give  people a  lifeline to truly affordable  care?  With this bill, Mr. BARLETTA insists  in a commonsense way that your tax  dollars go to those we are trying to  help: those who can’t get healthcare at  work; those who don’t get it through  government programs like Medicare or  the VA; those small-business people;  those  folks  coming  out  of  college;  those entrepreneurs who are at home  starting a new business or raising their  families;  even  those  early  retirees.  Those are the people we are trying to  help, and every dollar counts.  Mr. BARLETTA’s bill, which  I am  proud as chairman of the Ways and  Means Committee  to bring  to you,  makes a  commonsense  requirement:  that you be verified to get those subsidies  before you  receive  them;  to  make sure those precious dollars actually go to the Americans we are trying  to help.  I strongly support the Verify First  Act. If you stand for stopping waste,  and fraud, and abuse in protection of  your tax dollars, I would urge your support for this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2017
238,House,115,0.718,26,2017-06-13,Mr. BABIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 2581, the Verify First Act, which will put  important safeguards in place to ensure that  federal tax dollars are not fraudulently used to  pay  for  illegal  immigrants  to  enroll  in  Obamacare.  Right now, the federal government provides  Obamacare premium tax credits to individuals  before fully making sure that these individuals  rightfully qualify for these benefits.  For example,  the  federal government has  wrongfully issued hundreds of millions of dollars  in  tax credits  to  individuals without  first  verifying  their  immigration status. After  the  money goes out  the door,  the  Internal Revenue Service must attempt  to  track down  these individuals to recoup the money.

240,House,115,-0.306,40,2017-06-13,Mr. CONNOLLY.," Mr. Speaker,  I strongly  support increased accountability and whistleblower protection at  the Department of Veterans Affairs. And  I recognize  that S. 1094  represents a compromise approach that was  crafted specifically  to address severe,  long-  standing problems at VA hospitals.  But a number of S. 1094 ’s provisions concern me. As Vice Ranking Member of  the  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,  these concerns would be amplified  if  these provisions were applied  to other contexts or across the federal government in future legislation.  A partial  list of problematic provisions  cludes:  The bill requires a  lower standard of evidence  that would allow  removal, demotion,  and other disciplinary actions even if the majority of evidence is exculpatory.  The bill supersedes existing collective bargaining agreements.  The bill provides for the clawback and forfeiture of bonuses and pensions under a  standard  that  is broad and  susceptible  to  abuse.  The bill denies senior executives of the right  to appeal  to  the Merit Systems Protection  Board, which they have under current law.  inThe bill imposes unreasonable timelines on  the ability of employees to respond to allegations that may lead to discipline and eliminates  the ability of  the Merit System Protection  Board  to mitigate penalties  that may have  been overly harsh and raise due process concerns.  The bill prohibits the use of administrative  leave  for employees challenging demotions.  This provision could also force employees to  use their accrued sick or annual leave while  on appeal, which Courts have considered a  taking in violation of the Constitution.  While S. 1094 is a bipartisan compromise  aimed at dealing with a specific and troubled  department, a number of  its provisions are  problematic and would not serve as an example for future civil service-related legislation.

241,House,115,0.605,47,2017-06-13,Mr. WALKER.," I thank Representative RATCLIFFEfor his comments.  Mr. Speaker, once again, if people are  watching at home or are gathering  here today,  I want to remind them  that, many times—Members of Congress, when you go back home, you  hear a lot of times: Do your job; get  things done.  And as I reflect your attention again  to our chart here this evening, we can  talk a little bit about what we have  passed in the House: 158, the most in  several different administrations.  However, even though we are going  to talk tonight a little about what we  have done and what we look forward  to, we are not stopping with 158, we are  not stopping with the 37 that have been  signed into law. We are looking forward to doing some new things.  I think one of the best people to talk  about something that we are excited  about is certainly somebody that I call  a friend, a fellow member, a colleague  from North Carolina, someone who allows me to tag along into NASCAR  country  from  time  to  time, a  real  friend of the people, someone who I  have  learned that will tell you the  truth no matter what you ask. It is my  privilege to yield to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON).  ",2017
242,House,115,0.675,47,2017-06-13,Mr. HUDSON.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the chairman very much for yielding. I  thank  the  chairman also  for organizing, once again, an opportunity for  us to speak directly to the American  people, and for his tremendous leadership on the values that we conservatives hold very dear.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about a piece of legislation tonight that we plan to bring to  the floor of the House this fall. The  right to defend yourself doesn’t end  when you cross State lines, which is  where my Concealed Reciprocity Act of  2017, also known as H.R. 38, comes into  play. We currently have 196 cosponsors  from both sides of the aisle.  My bill simply provides law-abiding  citizens the right to carry concealed  and travel freely between States without worrying  about  conflicted  concealed carry State codes or onerous  civil suits.  As it stands, the patchwork of agreements is confusing for even the most  cautious concealed-carry permit holder, and it has caused law-abiding citizens,  like Shaneen Allen,  a  single  mother  from New Jersey, to unwittingly break the law and suffer arrest  and detention.  Now, the Constitution’s very clear. If  you look at Article IV, section 1, it  says: ‘‘Full Faith and Credit shall be  given in each State to the public Acts,  Records, and  judicial Proceedings of  every other State. . . . ’’  That is why a driver’s license is recognized in other States. That is why a  marriage license is recognized in other  States.  That  is why  divorce  proceedings  are  recognized  in  other  States; in the same way the concealed-  carry permit or the right to carry concealed should be recognized.  In the Senate, Senator JOHNCORNYN  introduced companion legislation. Senator CORNYNhas long been a champion  for our Second Amendment rights, and  I am pleased to work with him as he  continues his strong leadership on national concealed carry reciprocity.  I have already received a tremendous  amount of support from my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle who recognize  our constitutional right to keep and  bear arms. However, the left continues  to spread misinformation and employ  fear tactics about this bill, erroneously  saying it will increase crime and arm  criminals.  First of all, under this law, an individual who travels to a different State  has to follow the laws of that State. In  the same way with a driver’s license,  when you drive  into another State,  they recognize that you are a  legal  driver, but you have got to follow their  laws.  Second,  every  single  person who  wants to buy a firearm still has to go  through the Federal background check.  My bill does nothing to change that.  Further, statistics have shown that  violent crime has decreased as gun  ownership and concealed-carry permits  have increased. Since 1991, 25 States  have adopted right-to-carry laws. The  number of people with carry permits  has risen to over 12 million people, and  the Nation’s violent crime rate has decreased 51 percent.  Also, if a criminal with malice intent  wants to get a gun, I can guarantee you  that he or she isn’t worried about following the laws that are on the books.  Unfortunately, we can’t change that,  but we can ensure that  law-abiding  citizens can  legally carry concealed  firearms to defend themselves.  As a shock to no one, big city liberal  Michael Bloomberg has promised  to  spend $25 million to stop this legislation. He could spend all the money he  wants, but our gun rights are not for  sale.  With a groundswell of support from  Americans across the country and a  pro-Second Amendment President, we  will make national  concealed  carry  reciprocity  a  reality  this Congress.  More and more States are recognizing  the rights of  law-abiding citizens to  carry a  concealed handgun without  permission from government, including  two this year, bringing that total to 12.  In my home State of North Carolina,  lawmakers in the House voted in favor  of House bill 746 to make a concealed-  carry permit no longer necessary in locations where it is currently permissible to openly carry a handgun. It is a  commonsense bill. I am proud of the  leadership of the folks in Raleigh. It  just demonstrates that all across this  country, the American people are recognizing that our right to keep and  bear arms shall not be infringed.  So I would just offer this very simple  piece of legislation, following the Constitution that says a law-abiding citizen trying to do the right thing is not  going to be criminalized because they  have crossed an invisible line in the  ground.  I am pleased to be here today to talk  about it, and I am thankful for having  this opportunity and support.  ",2017

244,Senate,115,0.394,89,2017-06-13,Mr. CORKER.," Mr. President, I am  glad to be down here with our ranking  member, Senator BEN from  Maryland. I want to thank him and his  staff for working until 10:20 last night  to complete negotiations on a Russia  amendment. I want to thank Senator  CRAPOand his staff and Senator BROWN  and his staff for the work they did on  the sanctions component, where over  the last 5 months they have worked  with our counterparts around the world  to make sure that what we did in this  piece of legislation was something that  was workable. Truly, I think  it has  been a great effort by four different offices. I am glad that cloture has been  filed on that amendment, and I understand we are going to vote on it tomorrow at 2 o’clock.  I will be very brief. Senator CARDIN  and I are here on the floor together,  and I know he wants to make some  comments about this. Let me just give  a brief summary, if I could.  The amendment enhances Congress’s  role in determining sanctions policy on  Russia. It provides for the President to  use a national security waiver or sanctions termination after giving Congress  30 days to review the proposed action.  I think everyone here knows I am a  strong proponent of congressional review. We began that under President  Obama. To me, it gets us in a place  where we are playing an appropriate  role in foreign policy.  The  amendment  codifies  existing  sanctions on Russia for their activities  in Ukraine and cyber space.  The amendment strengthens and expands existing conduct-based sanctions  by requiring the imposition of sanctions on actors undermining cyber security,  supplying  arms  to  Syria,  human rights abusers, and those  involved in corrupt privatization of government-owned assets.  It mandates  sanctions on Russian  deep-water, Arctic, and shale projects  worldwide and yet allows for waivers to  be made based on national security interests of the United States.  This amendment prioritizes U.S. foreign assistance to allies in their fight  against Russian aggression. This  is  something  I know Senator CARDIN  worked hard on, and I appreciate his efforts.  It authorizes $250 million to establish  the Countering Russian Influence Fund  to  implement programs  in EU and  NATO  member  countries—Senator  PORTMANplayed a role in this as well,  and I appreciate his efforts—as well as  candidate nations, to combat Russian  interference, with a priority given to  programs that develop cyber security,  address public corruption, respond to  humanitarian  crises,  counter  disinformation,  and  support  democratic institutions.  It requires the State Department and  other Federal agencies to collaborate  and develop a plan to reduce Ukraine’s  dependence on Russian energy imports,  which we know Russia has used to extort Ukraine.  I think it is a very good piece of legislation. I appreciate the contributions  of many Members here. I know Senator  MCCAIN,  Senator  Senator  RUBIO, and so many people here have  been involved in wanting to produce  legislation that pushes back  in this  way. We have tried to utilize the best  of many bills that have been put forth.  Again, I cannot thank the ranking  member and his staff enough for the  way they have worked with us to get us  to this point.  ",2017

The Family Self Sufficient, FSS,  Program is an existing Department of  Housing and Urban Development, HUD,  employment and savings incentive initiative for families that use section 8  vouchers or live in public housing. FSS  provides participants access to the resources and training that enable them  to pursue higher paying employment  opportunities and meet financial goals,  while putting FSS families in a better  position to save by establishing an interest-bearing  escrow  account  for  them. Upon graduation from the FSS  program, the family can use these savings to pay for job-related expenses,  such as additional workforce training  or the purchase or maintenance of a  car needed for commuting purposes. In  short, FSS is all about giving our constituents the incentives and the tools  to move up the economic ladder.

This  year’s  Anniversary will  honor  the  Broward County Public Defender, Mr. Howard  Finkelstein;  the Honorable Dale Ross;  the  Broward Sheriff’s Office; the Broward Behavioral Health Coalition;  the United Way of  Broward  County;  Henderson  Behavioral  Health;  the Broward County Crime Commission; the Mental Health Association of Southeast Florida; and  the National Alliance on  Mental  Illness Broward County. All of  these  outstanding individuals and organizations deserve this honor as they have devoted countless hours and years  to helping  those with  mental  illness navigate an often unforgiving  criminal justice system.  As we celebrate  this august occasion,  I  would be remiss if I did not single out the efforts of  Judge Ginger Lerner-Wren.  Judge  Lerner-Wren was  tasked with presiding over  and administering our country’s  first Mental  Health Court in 1997, shortly after taking the  bench. Since that time, she has been a leader  in the field of Therapeutic Jurisprudence and  the  justice  that emanates  therefrom. Judge  Lerner-Wren, and all those who work for the  Mental Health Court, as well as those dedicated  to  the cause of Therapeutic Jurisprudence really have one simple goal in mind—  ensuring dignity for those suffering from mental illness, who find themselves navigating our  criminal justice system.  Mr. Speaker, I applaud all those associated  with Broward County’s Mental Health Court  over the past 20 years. Their work has made  an important difference in the lives of those  dealing with mental health issues, to their families, and our community.  I wish  the Court  many more years of continued success, and  look  forward  to championing  their  important  work in Congress.  f  TRUMP  CUTTING  THE  EPA  WATERSENSE PROGRAM MAKES  NO SENSE AT ALL  HON.

250,Senate,115,-0.3,71,2017-06-26,Mr. CASEY.," Mr. President, I rise, as  well, to talk tonight about the issue of  healthcare. I thank my colleague from  Connecticut for looking down the road  to when, maybe, we can actually work  together on this issue. We are in conflict this week, and that is not a place  any of us want to be.  We are in conflict because of the elements of this bill. I will make two  basic points in my remarks tonight,  one about Medicaid and then one point  about another provision in the bill that  I think is particularly insulting.  A lot of our discussions start with  policy and data, and that is important.  That is obviously part of the debate  about the bill and what is in it and  what impact it will have on programs  and people over a long period of time,  but part of this debate, of course, is  about the people we represent. I know  the Presiding Officer understands this,  and I am heartened that he is paying  attention  to our arguments because  sometimes—I have done  it myself—  when you preside, sometimes you are  doing something else. So we are grateful for his attention.  I have talked on this floor a couple of  times over the last couple of weeks—  even months—and I will not repeat the  stories because they have been told a  number of times, but Rowan Simpson  is a young man whom I recently just  met. His mom had sent me a letter.  Rowan is on the autism spectrum, and  his mom is very worried about his future because of the potential impact on  Medicaid and the benefits he is getting  today from Medicaid.  I just referred the other day—I guess  it was Thursday on the floor—to a letter from a dad about his son Anthony,  who has a number of challenges, one of  them being that he is on the autism  spectrum.  I have another  letter, as  well, which I will not go through tonight, but it is from a mom in Northeastern Pennsylvania, who wrote to me  about two of her children—principally,  her son who has Type 1 diabetes and  what the loss of Medicaid coverage will  mean for that child, who, in this case,  is just 4 years old.  Everyone  in this Chamber  in both  parties has stories like this to tell—  stories about people who are, because  of a disability, totally dependent upon  Medicaid. That is not unique to one  State, and, of course, it is not unique  to one party.

Exceptional lawyers, shrewd strategists, and formidable coalition-builders,  they retire after  five  decades on  the  frontlines of virtually every  major advance for women and girls in this nation.  One of Marcia and Duffy’s greatest legacies  the persistent  leadership of  the National  is  Women’s Law Center, the legal advocacy organization they co-founded and co-directed—  pioneering progress for women and girls at a  moment of landmark new legal and legislative  victories for women ’s rights.  Under Marcia and Duffy’s  leadership,  the  NWLC grew into one of America’s most formidable and effective organizations for advancing women ’s rights and opportunities.  Guided by their leadership, the NWLC will  continue to honor their founders through strategic, effective and groundbreaking advocacy  for a new generation of women and girls. Beyond the Center, the many female, and male,  advocates who have been mentored and supported by Marcia and Duffy over  the years  continue to carry forward their vision.  Marcia’s induction to the national Women’s  Hall of Fame at Seneca Falls, NY in 2015 was  a fitting honor for an extraordinary person who  has earned a place in the pantheon of champions  for America ’s women. Duffy has been  rightly honored with a Lifetime Achievement  Award  from  the U.S. Department of Health  and Human Services for her ‘ ‘efforts on behalf  of America’s children.’ ’ These awards are just  two of  the many recognitions  they have received for their leadership.  It has been my honor to work with Marcia  and Duffy for three decades and witness first  hand their dedication and commitment. On behalf of their many friends in Congress, I commend Marcia D.

255,,115,-0.378,1,2017-07-17,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to mourn the passing of the Chinese  human rights advocate and Nobel Prize  Laureate, Liu Xiaobo, who died  last  Thursday in China, under guard.  The world has lost an incomparably  courageous advocate who was dedicated to advancing human rights and  the rule of law, and paid for them with  his own freedom and life.  Liu’s passing last week in Chinese  custody marked a tragic end to over a  decade of persecution by the Chinese  authorities who relentlessly mistreated  him as he gradually became a symbol  of  the  pro-democracy  movement  around the globe.  In 2010, the Nobel Peace Committee  awarded him the Peace Prize for his  thoughtful advocacy for reform and for  his courageous support of the pro-democracy document Charter 08.  A year prior to the Nobel Peace Prize  being awarded to Liu, in 2009, Chinese  authorities tried him for subversion of  state power, for which he received an  11-year sentence. Given his rising stature  in the  international community,  they  imprisoned him  in secret  locations away from family, supporters, or  international media. They kept him  from receiving the Peace Prize and put  pressure on the committee to rescind  the award, in addition to doing everything they could to prevent Liu’s supporters from attending the ceremony  in Norway.  They  routinely  censored and  continue to censor the internet for references to Liu and other pro-democracy advocates and ideas.  China was so afraid of the power of  his words and the bravery of his actions that while Liu was suffering from  severe  illness,  Chinese  authorities  adopted the ultimate cruelty of not letting him leave China for medical help  that experts said might save his life.  For China, the supreme goal was his silence.  The more we  care  about  human  rights and freedom, the more we must  now mark his death and remember him  not by being silent ourselves.  I  first came to know about Liu’s  work a few years after the Congressional-Executive Commission on China  was created as part of the debate over  China’s ascension to the World Trade  Organization and concerns from Members of Congress over China’s human  rights record.  In 2000, I coauthored the legislation  that created the China commission to  help  advance  and monitor  human  rights abuses in China. The commission continues to do important work  and continues today by shining a spotlight on many issues such as abuses in  labor,  environment, and  freedom of  speech and association.  While he was the most prominent  voice in China against its repression of  human rights and democratic values,  Liu was not as well known in his life as  another brave voice, Andrei Sakharov.  His voice and action occurred during  the Cold War, where there was a full  press against the Soviet Union, including its suppression of freedom. He supported numerous efforts for freedom,  including those of another noble warrior  for  freedom, Natan Sharansky.  Like Sakharov, Liu was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize, but both were kept  in virtual  imprisonment and not allowed to go to Stockholm.  Liu’s battles  for  freedom occurred  when China’s economic and political  power were rising. The United States  and other nations were wrestling with  how to adapt, and relations with China  have been  increasingly  infused with  concerns about security, including the  nuclearization  of North Korea.  So  there has been a tendency for concerns  in other nations about human rights  and freedom in China to take a back  seat.  This  is a major change  from  the days of  Tiananmen Square, and events elsewhere  then  in China. My son, Andy Levin was  in  Chengdu during demonstrations there for freedom and he managed amidst all  the dangerous turbulence to cable a vivid article about  the struggle for freedom there to the Detroit  News.  Chinese authorities have also  relentlessly  harassed his widow, Liu Xia (Lew Tsia), by  keeping her in isolation, under house arrest for  weeks at a  time, and monitoring her every  move.

257,Senate,115,-0.53,50,2017-07-17,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. President, in the  spirit of the ‘‘Decade of Vision,’’ I am  pleased to recognize July as Dry Eye  Awareness Month. In 2009, while serving in the House of Representatives, I  was proud to sponsor the successfully  passed H. Res. 366, which recognized  the 40th anniversary of the National  Eye Institute and designated 2010–2020  as the ‘‘Decade of Vision.’’ This resolution sought to bring awareness to our  Nation’s challenges  in vision health,  especially as our population ages and  the incidence of chronic diseases that  may cause vision impairment grows.  Dry eye is one of these growing vision  health  challenges  that  affects  more than 30 million people  in the  United States. It occurs when the eye  does not produce tears properly or they  are not of the correct consistency and  evaporate too quickly.  It can range  from discomfort to a painful chronic  and progressive condition that leads to  blurred vision or even vision loss. Dry  eye is one of the most frequent causes  of patient visits to eyecare providers.  It is a particularly burdensome issue  for our brave soldiers who were engaged in Operation Enduring Freedom  and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Veterans Administration reports that upwards of 70 percent of traumatic brain  injury-exposed veterans have dry eye  symptoms.  Research supported by the National  Institutes of Health and its National  Eye Institute has improved our understanding of this condition. Dry eye can  have many causes, including environmental  exposure,  side-effects  from  medications, eye surgery, eyelid disorders, immune system disorders, contact lens wear, cosmetic use, aesthetic  procedures, and an increasingly common cause:  staring at computer or  video  screens  for  too  long without  blinking, which may have a disproportionate impact on our younger generations.  I want to recognize an  important  educational  opportunity  during Dry  Eye Awareness Month this year. The  Tear Film & Ocular Surface Society’s  ‘‘Dry Eye Workshop II Report’’ will be  published in ‘‘The Ocular Surface Journal,’’ updating the definition of dry eye  and addressing its greater impact on  vision health—the first such reexamination since 2007. Report highlights  were presented at a July 12, 2017, congressional briefing, accompanied by a  ‘‘Test Your Tears’’ screening and presentation of research posters.  The vision community and its coalition partners are uniting to recognize  this growing vision health problem,  and I stand in support of these awareness and educational efforts.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  TRIBUTE TO EMMETT  CHASSANIOL, JR.  ∑",2017

259,,115,0.16,57,2017-07-17,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker, Liu  Xiaobo’s premature death was a jarring shock  to everyone who admired  this champion of  freedom and democracy. We mourn his loss  because it is a tragic loss for his wife, family  and friends and a catastrophic loss for China  and the entire world.  We owe Liu Xiaobo a debt of gratitude because he demonstrated that the noble ideas of  democracy and due process, liberty and the  rule of law are not foreign ideas in China.  These are universal principles  that beat  strongly  in  the hearts of people everywhere  from New Jersey to the Ninevah plains of Iraq,  from Poland to Peru, and from Burma to Beijing.  We owe Liu Xiaobo a debt of gratitude because he reminded us that the desire for democracy and human rights is shared by everyone because each person is endowed by the  Creator with inalienable rights.  The Chinese Communist Party has tried to  curtail his ideas, they call them dangerous and  subversive, and they seek to silence, censor,  and  repress  them. Yet,  they  live on  in  the  hearts of untold millions of Chinese people.  With Liu Xiaobo’s death, we are also reminded of the words of Dr. Martin Luther King  who said ‘ ‘injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.’ ’ We should all agree  that  what was done to Liu Xiaobo and his wife Liu  Xia was a grave injustice.  Liu Xiaobo’s imprisonment in 2009 became  a death sentence. The blame for this should  lie squarely on the Chinese government and  for his death they alone should be held accountable.  Liu Xiaobo was the first Nobel Peace Prize  winner to die in state custody since Carl von  Ossietzky died after being held in a Nazi concentration camp.  The Chinese government complained that it  was ‘ ‘stabbed in the back’ ’ by those expecting  it to deal quickly with its client state in North  Korea. How shameful it is to play the victim  card while a victim of their own repression lay  dying.  No nation  should be  judged entirely by  crimes of the past, but this crime—the death  and silencing of Liu Xiaobo —should follow the  Chinese Communist Party like an unwashable,  permanent stain.  We must never forget Liu Xiaobo ’s enduring  contributions—whether during the Tiananmen  Massacre where he helped save the lives of  many students or with Charter 08 —the treatise  urging political and  legal  reforms  in China  based on constitutional principles.  We must not forget Liu Xiaobo; we must advance and preserve his legacy, and repeatedly  confront  the Chinese Communist Party with  his ideas and memory.  In  this  time of need we must signal  the  Congress’s  unanimous  support  for  Liu  Xiaobo’s family, his wife Liu Xia, and all those  bravely standing up for human rights and liberty in China.  I was invited by Liu Xiaobo ’s family to attend the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. It  was a moving ceremony;  the now  famous  empty chair spoke volumes about the Chinese  Communist Party’s abiding  fear  that human  rights  and  democracy will  undermine  its  power.  I will always  remember  the words of Liu  Xiaobo’s speech  that day about  the  importance of pressing for human rights: ‘ ‘Freedom  of expression  is  the  foundation of human  rights, the source of humanity, and the mother  of truth. To strangle freedom of speech is to  trample on human rights, stifle humanity, and  suppress truth.’ ’  And he also expressed his hopes for China’s future: ‘ ‘. . . I firmly believe that China’s  political progress will not stop, and I, filled with  optimism, look forward to the advent of a future free China. For there is no force that can  put an end to the human quest for freedom,  and China will  in  the end become a nation  ruled by  law, where human rights reign supreme. ’ ’  Liu Xiaobo will, sadly, never see a  free  China. Chinese authorities have gone to great  lengths to stifle his ideas and those who followed him. In recent years, the government of  President Xi Jinping has engaged  in an extraordinary assault on the rule of law, human  rights, ethnic minority groups, and civil society.  As China’s economic and military might  grows, more and more countries will be afraid  to raise subjects that the Chinese Communist  Party wants to make taboo.  The U.S. stands alone —inadequate as  its  efforts are at times—in its willingness to keep  on raising human rights issues that need to be  raised. The U.S. cannot lightly shrug off the  mantle of being democracy’s defender, no  matter how heavy that mantle may become.  It is tempting to be pessimistic about China’s future and the future of U.S.-China relations. But I am not pessimistic. Constant repression has not dimmed the desires of the  Chinese people for freedom and reform. I attribute this fact, in part, to Liu Xiaobo’s ideas  and example.  Nevertheless,  the U.S. cannot be morally  neutral or silent  in  the  face of  the Chinese  government’s repression of fundamental freedoms. Human rights are not a secondary interest, but one critically linked to U.S. economic  and security interests.  The U.S. must not shy away from meeting  with China ’s other Nobel Laureate, the Dalai  Lama, or other dissidents. We must use Congressionally authorized sanctions to hold Chinese  officials  accountable  for  torture  and  gross abuses. We must connect Internet and  press freedoms as both economic and human  rights priorities. And we must demand, repeatedly and clearly, that the unconditional release  of political prisoners is in the interest of better  U.S.-China relations.  I believe that someday China will be free.  Someday, the people of China will be able to  enjoy all of their God-given rights. And a nation of  free Chinese men and women will  honor and celebrate Liu Xiaobo as a hero. He  will be honored along with all others like him  who have sacrificed so much, and so long, for  freedom.  f  RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF  COMMANDER HAROLD CHAPMAN  HON. LEE M.

260,,115,0.354,57,2017-07-17,Mr. ZELDIN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay special tribute to Harold Chapman, a resident of New York’s First Congressional District  and the 73rd AMVETS National Commander.  Commander Chapman’s unyielding work  for  both his country and fellow veterans exemplifies public  service, and  should be appropriately revered and respected. In light of his  years of distinguished service  to  the United  States and her people, I am proud to offer this  statement  in honor of Commander Harold  Chapman.  Commander Chapman is an honorably discharged  veteran of  the United States Air  Force, with his Vietnam War-era service  including 18 months in the Pacific Theater, as  well as postings at air bases in California and  Texas. Following  his  honorable  discharge,  Commander Chapman began his service at  the AMVETS Department of New York, taking  command of AMVETS New York Post 18 in  1995.  Remarkably,  Commander  Chapman  went on to hold each chair in sequence at the  AMVETS Department of New York before taking command of the entire department and its  more than 70 posts in 2002.  Following his two terms as New York’s representative  to AMVETS’ National Executive  Committee,  in 2008, Commander Chapman  became the head of AMVETS District I. This  impressive next step saw Commander Chapman oversee all AMVET members and Posts  in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode  Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. While in command of District  I, Commander Chapman’s admirable efforts to  grow AMVETS membership  throughout hi s  district merited him an award from AMVETS  National Headquarters,  in addition  to previously being recognized as the Department of  New York’s AMVET of the Year.  Today, Commander Chapman  travels  the  nation to hear directly from AMVETS members  on a variety of issues and deliver their important concerns directly  to  the White House,  Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and Congressional  leaders  in both  the  Senate and House of Representatives.

Mr. Speaker, here we are again: the  special interests are running the show  in Washington. Pointblank, this resolution will make it harder for Americans  to get justice. Specifically, this will  unwind critical new rules that allow financial consumers to take collective  action. You heard that right. This is an  effort to take away your ability to sue  big banks when they run you over. Instead, the majority wants to force you  into unfair, bureaucratic arbitration  processes  that  severely disadvantage  you in favor of the Wall Street firms.  I always ask the same question when  the Republicans bring these measures  up here to gut consumer protections:  Who back home is asking for this? Who  is coming to the townhalls and begging  to repeal this rule? Who is asking you  to make  it harder to seek damages  when someone is being harmed by a big  bank?  Nobody is asking for this. In fact, as  KEITHELLISONsaid a few minutes ago,  there are 100,000 people who are beseeching us to support this rule to protect them out there. Nobody is asking  to repeal this rule or shut this rule  down.  I know who wants it here in Washington. It is the big money special interests, the so-called swamp. We can’t  let this happen. The American people  should be furious.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  oppose this reckless, shameful effort.  ",2017
264,House,115,0.538,59,2017-07-25,Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J.  Res. 111, which uses the Congressional  Review Act to disapprove and nullify  the rule issued by the CFPB on July 10,  2017.  Time and time again, we have seen  the CFPB abuse their power and authority  to  unilaterally  issue  rules  without seeking any input from Congress.  Since  its establishment, the CFPB  has displayed complete disregard  for  due process, as it has issued enforcement actions against companies that  are unjustly accused of wrongdoing.  Frankly,  the  CFPB’s  recent  antiarbitration  rule  is no different.  This rule would change the ability for  consumers to resolve disputes with financial services companies through arbitration, which has consistently provided consumers with expedient, efficient, and less costly resolutions.  In  short, making  consumers  pay  more for less is the exact opposite of  consumer protection, and is the reason  we need to reject this harmful rule.  I applaud the work of Chairman HENSARLINGand the other members of this  committee on this work to hold the  CFPB accountable.  ",2017

He  worked hard, and he got the job done  for the people of Ohio and the people of  this country. We will sorely miss him.  Best  regards  to his beloved wife,  Mary, and three children and the rest  of the Regula family. It was an honor  and privilege to know Ralph Regula.  ",2017
267,House,115,0.385,80,2017-07-25,Mr. RENACCI.," Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today to offer my tribute on behalf of  my predecessor, mentor, and most importantly  my friend, the late Congressman Ralph Regula. We not only had the chance to share the  same district but we celebrated  the same  birthday, something  that always made our  connection feel stronger.  Congressman Regula represented the 16th  District of Ohio in the United States House of  Representatives from 1973 until his retirement  in 2009. For  thirty-six years and eighteen  terms, Ralph Regula brought common-sense,  Ohio values  to Washington each and every  day.  Ralph came  to Washington, often  in his  ubiquitous red pickup truck, to do a job for the  American People. His was an office held  in  trust  for a  time and  then  relinquished with  grace when that season of his life was over.  Ralph Regula began his career as a teacher  and grade school principal. Throughout his  long career  in public service he always encouraged students who approached him  to  ‘Learn something new every day’ ’.  It was  more than advice: it was a heartfelt wish that  every young person he met would embrace a  lifetime of learning and go on to become the  very best versions of themselves.  As a public servant, Ralph Regula was a  thoughtful, conscientious man of  the people.  From humble beginnings as village solicitor in  Navarre, Ohio, Ralph brought his experience  as an educator  to  the Ohio Board of Education, and  from  there,  to  the Ohio state  house where he served in the Ohio House of  Representatives  and  the Ohio Senate.  In  1972, Ralph Regula was elected to Congress  to represent the 16th District of Ohio, an office  he always said he held in trust for the people  he represented back home in Ohio. His constituents sent him back to Washington eighteen times, asking for and receiving his best  service and  judgment on  their behalf  in  the  People’s House.  In Congress, Ralph Regula served most of  his tenure in the Committee on Appropriations.  Ralph would say he was one of the keepers  of America’s checkbook.  In  that role, Ralph  brought his own brand of fiscal conservatism  to bear on the great issues facing the United  States. As chairman of the Committee on Appropriations Interior subcommittee, Ralph was  instrumental  in securing  the  future of Cuyahoga Valley National Park.  I have no doubt that Ralph Regula will be  remembered for many things during his time in  Congress. I think his sense of fairness and his  bi-partisan approach  to  lawmaking will, no  doubt, be among the best attributes recalled  by his friends and colleagues. Debate ended  at the doors to the House, but the friendship  always endured.  Ralph was foremost, though, a family man.  The great love of his life, Mary, was his partner  through  thick and  thin. Partners  in all  things, Ralph and Mary built a  life  together  and  raised  three wonderful children: David,  Richard and Martha.  In closing, Mr. Speaker let me just say this:  It  truly was  the honor of a  lifetime  to know  Congressman Ralph Regula and call him my  predecessor, mentor, and my  friend. He will  be dearly missed by all.  f  RECESS  ",2017

270,,115,-0.281,150,2017-07-25,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to honor an outstanding Man of God,  Elder Ervin Peterson, who will celebrate his  20th Anniversary as the distinguished pastor  of New Hope Full Gospel Ministries, Inc. His  anniversary celebration will take place Thursday, August 3rd through August 5th, 2017 at  New Hope Full Gospel Ministries, Inc. in Albany, GA.  A native of Calhoun County, Elder Peterson  was born to Mr. Willie J. and Truezella Peterson, as one of eleven children, in 1955. He is  the loving husband of Minister Deborah Peterson, the father of (5) children, Mrs. Yolanda  Bryant, Mrs. Shamika Washington  (Clifford),  Ms. Jasmine Peterson, Ms. Audriauna Peterson, and Kamron Peterson; and, (8) grandchildren, William Bryant, IV, Deja Bryant, Jela  Bryant,  Bayleigh  Bryant,  J’Naia  Crapps,  Mariah Lumpkin, Calvin Grant, and Xavier Williams.  Elder Peterson was called  to preach  the  gospel in 1981 and was ordained in August  1982. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit  and the late Elder W.H. Norwood, Elder Peterson quickly  learned  the covenant, doctrine,  and ordinances of the Primitive Baptist Association of which he served as Moderator from  1995–1996. While many of his churches were  great distances away  from his home, he  served his members  faithfully no matter  the  distance, nor the task.  Ephesians 4:11–12  says  ‘And he gave  some, apostles; and  some, prophets; and  some, evangelists; and some, pastors and  teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for  the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the  body of Christ’ ’. In June 1997, after receiving  a vision from the Lord, New Hope Full Gospel  Ministries, Inc. was born. Elder Peterson and  a  few devoted  followers developed a small  ministry with firm foundation and a dynamic vision. Elder Peterson’s  love  for God and his  people is evident in the many lives he touches. A man of great integrity, he not only continues to labor for Christ, but he continues to  strive for excellence in his profession as a licensed plumber and HVAC technician.  Elder Peterson is a great and inspirational  leader, but none of this would have been possible without the love and support of his wife,  family, and  the New Hope Full Gospel Ministries, Inc. church family.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask my colleagues  to  join  me, my wife Vivian,  and  the more  than  730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second Congressional District  in  thanking Elder Ervin  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

Rapp  on his retirement from the U.S. Army and on  his receipt of the Distinguished Service Medal  for his 33 years of steadfast service. This exceptional achievement is proof of Major General Rapp’s commitment to ensuring our nation ’s safety and his dedication to educating its  military leaders.  Over  the course of Major General Rapp ’s  notable career, he has been sent on multiple  command tours and combat deployments. He  has also taken on numerous assignments in  critical and joint operations, displaying a wide  range of skill and expertise. From 2008  to  2009, he was appointed as the Commander of  the Northwestern Division of the Army Corps  of Engineers,  taking on  responsibility  for a  5,000-person organization and overseeing vital  projects. From  there, Major General Rapp  moved into the role of 72nd Commandant at  the U.S. Military Academy, West Point, where  he diligently supervised the leadership development and military training of 4,400 members  of the U.S. Corps of Cadets.  From 2011  to 2012, Major General Rapp  courageously served overseas as  the Commanding General of the U.S. National Support  Element Command  in Afghanistan, providing  logistical and administrative support  to over  190,000 individuals. He continued his service  during his next assignment as U.S. Army  Chief of Legislative Liaison. In that role, he developed,  coordinated,  and  executed  the  Army’s  strategic  communication  effort with  Congress, fostering and strengthening ties between the two bodies.  Major General Rapp’s dedication to serving  his country proved motivational to others, and  in June of 2014, he was named the 50th Commandant of the U.S. Army War College and  the Commanding General of the Carlisle Barracks. He worked tirelessly to inspire professionalism in students and to instill in them a  high level of strategic leadership and reflective  thinking. He has become a role model for not  only War College  faculty and students, but  also his own children, who have all pursued  military educations and careers. Major General  Rapp’s career exemplifies the highest levels of  service to the nation and reflects great credit  upon himself and the United States Army.

Last night, the Senate agreed to significant legislation on three fronts to  make the VA better and more responsive to our veterans.  Ranking Member TESTERand I have  spent the entire year working toward  making sure we dealt with the needs  the VA has so all these stories we see  on the  front page of papers, stories  about there being unsafe conditions,  stories about people being mistreated,  stories of people having to wait so long  for their appointments—we want to put  an end to all this, and we have given  the Secretary the tools to do exactly  that.  I was telling the ranking member  this is called ‘‘no excuses day.’’ Secretary Shulkin will have no excuses for  any mistakes to be made. Every tool he  needs in his toolbox to see that the  Veterans’ Administration  is  responsible to the veterans of the United  States of America passed in this Senate, passed in the House. There were  six major bills the first 7 months of  this year, a remarkable achievement, a  testimony to teamwork, to staff, and  to the leadership of the Republican and  the Democratic Parties. The majority  and minority  leaders of this Senate  made it possible for that to happen last  night. I am eternally grateful to both  of them for their support and help.  I am not going to read all the names  of the staff now because we are in limited time.  I ask unanimous consent that the  names  of  every  staff member who  worked with  the VA Committee  to  make it the best year ever be printed  in the RECORD.

275,Senate,115,-0.214,11,2017-08-03,Mr. TESTER.," Thank you, Mr. President.  I want to thank Chairman ISAKSON  for his work on the VA Committee. We  have gotten a lot of work done the first  part of this Congress because we communicated. We haven’t put up artificial  barriers. We sat down and all realized  taking care of our veterans is the cost  of war. We need to do it and live up to  the promises of these folks when they  signed up. We have done pretty good  work.  It is not only JOHNNY. It is not only  myself. It is also the people who have  served on that committee, many in the  Chamber right now. I want to thank  them for their commitment to making  sure we  live up to the promises we  made our veterans, but  it  is about  working together. It is about talking  to folks. It is about compromise. It is  about not digging in but moving together. This is a great country, and it  was built by people working together.  The VA Committee is a prime example of people working together. We set  aside our differences. We listened to  the veterans service organizations. We  let them drive the bus, to an extent.  We worked with Secretary Shulkin and  other leaders within the VA. We have  been transparent. We have been honest  when we disagreed. We haven’t embarrassed one another. Quite frankly, this  is the way it can work in this body  when we start from a point of agreement rather than disagreement.  We have two bills already signed into  law: an accountability bill, which holds  VA employees accountable to the veterans,  fires bad employees, protects  whistleblowers;  and  the  Veterans  Choice Improvement Act, which makes  VA the prime payer and reduces out-of-  pocket expenses for veterans. Then, the  bills passed last night to take care of  the disability appeals, some 470,000—we  are going to expedite that process and  bring it down from 3 years to 1 year.

Today we approved the user  fee reauthorizations for the FDA. We  have done the important work of passing these essential user fee agreements  out of the committee and have now debated and passed them on the Senate  floor.  The HELP Committee is filled with  strong personalities. These personalities reflect the passion and diversity  of opinion of millions across our nation  today. While we may disagree on certain policies, most of us can agree that  funding the drug, device, and biologic  centers of the FDA is essential.  Our  future scientific endeavors require a strong FDA that communicates  openly with the industry that it regulates, and this agreement sets up protocols to achieve that goal. A strong  FDA also requires clear steps for product review, and only through such deliberative actions can we bring more  competition and clarity to our drugs,  devices, and biologic products.  I have championed multiple provisions in this bill, but there are two I  would like to highlight today. First,  there is the counterfeit and diverted  drug  language. This  language makes  importation neither harder nor easier.  In fact, it doesn’t change importation  laws at all.

Rolando Herrera and Lorena Robledo were  both born in Mexico. Their families immigrated  to the Napa Valley to seek better lives and opportunities  for  their children. Lorena ’s  family  taught her to tend vines and grow grapes, and  Rolando was able to study enology and viticulture at UC Davis. When the couple met, ‘ ‘it  seemed like fate.’ ’  Rolando and Lorena  founded Mi Suen˜o  Winery in 1997, the same year that they were  married. Together they have built their dream  winery with  love, passion and deep understanding of  the art of growing exceptional  grapes and creating award-winning wines. As  Rolando says,  ‘farming and making wine  is  not science, it’s experience.’ ’  Rolando and Lorena believe  that creating  truly unique wines requires careful attention to  every stage of the winemaking process, from  start to finish. From choosing the right plot of  earth, to personally planting the vineyards and  selecting  the  most  attentive  distributors,  Rolando and Lorena have created a truly exceptional business and product. The White  House recognized the quality of their wines by  pouring  three different Mi Suen˜o wines at  state dinners. Earlier this year, the Smithsonian Institution honored them at their Fifth Annual Winemakers’ Dinner.  This month Rolando, Lorena and all  their  children will gather to celebrate their twentieth  Anniversary. Rolando and Lorena have developed different single-vineyard, barrel-selected  wines named after each of their six children.  Their brave story of  immigration,  incredible  hard work and passion is a perfect example of  what it means to live the American Dream.  Mr. Speaker, Mi Suen˜o Winery has been  producing quality wine for the past 20 years.  I am proud to have such a hardworking family  living in our community. It is fitting and proper  that we honor them here today.  f  H.R. 339, THE NORTHERN MARIANA  ISLANDS ECONOMIC EXPANSION  ACT  HON.

Too often, honest small  business  owners were  treated  like  criminals and had their bank accounts  seized by the Federal Government for  making  frequent deposits  from cash  sales.  The law at issue today is the Bank  Secrecy Act, which set up new reporting requirements for certain activities,  like depositing more than $10,000  in  cash. The purpose of the law is to limit  criminal business activity conducted in  cash, money  laundering, drug transactions,  and  criminal  enterprises.  Thus,  systematically  depositing  amounts just short of this threshold, is  deemed an illegal attempt to structure  bank transactions to avoid the reporting requirement.  Over the past 2 years, a number of  law-abiding small businesses with high  volumes of cash sales testified before  the Ways and Means Subcommittee on  Oversight describing just how this law  was being applied by the IRS and the  Department of Justice to seize their  bank accounts. Congressmen on both  sides  of  the  aisle  immediately  denounced this practice and sought to  have the seized amounts returned.  In October of 2014, the IRS changed  its policy on enforcement. Now it only  will seize funds of taxpayers where the  money is being deposited from an illegal source. H.R. 1843 codifies this policy change, excludes interest received  by taxpayers on the return of seized  property from tax, and provides notice  and hearing rights to taxpayers.  The IRS, however, is only one side of  the issue. United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions also must act to  right this wrong against these small  business owners. The IRS referred 255  petitions to the Department of Justice  from small business owners seeking the  return of their property. As of June  2017, the Department still had over 180  petitions to review. The Department of  Justice should and must work faster.  I thank Congressman ROSKAM, my  friend; and the Democrat lead cosponsor, my friend as well, Congressman  JOECROWLEY, for their hard work on  this legislation; and also the ranking  member of the Oversight Committee,  JOHNLEWIS, for his leadership on this  issue.  In closing, I want to take a look at  how the position taken by the IRS and  the Department of Justice affected a  small bakery in Connecticut. For almost 100 years—three generations—the  Vocatura family has operated a bakery  in Norwich, Connecticut. They  sell  sandwiches and fresh bread, lots of low-  dollar purchases. Until recently, they  didn’t accept credit cards; so most of  their business was in cash.  According to press reports, between  March 2007 and April 2013, the Vocatura  brothers made hundreds of deposits in  amounts ranging from $7,000 to $9,900.  The bank tellers told them that they  had to fill out lots of extra paperwork  for  deposits  over  $10,000,  so  the  Vocatura brothers made sure to deposit  their receipts more often. They didn’t  realize they were breaking the law by  consciously avoiding making deposits  over $10,000.  In May of 2013, the IRS enforced the  structuring laws and seized the bakery’s checking account with more than  $68,000 on hand. The IRS held on to the  Vocatura’s money for 3 years without  ever bringing a case before a judge. The  brothers filed a motion, demanding the  return of their money; and in 2016, the  IRS capitulated.  This story is similar to others that  we have heard. This legislation would  ensure that no other small business is  put in this position. I urge support on  both sides of the aisle for this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2017

283,House,115,-0.109,10,2017-09-05,Ms. SINEMA.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  Chairmen HULTGREN and HENSARLING,  Ranking Member WATERS, and Congressman HOLLINGSWORTH for working  with me on this bipartisan legislation  to  improve our capital markets and  help more small companies succeed.  As part of the JOBS Act, Congress directed  the Securities and Exchange  Commission to amend Regulation A to  allow small companies to raise up to  $50 million in offerings exempt from  full SEC registration. These amendments, known as Regulation A-Plus,  exclude certain potential  issuers,  including Exchange Act reporting companies.  As a result, thousands of companies  that already meet the SEC’s high disclosure requirements are ineligible to  use Regulation A-Plus to cost-effectively raise the  funds they need to  grow and hire employees.  That is why I have introduced this  legislation with  Congressman HOLto allow SEC  reporting  companies  access  to Regulation A-  Plus. It is a valuable pathway for small  businesses to raise money in an efficient, public, and transparent manner.  I am committed to working with my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  ensure that Arizona’s innovative small  businesses have every opportunity to  thrive, and I hope that Members will  join us today in support of this bipartisan legislation.  Again,  I  thank Congressman HOLfor working with me on  this commonsense, bipartisan bill.  ",2017

Mr. Howard was born on October 20, 1980  in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was raised in  the 7th Ward and graduated  from Sarah T.  Reed High School  in 1999. He was a nine  year veteran of the New Orleans Fire Department. He spent most of his career with the fire  department at  the Engine 6 station on Old  Gentilly Road, in the Desire neighborhood.  Mr. Howard went to Memphis, Tennessee,  with his colleagues, to compete in the Memphis Finest Hoops Fest basketball tournament  for  first  responders  and  law  enforcement.  While out with some of his colleagues after  the first set of games, Mr. Howard was struck  by a stray bullet and died instantly.  Mr. Howard loved the city and the people of  New Orleans. His legacy will forever be a part  of  the city and his dedication  to community  embodies the spirit of New Orleans. We cannot match the sacrifices made by Mr. Howard,  but surely we can try to match his sense of  service. We cannot match his courage, but we  can strive to match his devotion.  Operator Gregory ‘ ‘G ’ ’ Joseph Howard, Sr.  survivors include his wife Dominique Howard,  two sons: Gregory J. Howard, Jr. and Dillion  J. Howard; his parents: June Howard and  Gregory Newman, Sr., his sister Brittney Howard, a host of siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins,  nieces, nephews, and friends.

Florida A&M University provides qualified students with an opportunity  to  further  their education  through-the  Graduate Feeder Scholars Program (GFSP).  The success of the Graduate Feeder Scholars Program has enabled Florida A&M University to lead the nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the number  of students who acquire post-graduate degrees.  The program is celebrating 30 years of excellence at this year ’s 2017 Graduate Feeder  Scholars Conference, which will  take place  Wednesday, September  6  through Friday,  September 8, on FAMU’s campus. I would like  to commend everyone who has worked tirelessly and diligently in making sure our children have  the opportunity  to pursue  their  dreams and advance their education.  It  is  time  to expand  the Feeder Scholars  program to more HBCU’s and I know Florida  A&M is ready to assist in the process.  I am proud  to support  this wonderful program and acknowledge Florida A&M’s hard  work over the years. Again, congratulations on  30 successful years and  to many more  to  come.  f  100TH ANNIVERSARY OF  MARKTOWN  HON. PETER J.

287,,115,-0.402,80,2017-09-05,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with  great pleasure and admiration that I recognize  the 100th anniversary of the historic neighborhood of Marktown in East Chicago, Indiana. In  honor of this special occasion, the Marktown  Centennial  Celebration  was  held  at  the  Marktown Community Center Park on August  19, 2017. Events  included a remarkable exhibit,  ‘Marktown —The First 100 Years,’ ’ as  well as a walking tour of this noteworthy community.  In 1917, Marktown was constructed by Clayton Mark and designed in the English Tudor  Revival style by renowned architect Howard  Van Doren Shaw. The neighborhood was built  as a planned housing community for the people who worked at Mark Manufacturing, one of  the  first mills  along  Indiana’s  shoreline.  Marktown  is  largely known  for  its distinctive  design in which the cars are parked on the  sidewalks and the streets are purposed for pedestrian walkways. While only part of the original design was built, the community met the  needs of  the American workforce and  their  families in the Indiana Harbor. The concept of  Marktown is truly innovative and a shining example of American ingenuity in the early part  of the 20th century. In 1975, the community  was added to the National Register of Historic  Places, capturing Marktown’s historical and  cultural significance from the industrial growth  period in the Calumet Region. The importance  of the Marktown neighborhood contributes to  the history and culture of Northwest  Indiana  and our nation.  Today, the residents of Marktown, as well  as the members of the Marktown Preservation  Society and its president, Paul Myers, focus  their efforts upon the preservation of the historic homes  in  this community. The people  who  live  in Marktown  today are very proud  and protective of their neighborhood. Many of  the  residents descend  from generations of  family members who grew up  in Marktown,  and they continue to fight for the restoration  and preservation of this unique community.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in honoring and  congratulating  the historic neighborhood of  Marktown on the occasion of its 100th anniversary. The Marktown historic community is a  significant piece of the region’s past and will  always be  remembered and admired. The  commitment to preservation and the unwavering dedication of the Marktown residents and  members of the Marktown Preservation Society, and Paul Myers are truly admirable, and  they are worthy of the highest praise.  f  INTRODUCTION  OF  A  BILL  TO  AMEND THE INTERNAL REVENUE  CODE OF 1986 TO DESIGNATE THE  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AS AN  EMPOWERMENT ZONE  HON.

293,Senate,115,0.409,67,2017-09-14,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, is this  a partisan approach to healthcare? I  don’t think so, if Missouri does better.  There is a Democrat representing Missouri. There  is  a Republican  representing Missouri. Here is the good  news. We got the Republican on board.  We appreciate the Republican.  Let me tell you how this works.  I  like Massachusetts, I  like Maryland, I like New York, I like California,  but I don’t like them that much to give  them a bunch of money that the rest of  us will not get.  If you  live  in Massachusetts, you  don’t get twice the Social Security or  50 percent more than  if you  live  in  Pennsylvania. How can this happen?  ObamaCare,  for whatever reason,  favors four blue States against the rest  of us.  Now, our friends in Mississippi, like  South Carolina—we have a 31-percent  African-American population in South  Carolina—I think the highest in the  country  is Mississippi. Under  this  block grant approach, our friends in  Mississippi get a 900-percent increase.  How can that be? Well, that is money  that was going someplace else other  than Mississippi.  So what  have we  learned  about  ObamaCare? Rural poor, particularly  African Americans, don’t do so well.  These  four States—New York, California, Massachusetts, and Maryland,  they have a lot of high wage earners.  We have some rural poor States. Missouri is a very wonderful State, with  big cities and rural areas. How do you  get more money? Well, under this formula, you are getting money  that  would have gone  to  the  four other  States. So 50 to 138 percent of poverty,  and  there are  45 million people  in  America who fall in that demographic.  We can figure out how many live in  Missouri. We use that as the basis for  the formula. You are not limited to  spending the money on 50 to 138 percent of poverty, but that seems to be a  fair way to redistribute the money. By  2026, the goal is, no matter where you  live, Missouri, South Carolina, or California, you are going to get the same  basic contribution  from  the Federal  Government, regardless of where you  VerDate Sep 11 2014  05:37 Sep 15, 2017 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G14SE6.040 S14SEPT1 ",2017

Among other issues, Mr. Howell will be remembered  for  reforming  the Virginia Retirement System and  leading  the  first  transportation funding overhaul in 27 years.

298,House,115,0.447,20,2017-09-26,Mr. BISHOP of Michigan.," Madam  Chair,  I  thank Chairman SMITH for  yielding and  for his hard work and  leadership on this matter.  Madam Chair, I rise today to support  H.R. 2824, which would reauthorize the  Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood  Home Visiting Program. At its core,  MIECHV improve the lives of families  in at-risk communities, focusing on the  first years of a child’s life.  Like the chairman, I, too, have seen  firsthand its successes. I recently traveled to a Nurse-Family Partnership facility, which is a nonprofit that arranges home  visits  from  registered  nurses to low-income, first-time mothers.  I had the opportunity to meet the  nurses and the women who currently  are enrolled in the program. NFP facilities transform the lives of vulnerable first-time moms and their babies,  empowering them to build brighter futures and stronger  families, none of  which  would  be  possible  without  MIECHV funding.  I am proud to note that, like my previous  speaker, my  home  State  of  Michigan has already taken the initiative to invest significant funding for  the NFP facilities and other organizations, in addition to MIECHV funds, to  the extent that Michigan would now already meet the requirement proposed  in the bill.  I am particularly thankful for the  chairman’s  transparent  engagement  process within the committee, specifically, early on. I raised the concern  that  the  addition  of new  evidence  standards, along with substantial evidence  standards  already  in  place,  might be problematic, and I wanted to  ensure that home visitors were not  overly burdened by data collecting so  that they can care for the mothers and  the babies.  Both  of  these  concerns were  addressed with  the  amendments  contained in the chairman’s amendment,  and I want to thank Chairman SMITH  and Chairman BRADY for their leadership in addressing these concerns and  other concerns.  I want to thank the chairman for all  of his hard work, and I want to join  him and my colleagues in supporting  H.R. 2824.  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of  Illinois.

299,House,115,-0.402,20,2017-09-26,Mr. DOGGETT.," Madam Chair, across  our country, there are thousands of  children, thousands of  families, that  have a really big stake in what happens  with this bill.  I support evidence-based home visiting programs, and I support them not  just by talking about them, but by providing them the resources they need to  reach more children and make a difference in their lives.  This whole  program,  ‘‘home  visiting,’’ is a little bit of a misnomer.  This is not about going out to pay a social visit, to join a club or something.  This  is  about  skilled  professionals  working with young parents to help  them be the parents they want to be. It  is about  family values.  It  is about  strengthening and protecting families,  particularly disadvantaged families.  Our home  visiting  programs  give  these families the tools that they need.  I have seen how successful they have  been in San Antonio, in San Marcos, in  Austin, and across Texas.  A story was shared with me recently  when I met with Alaska and Jimmy  Martinez  from San Antonio. During  their first year in college, Alaska became pregnant. She felt she was going  to have to drop out of school, and then  they met with Susan, with the Nurse-  Family Partnership there in San Antonio, and she gave them some referrals  and some assistance. They were able to  learn more about the development of  their child and how they could prepare  their family for that child’s arrival.  Now, Alaska is about to finish her associate’s degree. Jimmy is pursuing his  business degree, and they are happy to  have a beautiful 2-year-old son.  That is the way this program is supposed to work so people don’t sink into  poverty. They are lifted up and so are  their children. This is just one of thousands of success stories from across the  country—the family that unexpectedly  finds they have a child with severe disabilities, or maybe just the more common experience of the family that has  a baby who cries all night long, and  they don’t know what to do about it.  Too often, that is the kind of thing  that ends up  in a slap here, a slap  there, and child abuse. Too often, it  ends up with that child just being put  in front of the television set instead of  working with the child to deal with  these real-life problems.  Some reforms were mentioned, alleged reforms, in this bill. I have served  on this subcommittee through a number of terms of Congress. We have had  some excellent witnesses, Republican  and Democratic, and I have yet to hear  a single witness call for a single one of  the changes that they are proposing to  impose on this program as obstacles to  its success.  We haven’t had an academic expert.  We haven’t had  a  stakeholder. We  haven’t had a single witness come forward and say: Please change this program so it cannot achieve the success  that it is having today.  This is an evidence-based program.  What does that mean? It means it is  based on fact, not just on hope or good  intention, as a number of our programs  are. It means there  is peer-reviewed  data showing that this program works  to  reduce child abuse and  to  solve  other problems.  The chairman, the advocate for this  bill, tells me that they recognize this  in the great Republican blueprint, and  they want to do more of this. Well, if  they want to do more of this, why are  they creating one obstacle after another and causing one group after another to oppose those changes?  What about the resources to get the  job done? As so many of the Republican  witnesses  before  our  subcommittee  have acknowledged, we are helping a  fraction of the children who are eligible for these kind of services.  I think you could call this bill the  Republican 6 percent solution, because  about 94 percent of eligible families in  America don’t get a penny of assistance out of this program.

Worse yet and even harder to believe,  the bill that Republican leadership is  rushing to the  floor  for a vote this  week  potentially  is  actually worse  than any previous versions of this legislation. The so-called Graham-Cassidy  bill they are hoping to vote on would  mean higher premiums for worse coverage and millions of Americans losing  their health insurance. It will permanently gut Medicaid. Let me say that  again. It will permanently gut Medicaid.

303,Senate,115,-0.454,69,2017-09-26,Mr. UDALL.," I say to Senator CORTEZ  MASTO, thank you so much. Thank you  for bringing the statements  forward  from  Chairwoman Torres.  She  has  every right to be concerned.  The short answer to her question is,  yes, we don’t want to go back. Chairwoman Torres is right to be concerned.  Tribal leaders across the country want  to know how this bill would impact  their  members,  but,  as  Senator  highlighted,  Republican  leadership has not  engaged  in  any  meaningful Tribal consultation.  I know that is something that concerns you a lot. Working with you on  our committee, you always raise that  issue—Tribal consultation and how important that is. That did not occur before these proposals were put before us.  Repeal of  the Medicaid  expansion  would pull millions of dollars out of  critical funding at the Indian Health  Service and would return the entire  system to life or limb. Medicaid funding at IHS has increased by over $240  million since the Affordable Care Act  passage, and that is an increase of 43  percent.  Under the ACA, Tribes and urban Indian health facilities have started offering  a  much  wider  range  of  healthcare services to Native Americans, such as OB–GYN, podiatry, and  behavioral health.  I have mentioned the old official IHS  motto several times: ‘‘Don’t get sick  after June.’’ This was a motto because  the Indian Health Service would run  out of money after June. So what people would say with regard to their  healthcare in Indian Country is ‘‘Don’t  get  sick after June’’—a pretty outrageous situation. In practical terms,  that motto translated to exactly the  sort  of healthcare  rationing Chairwoman Torres described in her letter.  Imagine  living  in  that  sort  of  healthcare system, where diabetics are  told that help is only available once  their kidneys start to shut down, where  expectant mothers can’t access prenatal care.  The reality is that Graham-Cassidy—  and we hope another proposal doesn’t  come forward like Graham-Cassidy; we  know they buried that today—would  turn back the clock in Indian Country,  taking us from this current era of Tribal healthcare innovation back to the  days of life and limb.  I thank Senator CORTEZMASTO for  her great advocacy for Native Americans. I know very well her work as  State attorney general.  I know  she  worked with Tribes and wanted to try  to work through problems rather than  litigate them all the time.  I wanted to say to your chairwoman  in Nevada that we really appreciate her  hard work on behalf of her Tribal members and other Tribes around the country.  I yield to the Senator from Nevada.  Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. I thank the  vice chair.  It is true that Indian Country made  significant gains under the Affordable  Care Act. Before the ACA, the Indian  Health Service regularly denied Tribal  members’ claims for basic care and preventive  services,  such  as mammograms, women’s health screenings, or  diabetes management care.  Because of the chaos the Trump administration  has  created  in  the  healthcare markets,  this problem  is  not being confronted, it is being exacerbated across the country. We have  seen it in Nevada. Insurers are pulling  out of the ACA exchanges  in rural  areas, thanks to the uncertainty these  continued efforts to repeal the ACA,  such as Graham-Cassidy, are creating  in the healthcare market.  Democrats are ready to work with  Republicans to fix the problems with  the Affordable Care Act. We want to  provide certainty that brings insurers  back into the health insurance marketplaces, lower premiums and prescription  drug  prices,  and  improve  healthcare. We can’t kick millions of  people—including the members of the  Walker River Paiute Tribe and the 27  other Tribes and community organizations in the State of Nevada—off of  their healthcare.  No one  in this country should be  forced to choose between paying their  medical bills and putting food on their  table. All too often, our Tribal members are confronted with  that very  choice.  I will not stop  fighting to oppose  these  efforts  to  take  away  the  healthcare of Native communities in  Nevada and millions more Americans  throughout our country. It is time we  work together.  I thank the vice chair.  I yield the floor back.  ",2017

305,,115,-0.484,111,2017-09-26,Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker,  today I rise to honor the continuous dedication  and hard work of Ms. Patricia McDermott. Ms.  McDermott  is an  invaluable member of our  community and longtime dedicated employee  of the Philadelphia Municipal Court.  Ms. McDermott, a trailblazer in the Philadelphia Municipal Courts, was the first woman to  be appointed to Deputy Court Administrator of  the Civil Division in 1996. However, her path  to arrive at this point was not easy. As a single mother, Ms. McDermott struggled early in  her career to find her footing within the court.  Nevertheless, she worked her way up the system diligently, starting in the Private Criminal  Complaint Unit, then moving to the First Filing  Unit in the clerical division, then to Assistant  Supervisor, then to Supervisor until she was  appointed to her current position.  Ms. McDermott has shown exemplary devotion and dedication  throughout her 43-year-  long career. She has done much good for the  City throughout her tenure, including her several renovation projects such as the combination of units work space at 34 S. 11th Street  2002 and the successful relocation of Municipal Court’s Civil Division  to The Widener  Building  in June 2012. Ms. McDermott was  also responsible for the implementation of a  nationally recognized electronic case management system known as C.L.A.I.M.S.  Ms. McDermott’s work is certainly admirable  and notable. A devoted wife and mother of  four children, she will always consider  the  Philadelphia Municipal Court to be her second  family. Mr. Speaker, please  join me  in honoring Ms. Patricia McDermott for the wonderful  work she has done and continues to do for the  Philadelphia Municipal Courts.  HONORING THE LIFE OF MR.

308,House,115,0.54,27,2017-10-11,Mr. OLSON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of S. 920, the National Clinical Care  Commission Act, a bipartisan bill that  has received unanimous support within  both the House and the Senate Chambers. S. 920 is the Senate companion to  my bill, H.R. 309, which is cosponsored  by over half of my House colleagues.  It has this level of support because  our Nation faces an epidemic. Diabetes  or prediabetes affects over 100 million  Americans. Nearly one in three of our  neighbors is affected.  This legislation will also help many  others who are affected by other diseases like heart disease, obesity, and  many others.  When I first came to Congress in 2009,  it was crystal clear that we had a big  problem. The benefits of all the Federal research dollars going into these  diseases were simply not making their  way to patients. Researchers at the  NIH, the CDC, the DOD, the VA, and  the FDA weren’t sharing diabetes research. Who knows? Sharing information may have put us on a path to cure  diabetes.  It was clear then, and it is still clear  today: we need a laser-like approach to  improve patient care by pursuing a  strong Federal focus on research.  This bill accomplishes that goal by  creating a National Clinical Care Commission comprised of doctors who specialize in diabetes care for patients.  This commission will have 3 years to  strengthen  the  partnership  between  Federal stakeholders and health professionals who will  bring hands-on,  clinical experience to improve care.  This is not a new, unending bureaucracy. After 3 years, this commission  will sunset. In 3 years, it will be gone.  We have already made such a huge  investment of taxpayer dollars into research. It is time to leverage that investment  into meaningful prevention  and effective treatment options.  President Reagan once said: ‘‘There  is no limit to the amount of good you  can do if you don’t care who gets the  credit.’’  That is why I stand here today in  strong support of my bill, which became Senator SHAHEEN’s bill, because  this bill will help so many Americans  who are suffering from diabetes.  So  today  I ask my colleagues  to  again help all those who suffer from diabetes and other complex metabolic  and autoimmune disorders by voting  for S. 920.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2017
309,House,115,0.57,27,2017-10-11,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, today I  rise in support of S. 920, the National  Clinical Care Commission Act, sponsored by Senator SHAHEEN.  This legislation has been around for a  while. It has been championed in the  House by our good friend and fellow  Texan, Representative PETEOLSON, as  H.R. 309. This bill has strong bipartisan  support. It passed this House unanimously earlier this year.  Diabetes and other  endocrine disorders have been a great cost burden on  Medicare and,  in  fact, our Nation’s  healthcare system in general. Thirty  million Americans have diabetes, 84  million Americans have prediabetes,  and three out of  four Americans on  Medicare have diabetes or prediabetes.  And $1 out of every $3 Medicare spends  is spent on diabetes.  This bill will establish a clinical care  commission  to  evaluate  and  recommend solutions for better coordination and use of Federal programs aimed  at improving care for people with diabetes and other related endocrine disorders. This commission will be tasked  with identifying gaps where new approaches are needed, eliminating duplication across Federal agencies, and  leveraging the Federal resources and  tools available to enhance the quality  of patient care.  I am confident their work will improve the lives of tens of millions of  Americans  living with diabetes and  with other endocrine disorders while  beginning the process of reducing the  staggering impact of these diseases.  Mr. Speaker,  I certainly want  to  thank and  commend our  colleague,  Representative PETEOLSON, for spearheading  this  important  initiative.  I  want to thank him for bringing it to  the floor of the House as many times as  he has. This has been a lengthy process, but today, with the passage of this  bill, we are voting on final passage, and  this bill will be sent to the President’s  desk for signature. Mr. Speaker, Mr.  OLSON’s long and arduous journey now  will be completed with the passage of  this bill, and we should all look forward to that.  ",2017

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in  strong support of S. 920, the National  Clinical Care Commission Act. S. 920,  as was mentioned already, creates a  commission  comprised  of  clinical  endocrinologists, other physician specialists,  primary  care  physicians,  healthcare professionals, patients, and  representatives from the Federal agencies most involved in diabetes care.  The  commission  is  charged with  making recommendations to streamline Federal investments in diabetes,  to improve the coordination and clinical care outcomes for people with diabetes, prediabetes, and other insulin-  related metabolic and autoimmune diseases.  Passage of this legislation will help  the Nation undertake more and innovative approaches to diabetes and its disease  complications,  for which  the  United States spends some $322 billion  annually.  I urge the Secretary also to move expeditiously to set up the commission so  it can begin its important work as soon  as possible. Clinical training and expertise in diabetes and other insulin-related diseases will be needed to lead  the commission, and it is my hope that  a clinical endocrinologist will be chosen to serve as the chairperson of the  commission. I think that is very important.  With a clinical endocrinologist as  chair and representatives from other  medical specialities, healthcare professions, and patient advocacy groups,  serving alongside with Federal diabetes  experts, the commission created under  S. 920 will help to ensure that new innovative medications and devices are  VerDate Sep 11 2014  03:27 Oct 12, 2017 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11OC7.047 H11OCPT1 ",2017

As we approach the 200th  anniversary  of  Frederick Douglass’  birth,  I urge my colleagues  in  the  House to support this legislation.  The purpose of this bill is more than  just honoring the birth of one great  civil rights leader. Its purpose is to recognize his lasting impact on American  Government, culture, and values. Frederick Douglass’ work stretched far beyond the fight for legal freedom into  the equally important fight for social  and cultural equality.  Born on Maryland’s beautiful Eastern Shore, Douglass escaped slavery to  become an author, abolitionist, and  true American hero. Frederick Douglass  is a model  for the values that  make our Nation great: equality, liberty, and a commitment to working  hard and helping others.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to  honor Frederick Douglass and the resounding impact his work has had on  modern American culture by passing  this legislation.  ",2017

Thomas Earl Petty was born on October 20, 1950, and, over a career that  spanned five decades, collected 28 top  10 hits, the most of all time.  But his contribution cannot be measured in hits or awards. He wrote America’s soundtrack. Tom Petty’s story  sounds familiar. He grew up in a small  town,  struggled, persisted, and  then  succeeded—a  true American Dream  story.  But it is not what he did; it is how he  did it that strikes us. It is the honesty,  wit, and sentimentality that made his  music special. Every hit Tom Petty  crafted became an anthem, each song a  score to the memorable moments of  our lives. American life would be much  diminished without his work.  Jefferson and Madison wrote our system. Twain wrote our story that described Early American folklore. Petty  wrote  our  songs.

315,House,115,0.522,48,2017-10-11,Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank my  colleague  for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise unscripted  to  bring to the attention of the entire Nation the plight of the good citizens of  Louisiana who were impacted by Hurricane Harvey last month. Beside me at  this graph shows the rainfall, the water  event of Hurricane Harvey as it impacted Texas and Louisiana.  b1830  As anyone can see, it was a tremendous water event, unprecedented rainfall, that overwhelmed any water management system. And, as anyone can  see, the parishes of southwest Louisiana were impacted, as well as many  counties in Texas, yet, as we discuss  disaster  relief, Louisiana  is  absent  from our conversation. I point out, to  all who would choose to witness, the  State line of Louisiana, as defined by  the Sabine River, and the impact of  Hurricane Harvey.  Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Harvey did  not  recognize  the  artificial  State  boundaries that we have created as a  Republic, nor should we as we provide  disaster relief  for our citizens. Just  after Hurricane Harvey had impacted  Texas and Louisiana, my office drafted  a letter to the executive branch to a  President that I admire and respect,  advising him of the impact, and begging his expedited approval of the disaster status once the formal request  had been submitted by our Governor.  Sometime  later,  just 2 weeks ago,  that formal request was submitted by  the Governor of our State. Just after  that submission, my office drafted and  submitted a second letter requesting  expedited approval of disaster status  for these citizens of Louisiana, who  were clearly just as impacted by this  storm as many citizens in Texas.  Tomorrow, we shall send a third letter, this time signed by the entire Louisiana delegation. I ask that the Nation  recognize the plight of the people I represent. The good and patriotic citizens  of southwest Louisiana are suffering.  I respect and admire my President, I  support him,  I have  supported him  since day one, and I support him still.  But it is important that we, as representatives of we the people, communicate clearly our intent and our service.  I beg that the leaders of the executive branch level would witness this  clear evidence of the need for disaster  declaration of the parishes of southwest Louisiana. And I beg that this  message  is  received with  the  spirit  with which it is delivered, which is respectful, yet in determined service of  the citizens whom I have sworn to represent.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague  for yielding these precious moments to  me.  ",2017

The Reverend Dr. A.V. Fisher was born the  sixth of seven children to Essie J. and Corine  Caraway Fisher in 1933 in Marshall County,  Texas. After graduating from Pemberton High  School, Reverend Fisher forged his own path  to become the first male student to graduate  Cosmetology at Valarie Hurd Beauty College.  In 1958, Reverend Fisher brought his expertise and work ethic to Fort Worth where he  opened his first beauty salon. Reverend Fisher  immediately transformed the salon into a community icon that caught the attention of Ebony  and Beauty Trade Magazines, ranking him as  one of the Top 100 Beauty Operators in the  United States. The Texas Legislature  joined  their high praise by honoring Reverend Fisher  for 50 years as a Hair Stylist and Beauty  Owner.  Following his successful barbershop career,  Reverend Fisher decided to embark on a new  chapter of  this  life by  transitioning  into ministry. He entered the Gospel Ministry in 1963  under  the  spiritual  guidance  of Reverend  James Warren and Dr. M.R. Lester, and later  became pastor of the Salem Missionary Baptist Church. As a Reverend, Dr. Fisher has  welcomed hundreds  to his church; baptized  many, ordained over 300 deacons, and  installed over 200 preachers as pastors all over  the United States. Additionally, Reverend Fisher’s service did not waiver. He  founded  the  Black Pastor ’s Association, coordinated  the  Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Service and  Prayer Breakfast  for 30 years, and helped  found the East Fort Worth Interdenominational  Ministerial Alliance. Reverend Fisher graduated from the New World Bible Institute, and  has received numerous awards  including an  honorary  doctorate. He  has  preached  all  across the United States and the Bahamas.  Reverend Dr. A.V. Fisher passed away on  Tuesday, October 3, 2017 and is survived by  his wife, Verdell Knighten, and  their  three  beautiful daughters, Avis Michelle, Ava LaNell,  and Adrain Van.

Queens College opened its doors on October  11, 1937, and ushered in the first class of students to the first public college in Queens. On  the first day of classes, Queens College President Paul Klapper remarked, ‘ ‘We are the pioneers of a new institution. We have no history  to look back to, but we can look forward to  progress.’ ’  Mr.  Speaker,  I  believe  that  President  Klapper would be proud to see the remarkable  progress that Queens College has made. The  Princeton  Review  has  continuously  commended the college for offering a world-class  education by an  illustrious  faculty  for an affordable price. It is no wonder that it places in  the top 1 percent of colleges that successfully  move its students from the bottom-fifth income  distribution percentile  to  the  top-fifth  income  distribution  percentile.  In  its  eighty  years,  160,000 students have become alumni. Some  have earned Pulitzer Prizes, Emmy Awards,  becoming CEOs, or achieved scientific breakthroughs. As an alumnus himself, I know that  Congressman CROWLEY is proud to join me in  commending Queens College for its steadfast  commitment  in ensuring  that students reach  their potential.  Queens College has not only cultivated a  reputation for investing in student success, but  also  for being one of  the most diverse colleges  in  the country. Students who are currently enrolled are  from 170 countries and  speak over 110  languages. Queens College  offers 69 undergraduate programs in the arts  and sciences. In its eighty years of operations,  the college has become a cultural hub for students  to pursue and achieve academic success in Queens.  I am proud  to stand with Congressman  CROWLEY to commemorate Queens College’s  80th anniversary.  I  look  forward  to seeing  what the future will bring for this trailblazing  beacon of higher education.

321,Senate,115,-0.502,18,2017-10-18,Mr. MARKEY.," Madam President, I  would like to begin by quoting David  Stockman. David Stockman was the  head of the Office of Management and  Budget in the Reagan administration.  He wrote a famous book after his tenure running the Office of Management  and Budget. It is called ‘‘The Triumph  of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution  Failed.’’ Let me read you a quote from  David Stockman’s book. This is what  he says:  The hard part of the supply-side tax cut is  dropping the top rate—the rest of it is a secondary matter. . . . Then, the general argument was that, in order to make this palatable as a political matter, you had to bring  down all of the brackets. But, I mean, [the  plan] was always a Trojan horse to bring  down the top rate.  I quote from David Stockman in his  book  ‘‘The Triumph of Politics.’’ He  wrote about how President Reagan sold  massive, deficit-busting tax cuts  for  the wealthy by making knowingly erroneous arguments, by making faulty  economic arguments.  As we stand here on the Senate floor  today, debating the Trump budget of  2017, we  focus on what Mark Twain  once  said: History does not  repeat  itself, but it does tend to rhyme.  This  looks  very much  like what  Reagan tried to pull off in the early  1980s, to no avail, and his book is very  clear as to why they were unsuccessful.  The Reagan-era promises of economic  growth and budget  surpluses  turned  out to be massive debt and deficits.  There is some kind of nostalgia, political nostalgia, for a Reagan era that  never existed and, instead, a painting  of a past that just has to be replicated  today. Let’s look at what David Stockman said he did and why it turned out  so unsuccessful for President Reagan.  The Republicans are back again with a  new budget, but they are using the  same old bag of tricks and gimmicks  from more than 30 years ago.  This is their plan, which is very simple, and it is identical: No. 1, claim unspecified funding cuts to many domestic programs many, many years in the  future;  No.  2,  assume  unrealistic  growth  from your policies that will  magically balance the deficit; and finally, No. 3, use those questionable  economic assumptions to provide massive tax breaks for the wealthy and big  corporations in our country.

322,House,115,-0.395,5,2017-10-25,Ms. BONAMICI.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to be on the floor this morning  to introduce bipartisan legislation with  my colleague on the Education and  Workforce  Committee,  Congressman  DREWFERGUSONfrom Georgia.  Our bill, Promoting Apprenticeships  Through Regional Training Networks  for Employers’ Required Skills Act, or  PARTNERS Act, will help close the  skills gap by increasing opportunities  for small- and medium-sized businesses  to establish apprenticeships and work-  based learning programs.  When I visit communities in northwest Oregon, I hear from many Oregonians who still feel left behind because  they don’t have the skills they need to  compete in today’s economy. They are  not alone. Many jobs today do not require a 4-year degree, but do require  more than a high school diploma. In  fact, those jobs make up about 53 percent of today’s labor market, but only  43  percent  of  today’s workers  are  trained at this level.  This creates a  skills gap,  leaving  businesses struggling to find workers  with appropriate skills, and workers  without meaningful pathways to better  paying jobs.  I hear from employers and workforce  organizations about the importance of  a qualified workforce. They want to  identify new opportunities to strengthen skills training.  Apprenticeships  and  work-based  learning programs are a win-win. They  provide individuals with paid, on-the-  job training and classroom instruction.  Employers can align training with the  skills they need at their workplaces,  and workers can learn while they earn.  Unfortunately, small- and medium-  sized businesses often lack the infrastructure and resources to establish apprenticeships or work-based  learning  programs on their own. So the PARTNERS Act addresses  this by establishing a grant program to support the  creation and expansion of industry and  sector  partnerships  that will  help  small-and medium-sized businesses develop work-based  learning programs  and  provide  support  programs  for  workers.  Industry and sector partnerships will  bring together employers, education,  training, labor, and community-based  organizations  to develop work-based  learning programs that benefit workers  and the economy as a whole.  In Oregon, these partnerships could  address, for example, workforce development needs in rapidly growing sectors like healthcare and technology.  Under the PARTNERS Act, the partnerships would use grant funds to recruit workers, develop  training curriculum, and provide workers with access to tools, work attire, transportation,  childcare  services,  and  mentorship  support.  These  support  services help businesses retain employees and help workers balance caring for  and providing for their families.  Importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill  results in no additional cost to taxpayers because it authorizes the use of  50 percent of the funds deposited in the  H1–B nonimmigrant petition account,  and these will be used by the Department  of Labor  for  the partnership  grants. This funding source was suggested by the administration in a June  2017  executive  order  on  apprenticeships.  Through  stronger  investments and  work-based learning programs, we can  build pathways  to get more people  back to work, to provide our Nation’s  businesses with the workforce that will  improve productivity and efficiency.  I thank Mr. FERGUSON for his leadership, and I urge my colleagues to join  us in supporting this bipartisan legislation that will help people in our districts across the country access good  jobs.  f  TAX REFORM  ",2017
323,House,115,0.65,12,2017-10-25,Mr. WOODALL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I had an opportunity to  mention  at  the  beginning  that we  might be debating the details of the  tax reform plan that does not exist  today. I see that we are, in fact, going  to do that.  There are a lot of studies out there  on this tax reform plan that does not  yet exist, but let me tell you that we  can all agree that we have the single  least-competitive Tax Code  on  the  planet today. We can all agree that  with the click of a mouse, a company  can transfer  its assets overseas and  grow jobs there instead of growing jobs  here.  Let us have the debate that we want  to have about who should bear the burden of American taxation. That is a legitimate debate and we should have it.  But let us not have the debate about  whether foreign workers should benefit  or American workers  should benefit  from American capital, because that  answer should be clear in the hearts  and minds of every single Member of  this Chamber.  We have an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to go from worst to first. Now, I  confess that I don’t actually expect to  get all the way to first. I will settle for  getting up in the top five and getting  out of the bottom five when it comes to  being able to lead in this country. But  I want to mention, Mr. Speaker, what  I think is a source of frustration of  constituencies on both  sides of  the  aisle, and that is the us-against-them  conversation that goes on day in and  day out.  I looked at the chart my friend from  Massachusetts brought down  to  the  House floor. It happened to be in university  colors of Georgia’s  red and  black, but I can see that as a representative of all the hardworking families in  my district, that chart didn’t do anything to inspire me about the impact of  tax reform going forward.  My friend quoted the Tax Policy Center. Now, The Wall Street Journal  called the Tax Policy Center a shill for  those groups that don’t want to see any  tax reform of any kind, but that is currently. The Tax Policy Center has been  doing research for a long time. The research my friend from Massachusetts  quoted was a study of a bill that does  not yet exist. The research I am going  to quote is of historical tax rates in  this country.  What my friends at the Tax Policy  Center said is that about 30 percent of  Americans—one-third of Americans—  pay no income taxes today; that the  Tax Code, as it exists today, protects  them from any tax liability at all.  Now, what we are proposing when we  get into fundamental tax reform, Mr.  Speaker, is to double the standard deduction. For those families that are already claiming the standard deduction,  we are talking about doubling it. Now,  the brackets are still in question, the  details are still in question, but we are  talking about doubling the number of  folks who don’t have to deal with the  IRS at all.  Today, about 30 percent of American  families don’t pay any income taxes,  VerDate Sep 11 2014  01:41 Oct 26, 2017 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K25OC7.022 H25OCPT1 ",2017
324,House,115,-0.472,75,2017-10-25,Ms. ADAMS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  Congressman BUTTERFIELD for yielding.  I just wanted to add that he was almost a Shaw Bear with his parents attending there. Just last year, I had the  opportunity to address Founder’s Day  to all of the students there.  Many  firsts Shaw boasts: the  first  college in the Nation to offer a 4-year  medical program, the first Historically  Black College in the Nation to open its  doors to women, and the first Historically Black College in North Carolina  to be granted an  ‘‘A’’ rating by the  State Department of Public Instruction.  Over the years, as Mr. BUTTERFIELD  has said, many scholarships have been  provided to those students. They have  encouraged the students to not only attend their divinity school, but we find  that many of them have become college presidents: the founder of North  Carolina Central, the first President of  Elizabeth City State, and North Carolina A&T State University were all  Shaw Bears, and we are delighted. So  the  lives  that  the General Baptist  State Convention has touched throughout its existence is beyond admirable  and almost beyond comprehension.  I want to close by saying that W.E.B.  Du Bois reminded us that of all the  civil rights of which the world has  fought for for 500 years, the right to  learn is undoubtedly the most fundamental.  So I praise the General Baptist State  Convention and  its  commitment  to  education, and Shaw University, as  well, for their charitable giving and for  their dedication to educating young  people through these 150 years, a century and five decades.

327,,115,0.29,131,2017-10-25,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor Mount Saint Dominic Academy  of Caldwell, New Jersey on the occasion of its  125th Anniversary.  Mount Saint Dominic Academy serves  the  surrounding community as an all-girls Catholic  College Preparatory School dedicated to the  education of young women from a variety of  ethnic, religious, and economic backgrounds.  The institution’s goal of inclusivity aims to both  inspire and empower students to realize their  unique gifts and talents in an academic atmosphere fostering excellence, respect, and diversity while at  the same  time  reinforcing  the  Christian-centered value of moral integrity.  The history of Mount Saint Dominic Academy began in 1892 with the Academy’s founding by the Sisters of Saint Dominic. Although  the Caldwell Dominican congregation was initially based  in Jersey City, New Jersey,  the  municipality was  ravaged  by  tuberculosis  throughout the 1880s. With the threat of contracting  the disease an everyday  concern,  Mother Mary Catharine Muth sought out a location for her ill sisters to recover. This refuge  was found twenty miles west of Jersey City in  the Borough of Caldwell. It was here where  Mother Catharine purchased the Harrison Estate on Roseland Avenue, a plot of land comprising of a small home and garden where  Mother Catharine  taught day students and  boarders, all the while, looking after her ill Sisters.  Over the next decade as the student body  increased, so did the necessity for larger quarters. In 1893, the cornerstone was laid for a  new Motherhouse  convent  and  school  in  Caldwell. In 1903, with the increased demand  in time devoted toward the education of New  Jersey’s  youth,  the  sisters decided  to  renounce  their cloistered  lifestyle and become  Third Order Dominicans.  By the late 1920s history repeated itself as  the school saw a greater  influx of new students. This influx led to renewed efforts to expand. Under Mother Joseph Dunn, the institute constructed a larger dormitory that came  to encompass both the school itself as well as  the residences for those boarding. More improvements and renovations were made under  Sister Germaine in the 1950s to add additional  classrooms, offices, and a larger library.  Recently, the academy has continued to improve upon  the  renovations  that  took place  during the twentieth century by continuing to  add more physical alterations and expansions  to the campus. Among these expansions has  been the construction of a new 19,000 square  foot  athletic  center  to  accommodate  the  growth  in participation within women ’s athletics. Furthermore, under the guidance of Sister Francis Sullivan, the school transformed its  former gymnasium  into  the Doris M. Byrne  Performing Arts Center which offers Broadway  quality experiences  for both performers and  patrons. These installments not only serve to  improve the experiences of students attending  the Academy, but are also available to benefit  the greater West Essex community as well.  Mount Saint Dominic Academy remains today  one of New Jersey’s foremost educational. institutions.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask  that you and our colleagues join me in congratulating Mount Saint  Dominic Academy on its 125th Anniversary.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

329,,115,-0.403,138,2017-10-25,Mr. DEUTCH.," Mr. Speaker, October 22nd  marked the 200th anniversary of the birth of  Baha’u’llah,  the  founder of  the Baha’i Faith.  There  are more  than  five million Baha’is  around  the world,  including  in my district  in  South Florida. Over the weekend, they came  together  to  celebrate  the  bicentenary  of  Baha’u’llah’s birth by honoring his life and his  teachings.  Like many  religious  leaders, Baha’u’llah  taught of the unity of mankind and the need  for us to work to build better communities and  a better world. Baha’is believe that Baha’u’llah  was God’s most recent messenger and that all  religions should live in harmony. This religious  tolerance is an important message in a world  where we too often see religious oppression.  In fact, Baha’u’llah was born in Tehran but  was imprisoned and exiled for his teachings.  Today, Baha’is  in  Iran are still openly persecuted for their faith. Baha’i youth are often  deprived of access  to higher education and  public  jobs, Baha’i-owned business are  frequently attacked, and Baha’i cemeteries are  desecrated  and  disrespected. Baha’is  are  vilified  in state sponsored media and  their  leaders are arbitrarily arrested and cruelly held  in Iran’s notorious prisons.  That  is why  I was proud  to  introduce H.  Res. 274 with a bipartisan group of colleagues  to condemn  Iran’s human  rights violations,  particularly its persecution of its Baha’i minority, and urge sanctions against officials who  have carried out these abuses. This resolution  passed unanimously through the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East  and North Africa, of which I am Ranking Member, and I look forward to moving it through  the full Committee and to the House Floor.  The bicentenary, though, is about celebration and shared optimism  for  the  future.  I’m  pleased  to  join with my colleagues  in congratulating Baha’is around  the world, and  in  Florida in particular, as they celebrate this festive and momentous occasion.

331,,115,-0.451,138,2017-10-25,Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to honor  the 120th anniversary of St.  Augustine ’s Episcopal Church  in Newport  News, Virginia.  St. Augustine’s Episcopal Church had humble beginnings. Originally known as Warwick  Parish, and then as St. Paul’s Church, its mission was started in 1897 with the intention of  providing a  religious community  for African-  American  Episcopalians.  The  church was  started with neither a full-time pastor nor an  official building, so the congregation ran their  early services out of  the upper  floor of  the  Columba Opera House  in Newport News.  Reverend Joseph F. Mitchell became the first  vicar for St. Paul’s Mission in the fall of 1897  and spent the next six years of his ministry  trying  to grow  the parish and raise enough  funds to afford to build a chapel for the congregation.  Under the leadership of Reverend Adolphus  A. Birch, the church ’s sixth rector, the name of  the mission was officially  changed  to St.  Augustine ’s Episcopal Church  in 1924. Reverend Birch’s successor, Reverend J.J. Posey,  oversaw the church’s move into their official  building on Marshall Avenue at Twenty-Sixth  Street in Newport News. The congregation still  meets at this location in a new church building  that was constructed in 1962 under the leadership of Reverend Lloyd M. Alexander.  Today, St. Augustine’s Episcopal Church is  home to a thriving parish life with a variety of  ministries and programs aimed at bettering the  congregation as well as  the Newport News  community. The Feeding Program was established in 1988 and offers hot meals to hungry  adults and children every month. The Twelve  Steps Program meets five days every week to  extend counseling, support, and mentorship  for men and women in the area who are struggling with substance abuse. The church also  sponsors a yearly  ‘Back  to School Drive ’ ’  which ensures  that  local children can begin  the school year with a backpack and school  supplies that they might struggle to otherwise  VerDate Sep 11 2014  04:58 Oct 26, 2017 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A25OC8.032 E25OCPT1 ‘ ‘ ",2017
332,House,115,-0.471,8,2017-11-06,Mr. TAKANO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 3122, as amended, the  Veterans Care Financial Protection  Act of 2017, and thank the bill’s sponsor,  the congressman  from Pennsylvania  (Mr. CARTWRIGHT),  for  introducing it.  Veterans who served during wartime,  and their spouses, may be eligible to  receive pension benefits if they meet  certain income and other eligibility requirements. Such veterans and  survivors may also be eligible for additional financial benefits, known as Aid  and Attendance, if the applicant needs  assistance performing personal  functions required in everyday living such  as bathing, feeding, and dressing.  Now, VA does not charge veterans  and their families to apply for Aid and  Attendance benefits. In addition, veterans  service organizations,  such as  The American Legion and VFW, offer  free assistance to veterans and their  families who wish to apply for this benefit.  Yet, in all parts of the country, some  individuals attempt to charge fees for  helping veterans apply for Aid and Attendance benefits. According to organizations, such as AARP and the Federal  Trade  Commission,  senior  veterans  have  increasingly become subject to  scams involving insurance agents and  financial planners trying to convince  veterans to make quick decisions about  pursuing Aid and Attendance in addition to their pension incomes. Some  scammers  use  false  representations  such as suggesting automatic entitlement to benefits.  Of greater concern, though, are those  who help the veteran restructure financial assets in order to qualify for pension and/or Aid and Attendance. For  example, moving financial assets into a  pooled-asset  irrevocable  trust might  render a veteran eligible for pension  and Aid and Attendance, despite having assets in excess of the qualifying  income thresholds.  While it appears that this would benefit the veteran, what these salesmen  do not tell them is that this type of restructuring might preclude them from  Medicaid eligibility because of rules  such as a  5-year  look-back period,  which  considers  whether  one  has  moved substantial assets at less than  market value.  H.R. 3122, as amended, would require  that VA post warnings on its website  about dishonest individuals who would  charge  fees  to  this very vulnerable  group of veterans and their families to  help beneficiaries apply  for pension  with Aid and Attendance benefits.  Now, this bill would also require GAO  to submit a report to Congress on the  types of standards used by Federal and  State agencies intended to protect vulnerable populations from financial exploitation, an analysis of the types of  financial exploitation facing veterans  who are eligible for Aid and Attendance benefits, and any other gaps and  efforts to address these issues.  H.R. 3122, the Veterans Care Financial Protection Act, enjoys broad bipartisan support in the House of Representatives as well as from our veterans service organizations. I want to  also acknowledge the work of the Subcommittee  on Disability Assistance  and Memorial Affairs Chairman MIKE  BOSTand Ranking Member ELIZABETH  ESTY for their efforts to protect veterans.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2017
333,House,115,-0.474,15,2017-11-06,Mr. RICHMOND.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to thank the gentlewoman  from the  Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for leading this Special Order and for the outstanding work that she has done as her  island, the U.S. Virgin Islands, recovers from two devastating hurricanes.  Being  from New Orleans,  I understand what two twin hurricanes can do.  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita ravaged  our city, our State, along with Mississippi, Texas, and the Gulf Coast. To  be very candid, the people of the Virgin  Islands, unfortunately, are doing this  too much on their own.  Part of what makes America exceptional, part of what makes us  the  greatest country in the world is that  when we find our citizens in a vulnerable position, through no fault of their  own, we come in as a government and  we help. When you look at the Virgin  Islands and the fact that the damage  they have received is more than their  capacity to rebuild, and it is through  no fault of their own, it is Mother Nature. It is an act of God.  Some would say it is global warming  and climate change, but it doesn’t matter what caused it. What matters is the  United States’ response to how we fix  it. So when we start talking about our  response to the Virgin Islands, it is a  great segue into Haiti and temporary  protective status.

The Wyoming Business Hall of Fame was  founded  in 2013 by  the University of Wyoming’s College of Business,  the Wyoming  Business Alliance/Wyoming Heritage Foundation, and  the Wyoming Business Council.  It  recognizes those who go above and beyond  for  their businesses and  their communities.  Lois, Patrick, Paul, and Maury each have  made an excellent example for their families,  friends, and residents across the state through  their hard work, leadership, and tenacity.  This year ’s inductees have been successful  in their businesses and have become integral  parts of their communities:  Throughout  her  impressive  career,  Lois  Herbst has helped run her family’s ranch, the  Herbst Lazy TY Ranch LLP, and has served  on many state agriculture boards. She was inducted  into  the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of  Fame in 1999, and has served as the president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association,  the  first and only woman  to hold  that  post, as well as on the Wyoming State Grazing Board.  Since taking over operation of their father’s  business, Cyclone Drilling, Patrick and Paul  Hladky have expanded it into a business that  employs more  than 700 people, operating  throughout  the Rockies. They are active  in  their community and believe that economic development depends on an educated workforce. This belief has driven their commitment  to  supporting  educational  opportunities  throughout Gillette and the state.  Maury Brown  is  the owner of  two businesses in Wyoming: Town and Country Supermarket Liquors, and Maurice Brown Exploration. He is dedicated to philanthropy, receiving multiple local awards, including the 2013  Greater Cheyenne Chamber of Commerce ’s  Person of  the Year award.

337,,115,0.375,64,2017-11-06,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Falling Spring Elementary School  on being honored as a 2017 National Blue  Ribbon School. The outstanding nomination  from  the Pennsylvania Department of Education comes after a vast amount of activities  and efforts which were  implemented at  the  Falling Spring School  for  the betterment of  their students.  Falling  Spring  Elementary  School  has  shown outstanding academic achievements  through continual improvements of resources  and materials provided to the students, the application of strategies that engage students in  their  learning, maximizing  instructional  time  with students, and presenting a model of expected outcomes for students to follow. The  integration of SMART boards and  iPads  in  each classroom allows for teachers to better  incorporate  realistic examples of materials,  motivate students with fun activities, and provide more direct communication.  Not only is Falling Spring Elementary laser  focused on student learning, but it also offers  additional opportunities for students to grow.  The school garden allows students in grades  K–5  to come  together as one  through planning, planting, and maintaining garden beds,  and provides them the chance to have fresh  produce tastings in the fall and spring. In addition to the school run garden, they also have  a  recycling and composting program where  students assist with composting and recycling  of materials from within the school cafeteria.  Falling Spring Elementary School offers a  wide variety of clubs that appeal to the interests of all students. These clubs range from  the STEM  club with activities  focused on  science, technology, engineering and math, to  the Compassion  in Action club which has  raised awareness for kindness in the school  and the community. One exemplary program  offered at Falling Springs is the SOAR or Student Leadership club. Over the years, SOAR  has developed the school pledge, addressed  bullying  issues, and organized a positive  incentive program. The school has also incorporated a Parent Teacher Association which  consists of parents who are deeply committed  to supporting students and contributing to the  success of the children within their community.  Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to congratulate  the students, staff, and parents of Falling  Spring Elementary School for this outstanding  nomination. The level of care and dedication  to the success of the students necessary for  an award such as a Blue Ribbon School  is  clearly shown  in Falling Spring Elementary  School, and it is an honor to recognize them  for this wonderful achievement.

338,House,115,-0.299,12,2017-11-15,Ms. TITUS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in opposition to the Republican’s tax  scam that has been jammed through  this Chamber without normal order,  without public debate, and without  consideration for our Nation’s future.  I represent the heart of Las Vegas, a  city that was one of the hardest hit  during the financial crisis. Many of my  constituents are just beginning to recover from the worst financial crisis  since the Great Depression, and this  tax  bill will  greatly  hinder  their  progress.  Some 20 percent of my constituents  itemize their deductions, the vast majority of whom earn under $75,000 per  year. These families will all see a tax  hike if this bill becomes law because  the deductions for student loans, medical  expenses,  sales  tax,  and  some  mortgages will all disappear.  The sad reality is, they won’t just  feel the hit on April 15, tax day. They  will feel it every single day. The deficit  that this bill will create will lead to  State and local governments missing  out on needed Federal  funding, and  they will either have to slash vital programs or raise taxes at that level. If  the Senate has its way, they will cut  Medicare by $25 billion and repeal the  ACA. This is not a tax reform. It is a  system that will be rigged.  f  NATIONAL ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE  AWARENESS MONTH AND FINDING A CURE  (Mr. YODER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2017
339,House,115,0.563,12,2017-11-15,Mr. YODER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize the month of November as National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month and to highlight  the need for continued funding to find  a cure.  In 1983, when President Reagan designated this month to help raise awareness for Alzheimer’s, there were less  than 2 million Americans who suffered  from  this disease. Today,  there are  nearly 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer’s.  Finding a cure to this disease is a  smart health policy decision we can  make, and it might also be the most  critical economic proposal. The cost of  caring for Alzheimer’s patients in the  U.S. was estimated to be $236 billion in  2016, which is more than $200 billion  greater than the total funding for research provided by the NIH for all diseases.  Investments in research have led to  some great news in Kansas. The University of Kansas announced that  it  will participate in the trial of a new  drug intended to prevent or delay Alzheimer’s. Further, KU researchers are  continuing to work on other preventative studies.  Mr. Speaker, as we must continue to  provide resources that we need to find  a cure for this disease, I am proud of  the work being done at KU and across  the Nation. We will continue to be relentless  in  our  fight  to  cure Alzheimer’s.  f  DEPORTED VETERANS  (Mr. VARGAS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2017
340,House,115,-0.391,12,2017-11-15,Mr. VARGAS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today on behalf of veterans of  the  United States Armed Forces who have  been unceremoniously deported.  In the 1990s, the  immigration  law  changes eliminated judicial discretion  and reclassified many low-level, nonviolent offenses as aggravated felonies  mandating deportation. As a  result,  the United States has banished an unknown number of veterans. In many  cases, these were minor offenses committed by veterans who succumbed to  the difficulties of readjusting to civilian life.  Many are combat veterans who sustained physical wounds and emotional  trauma in conflicts going back to the  war in Vietnam. This banishment effectively denies these men access to often  critically needed medical care.  Regardless of immigration status, all  U.S. military veterans are entitled to  treatment at the Department of Veterans Affairs medical  facilities, yet  very few of these deported veterans are  granted the necessary waivers to access the care either in the States or  abroad.  In fact, most of these veterans, the  only way they are going to return is in  a box, dead, because they do have the  right to be buried in a veterans’ cemetery. Let’s do the right thing and bring  these veterans home so they can get  the care they need.

341,House,115,0.491,19,2017-11-15,Mr. ROTHFUS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the chairman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  rule and the underlying legislation.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we are  considering today is the culmination of  years of work, years of listening to the  concerns of hardworking taxpayers at  home, and several elections where the  people spoke out for relief from a broken, special-interest laden Tax Code.  Here are the questions we need to be  asking today:  Are you tired of the status quo?  Do you think we can do better than  the slowest economic recovery since  the Great Depression?  Do you want a healthier economy  that  creates  the opportunities  that  offer you a real chance to get ahead,  puts more money in your pocket, and  helps you fulfill your American Dream?  If you answered yes to any of these  questions, then the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act is for you.  As I travel across my district, I hear  story after story  from  families with  nothing  left over at the end of the  month, who are struggling to save for  retirement, pay off  loans, or simply  make ends meet.  It doesn’t have to be this way. There  is a better way.  We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix this. We can act now  to put more money back into the hardworking  taxpayers’  pockets, make  American business more competitive,  and create a much healthier economy.  Americans have toiled under a broken Tax Code filled with loopholes and  special interest carve-outs for far too  long. This  legislation—the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act—is a giant step for everyday Americans looking to get ahead.  This is for the family of four, making  $59,000 a year, who can save $1,182 a  year in taxes. This is for the single  mom, making  $30,000 working night  and day to support her two children,  who will also save more than $1,000 a  year in taxes.  Our legislation doubles the standard  deduction,  so people won’t have  to  itemize their tax returns. It expands  the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600  and provides a $300 credit for adult dependents living at home. It will create  more jobs in Pennsylvania and raise  Pennsylvania’s families’ incomes.  It will bring dollars back to America  to be invested in American companies  with American workers.  It will empower the people of America who want  to get ahead, and it will lessen the  power of Washington, D.C.  Vote for freedom, vote for prosperity,  vote for this rule and this bill.  ",2017
342,House,115,0.319,19,2017-11-15,Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I stand in strong support of  the rule and the underlying legislation.  Sometimes, in order to understand  what is going on in the present and  then what could happen in the future,  you need to go to the past.  Let me read something from a true  Irish-American President who said:  ‘‘Our true choice is not between tax  reduction, on the one hand, and the  avoidance of large Federal deficits on  the other. It is increasingly clear that  no matter what party is in power, so  long as our national security needs  keep rising, an economy hampered by  restrictive tax rates will never produce  enough revenues to balance our budget—just as it will never produce enough  jobs or enough profits. . . . ’’  ‘‘ . . . only full employment can balance the budget, and tax reduction can  pave the way to that employment. The  purpose of cutting taxes now is not to  incur a budget deficit, but to achieve  the more prosperous, expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.’’  I  understand  that  there  are  differences of opinion on what we are trying to do, but, please, let’s talk about  the facts. Let’s talk about a piece of  legislation that is a rising tide that  will lift all boats.  We are going to cut taxes for every  American at every income level. We  are going to reduce taxes by almost  $1,200 for every average-sized, middle-  income American  family. This puts  more money in the pockets of our families. I don’t care how they vote or how  they registered. They are Americans.  It reduces by almost $2,000 for every  average-sized, middle-income family in  Pennsylvania’s Third District. That is  a $2,000 reduction for them.  It will grow our national GDP by 3.6  percent.

343,House,115,0.62,40,2017-11-15,Mr. COMER.," Mr. Speaker, I move to  suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2672) to designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 520 Carter Street in Fairview,  Illinois, as the ‘‘Sgt. Douglas J. Riney  Post Office’’.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:  H.R. 2672  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SGT. DOUGLAS J. RINEY POST OFFICE.  DESIGNATION.—The  (a)  facility  of  the  United States Postal Service located at 520  Carter Street in Fairview, Illinois, shall be  known and designated as the ‘‘Sgt. Douglas  J. Riney Post Office’’.  (b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law,  map, regulation, document, paper, or other  record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to  be a reference to the ‘‘Sgt. Douglas J. Riney  Post Office’’.  ",2017
344,House,115,-0.236,40,2017-11-15,Mrs. BUSTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  in support of my bill, which  would designate the post office in Fairview, Illinois, as the Sgt. Douglas J.  Riney Post Office.  Sergeant Riney, who died on October  19, 2016, of wounds received from hostile enemy forces in Kabul, Afghanistan, lived a life dedicated to service.  After he graduated from Spoon River  Valley High School, Sergeant Riney became a volunteer firefighter with the  Fairview Fire Protection District. He  was known as a man who could always  be counted on by his community, a  man who felt a calling to public service. He joined the Army, entering Active Duty in July of 2012.  Sergeant Riney was deployed as part  of Operation Enduring Freedom from  July 2014 to February 2015. In June of  2016, he was again deployed to Operation Freedom’s Sentinel.  As part of the Support Squadron, 3rd  Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division  from Fort Hood, Texas, Sergeant Riney  excelled at his work.  Throughout his time in the Army,  Sergeant Riney was repeatedly recognized with commendations,  including  the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and  the Army Commendation Medal.  At home, Sergeant Riney lived with  his wife, Kylie, and their two children,  Elea and James.  He is survived by his loving family:  his  father and his stepmother, Dave  and Kristie Riney; his mother and stepfather, Pam and Don Boland; his brother, Jeff Budd; his sister, Stacey Budd;  two  stepbrothers,  Bryce  and  Kole  Vaughn;  and  one  stepsister, Ashlie  Herrin.  On the fateful day of October 19, 2016,  our Nation lost one of its finest, and  the community of Fairview lost one of  its best.  The naming of the Fairview Post Office is just a small token of our appreciation for Sergeant Riney, who made  the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation.  While we can never fill the hole left  in the  family, the Fairview community, or the Nation, I hope this post office will serve as a proud commemoration of a man who dedicated his life to  serving others and as an inspiration for  those who just hear his name.  On behalf of the hardworking men  and women of the Illinois 17th Congressional District, I will never forget the  service of Sergeant Douglas Riney, and  we will always honor his sacrifice.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues  for the consideration of this bill.  Mrs.  WATSON  COLEMAN.  Mr.  Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I yield back the balance of my  time.  ",2017
345,House,115,-0.487,96,2017-11-15,Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank our ranking member  for yielding and for all of his incredible  work on this bill.  Mr. Speaker, we were promised tax  reform, but that is not what we are seeing in this bill. In fact, you don’t have  to dig far into this 429-page bill to see  that it is a con, a cynical bait and  switch for families at home.  When this bill was released  just 2  weeks ago, I started getting calls from  families at home wanting to know how  it would affect them. We dug into it,  and I want to share just a few of those  examples, but it didn’t take long to see  why it was developed in secret and why  it is being rushed to a vote.  On page 254, Republicans propose getting rid of a program that helps veterans find work when they come home.  300,000 veterans have been helped by  the work opportunity tax credit. The  repeal of this provision to reduce taxes  for the very wealthiest is a coldhearted  way to say thank you for your service.  On page 113, this tax scam sends a  bill to 9 million households who have  extremely  high medical  costs. Tax  breaks for billionaires are expensive;  we get that. Under this plan, Americans who live in nursing homes, have a  sick child, high medical costs will foot  the bill.  On pages  95 and  97,  students get  added to the list of Americans who will  be  forced to pay  for the GOP’s tax  breaks for corporations. They will see  increased debt and taxes.  This bill says: Good luck, students.  Building an economy  that will not  allow you to pay off the $1.3 trillion of  existing student debt but, instead, will  add $2.3 trillion in deficit, this bill was  created for you.  Just yesterday, the President’s chief  economic  strategist  was  surprised  when the CEOs gathered admitted they  would not be investing their tax cuts in  jobs and wages.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  GARRETT). The  time of  the gentlewoman has expired.  ",2017
346,House,115,0.298,96,2017-11-15,Mr. REED.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  chairman for all of his hard work in  putting this bill together.  Mr. Speaker, this bill has been in the  process for over 7 years in regards to  the time I spent on the committee.  There have been multiple hearings on  the issue of tax reform, well over 40-  plus. There have been hours upon hours  of debate.  There were  efforts  done  by  our  former chairman, Dave Camp. I know  my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle have recognized, during our committee markup process, the hard work  that Chairman Camp did with rewriting the entire Code from the bottom  up.  These issues have been out there for  the American people and for the people  from across the country to look at, to  digest. Now is the time to rise in support of this legislation, Mr. Speaker,  because what we have before you is a  new Tax Code for the 21st century.  Mr. Speaker, we have a Tax Code  that is going to, for once in 31 years,  put our corporations on  the multinational level across the world in a  competitive position by lowering the  rates and getting to a 21st century taxing program on a territorial basis.  Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, we  deliver tax relief. I know the folks on  the other side aren’t going to agree  with this because they are going to say  this is a Tax Code for the rich, this is  a Tax Code, tax reform for the rich and  the almighty 1 percent.  But, Mr. Speaker, I have done the  math. I have looked at this bill inside  and out, and it delivers a simplified  Code where $1,600 is left in the pockets  of my constituents  in western New  York. That is $1,600 that they earned  that the government won’t have to  take from them anymore; $1,600, Mr.  Speaker, that will allow them, as senior citizens, to go visit their grandkids  in the South because New York State  has driven them out of New York State  with its high tax policies at the State  capital. That is $1,600 that maybe they  can go on a trip with their family and  experience a little relaxation because  of the hard work that generated those  moneys and those dollars in their pockets.  Mr. Speaker, these are the people  whom we represent, the Perrys. Mr.  and Mrs. Perry are hardworking people  of western New York, and those are  their two beautiful children. What this  is going to allow them to do is get a  little bit more of their money kept in  their pocket so they can spend a little  bit more  time with  their kids and  enjoy the fruits of their labor.  b1800  Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues  on  the other  side advocate because  there is another issue with tax reform  that I want to highlight real quick.  The easy approach of government is  to spend more money, develop more  programs, and maybe give a little bit  in regards to a government welfare  check. But what this Tax Code and reform does is deliver a job opportunity  for these people, and I don’t know a  better program in America that serves  more people than an honest day’s work  and an honest paycheck and an honest  job, and that is what this Tax Code will  do.

350,,115,-0.53,173,2017-11-15,Ms. MOORE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce legislation to make a commonsense update to the Selective Service Registration system.  As my colleagues know, our country has  long recognized the moral dilemma faced by  those with strong religious or moral grounds  against serving in the military and engaging in  war. As noted by the Supreme Court in Welsh  vs. United States, there are many in our country  ‘whose consciences, spurred by deeply  held moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, would  give  them no rest or peace  if  they allowed  themselves to become a part of an instrument  of war.’ ’  Historically, Congress has provided for alternative service or exemption from service for  those whose scruples and conscience cannot  allow them to participate in combat or in any  form of military service.  In  today’s all-volunteer military,  those who  have moral objections to participating in war  can opt not  to  join  the military. However,  under the Universal Military Training and Service Act, all men between the ages of 18 and  26, including conscientious objectors, are still  required to register for a national draft, should  Congress authorize one.  My bill would  require  that  the Selective  Service provide registrants, at the time of registration, with the option to indicate a desire to  be classified as a conscientious objector.  My bill would make clear that simply making  that indication at registration does not bind the  U.S. in any way and does not assure that the  registrant will be so classified.  Finally,  the bill would allow  the Selective  Service system to also accept, at the time of  registration, written statements in support of a  conscientious exemption claim.  I want to be clear that the legislation does  not change current requirements for how such  claims are handled. Under current law, those  who pursue a conscientious exemption  from  military service during a draft can only put forward an actual claim, with supporting evidence, after they get an induction notice.  Again Mr. Speaker, our nation has a history  of  recognizing, as noted by  the Supreme  Court in Gillette v. United States, ‘ ‘the situation  of conscientious objectors to war, who, absent  special status, would be put to a hard choice  between contravening  imperatives of religion  and conscience or suffering penalties.’ ’ My bill  simply tries to make the process of registering  those objections more direct and  straightforward.  f  HONORING DR.

351,,115,-0.283,173,2017-11-15,Mr. SMITH of Washington.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  to  honor  and  congratulate Dr.  Jack  Bermingham,  the President of Highline College, on his retirement.  Dr. Bermingham’s academic career began  in 1979, upon earning his Ph.D.  in History  from  the University of California, Santa Barbara. After serving on the faculty of the University of  the West  Indies  in Jamaica, he  moved to Washington state where he later became the Dean of Social Sciences at Pacific  Lutheran University. His career at Highline  College began  in 1994 when he  joined  the  College’s administration as Academic Vice  President. His career at Highline progressed  and he was appointed  to serve as  the college’s President in 2006.  During his  tenure at Highline College, Dr.  Bermingham  fought  to  further education on  many fronts. He expanded the College ’s collaborations with businesses, K–12 schools,  four-year  institutions, and  local organizations  in order to improve the community’s access to  education. Under his  leadership,  the college  began offering  four-year degree programs,  among them the Bachelor of Applied Science  in Cyber Security, which received regional, national,  and  international  recognition.  Dr.  Bermingham also served on numerous boards  and committees at the national and regional  level.  Dr. Bermingham has also been a leader in  international education. He has presented at  international conferences, including in Turkey,  Hong Kong, and Botswana. He served as  Chair of the Executive Committee of the Board  of Community Colleges for International Development, which also recognized his outstanding  work in international education in 2005. That  same year, he was also recognized by  the  Polytechnic of Namibia  for his  instrumental  role in the success of that institution’s international partnerships. Additionally, for the past  seven years under Dr. Bermingham’s presidency, Highline College has hosted the Pacific  Rim Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition  which attracts teams from international universities and institutions.  Throughout his career, Dr. Bermingham has  been an ardent champion of diversity and social justice. Highline College has become the  most diverse higher education  institution  in  Washington state.  It  is also a place where  many  immigrants and  refugees begin  their  journey to achieve their academic and professional dreams. Highline College was awarded  the Equity Award  from  the Association of  Community College Trustees in 2016, and for  the last four years has been awarded the High  Education Excellence in Diversity Award. Dr.  Bermingham made  it a priority  for Highline  College and their faculty to serve all students,  regardless of color, creed, ethnicity, or economic situation.  Dr. Bermingham’s legacy is one of harmony,  inclusion, and academic excellence. He has  proven himself to be a tenacious leader, and  has also shown to have the ability to connect  with people  through kindness and compassion. He will be greatly missed at the college  by faculty, students, and the community.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I  congratulate Dr.  Jack Bermingham on his  twenty-three years of service at Highline College and wish him the very best in his retirement.  f  EMERGENCY SERVICES AWARDS  HON.

355,,115,-0.438,1,2017-12-01,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in honor of a native son of Baltimore,  Maryland, Mr. Reginald F. Lewis.  Let me also acknowledge the presence of many of the Lewis family members in the gallery, including his mother, Carolyn; widow, Loida; daughter,  Leslie; and brother, Anthony.  From November 30 to December 1,  1987, 30 years ago, Mr. Lewis negotiated  the $985 million leveraged buyout of  Beatrice International Foods. At the  time,  it was  the  largest  leveraged  buyout  of  an American  company’s  overseas assets, and it led to the creation of what the New York Times  identified in 1993 as the largest corporation in the United States led by an  African American.  Mr. Lewis’ accomplishments changed  the face of American business forever  and opened new doors of opportunity  on Wall Street. His substantial philanthropic gifts have also continued to  benefit Baltimore and, indeed, the Nation. They help young Americans of  color to dream bigger, and in Lewis’  own words, to ‘‘keep on going, no matter what.’’  I invite everyone to join me in celebrating and honoring Reginald Lewis’  memory and extraordinary accomplishments.  f  NORTH  CROSS  CONGRATULATING  HUNTERDON  WOMEN’S  COUNTRY TEAM  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)

380,Senate,115,-0.318,36,2017-12-01,Mr. WYDEN.," I am very pleased that  my colleague  from Vermont  is discussing this issue on the floor. The Finance Democratic staff has been looking into this and has been working also  with the Senator’s staff, and I think  that it would be fair to say that every  few hours, this bill just seems to get  worse. I mean, we don’t know if, in the  middle of the night, somebody will add  another round of favors for the powerful interests, the politically well connected. What I can tell the Senator is  what we have been able to put together  as of now.  In 2004, legislation was written that  we were very much involved in that  helped eliminate the loophole by requiring U.S. citizens to be bona fide  residents of the Virgin Islands and imposing U.S. tax on income effectively  connected with  the United States.  Now, in the dark of night, as I have indicated, it appears that we have a provision that is relaxing this rule.  From our conversations, I know the  Senator understands that we all want  to help the people of the Virgin Islands  after a devastating hurricane. Are we  helping people by creating a huge, new  loophole, possibly  for a handful of  those people who are especially well  connected and can get to the Finance  Committee? I am convinced that if one  looks at the Paradise Papers and the  Panama Papers, what they were warning about in those papers was of all of  these efforts to stash money and create  new options for people to wheel and  deal in offshore accounts.  So my colleague is right. I continue  to wonder why, when we want to ask  these really important questions about  special  interest  favors and when we  look to the other side, we have this  barrier between both sides of the aisle.  We need somebody here to explain to  us and explain to the American people  how this has seemed to just fly out of  the sky.  I am very appreciative of the Senator’s raising a question about what  looks like yet another scam that has  come into a process that has been one  big sham from the beginning. I appreciate my colleague’s question.  ",2017

384,,115,-0.208,43,2017-12-01,Mr. BENNET.," Mr. President, on the  matter that was being discussed—I am  on the Finance Committee. There has  not been a hearing on this bill, not a  single hearing. A markup is not a hearing. People might say, well, why  is  that a big deal? Why is that relevant?  Because a hearing is an opportunity for  the American people to say whether  they want this bill or not. A hearing is  an opportunity  for an economist to  come to the Senate and say whether  they want this bill. A markup  is a  chance for Senators to say what is on  their mind, not for the American people to be able to say what is on their  mind. That  is what  I am  thinking  about today.  I wanted to start my remarks with a  little bit of a history lesson because  this Chamber seems to forget what it  has said, where it has been, and it is  only if you have a case of terrible amnesia that you can support this legislation.  When Bill Clinton  left  the White  House, he left his successor a projected  surplus of $5.6 trillion. That is what  George Bush inherited when he became  President. The Senate was actually  having hearings about what to do with  the surplus and whether that surplus  constituted some sort of threat to the  economy. That is what he left behind.  Then, George Bush, with this Congress,  cut taxes in 2001. They didn’t pay for  those tax cuts. They didn’t need to because they would pay for themselves.  That is what they said.

386,Senate,115,-0.4,50,2017-12-01,Mr. FRANKEN.," Mr. President, I rise  this evening in opposition to the tax  bill before us. I think the problem in  our country isn’t that wealthy people  in this country aren’t wealthy enough;  the problem  is, the wealth gap has  grown to the highest levels in my lifetime. This bill would make that wealth  gap even bigger.  Senator Paul Wellstone often said:  ‘‘We all do better when we all do better.’’ He knew the economy does better  when there is a strong middle class and  when working  families  have more  money  to  spend. Unfortunately,  the  Republican tax bill does the opposite of  what Paul Wellstone argued  for. Instead of helping working families, it  raises taxes on at least 14 million of  them, and it uses this revenue to give  $1 trillion to the superrich, all while  adding  $1.5  trillion  to our national  debt. This is, at its core, an awful bill.  When President Trump took office,  he pledged that he would look out for  the ‘‘forgotten men and women,’’ not  the wealthy. This bill is a betrayal of  that commitment.  I believe Congress should work on a  bipartisan basis to make our Tax Code  fairer and simpler for working families,  and that is what I have advocated for  since I joined the Senate. Democrats  have made a good-faith effort to work  in a bipartisan manner on a tax reform  bill with Republicans, but Republicans  have chosen, from the very start of this  Congress, to take a purely partisan approach  that has  left Democrats entirely out of the discussion.  We all know this bill is being rushed  through Congress so Republicans can  claim a legislative achievement by the  end of the year. That is not the way  you get a fairer, simpler Tax Code. You  get a fairer, simpler Tax Code by having hearings with outside witnesses.

Upland has played an integral  role in the industrial and educational development of Indiana and Hoosiers from every part  of the state are thankful for the contributions  of the men and women of Upland.  The  town of Upland  is  celebrating 150  years, but  the history of Upland dates back  further. Settlers came  to  the area  in 1828,  clearing the land and trapping wild game for  food and furs. In 1867, settler Jacob Bugher  gave a right of way to the Central Railroad of  Indiana in exchange for a promise that all passenger  rail would  stop  in  the  soon-to-be-  formed  town. Central Railroad  of  Indiana  agreed, the railroad was built, and Upland was  officially incorporated.  In the years since it gained its name as the  highest point on the Central Railroad of Indiana rail line, Upland has developed into a lively and thriving community, serving as a home  for generations to families, businesses, professionals, churches, schools, and other organizations.  In 1887, the town saw a great influx in business due to the discovery of natural gas. Just  a few years later, in 1893, Taylor University  moved to Upland. The University was founded  on the belief that education should be available  to women as well as men, and Taylor  University is now regularly ranked in the top  three colleges in the Midwest by U.S. News &  World Report. The arrival of Taylor University  gave students across the country the opportunity to receive a first-class liberal arts education in a special town.  In recent years there has been an influx of  business developments in Upland, which has  been great  for  the economic growth of  the  town. The town of Upland has a unique balance  between  established  favorites  like  Ivanhoe’s Drive-In, a drive-in restaurant established in 1965 famous for its ice cream and  burgers, and attracting new businesses,  like  coffee shops and clothing stores.  Upland,  Indiana exemplifies  the best of  small-town America. The citizens have a clear  passion and love for their town, but are also  quick  to welcome visitors  from around  the  world. I am proud to represent such an amazing  town, one with a history of growth and  success as well as  the promise of a prosperous  future. Please  join me  in celebrating  the sesquicentennial anniversary of the incorporation of the great town of Upland, Indiana.  f  RECOGNIZING  KEVIN  STRICKLER  FOR  THE MONTANA  CONGRESSIONAL  VETERAN  COMMENDATION  HON.

For  two decades, John has provided experienced  and insightful leadership at Newtown Savings  Bank, and his contributions have been crucial  to guiding the institution through both successful and challenging economies.  John is a native of Bronx, New York, and  completed his undergraduate degree at Manhattan College before going on  to earn his  Master of Business Administration at Iona College. He began working  in  finance  in New  York before moving with his wife Linda  to  Connecticut in 1988. Throughout his long and  successful  career  in  the  financial  industry,  John has served  in a number of  leadership  roles, such as Chief Financial Officer, for a variety of  institutions. Following a decade of  working at  the Bank of New Haven, John  joined Newtown Savings Bank as President  and CEO in 1998. His experience and leadership have been instrumental in continuing the  organization’s success for the future.  In addition  to his successful career, John  has shared his time and expertise with a number of community and professional organizations  in Connecticut. He currently serves on  the Western Connecticut  State University  Foundation Board, and has previously been  Director of Habitat for Humanity of New Haven  and Chairperson of the Newtown Rotary Golf  Fundraiser Event. John has also served as a  board member of the Connecticut Society of  CPAs’ Educational Trust Fund, a member of  the Connecticut Community Bankers Association’s Executive Committee, and a member of  the Greater Danbury Chamber of Commerce  board.  Mr. Speaker, in his two decades of leadership  at  Newtown  Savings  Bank,  John  Trentacosta has been a successful leader in  Connecticut’s financial services industry, and  he has also been a true partner to our community.

Mr. Speaker, let me start by recognizing the tremendous leadership of my  colleague,  Representative  POE  from Texas. I thank him for giving me  the honor of being his wing woman in  presenting this important piece of legislation today.  And, indeed, the SAFER Act is an  important piece of legislation to reinforce the efforts of our local and State  law enforcement in their work to reduce the number of untested rape kits  and help  take  these  sexual assault  predators off the streets.  At the same time, this legislation underscores the critical role that the pediatric sexual assault examiners play  in this process and makes them eligible  for key training.

407,House,115,-0.388,39,2017-12-21,Mrs. LOWEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a failure of both process and  substance.  When Congress received the paltry and  insufficient disaster request from the  administration, the House and Senate  Appropriations Committees began a bipartisan and bicameral process to develop an emergency assistance package  that would come closer to meeting the  massive scale of need resulting from  hurricanes and wildfires in the summer  and fall 2017.  I sincerely regret that the majority  leadership  abandoned  that  process,  choosing,  instead, to disregard  input  from Democrats and even from Senate  Republicans, and developed their own  partisan supplemental. The results of  that decision is a poor product that  will not be enacted into law.  Despite some robust funding levels,  this bill fails to fix a potentially calamitous Medicaid system situation for  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Without help  from Congress,  these programs will exhaust available  funding within months. This bill also  fails to waive unworkable and unjustifiable  cost  share  requirements  for  FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers’ projects, which could put Federal funding out of reach.  These  and  other  serious  shortcomings must be fixed before an emergency  supplemental  is  enacted  into  law. Even if this supplemental passes  today, the House majority’s decision to  exclude both Democrats and Senate  Republicans from this process means  that it will not be enacted this year because it cannot pass the Senate.  Instead of the partisan product with  no chance of advancement, we should  be considering a responsible bipartisan  emergency supplemental that both the  House and the Senate could pass and  enact into law.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2017

I  am  one  of  eight  subcommittee  chairmen who held public hearings at  the request of the chairman.

409,Senate,115,0.434,137,2017-12-21,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President, today I  wish to honor my good friend and colleague from Alabama, Senator LUTHER  STRANGE, prior to his departure from  the U.S. Senate.  While LUTHER and  I have worked  closely  together  in  the Senate, our  friendship dates back nearly four decades. Over the years, I have had the  privilege of not only getting to know  LUTHER, but also getting to know his  wife, Melissa, and his two sons, Luke  and Keehn.  Even before LUTHERwas appointed to  the U.S. Senate, he and I worked alongside each other throughout much of  our careers. When LUTHERwas sworn in  to fill Attorney General Sessions’ seat,  I was pleased to have him just down  the hall from my office.  As soon as LUTHERwas sworn into  the Senate, he hit the ground running.  His camaraderie, integrity, and great  attitude did not go unnoticed. Another  thing we all quickly observed about  LUTHER in the Senate was his willingness to help in any situation. He was  always the first to volunteer, whether  the task be big or small. LUTHER is admired by Members on both sides of the  aisle, which is rare in Washington. He  has made a lot of friends in the Senate  and has worked in a bipartisan fashion.  In addition to his work ethic and  great attitude, LUTHERwas able to accomplish an incredible amount legislatively in a short period of time. His  successes include his work on the final  National Defense Authorization Act  conference negotiations, securing three  littoral  combat  ships,  his  help  in  achieving the 51 votes needed to pass a  once-in-a-generation tax reform package, and helping repeal Obamacare.  LUTHER’s time in the Senate was cut  too short. I would be remiss not to  mention how much I, along with my  Senate colleagues, have enjoyed his  company.  I thank Senator STRANGEfor his time  and service both to Alabama and our  Nation here in the Senate. I wish him  all the best in his future endeavors,  and I look forward to continuing our  close friendship.  Thank you.  f  TAX REFORM BILL  ",2017
410,,115,0.763,172,2017-12-21,Mr. GAETZ.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  rise  to  recognize the life of the premium cigar patriarch, Mr. Gilberto Oliva, founder of Oliva Cigar  Co. Gilberto passed away peacefully in a hospital in South Miami on Saturday, December  16, 2017, surrounded by his family and close  friends.  As  a  young  tobacco  farmer  in Cuba,  Gilberto built his endeavors on the blueprint of  the American Dream. As an early adult, he  moved from his family farm to pursue tobacco  trading. The growing conflict under the Cuban  dictatorship forced Mr. Oliva to flee to Nicaragua where he became a pioneer in tobacco  cultivation.  While Nicaragua was his home, Gilberto’s  business grew all over  the world,  including  Honduras, Mexico and  the Philippines. His  product quickly became known around  the  world for its quality. In 1995, he established  his own brand of cigar, and  in 2006, he  launched the Oliva Serie V, which Cigar Aficionado Magazine named Cigar of the Year in  2014.  In early 2016, Mr. Oliva was honored by the  Asociacio´n Nicaragu¨ense de Tabacaleros, the  Nicaraguan Tobacco Association, with a lifetime achievement award. Yet for all his many  successes, he never  forgot his  roots. He  yearned for a free Cuba, and he instilled in his  children a respect  for personal responsibility  and hard work.  Gilberto is succeeded by his wife Carmen,  his  five  children—including my  former  colleague and friend, Florida House Representative  Jose Oliva—and  his  fourteen  grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States  Congress,  I want  to  recognize  the  life of  Gilberto F. Oliva. He was a great man, a world  leader in the field of cigar manufacturing, and  the patriarch of a wonderful family.  f  JIM CRITCHLEY’S RETIREMENT  HON. RAU´L M.

412,,115,0.774,172,2017-12-21,Mr. BUDD.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor the undefeated MEAC and 2017 Celebration Bowl Champions.  I’m  speaking  of  course of the North Carolina A&T Aggie football team.  Last week, as time expired in the Celebration Bowl, the Aggies made their nation proud  with a last second touchdown to secure their  second Celebration Bowl victory in just three  years. And with that win, the Aggies became  the first MEAC team to go undefeated as they  won  their second HBCU national  title under  head coach Rod Broadway.  Mr. Speaker,  ‘A Champion Has Risen’  indeed, and  that champion,  is  the A&T Aggie  Football Team.  Congratulations to the esteemed Dr. Harold  Martin, Sr., to Coach Broadway and his team,  and also to the offensive and defensive MVP’s  of  the game, Marquell Cartwright and Mac  McCain for their performances.  I am honored to represent this historic and  honored  institution  in Washington, and  they  have made me, their community, and most importantly,  the  ‘Aggie nation’ proud with  their  win.  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in honoring North Carolina A&T for their historic season and national championship win.  f  SAUDI TEXTBOOKS  HON.

413,,115,0.636,179,2017-12-21,Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  congratulate my  friends  at  Fanello Industries in Lavonia on their 20-year  anniversary.  Established in 1998, this company has supported businesses across various industries by  providing them with stamped metal blanks and  other assemblies that play a major role in production.  When  the  company’s  founder,  Vince  Fanello, first opened his business in northeast  Georgia, he understood that he was making a  major commitment. Like many other companies, Fanello Industries began small and grew  over time as a result of determination and diligence.  By the time the company reached its fifth  year, it expanded to include multiple assembly  lines and utilized 100,000 square feet of space  to house its tools and employees.  Oftentimes, we forget the leap of faith that  many people take when starting a business.  For most business owners, passing the one-  year milestone without succumbing to the defeats that come with a running business is a  major accomplishment.  Many  small  business  owners,  like Mr.  Fanello, are providing jobs that don’t require a  4-year degree to people. When I met with Mr.  Fanello, he stressed the need for welders in  his  industry and highlighted his efforts  in  reaching out to the state prison system to provide work to recently released inmates so that  they can build the skills needed for welding.  My  friends at Fanello  Industries can  look  back at what they’ve built with pride—remembering  that  they persevered  throughout  their  20-year operation.  I congratulate  them and  look forward to their continued success.  f  RECOGNIZING KEISER UNIVERSITY  HON. DANIEL WEBSTER  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, December 21, 2017  ",2017
414,,115,0.478,179,2017-12-21,Mr. WEBSTER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to recognize Keiser University  for  their accomplishments and their example for  how a private university should operate and  serve their community. For 40 years, Keiser  University has equipped thousands of students  to achieve success in our ever-changing economy. It is through institutions like Keiser that  students across America and around the world  have  access  to  a  variety  of  educational  choices ranging from associate to doctoral degree programs.  An overwhelming sixty-six percent of Keiser  graduates complete their degrees in the fields  of Science,  Technology, Engineering,  and  Mathematics  (STEM). With unwavering persistence, I continue to support STEM, and am  very pleased to celebrate the impressive milestone of this educational institution. In the past  10 years, Keiser University produced more  than 33,800 graduates with associate degrees  in a wide variety of in-demand working fields.  With access to skilled workers on the decline,  it is imperative that Congress works together  with states to better prepare our workforce of  tomorrow.  I am pleased  to witness Keiser’s  success, and wish them many more years of  prosperity.  I applaud Keiser’s  faculty, staff, and students for their achievements and for their ongoing commitment to equipping our next generation  to  be  leaders  and  achieve  their  dreams.  f  IN  HONOR  OF  AL  AND  PENNY  TWOMEY  FOR  RECEIVING  THE  2017 WYOMING  CARES  VOLUNTEER OF THE YEAR AWARD  HON.
