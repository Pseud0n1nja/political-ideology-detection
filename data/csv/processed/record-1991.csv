1,43,1,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  11 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Texas [Mr. FROST].  ",1991
2,43,1,Mr. FROST.," Mr. Speaker, House Res olution 5 contains changes to the rules  of the House of Representatives rec ommen4ed for inclusion in the rules of  the House for  the 102d Congress. For  the most part,  the package contains  amendments to the rules of the 101st  Congress which are technical, clarify ing, and confronting in nature or which  eliminate obsolete provisions. Two of  the  recommended amendments, how ever,  substantially  affect  the  oper ations of  the House. Those  amend ments will be explained in some detail  in my statement and at this  time I  would like to  take a  few minutes to  briefly  summarize  the  recommended  changes to the rules of the House.  Mr. Speaker, currently, clause 9(a) of  rule I grants the Speaker the authority  to direct and control  closed circuit  telecommunications  systems within  the House. The first amendment simply  clarifies that the Speaker is empow ered to issue rules and regulations af fecting any telecommunications within  the House.  The  second amendment provides a  waiver of  the  service  limitation  re strictions for service on the Committee  on the Budget for those minority Mem bers elected to the committee as the  ranking minority member. This waiver  was included in rule X in the 101st Con gress and was, when first adopted, only  applicable to the 101st Congress. This  amendment  extends  the  waiver  through the 102d Congress.  The third amendment deletes an ob solete grant of authority to the Com mittee on Rules found in clause 1(q) of  rule X. Prior to the adoption of the 1985  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  amend ments  to  the Congressional Budget  Act,  authorizing  legislation was  re quired to be reported by May 15 of the  year preceding the start of the fiscal  year in which such authorizing legisla tion becomes effective. Rule X granted  the Committee on Rules the authority  to waive that provision of the Budget  Act in those cases in which committees  did not meet the May 15 deadline. How ever, the 1985 amendments deleted this  provision and this amendment strikes  this obsolete grant of authority.  The Ethics in Government Act, en acted during the 101st Congress, grant ed additional authority to the Commit tee on Standards of Official Conduct in  order that it might carry out its re sponsibility  to  issue  regulations and  implement certain Government ethics  laws as  they apply to Members, offi cers, and employees of the House of  Representatives. The  fourth  amendment merely expands the jurisdictional  grant of authority in the rules of the  House to reflect the committee's addi tional responsibilities under the act.  Mr. Speaker, the fifth amendment al ters clause 2(a) of rule XI to give the  standing committees of the House ade quate time to organize the beginning of  a Congress. The current rule requires  committees of the House print  their  rules  in  the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD  within 30 days after the Congress con venes. The amendment provides  that  the rules shall be printed within 30  days  after  the  committee has been  elected by the House.  The sixth amendment is a straight forward amendment which specifically  provides  that  the  ranking majority  Member of each committee and sub committee shall be designated as the  vice-chairman of  that committee or  subcommittee.  The  seventh  amendment  amends  clause 2(1)(6) of rule XI in two respects.  In the first instance,  the amendment  deletes duplicative and conflicting pro visions contained  in  that clause  to  clarify that legislation is not eligible  for consideration until after it has been  available for 3 days. In the second in stance,  the amendment provides that  the layover requirements for a budget  resolution shall conform with the re quirements of section 305(a)(l) of the  Budget Act.  The eighth amendment is a technical  change to the title of rule XII to reflect  the current membership in the House  of the Resident Commissioner of Puer to Rico and all Delegates.  The ninth amendment would allow  the Speaker, in his discretion to recog nize Members for a privileged motion  which,  if agreed  to, would authorize  the Speaker to declare a recess, either  to a time certain or subject to the call  of the Chair. Under the current rules,  in order for the House to recess, it is  necessary to obtain unanimous consent  or the House must agree to a rule re ported from  the Committee on Rules  providing for such a recess.  The 10th amendment is a matter of  some  substance. Mr.  Speaker,  this  amendment would  enhance  informed  and deliberate fiscal decisions by the  Congress by incorporating a statutory  statement of cost, provided by the Con gressional Budget Office, into spending  our revenue bills. Under the budget re form measures enacted at the end of  the 101st Congress as part of the rec onciliation package,  it is  imperative  that Congress know the cost of legisla tion because, under  the new pay-as you-go procedure, a  sequestration on  all nonexempt entitlement programs is  required  to  offset  deficit  increases  caused by new entitlement and revenue  legislation.  This amendment to rule XXI would  require reported bills and conference  reports to contain a statement of law  codifying  the CBO cost estimate for  such  bills  and  conference  reports,  through fiscal year 1995,  for  the pur poses of pay-as-you-go sequestration.  This statement of law will also ensure  that the same CBO estimate is used for  calculating the cost of legislation for  purposes of any end-of-the-session se questration applying to direct spend ing. A point of order would lie against  a bill or conference report in violation  of this requirement.  It is the opinion of the Democratic  caucus that CBO cost estimates most  accurately reflect the will of Congress  and ensures that the scoring of these  measures will be performed by an agen cy without any policy interests in the  legislation which it is evaluating. The  rule also ensures  that Members will  know when they vote on entitlement  and revenue legislation whether enact ment of such legislation may result in  a  sequester of all nonexempt direct  spending  programs,  including Medi care.  In order to facilitate the business of  the House, the 11th amendment would  permit the Chairman of the Committee  of the Whole to cluster votes in those  instances  in which a  series of votes  may take place in the Committee. In  other words,  the Chair would be per mitted, in his discretion, to reduce the  time on all votes subsequent to a 15minute vote to 5 minutes so long as no  other  business  intervenes  between  votes.  The 12th amendment is a  technical  amendment which clarifies that the al phabetical  call  of  the  committees  under Calendar Wednesday shall begin  anew with each session of a Congress as  well as at the beginning of a Congress.  The 13th  amendment  amends  rule  XXVII in two respects. In the first in stance,  the  amendments  strikes  the  prov1s1ons  in  current House  rules  which requires a vote on ordering sec onds on motions to suspend the rules.  In the second instance, the amendment  amends  the discharge  rule  to clarify  that resolutions discharged from  the  Committee on Rules are to be consid ered in the House in a manner similar  to the consideration of bills discharged  from other committees of the House.  Mr. Speaker, at the present time, all  expenses associated with the use of the  House Recording Studio and the elec tronic  transmission of recording ses sions are charged against the official  expenses allowance of a Member. How ever,  in  some  instances,  the  trans mission costs are more properly attrib uted  to the nonpolitical organization  receiving  the  transmission. The 14th  amendment would allow a Member, in  those instances, to receive reimburse ment and to restore his expense allow ance in the exact amount of the trans mission cost charged against the offi cial  expense  allowance. Absent  this  amendment to rule XLV, it is possible  that the receipt by a Member for reim bursement for expenses associated with  ",1991

The  gentleman  from Texas  [Mr. FROST] will be recognized to con trol the balance of the time on his side.  The gentleman from Texas has 14 min utes  remaining,  and  the gentleman  from New York [Mr. SOLOMON] has 16  minutes remaining.  ",1991
4,56,1,Mr. FROST.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 4  minutes to the distinguished chairman  of the Committee on Ways and Means,  the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Ros TENKOWSKI].  ",1991
5,56,1,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in support of the proposed changes  to the House rules. Some are alleging  that the House rule requiring Congres sional Budget Office and Joint Com mittee on Taxation outlay and revenue  estimates to be included in revenue and  entitlement bills undermines the credi bility of  the 1990 budget agreement.  This is simply not the case. Instead,  the proposed rule sends a strong mes sage that we intend to live up to the  agreement.  The budget agreement specified that  any legislation which increased outlays  for an entitlement program or reduced  revenues must be paid for in each and  every year for the next 5 years. To en force that requirement, it was agreed  that  there would  be  an  across-the board, automatic cut in nonexempt di rect spending programs if a bill were  passed  that was not budget neutral.  The practical effect of this pay-as-you go financing requirement will be that  the Medicare Program will automati cally be  reduced or sequestered, and  will compensate for about 80 percent of  any enacted legislation which  is not  budget neutral. Members have a right  to know when they cast their vote on  the House floor whether or not Medi care and other direct spending entitle ment laws are being changed. The pro posed change to the House rule ensures  that each Member will have this infor mation.  The Committee on Ways and Means  has lived up to the pay-as-you-go re quirement for the past decade. For ex ample, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was  revenue neutral over a 5-year period;  the Family Support Act of 1988 was  budget neutral; the catastrophic health  insurance bill was budget neutral; and  the child care bill  approved by  the  committee last year was fully budget  neutral.  To ensure that Medicare and other  direct spending programs are not inad vertently  sequestered  requires  that  bills  reported  from  a  committee be  budget neutral. This requires that cost  estimates be  prepared  on  each  and  every amendment  that  is offered  in  committee. OMB does not have the ca pacity or the staff to perform such a  function.  Furthermore,  the Congres sional Budget Office  and  the  Joint  Committee on Taxation already ably  prepare cost estimates which are both  independent and objective.  In addition, it is my view that last  year's budget negotiators did not in tend for OMB of this or any other ad ministration to have the right to be in volved in the day-to-day legislative ac tivities of the Congress and its com mittees. Our system of government re quires that the legislative branch be an  equal and separate entity. That implies  that Congress should work with con gressional branch agencies in develop ing our legislative products. CBO and  the Joint Committee on Taxation are  independent of any member here. They  are not political entities and their esti mates  reflect  nonpartisan,  objective  analysis. By its very nature, OMB can not make the same claim. Without this  rule, the Director of OMB would have  to review and prepare a cost analysis of  any ""chairman's mark"" whether in the  Ways and Means Committee or in any  other committee of  the Congress as  well as all amendments that members  wished to propose. This would be offen sive to me as chairman and should be  offensive to all Members of Congress on  both sides of the aisle.  If the President believes that a bill is  not budget neutral and that the CBO  and JCT estimates that are included in  a bill are substantially off the mark,  the President can exercise his constitu tional right to veto such a bill. I would  hope that would not be necessary.  Finally, Mr. Speaker,  this proposed  rules change  is  important  to ensure  that the congressional budget process  enforces the pay-as-you-go concept in  the 1990 budget agreement. I fully in tend to support and enforce the pay-as you-go  discipline  in my  committee  since it is a discipline that I have im posed on the Ways and Means Commit tee for the last decade. I urge all Mem bers to support the rules change.  ",1991
6,56,1,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes  to  the  distinguished  gen tleman  from  Massachusetts  [Mr.  CONTE], who was just sworn in for the  17th time.  ",1991
7,56,1,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my  good friend,  the gentleman from New  York, for yielding this time to me, and  I rise in opposition to the rule.  Mr. Speaker, today, amidst the pomp  and circumstance of a new Congress,  we set the rules of the road by which  this Chamber will operate for the next  2 years.  Now, as one of our first acts, we are  invited  to  undo  one  of  the major  achievements of the last Congress.  For the first time, the President and  the Congress agreed to try to control  the  fastest growing costs of govern ment-the entitlement programs that  spend automatically, without control.  We said, if Congress wants new auto matic spending programs, it has got to  pay for them-pay-as-you-go.  Fiscal  responsibility. The  law gave  the Office of Management and Budget  the  job of assuring the new spending  was fully paid for. That was a conserv ative provision,  no  doubt  about  it.  OMB is more concerned about the pay ing than the going.  Now, less than 3 months later, before  this provision has even been tested, the  majority wants to change that agree ment. Unilaterally, they have decided  they don't like that conservative re straint on new  automatic  spending.  And that is what is most distressing.  Here we go. The most fundamental  question facing the Congress today is  whether we can get the deficit under  control. We made  a  fragile,  5-year  agreement with the administration to  move  toward controlling  the deficit.  And now, we are invited to start unrav eling it.  ",1991
8,69,1,The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  Chair will  remind  the audience  that  they  should  refrain  from  expressing  any positive or negative expressions re garding the conduct of Members here  on the floor of the House.  NO MORE BUDGET SUMMITS  (Mr. DANNEMEYER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ,1991
9,69,1,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker, it  is sad but necessary for Members, at  the beginning of this new Congress, to  reflect a little on where we are, on the  increase  in the national debt that is  projected.  To do that, I want to draw the Mem bers' attention to what was  the pro jected deficit in January of 1990 for fis cal year 1991:  $130 billion; 2 months  later, CBO,  the same agency, estimat ing the deficit projection, was $161 bil lion; 4 months later, July, CBO said the  deficit for 1991 would be $232 billion;  and then, in December, at the close of  the year, the same agency, CBO, said  the deficit would be $253 billion.  What is the increase in the national  debt projected for this fiscal year; $399  billion? This place  is out of control.  The people that estimate figures have  no idea of what is going on. What does  it tell Members? We have to stop the  idea that somehow budget summitry is  going to solve our problems. We have  to get rid of the idea that we can tax  ourselves out of this mess. The only  thing that can solve this is the Con gress that has the guts to restrain the  growth in spending by limiting spend ing increases in appropriation bills to  no more than the rate of inflation, over  what was spent in the preceding year.  Never, ever again will we have budget  summits.  THREE MAJOR ISSUES NOW  BEFORE CONGRESS  (Mr. MAZZOLI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
10,69,1,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, the first  day of the session is always very eventful. We have a chance to see our friends  and greet  the  newcomers. This has  been an eventful day. However, even  beyond the human relations, this is an  eventful day for me because I put my  name on three major bills that I think  could, if passed, and really change this  country and our world.  One  is  the resolution referred  to a  moment ago by my friend from Flor ida, Mr. BENNETT, which has to do with  the power of the Congress to make war,  and not  the President alone.  I  think  that is a very fundamental issue which  must be dealt with in this Congress. I  salute the Speaker for keeping Mem bers  in session  through January and  not allowing Members to be in recess.  The  second bill  is  the Brady bill,  which is a 7-day delay or waiting pe riod before a handgun can be  trans ferred. This, I  think, would overcome  much of the violence and many of the  deaths we have seen thoughout our Na tion, and certainly here in the District  of Columbia.  The  last bill perhaps  is more  fun damental  than anything, and that is  campaign reform,  to change  the very  system by which we Members come to  Congress  to change a  system which  many of the people in America feel has  been corrupted.  I think, Mr. Speaker, if we the Con gress were to deal with these issues, I  think we would have an absolutely sen sational Congress.  Let me take this opportunity to wish  all of our colleagues much health and  happiness in this new year.  D 1640  SECRETARY LUJAN REPRESENTS  AMERICANS  (Mrs. BENTLEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her re marks.)  ",1991
11,69,1,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I con gratulate our  former colleague, Sec retary of the Interior Manuel Lujan,  for representing  the American people  in  the Matsushita's ownership of the  concessions  at  Yosemite  National  Park.  Secretary Lujan is not coercing nor  intimidating Matsushita  as  former  Senate majority leader Howard Baker  and former U.S. Trade Representative  Robert Strauss claim. He expresses the  sentiments of the American people, not  those of Japan's shadow warriors who  are hired guns for Matsushita as both  Senator Baker and Bob Strauss are.  We  live in America where we have  freedom of speech, and not intimida tion by the yen or the almighty dol lar-or what the Washington Post calls  an ""elite corp of middlemen."" We can  still fight city hall. Secretary Lujan is  a true public servant and is serving the  best interests of the American people.  That is something the hired guns of the  Japanese have forgotten.  We need more people like Secretary  Lujan to keep this country from being  rolled over by the special interests of  former Government officials who sell  our future for a yen.  SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT ON THE  PERSIAN GULF  (Mr. GEKAS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
12,69,1,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker, there are  those who would criticize the President  of  the United States  for acting  too  hastily on the question of the Persian  Gulf; yet if you look at the record you  will see that this President consulted  worldwide with multiple numbers of  nations and leaders before taking one  step in the Persian Gulf. He presented  through his proper representatives res olutions  in  the United Nations and  waited for 12 of them en seriatim to be  considered and passed before  taking  the next vital step in the resolution of  that crisis, and January 15 was set as a  deadline for  the removal of the Iraqi  forces  in Kuwait by  the United Na tions, not by  the President. He has  acted with calm and with dispatch and  with restraint  throughout this whole  period.  I will support the President of the  United States as a Member of Congress  in the execution of American foreign  policy, and  if a  resolution should be  presented to  the Congress to support  the President in his efforts, I shall do  that; but one thing we cannot do is to  unilaterally withdraw from the Presi dent the power of congressional opin ion and the power of American public  opinion while he is negotiating in these  stages of  the policy  in  the Persian  Gulf.  Let us stand with and rally around  the President of the United States.  SUPPORT COLA INCREASE FOR  VETERANS  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
13,69,1,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr.  Speaker,  al though the last congress we provided  cost-of-living increases to our Federal  retirees  and Social Security  recipi ents-we failed to grant a similar in crease in VA disability payments. We  failed to provide undiminished support  to our Nation's veterans at a  time  when we were asking a new generation  of servicemen to heed their country's  call in the Persian Gulf.  This situation  is nothing short of  abominable and cannot be permitted to  continue. How can we ask our citizens  to serve  their country now when we  fail  to deliver on our past promises?  ",1991
14,225,1,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay  tribute  to a distinguished  individual and  my good friend, Mr. Richard Mugridge.  Rick has been a hard-working individual  in  Michigan's 12th District for some time now.  I  have come to know him through his extensive  work on my campaigns and know he has al ways been there to help me. His commitment  to my campaigns, however,  is exceeded by  his commitment to his union.  In 1968 Rick began working  for Michigan  Bell. Shortly thereafter he became active in his  CWA Local 4014. He became an election  committee member in 1972.  In 1976, Rick received a great honor from  his  fellow members when he was appointed  chief steward. He was then elected vice presi dent in 1981 for a 3-year term. In 1984, CWA  Local  4014  and  4008 merged. Rick  has  served as vice president of the north area for  the past 6 years.  Rick serves on the election, bylaws, legisla tive, and mobilization committees. His hard  work and dedication have earned him respect  and success. He has been, through the years,  a tireless champion for his fellow union mem bers.  Rick has been a  loyal volunteer of mine  since my  first campaign  for Congress.  I am  honored to call him a friend and proud to have  his support. I hope, and expect, that Rick and  I will stand shoulder to shoulder in the many  challenges to come.  INTRODUCTION OF THE ""BEEPER  BILL""  HON. CARDISS COWNS  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 3, 1991  ",1991
15,225,1,Mrs. COLLINS.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing  legislation that  is  intended  to help  put a dent in the ease with which the Nation's  illegal narcotics trade is carried on. The Tele communications Drug  Enforcement Act  of  1991 would allow law enforcement officials to  obtain a court order to cut off the mobile com munications  service of persons  the  police  49-059  0-95 Vol. 137 (Pt. ll 8  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  have probable cause  to believe are using  those devices to participate in the illegal drug  market.  Over the past several years, as communica tions technology has advanced, so has the so phisticated use of new communications de vices by persons  involved  in the  illegal drug  market. The use of digital voice and message  beepers, mobile cellular telephones and  fac simile machines in the drug trade is very high  and growing. A Jaw enforcement official in the  District of Columbia estimates that 90 percent  of the people arrested in the city for drug deal ing have beepers, and  that an estimated 25  pagers are confiscated each week which have  been used in the drug trade. The use of these  devices, together with the use of public tele phones, has made the job of investigating and  identifying drug traffickers a difficult task. The  legislation that I am proposing will allow law  enforcement officials to obtain a court order,  based on probable cause,  to disconnect the  mobile communications service to persons the  police have reason  to believe are using  the  equipment for illegal purposes.  Obviously, we must utilize all means nec essary and proper to fight the war on drugs.  Since  there  is vast evidence  that otherwise  useful, convenient and innocuous devices are  being used to perpetuate the drug trade, we  must attempt to stop this practice. While I do  not have any notions  that  this measure will  stop drug dealers in their tracks. I do believe  . it will be yet another hurdle or hindrance  in  their dirty business. I urge my colleagues to  support this measure.  INTERNATIONAL  FUND  FOR  ffiE LAND AND THE MACBRIDE PRIN CIPLES  HON. ELIOT L ENGEL  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 3, 1991  ",1991
16,225,1,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing legislation which would take an impor tant step toward the elimination of job discrimi nation in the north of Ireland. My bill stipulates  that organizations  receiving  financial support  from  the American contribution  to  the  Inter national Fund for Ireland would be required to  abide by  the MacBride principles of fair em ployment.  When  I visited  Ireland  in  the summer of  1989, representatives of the minority Catholic  community raised concerns about the adminis tration of the  IFI and  indicated that the $20  million annual  funding  level  from  the United  States was simply contributing  to continued  discrimination against the Catholic minority.  The MacBride principles,  developed and  very successfully promoted by  the  Irish Na tional Caucus, are similar to the Sullivan prin ciples  utilized  to  combat  discrimination  in  South Africa. The MacBride principles:  First, prohibit discrimination based on  gious affiliation;  Second, provide for the protection of minor ity employees at the workplace;  Third, ban provocative sectarian and politi cal emblems from the workplace;  reli 223  Fourth, establish  layoff,  recall, and  termi nation procedures which do not favor particu lar religious groups;  Fifth, prohibit  job reservations, apprentice ship  restrictions, and differential employment  criteria, which discriminate on the basis of reli gion or ethnic origin;  Sixth, develop  training programs  that will  prepare substantial numbers of minority em ployees for managerial, supervisor, administra tive, clerical, and technical jobs.  My bill would help ensure that American tax payers' money is not used to further discrimi nation in Ireland. At no time should the United  States support anti-Catholic discrimination, but  in particular during this era of extreme budget  constraints we must ensure that every dollar is  utilized effectively.  INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL  BUDGET STRUCTURE ACT OF 1991  HON. WilliAM F. CLINGER, JR.  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 3, 1991  ",1991
17,225,1,Mr. CLINGER.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I intro duced  the Federal Budget Structure Act of  1991.  Before describing the provisions of this leg islation, however, I wish to express my appre ciation for the valuable assistance of Charles  Bowsher,  the Comptroller General, and his  staff in helping to develop this legislation. The  Comptroller continues to play a valuable lead ership role in  improving our antiquated finan cial management practices.  The Federal Budget Structure Act simply  seeks to identify, define, and present separate  operating and capital components of the Fed eral budget, and to distinguish between Fed eral funds and trust funds, while maintaining a  unified budget. It is not yet a perfect piece of  legislation, but hopefully  it will help  fuel a  needed debate.  Mr. Speaker, let me reiterate that this legis lation seeks  to  retain a unified budget. This  proposal does not attempt to reduce the Fed eral budget deficit through more smoke and  mirrors  by  taking  capital  expenditures  off budget. A unified budget is maintained.  This  legislation seeks  to provide what  the  existing budget does not-adequate informa tion on  the  revenues, expenditures, surplus/  deficit amounts, and  financing  requirements  for capital activities of  the Federal Govern ment. It also attempts to provide a distinction  between Federal  funds and  trust  funds, and  between capital and operating activities  in a  manner which does not hinder identifying the  resources needed to meet the Government's  capital infrastructure needs.  The benefits of a capital budget are many.  The private sector and a  large majority of  State and local governments have set a finan cial example of the direction the Federal Gov ernment should follow. A capital budget:  Focuses attention  to a greater degree on  the deteriorating physical infrastructure of the  Nation and allows us to make more rational in vestment decisions;  Promotes  intergenerational equity by bur dening  future generations with debt service  ",1991
18,238,1,Mr.  LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  next  week the Santa Maria Chamber of Commerce  will name Donald E. Lahr as its ""Citizen of the  Year.""  If there is anyone who deserves the title, it's  Don Lahr. Not just because he's a close per sonal friend. Nor because of his civic involve ment. Nor because he has a beautiful wife  and  four  strong  sons-and  seven  grand children.  No, Mr. Speaker, Don Lahr deserves  this  honor because he truly is an outstanding per son and citizen.  Don is an Army veteran who came to Santa  Maria in 1947. He attended Santa Maria Jun ior College, graduating  from Whittier College  in 1951. After a 7-year career with Sears Roe buck and Co., be became the western division  manager for P.J. Gould Co. He then became  division manager  for  Insurance  Securities  Trust Fund, and  in 1967,  founded his own  company, Lahr Electric Motors, Inc.  During his long career in business, Don did  not neglect his civic duties. He was president  of Orcutt Unified School District, president of  Santa Maria Developers, president of the Ro tary Club,  chairman of  the Santa Barbara  County Planning Commission, president of the  Supervisors Advisory Committee  for Orcutt,  president of Santa Maria Association  for the  Mentally Retarded, director  fo  the Environ mental Research Foundation, and a director of  the Santa Maria Valley YMCA. As if that were  not enough, a few years back he was ap pointed to the 37th District Fair Board by Gov ernor Deukmejian.  Don is the husband of Doris Throckmorton  Lahr, and  they are  the parents of Donald,  Lawrence,  Jeffery  and Thomas  Lahr. Mr.  Speaker, on behalf of the U.S. House of Rep resentatives, I want to extend our sincere con gratulations to my friends Don and Doris, and  to say  that  in my view,  they will always be  ""Citizens of the Year.""  REPEAL OF SOCIAL SECURITY  EARNINGS TEST  HON. BOB STUMP  OF ARIZONA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 3, 1991  ",1991
19,238,1,Mr. STUMP.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing legislation to repeal what I, and many  others, consider to be one of the most unfair  features of the Social Security Act,  the so called earnings test.  Under current law, Social Security and Rail road retirees can receive only $9,720 per year  in earned  income. Recipients who annually  earn more  than  that amount generally have  their retirement benefits reduced $1  for every  $3 earned above the limit.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is particularly  important to  understand that the earnings test affects only  earned  income,  such as  from wages. UnJanuary 3, 1991  earned income from investments, is not count ed. Thus, the earnings test disproportionately  affects  low-and middle-income retirees who  lack the resources to accumulate large sums  of unearned income.  It is a fact that some retirees want to stay  active  through employment. And, some are  forced to reenter the work force for economic  reasons. While we should not force any retiree  to return to work, neither should the Govern ment stand in the way of anyone who wishes  to return to the work force. Regardless of age,  one should be able to work as much as they  may need, without penalty. This country can  only lose by denying our work force the wealth  of knowledge and experience the retirement age population possesses.  HONORING JOSEPH G. BALSAMO  HON. BENJAMIN ~ GD.MAN  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, Januarl/ 3, 1991  ",1991
20,238,1,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  it is with great  regret that I rise to inform our colleagues that,  during the recent holiday recess, we  lost an  outstanding, public minded citizen.  I had known Joseph G. Balsamo for over 40  years. Throughout his life, Joe was the per sonification of an  individual seeking a better  community for himself and for future genera tions. He was never reluctant to pitch  in  to  make things just a little bit better for all of us.  Joe, a native of Brooklyn, NY, served in the  Pacific Theater during World War II, as I did,  and  like so many of our generation, he at tended law school after our victory in that con flict, using the practical lessons learned on the  battlefield to assist him in mastering the intel lectual lessons of a legal education.  Joseph Balsamo and  I were classmates at  the New York Law School. Not only did we  forge a life-long friendship at that time, but we  developed our love for the law and for judicial  process  that served both of us well. Even  back then,  I was struck by Joe's comprehen sive and his compassion. He seemed to  in stinctively grasp that the law exists not only to  provide an orderly society, but also  to help  others, and to achieve justice.  Upon  graduation  from  New  York  law  School, Joe relocated  in Suffern, NY, where  he  founded  the  successful  law  firm  of  Balsamo, Byrne and Cipriani.  Joe was not the kind of lawyer that you run  into every day. He was more like the untypical  country  lawyer that we see portrayed  in  fic tional television and motion picture accounts.  His  law partner, John Byrne, recently stated:  ""There was never a client who had a problem  that was too small for Joe to listen to. He lis tened to everybody, no matter what their prob lem was, and he never turned anybody away  because they were unable to afford a fee.""  Not content merely  to become one of the  most respected  trial attorneys  in our part of  New York State, Joe also dove headlong into  community service. He became chairman of  the Village Zoning Board of Appeals at a time  when the village of Suffern was facing unprec edented post-war growth. Joe Balsamo helped  steer the village along the proper path of con",1991

22,264,1,Mrs. COLLINS of  Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  in  1973,  the Federal Communications Commis sion [FCC] adopted internal policies designed  to  increase  diversity  in  the  ownership  of  broadcast entities. During  the  late seventies  and early eighties, these policies helped add  significantly to the number of women-and mi nority-owned broadcast stations. However,  in  1985  the FCC's minority preference policies  were called  into question  in  the courts;  the  Commission  suspended all  license applica tions and pending cases where minority pref erences were involved and sought to disman tle their own policies. The question of the con stitutionality of these policies was in doubt for  several years, but last year, the United States  Supreme Court upheld the FCC's policies giv ing preference  to minorities  in  the sale of  broadcast stations. The  legislation  that  I am  introducing today will codify these policies and  make them a part of our Federal laws.  The FCC's distress sale policy and the com parative hearing enhancement credit are two  of the three most important components of ef forts  to  increase broadcast entity ownership  opportunities for minorities. Minority ownership  is perhaps the most important element in pro viding diversity in broadcast programming and  viewpoints. Diversity is a long established goal  in U.S.  telecommunications policy.  It stems  from our strong belief  in  the  right  to  free  speech  and  the  principle  that  minority  groups-both numerical and ethnic-have a  right to have their viewpoints heard. Further,  diversity of ownership of the broadcast media  is vital to gaining a broad spectrum of views  on our Nation's airwaves. Television and radio  play a dominant role in informing the American  public of news events and shaping their per ceptions of people. If minorities and women do  not have access to these mass media facili ties-and  without  ownership,  they  often  don't-they have no realistic chance of con tributing  to this exchange of information and  views.  Now that the Supreme Court has ruled,  it  removes the uncertainty of the validity of the  two policies; it's now up to Congress to take  the next logical step and codify them.  I urge  my colleagues to support this effort.  January 3, 1991  REPEAL THE ACCUMULATED  EARNINGS TAX  HON. PHIUP M. CRANE  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 3, 1991  ",1991
23,264,1,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing legislation which would repeal the ac cumulated earnings tax [AET] as it applies to  widely held corporations.  The accumulated earnings tax, section 532  of the  Internal Revenue Code, has been  im posed on closely held corporations that accu mulate earnings and profits (rather than pay  them out as dividends) in order to assist their  shareholders  in avoiding  income  taxes. The  1984 Deficit Reduction Act made the accumu lated earnings tax applicable, for the first time,  to widely held corporations. The AET was an  understandable congressional response to the  formation of  investment corporations which  were created for no true business purpose but  were  simply devised  to  take advantage of  what was at the time a huge disparity between  the capital gains tax rate and the dividend tax  rate, a difference which no longer exists. How ever, although this concern seemed legitimate  for closely held corporations, it is hard to un derstand why there would be this same con.:.  cern with respect to manipulating dividend pol icy in a widely held corporation.  Were section 532(c) simply unnecessary,  I  suppose we could just let it stay on the books.  However,  the continued existence of section  532(c) is actually quite harmful to the decision  making process of legitimate companies. Con tinued application of section 532(c) to widely  held corporations means that the IRS will be  essentially interfering in the corporation's deci sion of whether or not to pay a dividend. If the  board of directors of a corporation believes the  corporation should accumulate  funds  to ex pand,  invest, or conduct research and devel opment,  it must do so with some trepidation  knowing the IRS may invoke the accumulated  earnings tax. Because of the continued threat  of the applicability of the accumulated earn ings tax to widely held corporations, there may  be a  tendency  for corporations  to pay divi dends, even when corporate resources should  be accumulated for other purposes.  Whether the  IRS  is applying the AET with  the intention of collecting it or whether the im position of the AET is used as a bargaining  chip to resolve other issues, the effect is the  same--unnecessary and harmful  interference  in decisions that are best left to the corpora tion. We need to free corporate directors from  the prospect of the AET and encourage com panies to make capital investments in order to  grow and compete  in  the  future. This Con gress, at the very least, should not be discour aging corporations from retaining capital for in vestment purposes.  This legislation has received hearings by the  Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select  Revenue Measures, and it is my hope to offer  this  legislation as an amendment  to appro priate  legislation  in  the Ways and Means  Committee  in  the 1 02d Congress.  I believe  this legislation makes sense and hope my col leagues can lend their support.  ",1991
24,277,1,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to in troduce  the Excess Profits Tax Act of 1991  and I invite my colleagues to back this meas ure.  During the past fall, we have seen the price  of oil more than double ostensibly as a result  of the Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait.  Fears of a shooting war breaking out in  the  Middle East have further destabilized the price  of oil. Throughout this difficult time, the main  beneficiary of the price increase and Persian  Gulf crisis has been the oil industry. Oil pro ducers have realized profits far  in excess of  those they had anticipated for this period, and  realizing  this, middlemen and  retailers have  raised the price of oil even further.  While  those  in  the oil  industry have seen  their incomes jump in the last 2 months, our  Nation's  consumers  and  businesses  have  275  borne the brunt of these price increases at the  pump. lower-and middle-income families are  especially hard hit by these high oil prices.  This excess profits measure would help to  deter and redistribute the huge profits which  oil companies are now realizing. Specifically,  excess profits  in  the oil  industry would be  taxed at a rate of no more than 40 percent for  a period of 3 years. At the same time, explo ration and development of oil resources would  be encouraged under the provisions of this  bill.  Mr. Speaker, in these times of fear and un certainty over the situation in the Persian Gulf,  while our courageous Americans are stationed  in the Saudi Arabian deserts and elsewhere to  protect our interests, it is only right that those  who  reap undue profits  from  this crisis also  contribute to the burdens borne by our Nation.  Mr. Speaker,  I request that the full  text of  this legislation be inserted at this point in the  RECORD:  H.R.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled, That (a) subtitle A of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to in come taxes) is amended by adding at the end  thereof the following new chapter:  ""CHAPTER 7-EXCESS PROFITS TAX  ""Sec. 1571. Imposition of tax.  ""Sec. 1572. Definitions.  ""Sec. 1573. Adjustments to income for years  in the emergency period.  ""Sec. 1574. Excess profits deduction.  ""Sec. 1575. Energy plowback deduction.

""(b) TAXABLE YEARS PARTLY IN THE EMER GENCY PERIOD.-In the case of a taxable year  which begins before the emergency period or  ends after the emergency period, the tax im posed by subsection (a) shall be an amount  equal to 40 percent of the excess profits tax able income for the taxable year multiplied  by a fraction the numerator of which is the  number of days within the emergency period  and the denominator of which is the total  number of days in the taxable year.

25,290,1,Mr. BARNARD.," Mr. Speaker, every Member  of Congress  is aware  that we have serious  problems  in our  financial services  industry.  While the commercial banking industry and its  insurance fund has received the most recent  headlines, problems in the insurance industry  are also starting  to get attention.  In  today's  Wall Street Journal,  it was reported that the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  securities industry is expected to post its worst  results since 1974.  We cannot protect  the deposit  insurance  funds and make our financial servic-..es industry  competitive unless Congress acts-aggressively  to restructure the industry so that it can attract  the capital  it needs to compete in the global  marketplace. Of course, our  immediate con cerns are  the  losses  to  the bank  insurance  fund. We can take two approaches to dealing  with the  losses. First, we can panic and use  taxpayer capital. We can substitute  intense  regulation which  suppresses market  forces  and takes the place of private capital. None of  these will help the overall competitiveness of  the  financial services  industry,  let alone  the  taxpayer. The second approach would be to  change the competitive structure of the indus try such  that  it attracts private capital and  places  it at risk, combined with a system of  aggressive  regulation  that  guides market  forces.  Today I am introducing, along with my col leagues Mr. BARTLETT, Mr. FRANK, Mr.  LA FALCE, Mr.  CARPER, Mr.  DREIER  and Mr.  BAKER,  the Financial  Industry Reform and  Capital Enforcement Act, which embodies the  second approach. This bill is substantially the  same as legislation that we  introduced in the  last Congress as H.R. 1992. Our proposal es tablishes a reciprocal structure for competition  in the financial services industry while provid ing a tough capital enforcement mechanism  that provides for early intervention while solv ing the problem of too big to fail.  It is not an  expanded powers bill  for banks.  It does not  favor one financial services industry over an other.  It will attract desperately needed com mercial capital to the financial services indus try.  It provides for functional regulation of the  financial services industry. It is a fair bill that  protects  the  taxpayer and assists  the econ omy.  I urge my colleagues  to give  the pro posal careful consideration  to  join us  in co sponsoring a solution to this urgent problem.  IN  RECOGNITION  OF  HON. MIKE  CARR UPON RETIREMENT FROM  28  YEARS  SERVICE  AS  CHAN CERY COURT JUDGE  HON. MIKE PARKER  OF MISSISSIPPI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 3, 1991  ",1991
26,290,1,Mr. PARKER.," Mr. Speaker, today I stand in  the Halls of Congress, in the ""people's cham ber,"" to speak in honor of a great citizen of my  district, the Honorable Mike Carr.

Judge Carr enlisted in the Army Reserve in  1942 and served on active duty from 1943 to  January 3, 1991  1946. He was appointed in 1949, and served  21h  years, as  law clerk  to  the Honorable  Edwin R. Holmes of  the U.S. Fifth Circuit  Court of Appeals.  Entering  the private practice of law in my  hometown of Brookhaven, MS, in 1951, Judge  Carr has been a productive and honored  member of the community for many years. He  was elected district attorney of the 14th judi cial district of Mississippi in 1955 and served  in that position until his election as chancery  court judge.

27,290,1,Mr. ROE.," Mr. Speaker, it is with a very spe cial sense of pride and friendship  that  I rise  today to honor a distinguished American who  has served  the State of New Jersey  for 18  years as a judge of the highest caliber and fin est distinction. Judge Thomas R. Rumana tire lessly strived to ensure that the quality of jus tice dispensed by his court was not eclipsed  by the overwhelming quantity of cases before  him.  For his unflagging devotion to his office and  the  sacred  trust  bestowed  upon  him,  his  friends and colleagues will honor him on the  occasion of his retirement from the bench. A  special dinner commemorating his excellence  in public service will be held on January 18 at  the  prestigious  restaurant  The  Tides  in  Haledon, NJ,  to celebrate Judge Rumana's  distinguished  record and exemplary conduct  while serving the people of the State of New  Jersey.  Mr. Speaker,  I have known Tom  for 55  years, since our days at Camp Altaha in the  Boy Scouts, where he displayed his first notes  of  judicial  discretion  by  sounding  reveille  wake-up calls every morning as our camp bu gler.  It was  that same year  that  the  future  Judge Rumana had his picture taken on the  steps of the Paterson Courthouse and was ad vised by a family friend to study law. This was  the  same  courthouse where  he  ultimately  would spend so many late hours toiling over  his judicial responsibilities.  Born and raised  in Paterson, NJ, his par ents, Louis and Elsie Rumana, ran a tailoring  shop on Clark Street. In addition to his bugling  talents, Tom was  renowned as a basketball  ",1991
28,303,1,Mr. DONNELLY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay  honor to Mr. Neil P. Anderson, who  retires  today  from his position as program manager  for base installation security systems, and di rector of development of the U.S. Air Force  Electronic  Systems  Division,  located  at  Hanscom AFB, MA.

I hope all my colleagues will join  me in congratulating Neil Anderson on his re tirement, and extend to him our best wishes in  his future endeavors.  301  UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN PLAYS  KEY ROLE IN SPACE MISSION  HON. F. JAMFS SENSENBRENNER, JR.  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 3, 1991  ",1991
29,303,1,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr.  Speaker,  would  like  to  recognize  the  invaluable con tribution of the University of Wisconsin to the  success of NASA's  recent Astro-1 mission  aboard space shuttle Columbia. The Wiscon sin  ultraviolet  photo-polarimeter  experiment  [WUPPE], developed by the University of Wis consin at Madision, was 1 of 4 astronomy in struments comprising the Astro Observatory.  The objective of the Astro-1 mission was to  study the invisible x rays and ultraviolet rays  emitted from objects in space. Visible  light is  but a very small part of the electromagnetic  spectrum. Thus, a more complete investigation  and understanding of  the universe depends  upon  the study of  these other wavelengths  which do not penetrate  the Earth's atmos phere.  During the course of the 9-day Astro-1 mis sion, NASA  experienced  several  problems  which  threatened  to  reduce significantly  the  amount of science originally planned  for  the  mission. One such problem  involved the  fail ure of the keyboards and video displays on  the two shuttle-based computers used to con trol and operate the Astro Observatory. Con sequently, the shuttle astronauts could neither  enter commands in the computer to precisely  point  the  telescopes, nor visualize what  the  telescopes were doing.  However,  thanks  to  the skill and  tireless  work of scientists on  the ground, expecially  the University of Wisconsin  instrument team,  much of the planned science on the Astro-1  mission was salvaged. With the onboard com puters  dysfunctional, NASA  improvised  by  having Dr. Ken Nordsieck, a University of Wis consin professor of astronomy.  relay  com mands  to  the shuttle orbiter. Dr. Nordsieck  was selected by NASA  to be  the alternate  payload specialist  for  the Astro-1 mission.  Thus, he was trained to operate all of the tele scopes aboard the shuttle. Using those skills  and  ground  based  computer displays, Dr.  Nordsieck essentially guided the shuttle crew  as  they pointed the Astro  instruments with a  joystick.  I commend  the University of Wisconsin  team  for  its outstanding contribution  to  the  Astro-1 mission. The Wisconsin  team was  headed by Dr. Arthur D. Code, WUPPE's prin cipal investigator. Dr. Kenneth Nordsieck was  the coprincipal investigator.  CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM  HON. CLARENCE E. MILLER  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 3, 1991  ",1991
30,303,1,Mr. MILLER of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I believe  one of the most critical  issues  for  the 102d  Congress to consider is campaign finance re form. We all  realize  the  importance of  this  issue, as we  just returned  from our districts  ",1991
31,316,1,Mr. HOLLINGS.," The President's mes sage: Forget about conservation in en ergy policy.  I was an author of fuel  economy  in  the 1970's standard, and  more recently we got our distinguished  leader, Senator BRYAN,  to  lead  this  fight and we put it out on the floor last  year. The administration opposed  it.  With  that  one  little  initiative, we  could save most of the output of Iraq  and Kuwait, 2.5 million barrels a day,  with that one little initiative.  We need an energy policy. But this  crowd came to town in 1981 and they  said, ""forget it."" We had a bipartisan  energy independence policy. President  Nixon,  President  Ford,  President  Carter. We had undergone all of those  oil cutoffs. Kuwait cut us off in 1967;  Kuwait cut us off in 1973; Kuwait and  OPEC doubled the price in 1979. So we  were getting a bipartisan energy inde pendence policy.  President Reagan and Vice President  Bush came to  town and said, ""forget  it."" We are going to appoint my friend  from Charleston, Dr. Edwards, who now  is doing an outstanding job at our med ical university, but Dr. Edwards was  told, ""Secretary of Energy, get rid of  your Department.''  They were going to get rid of the De partment of Education, get rid of the  Department of Energy; let the market  forces operate. The OPEC cartel, that  crowd was running up the price, cut ting off the oil and everything else, and  we were going to turn it over to mo nopolistic cartel forces. It was not any  free market. But they said we did not  need an energy policy.  Now, what we need do is, No. 1, to Ar abize  this Arab  dispute  before war  breaks out. We killed 58,000 in Vietnam  before we Vietnamized Vietnam. You  cannot impose a culture through a bar rel of a gun. They looked upon us as  foreigners there. General Ridgeway and  others said do not start a land war in  Asia. We were told that in Korea. We  were  told that again in Vietnam. We  have  now  Iraq. My geography book  shows Iraq  is  in Asia.  I always said  education is in the second kick of a  mule. We should have learned that by  Vietnam. But there goes the third kick  of a mule in Iraq, a land war in Asia.  And so we got to the point here of  starting a land war because we did not  have an energy policy when what we  really need  to  do  is Arabize  those  forces, and let the Arabs do the ground  fighting if there is to be war. Specifi cally, rather than double from 200,000  to  400,000  the United States ground  troops in Saudi Arabia, American Gl's,  we  should have been drawing  down  from  the 200,000  to 25,000 or 30,000  in  that desert. We keep our Air Force; we  keep our Navy; we keep our air power;  we keep our missile power, and we say  exactly what was said in July; if there  is to be an attack by an Arab upon an  Arab, it is their affair.  I cannot see them having free elec tions  in Kuwait.  I  cannot  see  us  occuping Iraq. I cannot see us leaving a  vacuum there. There is a deep concern,  of course. If you get rid of Saddam, it  is possible that the Shiite majority in  Iraq will join with Shiites in both Iran  and those over in Syria and will begin  taking over in the Mideast. Then we  would really have a can of worms.  Rather than new world order, there  would be new world disorder.  I  think  the President  is mistaken.  They say there are 200,000 Arab support  forces. That is enough for a front line.  Remember, we only had 325,000 troops  in Europe against Russia with all its  missiles and everything else. Now we  are getting 400,000 to 500,000 against lit tle old Iraq, with only 17 million peo ple, with what we ridicule as a very  weak Air Force and no Navy to speak  of. As to the Iraq Army, yes, the Re publican Guards are good, but every thing else is not. We have more forces  deployed there than we had in Europe  to stop  the Soviets. We should draw  down our ground  forces and  let  the  Arabs settle their differences. Because  I do not care what we put in  there,  they are going to have differences once  we are gone.  We are not going to impose a culture  from the barrel of a gun. We are going  to be infidels. You cannot change a cul ture  except  through  an  educational  process, and the barrel of a gun is not  an educational process. Do not make  Saddam a hero. The President started  making him a hero when he personal ized it. When he put this dispute on a  personal basis and started calling him  Hitler,  the President of  the United  States gave him credibility. Anybody  ought to know that.  Teddy Roosevelt said, ""speak softly  and carry a big stick."" We have been  speaking  loudly and all  the generals  are coming out saying  there  is not  enough stick; we are not ready yet. We  cannot  speak  except  in  emotional  terms of rape, torture, and Hitler.  Diplomatic  and  foreign  policy  ex perts would never talk in those terms.  They should be counseling our Presi dent and not playing the game of belli cose rhetoric to charge up the people.  This fellow Saddam has used his mili tary  to attack  two of his neighbors.  That  is exactly what we were  con demned for by the General Assembly  of, what?-the United Nations. In 1983,  on the subject of Grenada, there were  100 votes against us. Kuwait voted to  condemn  us  for  naked  aggression  against our neighbor, Grenada. Then  on December 29,  just a  little over a  year ago, 1989, so-called naked aggres sion in Panama. And who voted against  us? Kuwait. Is Kuwait worth the life of  a GI? Not at all.  We cannot, frankly, adopt the policy  of committing U.S.  troops to combat  aggression everywhere. Tha~ is a bad  policy and a bad mistake. We can. cor rect it with our advice and counsel, as  a democratic republic form of govern ment, by saying let us let those sanc tions work.  In an article on the front page of the  New York Times, day before yesterday,  Patrick Tyler wrote from Baghdad that  the sanctions are working. How? The  ration cards given the Iraqis just a few  months ago are already cut in half in  value.  Iraq has not been paid for one drop of  oil exports since August 2. That is a  $1.5 billion foreign reserve cutoff for 5  months,  and  the  economic  pressure  continues. Let them continue  to live  with that.  We had no special relationship with  Kuwait. There is no  treaty or agree ment, or inference thereof. They would  not let us even land during times of  crisis in the Iran-Iraq war. They would  not let us dock a ship. They would not  let us land a plane. And we said 3 years  ago-the distinguished Senator  from  Arkansas, Senator BUMPERS, and oth er&-the heck with Kuwait. They have  not been our friend. They are certainly  not a friend of democracy and freedom  and human rights.  Our national security is not in any  way threatened. For those who depend  upon getting most of  their oil  from  that part of the world, Germany and  Japan,  their national security could  well be  threatened, but  they do not  find any reason to get involved. And do  not get worried about that little Ger",1991

33,329,1,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, I com pliment my friend from New York. He  has been one of the stalwarts in the  U.S. Senate since the beginning of this,  who has  tried  to  remind  the Senate  that in order for a President to carry  out foreign policy, and for that foreign  policy  to be successful and save  the  lives of Americans, it is necessary that  we stand together and are unified be hind a strong position.  Some may say that the Senator is  rattling sabers on the Senate floor. But  I think if we want to send a message to  Saddam Hussein, my message to Sad dam Hussein  is: Go home,  resign, go  into exile. This man is a threat to the  security of  the  region,  and  that,  in  turn, is a threat to the security of the  world.  I shudder to think of what kind of a  situation we will be in 3 or 4 or 5 years  from now if all the hand-wringers have  their way and Saddam Hussein  sur vives, develops nuclear weapons, and  then starts blackmailing people with  the threatened use of those nuclear or  chemical weapons  in major cities or  ports throughout the world.

Mr.  and Mrs. Paolone celebrated their 50th wed ding anniversary November 30, 1990.  The  pair were married  in  St.  Dominic  Church of Youngstown, OH,  in  1940. Mr.  Paolone worked  for many years as an ac countant  for  the T ochtenhagen Bros. Motors  Inc., Buick dealer in Girard, OH. At the time of  his retirement, July 31, 1978, Mr. Paolone was  employed by  the Trumbull County Commis sioners of Warren, OH. Mrs. Paolone, in addi tion  to caring  for her home and  family, has  been an active and valuable member of the  Girard Federated Democratic Women's Club.  For  the past 50 years, both Mr. and Mrs.  Paolone have been dedicated members of the  St. Rose Church.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to congratulate  Thomas and Agnes Paolone on their 50 years  of marriage. Their commitment to each other  and  to  their community  is exceptional. May  their marriage continue to serve as a much needed example of love and dedication to us  all. I wish them many more years of happiness  together, and I am honored to have two such  wonderful people as members of my district.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  CORRECTING AN INJUSTICE TO  DISABLED MILITARY RETffiEES  HON. C.W. Bill YOUNG  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 7, 1991  ",1991
35,381,1,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, trag ically, because of a  loophole  in current law,  disabled military  retirees with  life-threatening  conditions are losing critical medical coverage  and home health care benefits under the Civil ian Health and Medical Program of the Uni formed Services [CHAMPUS].  The plight of my constituent, Mr. Andrew  Cox, of St. Petersburg, FL, dramatically dem onstrates  the urgent need of this 102d Con gress to amend existing laws to allow disabled  military retirees to retain valuable health care  benefits they were promised in return for dedi cating  their  lives  to service  in our Nation's  Armed Forces.  Andy Cox honorably served  in  the U.S.  Army  for 22 years. Following his  retirement,  he suffered a severe head injury in a fall from  a ladder 3 years ago which left him 100-per cent disabled and  in a semicomatose state.  After spending an extensive period of time in  a hospital, Mr. Cox was able to continue his  rehabilitative  process  at  home with  home  health care benefits provided by CHAMPUS.  One year ago this month, Mr. Cox was noti fied that under a 1972 law, because he had  been determined to be 100-percent disabled  for more than 2 years, Medicare was replacing  CHAMPUS as his health care provider. Soon  thereafter, following an extensive review of his  case, Medicare determined that Mr. Cox would  no  longer be eligible  for home health care  benefits, previously provided by CHAMPUS,  because his condition did not show room  for  ""substantial progress in a reasonable period of  time.""  It was suggested  to  the Cox  family  that  Medicaid may provide the coverage denied by  Medicare.  However,  because  of  a  small  monthly veterans pension to which Mr. Cox is  entitled, he was determined to be ineligible for  Medicaid home health care benefits. As a re sult, Mr. Cox and his wife Terry have had to  sell their home, their furniture, and virtually ali  of their personal possessions in order to sur vive, pay monthly expenses, and provide for  private home health care coverage. The U.S.  Government should not stand  idly by and  allow families such as the Coxes to be ignored  and left struggling financially  in their greatest  time of need.  Legislation  I have  introduced  today, Mr.  Speaker, would close the loophole in current  law which denies health care benefits to those  disabled military  retirees who are most  in  need.  It would make military  retirees with  nonservice connected disabilities eligible to re tain CHAMPUS benefits. Under my legislation,  CHAMPUS would serve as secondary carrier  to provide  for  those health care needs not  covered by Medicare. This  legislation would  retroactively reinstate CHAMPUS coverage to  military retirees who became disabled and lost  eligibility for CHAMPUS prior to enactment of  the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, Americans such as Andy Cox  who dedicated a large part of their life to serv379  ice in the Armed Forces came to the defense  of our Nation in its time of need. In return, we  should ensure that a grateful nation comes to  their assistance in personal times of need, es pecially in tragic times when they become dis abled due to accidents or medical conditions.  Swift enactment of the legislation I introduce  today will send a strong message of support  and appreciation to all past and present Amer icans who have worn the uniform of the United  States and made the Armed Forces their cho sen careers.

49,407,1,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, first,  let  me welcome our newest Senator, JOHN  SEYMOUR, from the State of California.  We welcome him to  the U.S. Senate.  We have a rather critical time in his tory-in my view a very serious time.  This is a very serious debate. We look  forward to his service in the U.S. Sen ate.  ",1991
50,407,1,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, will  the Senator yield to me so that I may  join in the welcome? I feel some empa thy with Senator SEYMOUR since it was  almost exactly 11 years ago that I was  in a similar situation.  I telephoned him following the day of  his appointment, and offered him a spe cial welcome and told him I looked for ward  to working with him. Senator  COATS  and  I  remember having been  through  the  same  experience,  and  I  think he  recognizes  the enormity of  the task that we all face.  So I join Senator DOLE in welcoming  Senator SEYMOUR, and I  look forward  to working with him.  I thank the Republican leader.  SCHEDULE  ",1991
51,407,1,Mr. DOLE.," I thank the majority lead er.  Mr. President, with reference to how  we are going to proceed, first of all, we  need to examine each other's plans. I  am not certain ours is prepared. I un derstand the majority leader is about  to complete his. We are trying to co ordinate, at least on this side, our ef forts with bipartisan  efforts  in  the  House, and, of course, at  the White  House,  to try to come up with some  proposal that will have strong biparti san support  in  the Senate. Until we  have had an opportunity to examine,  not only look at it myself, but to have  a conference with Republican Senators  sometime either this morning or after noon, we will not be in a position to  get consent to proceed to the consider ation. I am not certain; is it a concur rent or joint resolution?  ",1991
52,407,1,Mr. MITCHELL., Joint resolution.  ,1991
53,407,1,Mr. DOLE.," Joint resolution. So we  need to examine the resolution to see  what it says because I still believe-I  am an optimist-I still think there is  plenty of time for Saddam Hussein to  come to his senses. I understand that  the  international community  is seri ous, and what I do not want to happen  is for him to get any misinformation or  mistaken signal from the Congress of  the United States.  It is my hope that there can be some  bipartisan development. I do not think  there has been any effort to make it  partisan. I think there has been on the  House side, but as far as I know on the  Senate side it has not occurred. I have  not taken a whip check. The majority  leader has not  taken a whip check.  This should not be a partisan matter.  We may have differences; it is a democ racy. But I  think our goal nearly in  every case is the same; that is, to get  Saddam Hussein to understand that he  must leave Kuwait.  I am not certain what signal would  be sent if we adopt whatever resolution  we may be given here in the next few  minutes. As  I understand  it, it says  just wait. It does not say how long; 30  days, 30 months, 30 years? So I am not  certain what kind of signal that sends,  but it seems to me it takes Saddam  Hussein off the hook. That may be the  most painless decision,  just wait and  wait and wait.  So it is still my hope  that we can  find some way to authorize the Presi dent to use force  in accordance with  the U.N. resolution, hoping that it will  not happen. And it occurs to me that  one way we might achieve that is to  authorize the use of force-but that is  not the same resolution-in some fash ion to give the Congress, under expe dited procedure, on the motion of the  majority leader and the Speaker of the  House, and a right to rescind that au thorization. It would authorize the use  of  force,  but you would  also  have,  under expedited procedure, a right to  rescind the use of force if the majority  leader and the Speaker feel  there has  been abuse of power or misuse or for  whatever  reason  that  the Congress  should  rescind  the authority  to use  force, if necessary, in accordance with  the U.N. resolution.  Maybe that is a possibility. It is one  that we will be discussing on our side,  one that I hope we might be able to ob tain some support for on the other side  because it just seems to me that is one  way  to get Saddam Hussein's atten tion. I do not know if he is tuned in. He  tells us where he is tuned in.  But I think one way for him to un derstand we are not divided is to try to  accommodate the President's request.  The President  asked  us  verbally  a  dozen times for help. Now he has asked  us in writing. It seems to me there has  to be some way, still preserving all of  our rights under the Constitution, that  we can support  the President of the  United States.  If we can figure out some way to do  that, then we can dispose of the resolutions very quickly. If not, it could be  more difficult. But if there is a deter mination by Members on this side-and  it does not take too many-that we are  proceeding in the wrong direction, we  are sending the wrong signal, then that  might frustrate the efforts of some on  the other side. We do not want to do  that.  I am not announcing that will hap pen, but I am indicating that we have  to make a  judgment on how best we  can underscore  the unity we have in  achieving the objectives of this with drawal from Kuwait and  the restora tion of the government. So we will be  working with the majority leader and  others throughout the day.  I guess there will be debate, but there  is nothing  to debate, unless we  just  want to debate the general gulf crisis.  Until we actually have a resolution be fore us, it is rather difficult to hone in  on anything specific.  Certainly we are prepared to debate.  I believe we should have been debating  for the last several weeks, not at this  last minute when we are coming down  to the crunch. So we are prepared to  proceed in an orderly fashion, even at  this late date. I yield the floor.  Mr. MITCHELL addressed the Chair.  ",1991

58,407,1,Mr. COATS.," Mr. President, I wonder  if I might inquire of the majority lead er a little more definition as to his at tempts to put some type of limitation  on  the debate. I  think one  thing our  new colleague will find is that one of  the great privileges of serving in the  Senate is the ability for unlimited de bate for any Senator at any time  to  say anything he wants on any subject.  When I came over from the House of  Representatives, I found that to be one  of the great benefits that the Senate  had that the House did not have, where  our time is limited. I also found it to  be one of the great disadvantages be cause of the fact that any Senator at  any time may speak on any thing, and  they often do, late at night, and on and  on it goes.  It seems to me that in this particular  situation, with the deadline of January  15 approaching, that some type of reso lution by  the Congress needs  to be  forthcoming  on  a  relatively  quick  basis, so that we do not send a signal  that the Congress does not know where  it wants to go.

64,420,1,Mr. WARNER.,"  I  thank my distin guished colleague. Mr. President,  the  Director-and I repeat-the Director of  the Central  Intelligence Agency, Mr.  Webster, has forwarded a letter to the  chairman of the House Armed Services  Committee which gives his most cur rent views with respect to the issue of  sanctions.  The distinguished majority leader as  well as two other Senators today have  stressed  the  importance of  the eco nomic embargo; that is, sanctions, as  they relate to the decision process that  led to, presumably, this document that  is the proposed joint resolution offered  by the majority party. I think all Sen ators should avail themselves as soon  as possible of a  copy of  this  letter  which I shall make available here in  the Chamber. And that also the leader ship of  the Senate  should  consider  making  available  to  Senators,  the  same briefing that was given to Mem bers of the Intelligence Committee of  which I am a Member, and others-the  distinguished Senators  here  on  the  floor with me from Missouri and Penn sylvania. We were  there yesterday.  I  think that briefing  together with an  examination of this document will help  greatly to explain the current status of  our senior intelligence advisor to the  President with respect to sanctions.  The bottom line as he states is:  The ability of the Iraqi ground forces to  defend Kuwait and southern Iraq is unlikely  to be substantially eroded over the next 6 to  12 months even if effective sanctions can be  maintained. This is especially true if Iraq  does not believe a coalition attack is likely  during this period.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the entire letter be printed at  this point in the RECORD, and I thank  my colleague from Pennsylvania for al lowing me to speak.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as fallows:  CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY,  Washington, DC, January 10, 1991.  Hon. LES ASPIN,  Chainnan, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House  of Representatives, Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in response to  your letter of January 9, 1991, in which you  ask for an updated assessment of the impact  of sanctions on Iraq and on the policies of  Saddam Hussein  subsequent  to my  testi mony before your committee in December.  In that testimony, as you accurately noted,  I observed that the sanctions were effective  technically and that they where being felt  economically and eventually would be  felt  militarily in some areas. I also testified that  there was no evidence that sanctions would  mandate a change in Saddam Hussein's be havior and that there was no evidence when  or even if they would force him out of Ku wait.  You now ask me to: (1) address the impact  of the sanctions on the economy and popu lace of Iraq and on the operational effective ness of its military if left in place for an other six to 12 months; (2) address the ques tion of how Iraq's defensive abilities might  be affected by the sanctions on the one hand  and by having additional time to prepare on  the other if sanctions are allowed to work  for another six to 12 months; and (3) address  the likelihood that sanctions, again if left in  place for another six to 12 months, could in duce Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.  UN  sanctions have  shut off nearly  all  Iraq's trade and financial activity and weak ened its economy, but disruptions in most  sectors are not serious yet. The impact of  sanctions has varied by sector. The most se rious impact so far has been on the financial  sector, where hard currency shortages have  led Baghdad to take a variety of unusual  steps  to  conserve  or  raise  even  small  amounts of foreign exchange. For the popu lace, the most serious impact has been infla tion.  The ability of the Iraqi ground forces to  defend Kuwait and southern Iraq in unlikely  to be substantially eroded over the next six  to 12 months even if effective sanctions can  be maintained. This is especially true if Iraq  does not believe a coalition attack is likely  during this period. Iraq's infantry and artil lery forces-the key elements of Iraq's ini tial defense-probably would not suffer sig nificantly as a result of sanctions. Iraq can  easily maintain the relatively simple Soviet style weaponry of its infantry and artillery  units and can produce virtually all of the  ammunition for  these  forces domestically.  Moreover,  these forces will have additional  opportunity  to extend and  reinforce  their  fortifications along the Saudi border, there by increasing their defensive strength. Iraq's  armored and mechanized forces will be de graded somewhat from continued sanctions.  The number of inoperable Iraqi armored and  other vehicles will grow gradually and the  readiness of their crews will decline as Bagh dad is forced to curb its training activities.  Iraq has large stocks of spare parts and other  supplies, however, which will ameliorate the  effect of  these problems. On balance,  the  marginal decline of combat power in Bagh dad's armored units probably would be offset  by the simultaneous improvement of its de fensive fortifications. While the military, es pecially the army, has been protected from  the impact of sanctions by stockpiling and  minimal usage, during a military action the  impact would be more profound as equip ment and needed parts are expended.  Iraq's Air Force and air defenses are likely  to be hit far more severely than its Army, if  ",1991
65,433,1,Mr. DANFORTH.," The conclusion of  Director \Vebster is that sanctions in  themselves will not lead to the over throw of Saddam Hussein,  and  that  they will not lead him to change his  policy  toward Kuwait. The Director  states that if Saddam Hussein decides  to withdraw from Kuwait,  that deci sion, and I quote, ""will be determined  by his  total assessment of political,  economic,  and  military  pressures  arrayed against him.""  It is my privilege to serve on the Se lect Committee on Intelligence. I am  precluded, of course,  from divulging  classified information I have received  in briefings in that committee. How ever, I am free to state my own conclu sions on the basis of my total under standing. My conclusion is this: Stand ing by  themselves and without  the  credible threat of military force, sanc tions have no chance of expelling Iraq  from Kuwait.  Some  have  argued  that  sanctions  would over time weaken Iraq's military  position and make an eventual conflict  less costly to American forces. But this  assumption is not borne out by the best  available  advice,  including Director  \Vebster's public testimony. The Direc tor states that ""Under known combat  conditions, Iraqi ground and air forces  can probably maintain near current  levels of readiness  for as  long as 9  months."" He  further states  that  the  Iraqi Air Force would feel the effects of  sanctions  to  a  greater degree  than  ground forces, which are more immune  to sanctions, but it is ground forces  that dug into Kuwait in massive num bers and it has been said that ground  forces have never been defeated by air  superiority alone.  Madam President, I know that there  have been various interpretations of fered in the Senate about exactly what  Director \Vebster said in his testimony  on December 5. It could be said that he  testified that sanctions work. Madam  President, if the meaning of ""work"" is  to inflict pain on civilians, that conclu sion is absolutely correct. But there is  no way to read the testimony of Direc tor \Vebster on December 5 and come  out with a conclusion that the sanc tions offer any possibility of removing  Iraq from Kuwait in the foreseeable fu ture.  I would like to quote just a few ex cerpts  from  the  letter that Director  \Vebster has written today to Chairman  ASPIN,  of  the House Armed Services  Committee. These are the words of Wil liam \Vebster. First, characterizing his  testimony of December 5, he said:  I also testified that there was no evidence  that sanctions would mandate a change in  Saddam Hussein's behavior and that there  was no evidence when or even if they would  force him out of Kuwait.  And  then  the Director goes on and says  this:  The ability of the Iraqi ground forces to  defend Kuwait and Southern Iraq is unlikely  to be substantially eroded over the next 6 to  12 months even if effective sanctions can be  maintained. This is especially true if Iraq  does not believe a coalition attack is likely  during this period. Iraq's infantry and artil lery forces-the key elements of Iraq's ini tial defense-probably would not suffer sig nificantly as a result of sanctions. Iraq could  easily maintain the relatively simple Soviet style weaponry of its infantry and artmery  units and can produce virtually all of the  ammunition for  these  forces domestically.  Moveover, these forces will have additional  opportunity  to extend and reinforce  their  fortifications along the Saudi border, there by increasing their defensive strength.  The Director then says:  On balance, the marginal decline of com bat power in Baghdad's armored units prob ably would be offset by the simultaneous im provement of its defensive fortifications.  Ira.q's Air Force and air defenses are more  likely to be hit far more severely than its  army, if effective sanctions are maintained  for another 6 to 12 months. This degradation  will diminish Iraq's ability to defend its stra tegic assets from air attack and reduce its  ability  to conduct similar attacks on  its  neighbors. It would have only a marginal im pact on Saddam's ability to hold Kuwait and  southern Iraq. The Iraqi Air Force  is not  likely to play a major role in any battle for  Kuwait.  ""Our  judgment  remains,""  says  the  Director, ""that even if sanctions con tinue to be enforced for an additional 6  to 12 months, economic hardship alone  is unlikely to compel Saddam  to re",1991
66,446,1,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President, crises such  as the one that confronts us in the Per sian Gulf demand the very best leader ship and judgment our Government can  provide. How  simple  it would be  if  Providence would take our hand, open  our mind, and lead us footstep by foot step into the future. Only under those  circumstances would we have the con fidence  to  know  that our decisions  were infallible, our actions correct, and  our Ii ves secure.  But mortality requires  the exercise  of judgment-judgment that finds  its  source in our history, philosophy, and  cultural ties; in our religious and patri otic convictions; in our concepts of mo rality and our need for security. When  these basic values are examined in the  context of the offensive threat Saddam  Hussein has taken in the Middle East,  it becomes clear why our President re acted speedily and in  the manner he  did.  What Hussein has done not only of fends our sense of morality, but threat ens our sense of security.  It is not  enough that he violently and illegally  annexed Kuwait, that he held innocent  men, women, and children hostage, and  that he has denied his own citizens  basic  rights and needs  to build  the  third largest war machine in the world.  It is not enough that this dictator is  little more  than a despotic madman  who has demonstrated his ruthless be havior by using chemical weapons on  his own people and killing members of  his own family. These are moral issues  that offend us greatly. But our concern  to put down  this deadly hydra goes  even further.  ",1991
67,472,1,Mr. BRZEZINSKI.," Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  If I may, I would like to begin with a brief  personal comment. As many of you know, I  supported President Bush in the 1988 elec tions, and I have supported his foreign policy  all along. Moreover, I do not subscribe to the  notion that the use of force is altogether pre cluded  in  international affairs.  I mention  this at the outset because I would not want  my views to be interpreted as motivated ei ther by political or ideological biases.  Let me also say right off that I have sup ported and still support the initial decisions  of the President regarding both troop deploy ments to deter any further Iraqi aggression  and the imposition of sanctions on Iraq for  the flagrant aggression that it did commit.  The President and his team are to be com mended for the skill with which the inter national coalition has been put together and  for the impressively prompt deployment of  American power. The policy of punitive con tainment of Iraq rightly gained almost uni versal international and domestic support.  Most Americans, I'm sure, share the hope  that the President's recent and laudable de cision to initiate a direct dialogue with the  Iraqi government will lead to a serious and  comprehensive exploration of a non-violent  solution to the ongoing crisis. Wisely,  the  President indicated that the purpose of such  a dialogue is not to merely convey an ulti matum but to convince Iraq that its compli ance with the UN resolution is the necessary  precondition for a peaceful settlement. It is  thus not an accident that those who so fer vently  have  been  advocating war  have  promptly denounced the President's initia tive.  To be meaningful, such a dialogue has to  go beyond demands for unconditional surren der, but involve also some discussion of the  consequences of Iraqi compliance with the  UN resolutions. That means that Iraq, in the  course of the ensuing discussions, will have  to be given some preliminary indications of  the likely political, territorial, and financial  aftermath of its withdrawal from Kuwait.  I  stress  these points because  those who  favor only a military solution will now exer cise pressure on the President to reduce the  incipient dialogue  essentially  to  a mere  transmittal of an ultimatum. That, I trust,  everyone recognizes would be pointless and  counterproductive. It would simply acceler ate the drift to war.  While it is premature to detail here the  substance of a non-violent solution to the  crisis that could emerge from the proposed  dialogue, it is possible to envisage a series of  sequential but linked phases, all premised on  Iraq having  satisfied  the  necessary  pre conditions regarding Kuwait.  First, of course,  its sanctions would be  maintained until Iraq implements its will ingness to comply with the UN resolutions  regarding their withdrawal from Kuwait.  Two, binding arbitration by a UN-sanc tioned body within a  specified  timeframe  would be accepted by  the governments of  Iraq and Kuwait,  regarding  territorial de limitations, conflicting financial claims, and  other pertinent matters.  Three, an international conference would  be convened to establish regional limitations  on weapons of mass destruction, pending  which a UN-sponsored security force would  remain deployed in Kuwait, and perhaps in  Saudi Arabia, to ensure needed security.  It is  important  to note, Mr. Chairman,  that any dialogue to the above effect will be  conducted while Iraq is being subjected to se vere sanctions. The US would be, therefore,  conceding  nothing while  conducting  the  talks. It is Iraq that is under duress, not us.  It is Iraq power that is being attrited, while  ours is growing. It is Iraq that is isolated and  threatened with destruction, not us.  Nor would any such outcome as the one  outlined above be tantamount to rewarding  aggression. Those who argue that do so be cause they desire only one outcome, no mat ter what the price to America-the destruc tion of Iraq. Withdrawal from Kuwait would  represent a massive setback for Saddam Hus sein and a victory  for  the  international  order. It will be a dramatic reversal of ag gression, humiliating and painful to the ag gressor.  However, it is quite possible, perhaps even  probable, that the talks will initially prove  unproductive. In my view, that should not be  viewed as a casus belli. Instead, we should  stay  on  course  applying  the  policy  of  punative containment. This policy is work ing. Iraq has been deterred, astrocized and  punished. Sanctions, unprecedented in their  international solidarity and more massive in  scope  than any ever adopted in peacetime  against any nation-I repeat-ever adopted  against any nation, are  inflicting painful  costs on the Iraqi economy.  Economic sanctions, by  their definition,  require time to make their impact felt. But  they have already  established  the  inter nationally significant lesson that Iraq's ag gression did not pay. By some calculations,  about 97 percent of Iraq's income and 90 per cent of its imports have been cut off, and the  shutdown of the equivalent of 43 percent of  Iraq's and Kuwait's GNP has already taken  place. This is prompting the progressive at trition of the country's economy and war making capabilities. Extensive rationing is a  grim social reality. Over  time, all  this  is  bound to have an unsettling effect on Sad dam Hussein's power.  The administration's argument  that  the  sanctions are not working suggests to me  that-in the first instance-that the admin istration had entertained extremely naive  notions regarding how sanctions actually do  work. They not only take time, they are by  their nature an instrument for softening up  the opponent,  including in the adversary a  more compliant attitude  towards an even tual nonviolent resolution. Sanctions are not  a blunt instrument for promptly achieving  total surrender.  Worse still,  the administration's actions  and its rhetoric have conveyed a sense of im patience that in fact has tended to under mine the credibility of long-term sanctions.  Perhaps  the administration  felt  that  this  was necessary to convince Saddam Hussein  that it meant business, but the consequence  has been  to make  the administration  the  prisoner of its own rhetoric, with American  options and timetable thereby severely con stricted.  The cumulative result has been to move  the United States significantly beyond the  initial policy of punitive containment with  the result that  the conflict of the  inter national community with Iraq has become  over-Americanized,  over-personalized,  and  over-emotionalized. The enormous deploy ment of American forces, coupled with talk  of ""no compromise"" means that the United  States is now pointed towards a war with  Iraq that will be largely an American war  fought  predominantly  by Americans,  in  which-on our side-mostly Americans will  die, and for interests that are neither equal ly vital nor urgent to America, and which in  any case can be and should be effectively  pursued by other  less dramatic and  less  bloody means.  Yet, to justify military action, the admin istration, echoing the advocates of war, has  lately  been  relying  on  the  emotionally  charged argument that we confront a present  danger because of the possibility that Iraq  may at some point acquire a nuclear capabil ity. In other words, not oil, not Kuwait, but  Iraq's nuclear program has become the latest  excuse for moving toward war.  This argument deserves careful scrutiny.  But once subjected to it, this latest case for  war also does not meet the tests, of vitality  or urgency to the American national inter ests. First of all, it is relevant to note tha.t  when the United States was threatened di rectly by  the far more powerful and dan gerous Stalinist Russia or Maoist China, it  refrained from engaging in preventive war.  Moreover, Israel already has nuclear weap ons and can thus deter Iraq, while the United  States has certainly both the power to deter  or to destroy Iraq. Deterrence has worked in  the pa.st, and I fail to see why thousands of  Americans should now die in order to make  sure that at some point in the future, ac cording to experts some years from now, Iraq  does not acquire a militarily significant nu clear capability.  Second, it is within our power to sustain a  comprehensive embargo on Iraq to impede  such an acquisition. Unlike India or Israel,  Iraq does permit international inspection of  its nuclear facilities. This gives us some in sight into its program. Moreover, much can  happen during the next several years, includ ing Saddam's fall  from power. Hence,  the  precipitation of war now on these grounds  meets neither the criterion of urgency nor  vitality.  More  than  that, war would  be  highly  counter productive to the American national  interest. A war is likely to split the inter national consensus that currently exists, the  United States is likely to become estranged  from many of its European allies, and it is  almost certain to become the object of wide spread Arab hostility. Indeed, once started,  the war may prove not all that easy to ter minate, given the inflammable character of  Middle Eastern politics. It could be costly in  blood and financially devastating.  This prospect is all  the more  tragic be cause the United States would thereby be de prived of the fruits of its hard-earned victory  in  the Cold War. We stand  today on  the  threshold of an historic opportunity to shape  a truly cooperative world order based on gen uine  cooperation  and  respect  for  human  rights. Yet, our over-reaction to the crisis in  the Persian Gulf is now adversely affecting  both our priorities and our principles.  In any case, Mr. Chairman, it is war that  soon we may have  to face because of the  combined pressures resulting from Iraqi in transigence,  the  imposition of a deadline,  the lack of patience in the application of  sanctions, and the consequences of massive  troop deployments.

68,485,1,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, recently,  over 11,500 brave men and women of the  1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, KS,  began deploying to the Persian Gulf as  part of Operation Desert Shield. Junc tion City, KS, has been the home of the  ""Big Red 1"" for the past 24 years and  has been the home of the fort for the  past 137 years. Truly,  this operation  has affected Kansas and Kansans in a  very personal way.  Mr. President, I have been particu larly impressed with the outpouring of  community support for the troops and  their families who are staying behind.  Gestures of kindness from all over the  community have been both  frequent  and generous. Community volunteers  have supplemented the efforts under way at Fort Riley's Family Assistance  Center.  I  recently visited  the family  assistance center and was very  im pressed by the level of support the cen ter is providing to Fort Riley's fami lies. And,  the  local  community  is  building on  that support-individuals  and businesses are lending a hand to  those who  are  left behind. For  in stance, a variety of Kansas groups and  organizations have offered  their sup port and assistance including: Kansans  for a Strong Fort Riley, who partici pated along with many others in ""Yel low Ribbon Day"" at Heritage Park to  give a visible sign of community sup port to the Big Red 1; Jim Clark Auto  Center has offered a variety of auto motive services free of charge to de pendents of deployed personnel includ ing  tire  repair,  towing,  and  jump  starts; the Geary County Board of Re al tors has established a ""hot line"" for  military dependents  to assist  in set tling housing maintenance and  land lord  disputes;  First  Presbyterian  Church has volunteered meeting rooms  and  personal  assistance;  the Geary  County Bar Association has  offered  support on legal matters; Montgomery  Ward has offered free video  taping of  messages for dependents remaining in  the area; the Retired Enlisted Associa tion is coordinating volunteers for the  family  assistance  center; First Na tional Bank and Trust Company pre sented a check in the amount of $2,500  to be used by Fort Riley's installation,  morale, welfare and recreation  fund.

69,498,1,Mr. MCCOLLUM.," Mr. Speaker, we are  going to be debating over the next cou ple of days  the most egregious and  most serious matter perhaps this Con gress, or any Congress, has faced in a  number of years. But I want to talk for  a moment not about the Middle East,  but about something else that is criti cal  to our national security  interest  that has occurred to the south of here  within the last few days.  Mr. Speaker, we  lost  three of our  military personnel in El Salvador by  brutal murder by the FMLN, the guer rilla  leftist organization. There has  been on the floor of this House over the  last couple of years considerable de bate about whether we ought to fully  fund the support we have given in the  past  to  the Salvadoran Government  and  to  their military  operations  against the guerrillas and the leftists.  It seems to me that once this has oc curred like it has down  there in  the  last few days, where the leftists have  shown  their  true colors once more,  when they have murdered three Ameri cans innocently after a helicopter was  shot down, and somebody went up and  actually  pulled  the  trigger  on  the  heads of at least  two of  them,  that  there should be no doubt in the mind of  the President of the United States and  the Members of  this body  that we  ought to go ahead and fully fund the  support  for  the Salvadoran Govern ment and its military in its efforts to  subdue  these  leftist  guerrillas  and  bring about full support for democracy  in that war-torn country.  Mr. Speaker, it is an obligation we  have, and I hope we  let that go  for ward.  CONGRESS HAS THE AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY TO DECLARE WAR  (Ms. OAKAR asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her re marks.)  ",1991
70,498,1,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker, I was not  intending to give a !-minute speech be cause I do intend to speak on the vari eties of resolutions, but I do think it is  important to note that during World  War II it was the Congress of the Unit ed States that officially declared war  and voted on that, and that on January  3 we all took an oath of office to up hold  the Constitution of  the United  States of America.  Mr. Speaker, if we want to shirk our  responsibilities  as Members  of Con gress, then what we can elect to do is  to say that the President can do what ever he wants in that area of the world  with respect to force. Or we can take a  different position that says, if we  intend to do that, he has to come to Con gress, and we have that awesome re sponsibility, which is a matter of fact.  If we do not approve of the Constitu tion giving Congress  the precise  re-  sponsibility to do  that,  then I would  suggest  to my colleagues  that  they  offer constitutional amendments and  so on to change the Constitution.  Personally I think the Constitution,  which has been part of our country for  more than 200 years, has worked pretty  well.  The President is the Commander in  Chief. The Congress has the awesome  responsibility to declare war.  REPORT FROM SAUDI ARABIA  (Mr. RITTER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
71,498,1,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Speaker, I just re turned from the Middle East and vis ited in Saudi Arabia along with con gressional delegation GRAY and SOLO MON, and I just want to report back to  my colleagues and  to  the American  people as to what I saw in Saudi Ara bia.  Our men and women  in  the armed  services have performed nothing  less  than a  logistical miracle and perhaps  the most incredible military buildup in  all of history. In 157 days we have put  more men, women, equipment, and ma teriel into that area than went out in  all of World War II and the Vietnam  War. These men and women are coura geous; they are well trained; they are  educated; they do understand why they  are  there;  they do understand the is sues, and I would hope that in the de bate today, as we bring out different  sides of these different resolutions, we  do nothing that would embolden at all  our enemy-that is, Saddam Hussein and  endanger our  service men  and  women  serving  in  that part of  the  world.

While Congress and  the American people  are preoccupied with  Iraq's conquest of Ku wait, we must not overlook the hundreds of in nocent victims who have suffered since  the  Iraqi invasion began last August.  I have seen documented reports from agen cies such as Amnesty International that have  cited the widespread use of arbitrary arrests,  torture, and execution of Kuwaiti citizens by  Iraqi forces.  I have asked the Department of State to ad dress my concerns, and have also asked them  to  look  into  reports that slavery and similar  abuses existed in Kuwait before the invasion.

74,498,1,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to continue my own discussion about  the Persian Gulf situation. We will be  making apparently on Saturday in this  House a very momentous decision. We  will be voting on three resolutions re lating to  the Persian Gulf.  I do not  know of any vote in the last 14 years  that I have been in Congress which has  been as important as this one will be.  Each of us will have to cast a vote  knowing full well that the future peace  of much of the world, the lives of many  American young men and women may  well weigh in the balance. Each of us  will make a decision, I hope based on  the best judgment that we can muster,  using our minds and using our hearts.  This will be,  if any issue has been a  moral question in the last 14 years that  I have been here, this will be a moral  issue, and I would hope that as we de bate, maybe beginning today, certainly  tomorrow and Saturday, that no one  will question the motives of any Mem ber who stands on the floor today, or  tomorrow. or Saturday and speaks on  the question of the Persian Gulf, no  matter what  that  person's position  might be, whether it might be favoring  giving the President the authority to  use force or not favoring that, and cer tainly I hope especially that no one  will assert, as some people have read ing  today's newspaper, partisan mo tives to any Member who stands on the  floor and votes and argues on one side  of the issue or another.  Truly we  are  representatives. We  took, a week ago today, an oath of of fice to uphold the Constitution and to  try to represent our constituents the  very best way that we can. I think that  we must take that responsibility very  seriously.  . I was very interested to see a Wash ington Post poll reported in Tuesday's  edition of  the Washington Post.  It  asked a question: Would the respond ents to the poll be in favor of going to  war with Iraq next Tuesday or some time thereafter if Iraq has not with drawn from  the Persian Gulf by that  time. Mr. Speaker, 63 percent of the re spondents said yes,  they would favor  going to war; 32 percent, no.  I think it is polls like that which re assure President Bush that a majority  of American citizens support his posi tion. I find that hard to believe based  on my own district, because certainly  the mail  that  I  have  received,  the  phone calls  that  I have gotten,  the  comments I have gotten as I go around  my district would not indicate that at  all.

76,524,1,Mr. WALKER.," Mr.  Speaker,  this  truly is an example of Congress han dling the most fundamental question in  the worst possible way. This is clearly  a constitutional question that we are  about to debate. Congress does have a  responsibility to speak to something as  fundamental as whether our soldiers  will be asked to risk their lives in pur suit of a policy.  And how do we handle so basic an  issue? We set up a process by which the  House  of Representatives  and  ulti mately  the Congress will speak with  mixed voices. We will speak with mixed  messages,  mixed messages  to  our  troops,  to our allies, and most  fun damentally to our adversaries. This is  an  issue  that should be voted up or  down without seeking political cover.  Politics should be the last consider ation in what we are doing here. And  yet this resolution is more of a politi cal document than a way of addressing  our fundamental constitutional respon sibilities.  It allows everyone to seek some po litical cover in the course of debate and  in  the course of the votes. Choosing  war or peace should be a yes or no an swer, not a series of ""maybe's."" This  rule allows Congress  to say, ""Maybe  yes,"" ""Maybe no,"" but does not ask us  to take any responsibility for our ac tions.  That  is unacceptable. The vote on  this rule should be ""no.""

78,524,1,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr. Speaker, I  my chairman for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, Congress and  the Na tion must make a  stark and a very  grave choice, whether to rush to war or  whether to stand firm in the gulf and  give sanctions and international pres sure a chance to work. We support the  goals of  the President's policy. And  Saddam Hussein must know that this  country is united against his aggres sion and determined that he must leave  Kuwait.  We support the use of troops to en force the economic sanctions and inter national pressure.  But January 15  is an arbitrary and  unrealistic deadline.  The  sanctions  are working. They  have achieved, as many of my col leagues have suggested, many of the  thank  goals we set out: protect Saudi Arabia,  keep the oil flowing, get out hostages  released. The present policy  is work ing.  Today in the paper the senior Sen ator from Georgia, SAM NUNN, had a  piece  in which he  talked about  the  sanctions and  the embargo.  Iraq, he  says, ""is unique in its vulnerability to  economic embargo. The  international  blockade has succeeded in cutting off  almost 100 percent of Iraq's exports,  mostly oil, stopped over 90 percent of  all imports, and reduced its gross na tional  product by  50  percent. Over  time, experts estimate that Iraq's GNP  would be down 70 percent.""  Diplomatic initiatives are still alive.  We had a  terrible setback yesterday,  there  is no question about that. But  the Secretary General  is active,  the  French and Algerians are active.  January 15 is too soon to declare this  policy a  failure and  to rush  to war.  There are those who believe a war in  the gulf will be a short war, that cas ual ties will be few,  the consequences  contained.    There  is not such thing as a short  war, an easy war. In fact, no war is  ever really over. Ask the families and  friends of the veterans of our last war.  Since I have been in public life, since  1972, a good part of every one of my  days in public life is devoted to dealing  with the problems and the aftermath of  that last war, and the lives of the peo ple who fought that war have forever  been changed.  We have over 400,000 men and women  on  the  front  line. We  are proud of  them, and we stand behind  them 100  percent.  But we believe that the best way to  support them is to make sure, to make  sure that we do not ask them to make  the ultimate sacrifice unless it is abso lutely necessary.  The war  in  the gulf will not be a  short war for us at home either. Our  economy  is already in recession, our  budget deficit  is  looming  larger and  larger, the burden of war will cost us  billions. Already it is costing us $2 bil lion a month.  Mr. Speaker, the President has built  an  impressive  international coalition  behind this policy. But for America to  send our own sons and our own daugh ters out to die alone in the desert with  little frontline support from our allies  is wrong. And for our American people  to still be paying  the overwhelming  cost of  this military venture, while  Japan and Germany have not met their  commitments, in unacceptable.  War is the least predictable and the  most painful of our options in the gulf.  It must be our very last resort. Sup port Hamilton-Gephardt.  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  YATES]. The Chair would remind Mem bers of the precedents and the rules of  the House under which Members are re[Mr.  ",1991
79,537,1,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  voice my opPosition to authorizing of fensive military action at this time.  There is no question in my mind that  Saddam Hussein's brutal takeover and  annexation of Kuwait  represents an  outrageous violation of international  law and civilized behavior. The manner  in which Hussein has ravaged Kuwait  and its inhabitants, held thousands of  foreign nationals as hostages or human  shields,  and  threatened  to  destroy  those  that oppose him has brought  Iraq's deplorable human rights record  to an alltime low. It is very clear to me  that by opposing Iraq's naked aggres sion, we are on the right side of this  issue.  Mr. Speaker, despite my view  that  now is not the time to authorize offen sive  action,  I  think  that President  Bush deserves credit for his initial re sponse to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. His  effort to organize a worldwide coalition  against Iraq  through  the United Na tions and his decisions to defend Saudi  Arabia deserve praise. In addition, his  orchestration  of  international  sanc tions against Iraq was an impressive  display of diplomacy and statesman ship. I applaud these actions and the  objectives stated for the United States  in these efforts.  At the same time, I have had serious  problems with some of the administra tion's performance.  I  find  it deeply  troubling that our allies have failed to  carry their share of the Desert Shield  load. Once again,  it seems  to be as sumed that the United States will bear  the greatest burden in both costs and  lives. The sight of American officials  traveling  the globe  to  solicit  funds  from our allies for an operation that is  more in their interests than ours, pre sents an uncomfortable picture of a  post-cold-war world in which America  bears the brunt of our collective secu rity burden.  Furthermore, the United States per mitted four United Nations resolutions  condemning Israel, our staunchest ally.  By appeasing the so-called sensitivities  of some of our coalition partners, I fear  that we may have sent a signal to some  that may lead them to think that we  have  abandoned  our most  trusted  friend in the Middle East.  In this instance, there are two criti cal decisions before us. The first con cerns who has the power to declare war  or authorize the use of offensive force.  I  adamantly disagree with President  Bush's assertion that he does not need  congressional authority  to wage war  against Iraq. The Constitution is very  clear on this point: Congress shall have  the power to declare war. In order to  make this point absolutely clear to the  President, I am proud to be a cosponsor  of the Bennett-Durbin resolution.  The second, more problematic deci sion facing this Congress is whether we  should authorize offensive military ac tion on or after January 15. While I respect those who hold the view that war  can never be a viable option, that is  not my position. I firmly believe that  there are causes worth going to war for  and there are instances in which war  cannot and should not be avoided. It  may well be that war will be required  of us in the Persian Gulf as the only  vehicle  for saving  the region from a  greater catastrophe at a later date. But  the case has not been made for a war  now.  In  addition,  there  remain  serious  questions of timing and strategy about  which I disagree with the Bush Admin istration. I am by no means alone in  this assessment. Former Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William  J. Crowe, Jr., told the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee  that  immediate  military action would be contrary to  sound military  judgment.  Another  former Chairman, Gen. David C. Jones,  agreed with this sentiment. Even more  chilling  is  the  fact  that one of  the  highest ranking officers in the Persian  Gulf theater, Lt. Gen. Calvin Waller,  flatly declared that our forces are not  ready for offensive action. Assuming  these experts are credible--and I do- the administration's fixation on Janu ary 15 has no military or diplomatic ra tionale. If this is the case, what is the  rush?  Also, given the flurry of diplomatic  activity now  taking place, why must  we close the door to a diplomatic solu tion by January 15? The sanctions and  embargo are having an impact. Nobody  expected  that an embargo against a  country with the natural resources of  Iraq would be an overnight success. For  each day we wait the sanctions only  become more effective and take their  toll on Iraq's ability and desire to hold  out. If we authorize war now, we could  be precluding any solution other than  bloodshed.  I  realize  that some com mentators claim  that we can defeat  Iraq in a short period of time with lim ited casualties. This might be  true.  Nevertheless,  history,  and more  re cently, Vietnam, have taught us that it  is a folly to predict the course of war.  Once we cross the Saudi border, there  is no way of predicting precisely and  completely what will result.  While  I do not support authorizing  military action at this time, I believe  there is a definitive shape any diplo matic solution must take. First, Iraq's  withdrawal from Kuwait cannot be an  end in itself. As long as Saddam Hus sein's military power remains intact,  Iraq remains a threat to American in terests and friends in the region. I do  not doubt that if Hussein is allowed to  walk away from this conflict, military  intact, he will become an even more  dangerous,  long-term  threat.  Our  goal-whether through force of diplo macy-must be regional security and  the  limitation,  containment,  or  re moval of Iraq's offensive capabilities.  Only the elimination or vast diminution of Saddam Hussein's demonstrated  destructive powers can justify the sac rifice of military and civilian lives.  Second, Iraq's withdrawal from Ku wait must be total and prompt. There  can be no doubt that Hussein did not  benefit from his naked aggression.  Finally,  there can be absolutely no  linkage between Hussein's occupation  of Kuwait and Israel's control of the  West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Hussein  took Kuwait in an unprovoked act of  aggression while  the West Bank and  Gaza came under Israel's control as a  result of a defensive war against Arab  attackers. Arguments  linking  these  two  issues are fallacious and  ill-con ceived. To lend any credence to Hus sein's claims is only to play into his  hands. Saddam Hussein did not invade  Kuwait on behalf of the Palestinians.  We must not allow him to claim the  slightest bid of credit for any move ment on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, when an exhaustive and  rational search for peace has failed, I,  with other Members of this body, will  have no course but to support rational  military action. When I am convinced  that war is the only manner in which  we can settle the crisis in the Persian  Gulf, I will support an authorization of  offensive action and do everything I  can  to see  that our  troops will win  quickly and decisively.  Mr. Speaker, if the time comes for  war, I will vote for war. Now is not the  time.  0 1830  ",1991

Throughout the years, securing peace  and freedom and deterring aggression  has been costly. As history  tells us,  turning a blind eye to Hitler-like ag gressions now can lead to a future of  grave consequences for all nations of  the world.  The lessons of World War II and other  wars must lead us here today.  The President has asked the Congress  for a resolution supporting the use of  force in the Gulf as a last resort. Many  of my friends on the liberal side of this  question oppose any use of force in this  situation-they argue that the conflict  is not about naked  aggression,  not  about the rape and destruction of Ku wait, not about human rights atroc ities, and not about a  united world  standing against the totalitarian des pot Saddam Hussein.  They argue that the conflict is over  economics,  self-interest,  greed,  and  money. In short, they argue that the  conflict is over oil and only oil, and  that oil is not worth sending our young  people to die for.  ",1991

104,589,1,Mr. GALLO.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to re introduce a bill that will encourage employers  to create a realistic employee incentive which  will convince more commuters  to take mass  transit. The benefits of this legislation include  energy conservation, easing  traffic, and con gestion, and most importantly will allow all of  us to breathe a little easier.  Early in 1990, I first introduced this bill be cause clean air and traffic congestion gratified  long support for this idea from the port author the New Jersey Department of Transpor ity,  tation, and numerous  ride-sharing organiza tions. This year I introduce my bill with even  more conviction  that  in  the past. Given  the  current situation and uncertainty in the Persian  Gulf it has become especially important for the  587  United States to have a national energy strat egy to address our energy concerns.  My bill provides a monthly tax incentive up  to $75 a month  for employers to encourage  their employees to either use mass transit, in cluding ferries, organized van pools as alter natives to single occupant vehicle commuting,  and most other modes of mass transit.  Current Federal policies create disincentives  for mass transit use and van pooling. The time  has come  to  level  the playing  field so  that  commuters will have realistic alternatives. I am  confident that any costs associated with my  bill can be offset by energy savings and  in creased compliance with new clean air  re quirements.  In spite of some  resistance by  the Ways  and Means Committee during the 101 st Con gress, I believe this is an idea whose time has  come. This year  I am pleased  to  learn  that  Representative FRANK GUARINI, who is a mem ber of the committee, has chosen to join the  fight  for affordable mass  transit  in  the 102d  Congress.  In addition, as a member of the Republican  Energy Task Force appointed  to offer con structive proposals  toward a comprehensive  energy policy,  I am working with my  col leagues to include my initiative in the final pro posal.  This is a free-enterprise solution to several  problems that does not rely on overregulation  and subsidies.  It is also a way of promoting  greater energy independence, and increasing  ridership on mass transit which, in tum, helps  to keep fares  low and to provide money  for  service improvements.  Mass transit represents a necessary invest ment  in  the  future of our Nation. Continued  economic  development  and  continued  im provement in the quality of our lives will not be  possible without it.  ",1991

106,615,1,Mr. HUCKABY.," Mr. Speaker, Janu ary 1990  t'was the best of  times.  It  seemed as though peace was breaking  out everywhere. America's  twin pil lars-capitalism and democracy-were  being emulated everywhere.  January 1991, t'is the worst of times.  War hangs heavy in the air. A bit play er on the world scene, Saddam Hussein,  backed by a million-man army is at tempting to destroy the new emerging  world order by  seizing Kuwait. The  United Nations  in an unprecedented  show of unity, established a date cer tain, January 15, for Hussein to with draw, or he would be subject to mili tary force. The date approaches rap idly. Tomorrow, this body,  the Amer ican peoples' body votes to determine  if it supports the position taken by the  United Nations or if it prefers to con tinue the sanctions.  War. The horror of war. Nerve gas,  germs, bombs will rain on American  troops, as well as on such place as Tel  Aviv and Jerusalem. Thousands, per haps tens of thousands, of people will  be killed. Young American men and  women will not live to see their chil dren enter first grade, to play baseball,  to be cheerleaders,  to graduate from  high school,  to see all  the wonderful  things we  take  for granted  in  this  country. We are about to ask untold  numbers of our young people and their  families  to make  the ultimate  sac rifice. It is a hard vote. The choices are  terrible. It is a decision we will  live  with and will be remembered for,  for  the rest of our lives.  Even with the nightmare facing us, I  deeply believe the right choice  is  to  proceed now and support our President,  and to support the U .N. sanctions are  destined to fail if we think they might  somehow  force Hussein  to  leave Ku wait. If he doesn't withdraw as a result  of the enormous pressure that is now  being applied,  it is,  in my opinion,  naive to think that he will withdraw as  a result of his economy winding down.  Keep in mind that this spring he will  plant a new food crop and will harvest  this fall. If his food is short, there can  be little doubt that a man who would  release nerve gas on certain segments  of his population will also deprive part  of his people of food in order to main tain his army indefinitely. This  is a  path with little likelihood of success.  To me, the choice is clear. It is time to  act.  America is the surviving superpower.  It is proper that we  take all actions  necessary to restore world order. Then,  perhaps, the world can have generation  after generation of peace. To those we  ask to sacrifice, we honor you.

Mr.  Speaker,  the Persian Gulf debate  is  framed in this Chamber by something  as relatively simple: good versus evil,  strength or weakness, war or peace.  However, it is not that simple because  this  is not  another  lifeless  debate  about numbers, revenues, taxes, budg ets, on the floor of the House.  This debate is to authorize the Presi dent to commit American troops to a  war in  the desert 10,000 miles away.  The decision is about life and death,  the blood of our children, and also  about patience.  A rancher came up to me in western  North Dakota a while ago and gave me  a verse, and it went like this:  10,000 men march off  to  fight when 40  statesmen call it right. But had the states men fought instead, their impatience would  have cost but 40 dead.  The question is not, should we  re spond to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait;  we should respond. We have done that.  We stopped the march of Iraqi aggres sion. They are stopped. We have im posed a tough economic blockade. Iraq  can sell no oil. Their GNP has fallen 50  percent and  their economy will col lapse. Time  and  sanctions will not  strengthen  Iraq. Time and sanctions  will weaken  Iraq. Everyone  in  this  room knows that.  Now,  the President and some of our  colleagues say, ""We must do. more. We  must authorize offensive action. We  must  authorize American  troops  to  fight in the Persian Gulf to send a mes sage to Iraq."" Well, Mr. Speaker, that  is not only sending a message to Iraq,  that sends a message of war to Amer ican soldiers.  I have, and I do support the Presi dent's goals. The question here today is  not of goals, but of methods. Do we  need  to go  to war on January 15  to  achieve our goals? I do not believe so.  Have we exhausted every opportunity  through  diplomatic  pressure  and  through economic sanctions, to resolve  this without going to war? No, we have  not.  So, then, what is the hurry? What is  the rush? I feel in my heart, deep in my  heart, that for this country to involve  itself now in a war in the Persian Gulf  would be a disastrous mistake. We need  to  resolve  today  to do  two  things:  First, we need to continue patiently to  apply  high-level  diplomatic pressure  and air-tight, economic sanctions  to  strangle  the  economy  of  Iraq  to  achieve the goals we have set in that  region; second, we need to decide that  whatever happens, we must ask our al lies to begin picking up their fair share  of the burden. It is a fig leaf to call this  a multinational force. It is an Amer ican force, and would be an American  war, and we will decide to spend money  we do not have, borrow it from our al lies,  to send American kids  to  risk  their  lives  to protect allied oil.  In stead, we should move to put the coali tion  forces under  the U .N.  flag and  then fairly share those costs.  When will we understand it is time  for America to ask our allies to bear  their fair share of the defense burden  whether in the Persian Gulf, Europe, or  Asia.  Let me finally say today I am con cerned here not only about war with  Iraq and our role in the world, but I am  also concerned about America choking  on debt and being threatened with an  economic crisis from within.  I  see a  President and a Congress standing tall,  exhibiting steely resolve,  to stand up  and talk tough to a tinhorn dictator in  the Persian Gulf, willing  to borrow  money  from  abroad,  and  risk  our  troops' lives to protect our allies' oil.  With all of that courage, I ask, Demo crats and Republicans,  the President  and Congress, where is the courage to  ",1991

111,628,1,Mr. RAY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup port of  the Solarz-Michel  resolution  and the U.N. Resolution 678. Saddam  Hussein invaded Kuwait over 5 months  ago. President Bush,  in my opm1on,  acted decisively and wisely. He gar*Titles listed for identification purposes only.  nered the cooperation of 28 countries,  and obtained the endorsement of the  Security Council of the United Nations  to use military force to expel Saddam  Hussein and his forces by January 15, if  he did not withdraw or initiate a with drawal action by that date; 82 percent  of Americans approved of his initial ac tion according to polls.  There have been a number of initia tives  to encourage Saddam Hussein's  peaceful withdrawal before this Janu ary 15 deadline, and we remain hopeful  that these will work. President Bush  offered  Iraq 15 different dates  for a  meeting in Baghdad, or elsewhere, be tween Secretary Baker and Saddam none were accepted, and time is run ning out.  On January 3, President Bush made  his last attempt to avoid war by invit ing the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq  Aziz, to meet with Secretary Baker in  Geneva. The meeting  took place on  Wednesday, January 9. This meeting  was made subject to the same condi tions, which are: no negotiations; no  compromise; no attempts for an Iraqi  face-saving; and no rewards for aggres sion. To date, there has been little if  any movement on Iraq's behalf. Min ister Aziz even refused to take Presi dent Bush's letter back  to Saddam  Hussein, which was delivered in Geneva  on January 9.  Secretary Baker and Secretary Che ney on Wednesday, January 2, briefed  several Members and myself on  the  current status. Secretary Baker has  publicly said that he is not optimistic  about peace in the gulf. The leadership  of the House and Senate has said that  full-scale debate should not occur until  after the Baker-Aziz meeting and we  are now engaging in that debate, which  in my opinion is timely.  In  this briefing, Secretary Cheney  and Secretary Baker told the Congress  that  the coalition of 28  countries  is  holding together-currently there are  280,000 American troops and 150,000 pre pared to embark or already underway,  with 200,000 foreign troops in place. Our  allies have committed $23 billion  to ward support  and Secretary  Baker is requesting additional funding  for 1991. I agree very strongly with the  administration  that America cannot  and should not bear the major financial  burden of this conflict.  On Friday, January 4,  I was visited  by former hostage Miles Hoffman from  Columbus, GA. He was the only Amer ican wounded by  Iraqi soldiers, held  captive, and  thankfully was released.  In this meeting, Mr. Hoffman was ac companied by three other former hos tages-Mr. and Mrs. Christopher Fol som of New York, and Mr. Cecil Brown  of Atlanta, who were released in De cember.  I had a very interesting conversation  with this group. The former hostages  advised me:  in 1990,  First, that we should not drag the ne gotiations out. We should strike force fully  in Baghdad, or other areas of  Iraq, and  temporarily  ignore Kuwait  where  Iraqi  troops are amassed; we  should destroy  Iraq's communication  and command centers, and cut off their  supply routes-in effect, isolate Iraq's  forces in Kuwait.  Second, it is  their impression  that  the Iraqi troop morale is not high, and  that they will largely collapse in the  face of a massive strike-a small num ber have already defected. Intelligence  sources have publicly repeated expecta tions that up to 200,000 Iraqi defections  will occur.  Third, according to them, sanctions  are not working-and will not work.  Food and other supplies are entering  Iraq  unrestricted  from  Jordan  and  Iran, and goods are being smuggled in  through Turkey. It is suspected that  Libya and other sympathetic countries  are sending hard currency to Saddam  as a  share of  their oil profits. This  money  enables  him  to  buy  needed  goods.  In addition, Iraq does have an  agricultural capability, which they are  accelerating.  Mr. Speaker,  there are  those who  want to give sanctions more  time to  work, and there are those who believe  that if we were to wait for more time  we would be giving up an essential edge  to our strategy. In my opinion, each  view on this very important matter is  sincerely held, and debate on this issue  should occur.  Miles Hoffman pointed out that Sad dam will not understand the concept of  democratic debate. Mr. Hoffman said  that the people of Iraq do not under stand ""the debate that goes on * * * be cause  in Iraq, anything against Sad dam Hussein is a death sentence."" So it  is very important for us on the floor  today and tomorrow to show our re solve, and to show America's will  to  carry out the U .N. sanctions.  However, I would suggest to my col leagues who are raising the specter of  thousands of U.S. casualties and body  bags coming home that they are ren dering a serious disservice to the fami lies who have loved ones deployed in  the Persian Gulf. My  colleagues,  I  would urge  that we  refrain from  the  use of such rhetoric. Our service people  and their loved ones know the risks- let us not make their lives even more  uncomfortable than they already are.  My view is that the President has the  authority  to engage American  troops  in an offensive action without a dec laration of war from Congress. There  have been over 105 offensive military  actions  in our Nation's history and  only 5 declarations of war.  However,  I concur in the fact  that  the Congress should debate the issue as  we are doing now, and at a minimum  endorse the U.N. Security Council's ac tion. That Resolution, No. 678, author izes an offensive action against Iraq  ",1991
112,641,1,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  3 minutes to the gentleman from Ar kansas [Mr. THORNTON].  THORNTON. Mr.  Speaker,  I  think that the situation in the Persian  Gulf has gone off course. It was appro priate to have an immediate, decisive  response to Saddam Hussein's acts of  naked aggression, and I applauded the  President's insistence upon adhering to  the rule oflaw.  However,  beginning  last  fall  the  President began a  series of military  buildups and ultimatums which cul minated in the setting of a deadline of  January 15. Setting deadline is not in  the interest of achieving a diplomatic  and peaceful solution. However, we now  find ourselves with our forces deployed  and an ultimatum aimed at convincing  Saddam Hussein that the United States  and the coalition of nations mean busi ness.  Long-term peace in the Middle East  must be grounded upon adherence  to  the rule of law. Saddam Hussein's ag gression has violated every principle of  law.  I  believe  the  overwhelming  senti ment  in  this  country would  be  to  achieve a peaceful resolution of this  crisis through diplomatic means.  Our original strategy was based upon  economic  sanctions supported by an  unprecedented  worldwide  coalition,  backed by an overpowering military  force and  the willingness  to use it plus the patience to allow diplomatic  and peaceful solutions to be developed.  Today,  there are many who would  abandon some of the building blocks.  Some would expect a peaceful resolu tion to be achieved if we deny to the  President the option of using all nec essary means to restore international  peace and security, casting into doubt  our willingness to use force.  Others are suggesting that we should  abandon  the. building blocks of pa tience. They are urging that immediate  use of force is necessary.  I do not believe that we should aban don either patience or the possible use  of force. We need to authorize the use  of all necessary means to achieve the  goals of the U.N.  resolution, and we  need  to have  the patience  to refrain  from  using military  force  until  all  peaceful means have been exhausted.  The Hamilton resolution  is,  in my  view, wise in calling for patience, but  mistaken in the supposition that Sad dam Hussein will be  interested  in a  peaceful solution once the possible use  off orce is restricted.  Mr. Speaker,  in order  to convince  Saddam Hussein to accept a diplomatic  49-059  0-95 Vol. 137 (Pt. ll 21  solution, it must be clear to him that  the alternative  to a diplomatic solu tion could be a decisive and forceful re sponse.  The Solarz proposal  contains  lan guage approving the option of using all  necessary means  to  restore  inter national peace  and  security  in  this  area after ""all diplomatic and other  peaceful means to obtain compliance""  have been exhausted.  Calling for patience  in its applica tion-and based upon my conviction  that the best hope for a peaceful solu tion depends upon the building blocks  of economic sanctions supported by a  worldwide  coalition,  backed  by  an  overpowering military  force and  the  willingness to use it, and the patience  to allow diplomatic and peaceful solu tions to be developed-I ask that you  join me in support of the Solarz resolu tion.

113,641,1,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield 3 minutes  to  the distinguished  gentleman from New York [Mr. HOR TON].  ",1991
114,641,1,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, given the  tremendous significance of events  in  the Middle East, I wanted to add my  thoughts  to  today's historic debate.  The crisis in the gulf has dominated  my  thinking since  the early days of  August. I do not take lightly the com mitment of American  forces.  I have  strong personal views on this subject. I  fought in World War II, as an infantry  company commander, and was overseas  for nearly 3 years. I was in two combat  landings, one in North Africa and one  in Italy. I knew  then and know now  that our commitment of forces in that  conflict was vital to our security, in deed, to the security of the world. On  the other side, I served Congress during  Vietnam.  From  that  experience,  I  learned the lesson of what can result  from  the commitment of troops  to a  conflict where our interests are not so  clear, where objectives are not defined.  I have given events  in  the Persian  Gulf serious and continuing  thought.  My conclusion is that our national se curity  is greatly  threatened.  I plan,  therefore, to support the Solarz resolu tion authorizing the use of U.S. Armed  Forces  pursuant  to  U.N.  Security  Council Resolution 678. By debating  and voting on this resolution, the U.S.  Congress is fulfilling its obligation to  the American people and  to our Na tion's Constitution.  I support  the Solarz resolution be cause congressional endorsement of the  U.N. resolution keeps the U.S. position  consistent with  the position of  the  community of nations. It does not put  us ahead of the game.  Keeping our national position con sistent with that of the United Nations  is important. The significance of the  concerted U.N. action to future world  peace is incalculable. For the first time  in world history,  the nations of the  world, acting together, have told an aggressor nation that its aggression will  not stand. If such a precedent had been  taken in 1939 when German troops in vaded Poland, million of lives might  have been saved.  Perhaps the only differences between  Hitler's invasion of Poland and Hus sein's invasion of Kuwait is that Hitler  did not have a standing army of more  than 1 million men. He did not have  deadly chemical weapons and the abil ity to deliver them. Nor was he on the  brink of a nuclear weapons capability.  Saddam Hussein has all of these. It is  in the interest of the United States and  the nations of the world to stop Hus sein now,  to let him know that such  naked aggression against another na tion will not be allowed to stand.  I commend President Bush and Sec retary of State Baker for going  the  extra mile to achieve a diplomatic res olution to the Persian Gulf crisis. The  rebuff of Secretary Baker by Iraqi For eign Minister Tariq Aziz in Geneva was  a disappointing moment for all of us  who desire peace. It is my sincere hope  that the path to peace remains open in  the Middle East and  that U .N. Sec retary General Javier Perez de Cuellar  will not be similarly rebuffed by Iraqi  officials in his efforts to enforce  the  U.N. resolution.  President Bush has been firm in his  actions and has not faltered. The Presi dent has not acted alone and has not  attempted to put the United States in  the  role of world policeman. He has  sought support from the world commu nity and has received that support. His  decision has been and remains to get  Hussein out of Kuwait and he has ap plied a program of mounting pressure.  Indeed, the risks are great and they in crease daily as we approach the Janu ary 15 deadline. However, I believe the  risks are greater if we allow Hussein's  action to stand.  We all want peace-I honestly believe  the quickest way  to peace is for  the  Congress to support the Solarz-Michel  resolution and  let Hussein know  the  Congress stands behind and alongside  the United Nations-the coalition of  nations, and the President and that ag gression will not be  tolerated. Then  and only then will Hussein back down.  D 1520  ",1991

So  everything has  fallen  back,  and  some Members who have alerted their  constituents  that  they are going  to  speak between 5:30 and 6 must realize  they may not get on until 9 tonight.  I just wanted to be very clear about  that. This gentleman certainly in no  way wants to restrict the debate, but  Members have to realize that this list  here is getting longer and longer.

When the House finishes the votes to morrow-and  again we  hope  those  votes will occur in midday-it will be  necessary for the House to stay in ses sion and for Members to be prepared to  be here tomorrow afternoon and maybe  into  the evening, because we do not  know at this point when  the Senate  will act and what resolution will pass  the Senate and, of course, how that fits  with whatever passes  in  the House.

144,667,1,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman  for  yielding me  this  time.  Mr. Speaker,  I have cochaired  the  Congressional Human Rights Caucus  for the last 8 years. During that time I  have attended dozens of hearings and  listened to hundreds of witnesses out lining human rights abuses all over the  globe. Much of the testimony has been  graphic and disturbing. But none has  approached the horror described during  the hearing I chaired in October outlin ing the atrocities the Kuwaiti people  have suffered at the hands of the Iraqi  invaders.  The witnesses-many eyewitnesses- described the most sadistic, cruel, bar baric, brutal, and vicious program of  torture and repression against the peo ple of Kuwait that can be imagined.  The litany of horror perpetrated on  the Kuwaitis by the Iraqi soldiers bog gles  the mind: Mutilation-including  castration, gouging out of eyes, pulling  out of fingernails and toenails, cutting  out of tongues and slicing off of ears,  ripping out of hair and beards with  pliers, and the application of electric  shock, red-hot irons, and lighted ciga rettes to sensitive parts of the body;  Rapes and sexual assaults on women  of all ages, including the brutal rape of  young teenage women in front of their  mothers and fathers;  Murder of babies  in  the neonatal  wards of Kuwaiti hospitals by stripping  the wards  of  incubators  and other  equipment essential for the babies' sur vival; and  Murder and summary execution of  men in front of their entire families,  and the random murder of innocent ci vilian Kuwaitis for the most minor rea sons or for no reason at all.  One witness, Mr. Speaker, said that  the Iraqi soldiers' respect for human  life  is so negligible  that  they make  bets on how many breaths a Kuwaiti  will take between the time he is shot  and the time that he dies.  A female Kuwaiti doctor testified to  the barbaric rapes and to the fact that  the Iraqi soldiers stole her hospital's  blood  supply and  she watched helplessly as a young woman bled to death  shortly after childbirth. She said:  As a mother, I can share each woman's  horrors; as a doctor, I abhor the forced de struction of medical capabilities which has  cost human lives; as a human being, I am en raged to know that other human beings pos sess such brutality and willingness to inflict  pain and suffering on others. My heart goes  out to those courageous people still in occu pied Kuwait who must deal with the savage  behavior of Saddam Hussein and his troops.  The pain and anguish of these people must be  alleviated.  a world  that cares  about  human rights and standards of civilized con duct, how can we stand by and watch this  continue?  In  Mr. Speaker,  there is no nation on  Earth more firmly committed to  the  cause of human rights than the United  States of America. We are looked to as  a beacon of hope for oppressed people  everywhere. We  do not, as do many  others who claim to be civilized, look  the other way as the rights of our fel low human beings are trampled in the  dust. And we cannot and will not look  the other way now.  Mr. Speaker,  the President has re peatedly and correctly warned that if  the United States fails to stand by and  implement the resolutions of the Unit ed Nations  to repel Iraqi aggression,  the ability of the United Nations  to  prevent any future aggression will be  destroyed and that organization,  like  its predecessor, the League of Nations,  will be consigned to the dustbin of his tory.  Mr. Speaker, the United States is the  beacon of hope to create a future world  dedicated  to the rule of law and  the  protection of the basic rights of every  single human being. If we now turn our  backs on  the suffering of the coura geous people of Kuwait, our chance to  lead the world toward that future will  be destroyed and  the barbarism and  brutality of all the Saddam Husseins,  which  has  dominated  so much  of  human history for so  long now, will  prevail. We must not allow that to hap pen, Mr. Speaker, we must support our  President.  D 1740  ",1991

146,667,1,Mr. TAUZIN.," Mr. Speaker, today we  debate, as constitutionally we must,  the issue of congressional authority for  our Commander in Chief to make war to use  the great forces of our Armed  Services in support of the U.N. Secu rity Council's demand  that Saddam  Hussein abandon his illegal invasion of  Kuwait.  As we  individually and collectively  weigh this awful decision, I believe it  important  to examine  the genesis of  this controversy-and I am reminded of  the admonitions of  the most distin guished gentlemen from California, to  feel passionately, as we debate. He  is  correct. While we must act carefully  and deliberately we cannot escape the  deeply felt and often conflicting emo tions which weight the hearts of every  American today. Let us strip this thing  down to its basics.  Saddam Hussein did not invade, Ku wait to capture its cotton fields. He  launched his aggression to capture its  oilfields and its oil weal th.  And we did not deploy our military  forces  to the Persian Gulf to protect  Saudi Arabia's great cotton fields. We  deployed  to prevent Saddam Hussein  from gathering under his unreliable  control those massive Saudi and Arab  Emirate oil fields that would have ef fectively provided  to  this one man,  control of over one-half of the entire  world's supply of oil.  The U.N. Security Council and  27  other partner nations have joined us in  the Persian Gulf for one overriding rea son-and it is not the price of cotton or  even the price of oil: It is the security  of oil-like  it or not-the  fuel  that  drives the economies of both the free  and not-so-free world.  And so today men and women from  Louisiana  and  from  across America  stand poised on the edge of war to fight  for oil-men and women from Louisi ana who would much prefer to be work ing in the oil and gas fields of Louisi ana helping to provide our Nation with  a homemade energy security are  in stead in battle gear defending someone  else's oil fields.  And so here is my passion. To each of  you who with me agonize over the best  way to settle this thing peacefully, I  ask you-where were the votes when it  was time to decide whether we would  produce here at home the energy sup plies we required? When it was time to  decide on moratoria against offshore  drilling in America, did you not see the  danger of reliance on Persian Gulf Oil?  When  it was  time  to consider explo ration of our Alaskan Arctic National  Wildlife Reserve [ANWRJ, did you turn  a deaf ear-pref erring to heed, instead,  the voice of America's environmental  extremists? When it was time for a sen sible nuclear energy policy for Amer ica, did you instead applaud the deci sion to shut down the $5 billion, newly  constructed, Shoreham nuclear  facil ity? When it was time to write tax pol icy did you join in efforts to penalize  domestic drilling-to make  it more  profitable for America's companies to  drill for oil in the Persian Gulf rather  than in the Gulf of Mexico? Did you  prefer to see our Louisiana workers un employed. So desperate for work that  many-many  more  proportionately  than  any  in  America-surrendered  their steel work helmets and donned  instead a military one.  Is it more than wrong that Louisiana  now fields more reservists and National  Guard troops proportionately than any  other State?

148,680,1,Mr. EMERSON.," Mr. Speaker and my  colleagues, since Iraq's brutal invasion  of Kuwait, which was only the most os tensible overt act of Saddam Hussein's  larger purposes, I have been supportive  of the President's prudent and meas ured response to Saddam Hussein's at tempts to hold the world hostage to his  arbitrary  territorial, dictatorial, and  world petroleum supply ambitions. The  events of the past 2 days since Sec retary Baker and Foreign Minister Aziz  met  in Geneva have only reaffirmed  my belief that Congress must give the  President the flexibility to deal with  the situation in manner he prudently  and advisedly sees fit.  Tomrnorrow I will vote  to give  the  President  that  flexibility.  There  is  nothing more atrocious and distasteful  than war.  I hope and pray earnestly  that there will be a peaceful resolution  of the crisis in the Middle East. I am  hopeful that the several diplomatic ef forts of which we are aware will yet  succeed.  However, if they do not, elements of  surprise and force must be available to  the President to pursue the objective  that diplomacy will  have  failed  to  achieve. We must preserve the oppor tunity, the emerging opportunities of  the world resulting from the demise of  communism.  We must not allow Saddam Hussein  to get away with this brutal and tyran nical actions lest other regional terror ist thugs will have the idea that they,  too may intimidate others and be suc cessful in that intimidation.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ""yea"" vote on  the resolution in the support of the So-  larz-Michel proposition.  ",1991

150,680,1,Mr. MOLLOHAN.," Mr. Speaker, it has  been said a number of times, in a num ber of different ways during this de bate, that this vote is, in all likelihood,  the most momentous vote we will cast  as Members of Congress. For every rea son, and we have heard many,  this is  true.  It is important, therefore, that there  be no confusion about our purposes.  They are not, as some have suggested:  To protect a small country against a  large country; to protect oil access; to  shore up an undemocratic sheikdom; or  to support a political system not in our  image. I think that a majority of this  body, as well as a majority of  the  world's citizenry, understand that none  of  these would  justify American  in volvement, or the world's sense of ur gency, and the multinational commit ment.  Indeed, nothing short of the reality  we face would prompt this U.N. under taking.  Iraq,  under Saddam Hussein,  rep resents a clear and present danger to  every country in the Middle East. If he  were permitted to occupy the region as  he has Kuwait-marrying up Iraq's for midable military  power  with  the  wealth  that controlling half of  the  world's oil  reserves  represents-who  could deny  that he would become a  world class military power who would  have  to be dealt with on a grander  scale, requiring greater sacrifices?  Many oppose the Solarz-Michel reso lution because they do not want a mili tary option exercised now, but  they  would  approve  force  after  economic  sanctions failed.  I have heard  them say as much-I  have heard them say things like:  Economic  sanctions  have  had  only  6  months  to work-before undertaking mili tary action, give  them the 6 to 12 months  which President Bush initially indicated it  would take to convince Saddam Hussein to  pull out of Kuwait.  Their reasoning has an initial appeal:  If sanctions have been effective for 6  months, perhaps in another 6 months  they will work magic and bring Sad dam Hussein to his knees.  Well, perhaps they will-but there is  certainly no guarantee. The United Na tions and an array of experts believe  that economic sanctions alone will not  work to remove Saddam Hussein from  Kuwait. The higher probability is that,  without  the  threat of force, Saddam  Hussein will  survive  the  economic  sanctions, while the diplomacy will un ravel.  The passage of the Solarz-Michel res olution now is what is needed to give  the military  option  credibility.  It  should be done now because most of the  Islamic world continues  to welcome  the  presence  of  the multinational  force.  It should be done now because abun dant military resources are committed  and even poised, and their morale  is  high.  It should be done now because Sad dam Hussein knows the next 2 months  are  optimum  time  for  undertaking  military operations in the Middle East.  To  the extent any of these factors  change,  the credibility of a military  option fades, it erodes-and with that  erosion-sanctions are seriously and, I  believe, fatally undermined.  Saddam Hussein  is  a  very  literal  man. What he sees on the surface is  what he believes he's got. He needs to  know that the military option is real that even many of those among us who  want  to ""give sanctions a chance  to  work,"" will support military action in  the final analysis.  It is ironic, I suppose, but we have a  greater chance of achieving a peaceful  resolution of this matter if we support  the possibility of military force now. If  we entrust the President with the dis cretion.  Don't  send  Saddam Hussein  the  wrong  signal. Don't let him believe  that this whole buildup was an exercise  in bluff-something he wants  to be lieve. Let him know that the Congress  and the American people stand behind  the resolve of the United Nations.  Absent the authorization of its use the formidable military force arrayed  against  Saddam Hussein  represents  more an object for his ridicule, serving  to enhance his stature, rather than as  an  incentive which,  in  conjunction  with the economic sanctions, has the  best chance of effecting his quitting of  Kuwait.

154,693,1,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of  the Hamil ton-Gep hart resolution.  Mr. Speaker, listening to the debate on the  House floor, talking to my constituents, talking  to other  interested parties,  listening  to  the  President at a breakfast meeting this morning,  and then debating a long time with myself,  I  have decided  to support  the Hamilton-Gep hardt resolution. This has been the most dif ficult decision  I have had  to make  in my 8  years in Congress.  I would like to support the President.  I be lieve he has done an excellent job along with  Secretary Baker in putting together United Na tions support for his policy in the Middle East.  That policy has accomplished a great deal. It  stopped the Iraqis from invading Saudi Arabia.  It freed all the hostages.  It put in place very  tough economic sanctions which are working.  But, I cannot support a war at this time. I can not at  this  time justify the  loss of American  lives which would result from us driving Iraqis  out of Kuwait and Saddam Hussein from his  reign of terror.  And  I say  that, because  I believe  it's  the  President's policy not only  to  liberate Kuwait  but to drive Saddam Hussein from power and  destroy Iraq's capacity to develop and deliver  biological,  chemical,  and nuclear weapons.  These are all very worthy goals, and I desire  them also, but not at this time and not at the  cost of American lives.  We must give economic sanctions and di plomacy a chance to work. At the same time  that economic sanctions and diplomacy are at  work, the President must work as hard to gain  the support of the American people as he and  Secretary Baker have worked to gain the sup port of the United Nations. The American peo ple do not support a war at this time. They do  not understand our mission at this time, and I  believe it is absolutely necessary for the peo ple in a democracy to support a military effort  of this magnitude  if that effort is to be suc cessful.  At the same time the President is working to  gain the support of the American people, Sec retary Baker must obtain more military and  economic support  from our allies. Yes, we  have a great  International coalition  in place  against Saddam Hussein, but  for  the most  part, it's a paper coalition. Ninety percent of  everything is U.S.A.  In conclusion, let me say I believe time is on  our side. War can wait for another day. Per haps we can be more united at home. and  stronger in  the Middle East with greater real  participation  by  our allies. Give  economic  sanctions and diplomacy a little more time.  If  my position does not prevail in the House and  the Senate,  then  I will very, very  reluctantly  support the President's policy because then it  will also be America's policy.  ",1991

156,693,1,Mr. COX of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I step into  the well of the House today to make my first  comments as a Member of Congress.  Little did  I know on December 1, 1989,  when I announced my candidacy, that my first  vote would be on the awesome issue of war  and peace.  I know all those who will vote on this issue  tomorrow are sincere and are acting in good  faith.  In  the  last several months,  I publicly sup ported the actions of the President.  I supported his placing a defensive force on  the border between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  I supported his magnificent orchestration of  much of the Arab world consistent with our ef forts.  I supported his success with the United Na tions in obtaining resolutions against Hussein.  I saw his policy as movement toward a new  world order: One, where military might was to  be used defensively to bring about peaceful  resolution of disputes  in a complicated, dan gerous world. With the end of the cold war, we  would lead the world with the example of pa tient use of diplomatic nonviolent solutions to  threats against international peace without re sorting to war.  On November 8, the President began mov ing his policy away from defensive use of eco nomic sanctions and  toward aggressive mili tary action.  Now I am asked to give him a blank check  to start a war when he believes that all peace ful means of resolution of this dispute have  been exhausted.  To do so, in my opinion, I give away my re sponsibility under the Constitution.  The time may arrive when I may agree that  all attempts at peaceful resolution have been  exhausted. I will then vote for war.  The Solarz-Michel  resolution  is  the sutr  stantive equivalent of a declaration of war by  this body. After its passage, the President will  have  the sole power to decide when war is  necessary.  A careful reading of the Hamilton-Gephardt  resolution reveals the authors support the ac tions of the President to date. The resolution  pledges the full support of Congress for con tinued application of  international economic  sanctions and diplomatic efforts  to pressure  Iraq to  leave Kuwait.  It pledges maintenance  of military options and does not close the door  to resort to war if necessary.  If you choose to declare war tomorrow, do  so. That is your responsibility. Vote for the So larz-Michel resolution.  If you retain any hope  that this dispute can be resolved without the  terrible violence of war, vote for the Hamilton Gephardt resolution.  I urge you to vote for Hamilton-Gephardt; to  support the President while retaining your abil ity to ultimately decide when offensive military  action is necessary.  We should not yet give up on the hope of  a new world order implied by the initial actions  of the President in this difficult situation.  ",1991

I had also hoped that humanity had reached  the level of development that we could find al ternative, more rational solutions to such inter national conflicts.  Strictly  enforced  international  sanctions can be that alternative.  When we talk of a new world order in the  post-cold-war era, we can find no better exam ple than the universal revulsion and rejection  of the brutal  Iraqi aggression against  its de fenseless neighbor, Kuwait.  The quick and decisive action by the United  Nations has ensured  that Saddam Hussein  has gained nothing from his occupation of Ku wait.  On the contrary, each day the international  economic sanctions are allowed to work weak ens  Iraq-economically,  diplomatically,  and  militarily.  Time is on our side in this conflict.  And if we continue to enforce the sanctions,  the whole world will continue  to be on our  side.  But if we choose war at this time, America  alone will bear  the burden and  the pay  the  costs of that military action.  Let us more strictly enforce the international  sanctions.  Let us use the multi-nation military force in  the region to impose an airtight naval, air, and  land blockade of Iraq.  Let us use our highly capable electronic in telligence capabilities and  rapid communica tion  facilities  to monitor compliance with  the  sanctions.  Let us punish countries and companies who  violate the sanctions by denying them access  to our American market.

161,706,1,Mr. COYNE.," Mr. Speaker, there is no issue  considered by  the House of greater  impor tance than that of war or peace.  As the elected Representatives of the peo ple of the United States, we have the respon sibility to debate the grounds on which our Na tion should consider military action against anthis weighty  other nation. We must also consider whether  the chances of achieving our goals  through  the use of sanctions are so slim that war is  the only option left. Ultimately, we must ask:  Why the rush to war?  The U.S. Constitution places  obligation on our shoulders.  First, we should consider the singular event  that has brought us to this point. On August 2,  1990, the military forces of Iraq  invaded the  neighboring country of Kuwait.  Since that date, Iraqi troops have waged a  brutal campaign of occupation and repression  against the Kuwaiti civilian population. The re cent Amnesty  International  report on  Iraqi  human  rights violations offers ample  illustra tion of Iraq's inhumane policy of terror against  the citizens of Kuwait.  For several months, the Government of Iraq  implemented a despicable policy of hostage  taking against foreign nationals. Hundreds of  United States citizens were seized by Iraqi se curity forces, as were the citizens of nations  around the world. Saddam Hussein's failure to  realize his goals may have led him to release  these hostages, but he still bears the guilt for  having seized human shields in the first place.  We owe him no gratitude.  Iraqi President Saddam Hussein deserves  and has  received  the condemnation of  the  international community.  It is unnecessary to  make comparison of Hussein  to other dic tators, either past or present,  to declare un equivocally his personal responsibility for the  crimes against international peace arid justice  committed by his Government.  The United States has been clear in its con demnation of Iraqi aggression. President Bush  has spoken forcefully of our Nation's resolve  to see that Iraqi occupation of Kuwait does not  go unchallenged.  Let me say now  that  I am  in complete  agreement with  the President and  the goals  set forth by recent U.N. resolutions: The com plete and unconditional withdrawal of  Iraqi  forces  from Kuwait. The U.S. Congress  is  committed to achieving this objective.  Saddam Hussein should  take no comfort  from the debate taking place in this chamber.  This is not a debate over the goals of United  States policy  toward  Iraq, but it  is a debate  over  the means by which we  shall obtain  those goals. Whether by sanctions or by war,  Iraq will leave Kuwait.  On  this point, our Nation has not stood  alone. We have been joined by the nations of  the world in common effort to end the occupa tion of Kuwait.  Since August, President Bush has brought  together an international coalition united in its  determination that Iraq must leave Kuwait. We  should commend the President for his leader ship in this first crisis of the post-cold-war era.  The Bush administration has marshalled an  unprecedented display of global opposition to  the continued Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. Act ing in concert with the United Nations, the ad ministration has been able to implement a pol icy of sanctions against Iraq. American troops  have been sent to Saudi Arabia, where they  have been joined by military units from other  countries.  For  the  first  time  in several decades,  the  United Nations has been able to act decisively  in response to a clear case of aggression. We  ",1991
162,719,1,Mr. SMITH of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from South Dakota [Mr.  JOHNSON].  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr.  Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Gephardt amendment.  Mr. Speaker, the issue of war and peace is  dominant on  the mind of every American  today.  I have just completed a series of 10  town meetings in communities large and small  throughout my State of South Dakota. Each  meeting was attended by overflow, standing room only crowds with  their interest focused  exclusively on events in the Persian Gulf re gion and America's proper role  in  the  inter national order of this new post-cold war era.  Several points were made abundantly clear  at these meetings: That our views on Ameri ca's  foreign policy differ greatly, but we are  united  in support of those courageous men  and women in uniform who serve our Nation  at great risk to themselves and their families;  that while our views differ, we are united  in  our commitment to America and one position  is not somehow more  loyal or patriotic than  another;  that while our views differ, we are  united in our condemnation of Iraq's invasion  of Kuwait and appalled at the brutality that has  and is taking place there.  But the decision to commence an offensive  war is perhaps the most fundamental of all de cisions made by any nation-clearly, for the  preservation of American liberty and our most  cherished rights, South Dakotans will lay down  their very lives and lives of their children. Our  contributions to past war efforts have been im mense, and we view those sacrifices with pa triotic pride.  But as  I travel my State of South Dakota,  visiting the  town meetings,  the church base ment hot-dish suppers, the high school grad uations, if I am to embrace the widow of a Na tional Guardsman, or hold the hand of a re servist's orphan, I need to be able to look that  person in the eye and tell them that their loved  one's death was absolutely necessary to pre serve America's liberty, and that there were no  other alternatives.  My constituents have been telling me over whelmingly, and I deeply believe, that the is sues at stake in the Middle East today simply  do not rise to such magnitude to justify what  will be an almost exclusive sacrifice for Amer ican families-at least not until all other op tions have been exhausted.  Immediately following  the  Iraqi  invasion of  Kuwait, our Government put a stop to further  Iraqi aggression  into Saudi Arabia-that has  been accomplished, the border aggression of  Iraq has been stopped in its tracks. Is it worth  the blood of thousands of our  finest young  people-is it worth the billions from our treas ury-billions which could so much better be  put to use for the benefit of our own people,  is it worth what will with virtual certainty be the  generations-long American military presence  in  the Middle Eastern deserts, all this to re move Iraq from Kuwait this month rather than  this year?  Iraq  is unique  in  its vulnerability  to multi national sanctions-the embargo has cut off  nearly 100 percent of its exports, including oil,  and 90 percent of its imports. Iraq's GNP has  already been reduced by an estimated 50 per cent, and economists predict it will decline by  70 percent as Iraq's economy and military ma chine is beggared.  The current sanctions are truly international  in nature-immediate war, however, will Amer icanize  the conflict  in an unmistakable man ner. The Wall Street Journal recently quoted a  top Arab diplomat as chuckling  that he cer tainly wouldn't send his teenaged son to fight  over Kuwait, but why should he, when  their  American  slaves will do all  the dying  for  them-and tragically, he assessed the current  situation all too well.  CIA Director William Webster has noted that  Iraq's military capability erodes each month  that goes by, due  to  the shortage of spare  parts, munitions, and equipment breakdowns  brought about by  the  international trade em bargo, an embargo which serves  to  thwart  Iraq's high tech and nuclear weapon develop ment as well.  There is, of course, a possibility that military  action now may be quick and decisive; but  there is also the much greater possibility that  a region-wide war, including the unknown con sequence of an  Israeli presence, will occur.  Our strategy cannot be premised on the notion  that immediate use of the military option will  result in a quick, and for us, a largely blood less, solution. Even after an American military  ""victory,"" the aftermath is likely to result in the  need  for a huge American military presence  for generations. Given the reaction of Islamic  governments  to  large numbers of deaths at  the hands of Christian and Jewish forces, the  certain  terrorism, and  the  fanaticism  that  is  likely to be unleashed, it is difficult to imagine  a region which will be made safer and more  stable as a consequence of this war. This is  truly a moment in  time which requires of us  the courage of patience.  The world which watches us today should  understand that policy making in a democracy  is not a neat, simple process. Debate is some times  loud and rancorous, and may give the  impression of divisiveness. But  in a democ racy, public debate is essential-it is a mani festation of our Nation's strength, and not of  weakness.  Saddam Hussein, you should not misread  this debate. Our people, our President, and  our elected officials, Republican and Demo crat, are absolutely united that you must leave  Kuwait-we differ here today only on whether  to accomplish this end by crushing your econ omy and military capability over time through  world-wide sanctions, or to do so through an  immediate military effort. Your failure to leave  Kuwait will destroy your nation either way.  ",1991

The future is about our country, the  world community and the 21st century  and how the world community will re solve conflict. It is also about the fu ture of young people,  young people  throughout  the world,  particularly  those in the desert, those whom I will  nominate next Tuesday morning to at tend the U.S. military academies, and  those who are yet to be born.  It is a debate about a unique oppor tunity  in history. There has been a  change in the world order. There is in creased  democratization  throughout  the world.  Setting aside the immediate crisis at  hand, the world today is safer than it  was 2 years ago, but obviously much  less stable and much less predictable.  However,  in the immediate future at  hand, the world community has come  together. They have come together to  indicate that they will not tolerate ag gression, that they will contain and os tracize those who do not conduct them selves in a human fashion.  But ultimately we must resolve the  question of whether or not we all have  the strength of patience to persevere in  concerted diplomatic and economic ef forts until all options are exhausted be fore military action is taken.  On Wednesday evening of this week, I  held a town forum in Gary, IN, and one  of the 73 speakers was Father Charles  Kniblik. He  spoke  briefly  but  elo quently.  Father  Kniblik  indicated  Wednesday evening that Congress had  a  tremendous opportunity  to educate  the youth  of our  country  and  the  world,  to educate  them that we will  not  tolerate aggression,  that we will  not tolerate violence, but we will deal  with those transgressions through the  strength of our convictions to the last  degree, and only then exercise the mili tary option. The  siege of Richmond  lasted  for a year. Sanctions against  South Africa have not worked over night. We have been patient in contain ing communism since 1945. The  free  world has stood  fast  in Korea since  1953.  Clearly, we are not  talking about  waiting decades to have the removal of  Saddam Hussein  from Kuwait. How ever,  just as clearly, we  should not  have  ever anticipated  the  sanctions  would work in simply 5 months.  Clearly, the answeris sanctions must  be given a  longer period of  time  to  work.  Finally, we are dealing with ques tions of life and death.

The only valid issue is whether to give Presi dent Bush authority to order thousands, even  tens of thousands to their death.  Our allies have done almost nothing to help  with this burden.

167,732,1,Mr. ORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I am deep ly troubled today as I begin my service  in the House of Representatives. I can not  imagine having  to make a more  difficult or more agonizing vote.  I rise in support of the Solarz-Michel  resolution. I believe that ~t is impor tant for Congress to support the Presi dent. I have fully and consistently sup ported  the President's deployment of  American troops, defense of Saudi Ara bia, and imposition of the U.N. sanc tions against Iraq. I question, however,  the President's decision  in November  doubling  the  number  of American  troops in the gulf and setting the Janu ary 15 deadline for Iraqi withdrawal.  This shift from a defensive to an off en si ve posture by American forces in the  gulf has embarked this Nation upon a  high-risk gambit which  I would not  have chosen.  Keeping  the  peace  is more  com plicated  than  simply  delaying  the  onset of war. I have searched my mind  and my soul and have reached a deci sion which I pray is correct. Ironically,  I have concluded that a vote against  the President's authority  to conduct  war will almost certainly result in war.  It would embolden Saddam Hussein and  would not prevent President Bush from  acting without congressional author ity.  On the other hand, a vote granting  the President authority to conduct war  might be the last hope for peace. By ex hibiting unity  of American  resolve,  Saddam might realize that futility of  his actions and withdraw.  In the final analysis, the success of  the President's diplomatic strategy re quires  the  credible  threat of  force.  Once Congress  approves  the  use  of  force, the President must make the de cision whether to use force, and when,  what type and how much force is nec essary.  Mr. Speaker, we are asked to author ize  force and stand prepared  to  take  this Nation into war if necessary in the  hope that war will be avoided. I pray  that we are right. I pray that girding  up  for war constitutes  the  last best  chance for peace.  I will give President Bush my trust  and my vote and my prayers.  ",1991

169,732,1,Mr.  TAYLOR  of Mississippi.," Mr.  Speaker, I am here to tell you that I  am in favor of giving sanctions more  time to work.  When  President  Bush  first  sent  troops to the Middle East on August 8,  1990, he said the mission of our troops  was wholly defensive-that it was not  to  initiate hostilities.  I  support  the  President's decision  to defend Saudi  Arabia. I support the President's deci sion to prevent Saddam Hussein from  selling the oil that he has stolen from  Kuwait.  Beyond our defensive posture,  issue becomes more complicated.  Article I, section 8, of the Constitu tion clearly gives Congress, the author ity to declare war. We met for 20 hours  a day, seven days a week at the end of  the lOlst Congress. At a time when we  could have taken action on this issue,  we were  told by  the administration  that the sanctions were working.  Three weeks later, when we were no  longer in session 2 days after an elec tion-our  President  convinced  the  United Nations  to set a deadline for  withdrawal.  What  happened  during  the weeks  that we were out of session to cause  this change? Were we attacked? Was a  single American killed by hostile fire?  Was one shot fired in anger?  During the same 3-week period, our  Nation  spend $12 billion on  interest  payments alone on the national debt.  Not principal; interest payments. Yet  there is no clamor here or in the White  House to balance the budget.  During the same 3 weeks, freighter  loads of marijuana, truck loads of cothis  Pueblo  caine flooded across our borders, but  there is no clamor to win the war on  drugs.  During the same 3 weeks, three addi tional S&Ls  failed  and yet no  one  clamored to bring the abusers of the  public trust to justice.  Dozens of American industries closed  their doors and joined the ranks of our  maritime industry, shipbuilding, steel  textile and electronic  industries-an other segment lost from what was once  our industrial might. Yet, there was no  clamor to protect the backbone of the  American dream-decent jobs that pro vide opportunity for upward mobility.  During the same 3 weeks, organized  crime  figures  murdered,  extorted  money and bragged of their successes  in manipulating our legal system. Yet  Members who  traveled  thousands of  mills to investigate the wrongdoings in  the Middle East, won't raise a hand  against the criminals at home.  Why are those who are so intent on  solving Kuwait's problem, so reluctant  to solve the problems of people here in  this  country?  America  has  never  wavered in its purpose. We have been  willing to fight for the things in which  we believe.  Historically, we have been a peaceful  nation,  that has acted not  in haste.  When North Koreans captured the U.S.  in January, 1968 and  tortured  and interrogated its 82 crew members  for 11 months, did we attack North  Korea? If not then why now?  The great leaders in this nation have  always thought of war as a last resort.  Some people may ask what kind a  message are we sending Hussein if the  President and the Congress appear di vided in the issue of aggression and of  liberating Kuwait?  With 400,000 U.S.  troops already  in  Saudi Arabia, America  already has  sent Hussein a clear enough signal.  Hussein is a little man. Iraq is only  one of 13 little nations to possess over  1,000 tanks. Iraq is one of 14 little na tions to possess chemical weapons. Iraq  has no Navy. Its Air Force is a  joke.  Hussein is a petty thug.  Tonight, after work, I will walk down  the street to have some dinner-no es corts-no bodyguards-no  fear of the  people  I  have  the privilege  to  rep resent. Tonight, Saddam Hussein, trav eling in a bomb proof vehicle will sleep  in one of his 10 bomb-proof shelters out  of fear for his life. He knows that his  people will one day avenge the murders  that he has  committed against his  countrymen. He  is afraid of his own  people.  No one, no one rushes to Hussein's  defense. All Members of this body re ject Hussein and his methods. All agree  that he must  go.  The  question  is  whether we starve him out, or blast  him out.  A universal criticism of government  is that we always find the most costly  way to accomplish our goals. Must that  ",1991

171,745,1,Mr. MANTON.," Madam Speaker, I rise  tonight in support of the resolution of fered by the majority leader, Mr. GEP HARDT, and the gentleman from Indi ana [Mr. HAMILTON].  Madam Speaker, at the outset,  let  me clearly state that I strongly sup port the following goals of the Presi dent's policy in  the Persian Gulf re gion: First, Saudi Arabia must be pro tected from Iraqi aggression. Second,  Iraq must unconditionally withdraw its  forces  from Kuwait. Finally, Saddam  Hussein's brutal aggression must not  be allowed to stand. I commend Presi dent Bush for his successful efforts to  unite the international community in  its  imposition of economic sanctions  against Iraq.  Let me also state the people of the  Ninth Congressional District of New  York, which I represent, have histori cally rallied around the President dur ing  times of international crisis. My  constituents are patriotic and willing  to make  the  sacrifices necessary  to  preserve freedom and protect liberty at  home and abroad. But my constituents  also know just how costly war can be.  During the Vietnam war, the Pentagon  categorized casualties according to the  home Zip Code  of every  injured or  killed soldier.  Woodside, NY,  Zip Code  11377,  a  neighborhood in my congressional dis trict, in New York City, where I lived  for many years, lost more young men  during the Vietnam war than any other  Zip Code in the Nation; 28 men from  Woodside were killed  in Vietnam, 17  from the Army, and 11 from the U.S.  Marines, including Lance Cpl. Thomas  Noonan, winner of  the Congressional  Medal of Honor. Most of these fallen  heroes were under 21 years of age.  The memories  of Vietnam  remain  painfully clear in Woodside. Before my  constituents are willing to sacrifice a  new generation they must be convinced  war is our only alternative.  Madam Speaker, as of today,  I am  not convinced, nor are my constituents  convinced that all the alternatives to  war have been exhausted.  I also am  deeply concerned that war in the Persian Gulf would  be  shouldered  dis proportionately by Americans. Many of  our allies, particularly France, Ger many, and Japan, have a greater eco nomic stake in removing Saddam from  Kuwait. Yet most of these countries  have been unwilling to commit combat  troops in the event of war. The few na tions willing  to commit  troops have  done so at levels dramatically less than  the United States should war break  out, American  casualties would  ac count for more than 90 percent of total  allied casualties. That would be unfair  to the American people.  Madam Speaker,  the  international  economic  sanctions  imposed  against  Iraq are firmly in place and they are  working. Iraq is not exporting any of  its oil. Iraq's gross national product al ready has been cut by 50 percent. Sanc tions  also  are weakening Saddam's  military by denying his army the spare  parts it desperately needs.  Madam Speaker, before we commit  our Nation to war, we must give eco nomic  sanctions  and other peaceful  means an opportunity  to work. This  much we owe the brave young men and  women who are willing to give  their  lives for their country. Until those ef forts fail, war must remain the last re sort.  I urge my colleagues to support the  Gephardt-Hamilton resolution.  Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker,  I  yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California [Mr. CUNNINGHAM].  ",1991
172,745,1,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Madam Speaker,  I rise in support of our servicemen and  women and  for my draft-age son by  supporting the Michel-Solarz for peace.  No one in this room has my combat ex perience, and,  in most cases, all of  them put together. Gephardt-Hamilton  means a war of attrition, our attrition.  It pains me, Madam Speaker,  that  Gephardt-Hamilton revisits a personal  nightmare. In Vietnam our hands were  tied, and over 55,000 Americans were  killed. Double that number were lost of  our allies. For us  to say our allies  today would cut and run is an unneces sary slap to their face.  Let me tell Members a personal expe rience. I have flown the Mirage fighter  in the Middle East. I know the Iraqi  skills and  their mindset.  I  flew  300  combat missions in Vietnam and was  part of Operation Proud Deep.  President Johnson had stopped  the  action against the North Vietnamese.  None of us wanted  to be  there. We  wanted  to get  the  job done and get  home.  From 1968 through 1972, the North Vi etnamese were allowed to rebuild. We  saw clearly the need for striking North  Vietnam, but his forces and our politi cians held us back. We launched a sec ond  time, but were called back. We  launched a third time, but scrubbed the  mission due to bad weather. We again  asked the politicians for an extension  ",1991

174,758,1,Mr. NEAL  of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, as many of us have pointed  out today, these votes we take on our  Nation's policy in the Persian Gulf will  be remembered as the most important  of our careers, whether we have been  here 1 term, or 25 terms. For that rea son alone, we should not rush our judg ment. History  tells us that when we  rush, or even stumble, into war, we end  up regretting our actions later. A num ber of current and former Members of  Congress have told us that their vote  for the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was  the vote they regretted most. Patience  is a virtue in instances when the con sequences of quick action are so high. I  have been home  in my district for a  couple of months and this is the mes sage  I  have heard  from  the people  there:  ""Don't rush  to war-let  the  sanctions take grip-use force as a last  resort.""  We are all proud of our Armed Forces  in the Middle East. Those brave men  and women have the support of all of  us, no matter what course of action we  favor here today. We all believe that  Iraq should end the armed occupation  of Kuwait, a sovereign nation and an  ally of ours. The aggression of Saddam  Hussein cannot be rewarded. This is a  vital matter for the postcold war world  order. The question is why we have to  make a snap decision, on a short time table, on the use of offensive force.  I am also concerned about the huge  burden that this country has taken on  as we defend Saudi Arabia and seek to  liberate Kuwait. The projected cost of  Operation Desert Shield is projected to  be about $30 billion for fiscal year 1991.  Our allies have pledged a mere $9 bil lion in assistance. This is not enough.  If our allies are going to be the direct  beneficiaries of our military actions in  the gulf, then they must be prepared to  pay an equal share of the costs.  Mr. Speaker,  this will be  the  first  time in American history that we have  set a date on which we will attack an other country. This  is unprecedented  and unnecessary. I do not believe that  enough  time has been given  for  the  worldwide  embargo  against  Iraq  to  have  their full effect. I believe  there  are  additional  diplomatic  channels  that can be brought into play that have  not yet been explored that could lead  to a peaceful solution to this explosive  situation. We owe  it to  the one-half  million American  service men  and  women  in  the Persian Gulf  to com pletely exhaust those options before we  resort to force. War is a last resort and  should be treated as a last resort. I do  not rule out offensive strike at a later  date.  If the President comes  to  the  Congress and demonstrates that sanc tions against Iraq are not working and  will not ultimately work, and if the  President is certain that all diplomatic  options have been explored,  then the  Congress can do  its' duty under  the  Constitution and declare war.  We were right to go to the defense of  Saudi Arabia and our other allies in  the Middle East against the aggression  of Saddam Hussein. Our policy to this  point has isolated this dictator and is  hurting  his  country.  I  believe we  should proceed  from  this point with  caution and patience.  I will vote for  the Hamilton-Gephardt resolution.  ",1991

176,758,1,Mr. KOSTMAYER.," Mr. Speaker, this  is what the House is debating: ""A reso lution concerning the authorization for  use of military force against Iraq.""  Why do we not call it what it is, a  declaration of war?  We  are  debating whether  or  not  America will go to war perhaps in the  next 72 hours.  We are deciding whether to send men  and women to kill and to be killed.  We are debating the most fundamen tal question a democratic society can  debate.  If ever  there was a  time  to speak  plainly, now is the time. This is a dec laration of war and it will  take  the  country into a war that we are  told  will be short and decisive, but which  could be long and bloody.  Mr. Speaker,  this is something the  Congress has done only five  times in  American history, only  twice  in this  century. Is this such a time?  Does  the Congress believe this dec laration  should  Jorn  those  that  launched two world wars in this cen tury?  Is this the new world order?  There seems to me nothing new at all  about  two armies poised to fight one  another to the death on a faraway bat tlefield. War, Mr. Speaker, is definitely  part of the Old World order. This is the  wrong war, at the wrong time in the  wrong place for the wrong reasons.  Mr. Speaker, others before me have  argued for more time for the sanctions  and for diplomacy.  I will not repeat  those arguments again.  But it seems to me that this drive to  war is taking on a perilous life of its  own. It is as if because there are sol diers there, we must fight or surrender.  But war, Mr. Speaker, even necessary  wars, should never be rushed into, and  tonight America is rushing to war.  The very people who would take us to  war now want it to be a secret war.  The New York Times reported this  week that the Pentagon will impose re strictions on the press to keep it from  reporting fully to the American people  the horrors of this war and its bloody  realities.  The Pentagon and the White House  want to deny the American people the  knowledge of  the  suffering  this war  will cause  to so many,  they want to  sanitize it.  If we go  to war, Mr. Speaker, we  ought to see it in its unvarnished hor ror, we ought to see it every night on  the Nation's television screens.  It ought not to be kept from us or  hidden from us. We ought not to be  shielded from  it. We  should see and  share the suffering of our countrymen  who will fight and die in this war.  And so Mr. Speaker, if there is to be  a vote on declaring war, let us call it  what it is. And if there is going to be a  war, let us see and know and feel what  its costs will be  in blood as well as  treasure.  The Pentagon's action  is unprece dented, for  they remember that when  television brought the war in Vietnam  into America's living rooms, America  turned against it.  Mr. Speaker, since others have dealt  with the efficacy of sanctions and the  hopes of diplomacy, let me say a word  about  the country's attitude  toward  this war.  Earlier this week I spoke to the peo ple I represent at three separate public  meetings  in Pennsylvania.  I  found  them deeply divided on going to war.  The polls indicate the Nation is as well  divided. If the war is short and the cas ualties  few,  the President will be a  hero and the war will be judged a vie",1991

178,771,1,Mr. SERRANO.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, for the  last few days  I have had a difficult  time  trying  to  figure out what  this  presentation on my part would be like  today, not in terms of what my vote  would be. That I have known for the  longest time.  But certainly whether it was proper  for me or not to bring into this debate  and into this discussion issues having  to do with my district and the suffer ing of my district.  After much soul-searching and some what despair at times, I have come to  the conclusion that it is indeed appro priate to discuss some other issues as  we discuss this very important issue.  My district being the poorest district  in the Nation and having problems that  we try to get rid of in other nations, I  just wonder what our role would be if  war breaks out. I do not think that we  need to go to war right now. I do not  want to see young men and women die.  I am sure that our allies, so-called al lies, will not help.  TOM DOWNEY on this floor said yes terday that the help they will give us  will be equivalent to the way people in  the South Bronx used  to hold some body's jacket when you got into a fist  fight. That is what they will do for us.  After the war, what? After the boys  and women  come  back  home  hurt,  wounded, and some will not make it at  all,  then what about  the occupation  that will take place? Please do not kid  ourselves, that will be for many years  to come, and that will cost a  lot of  time, a lot of effort and a lot of money.  In the meantime, we will have a lot  of ruined lives, a lot of people coming  back home. You know, today and yes terday and tomorrow morning we will  hear a  lot of people  talk about how  much we feel for the troops and what  great heroes they are and how much we  respect  them. But a  lot of the same  people, with all due respect to them,  when they come back needing support  and medical help and homes and jobs,  will say  that  the economy does not  allow it and  they are fiscal conserv atives and they do not want to spend  the money on  the same people  that  they are sending into war right now.  So my district has to be told some thing that I do not want to have to tell  them in the next few days,  that our  agenda will have to be put on the back  burner;  that the  issue and homeless ness in my district will have to be put  aside for a while, that the fact that I  have more babies born with AIDS will  have to be put aside for years to come  because we have to pay for a war that  we should not be in; that the fact that  I have more babies born addicted  to  crack  in my district  than anywhere  else in the Nation will have to be for gotten for a while so that we can con tinue to spend $30 billion or more every  5 months to take care of this war.  And for what? To restore the legiti mate Government of Kuwait? Legiti mate? A prince and his 50 cousins in a  little kingdom, not sharing with any one else, that is what we are going to  restore in return for not taking care of  the poor in my district?  And Syria, our new-found ally;  if 6  months ago I had said on the floor of  this House that Syria was an ally of  mine, I would have been asked to re move myself from  this floor. Now we  have not even removed them from the  list of terrorist nations, and we are  still calling them our ally.  D 0330  And Saudi Arabia; now is that not  wonderful? A country  that we  send  troops to def end which will not let our  boys and our girls wear medals, reli gious medals, because it offends their  religion. Well,  it offended me  that  450,000 men and women have to be over  there ready to die for a country that  will not let me or someone else wear  my  religious cross because  it is  im proper.  What  is  the hurry? Let sanctions  work. We have  time. We have waited  out Europe for 46 years. My God, we  can wait another year. And  in  the  meantime we will not  lose anybody.  Why do we have to go around trying to  force someone into believing that we  can win this war in a week or win it in  a month?  Mr. Speaker, people talk as if it were  not important, that we will only lose  5,000 men  and women  in  the  first  month, that maybe we will only lose  10,000. Well, yes, that is a number we  throw up, but I  say, ""If you're Mrs.  Smith, or Mrs. Rivera, or Mrs. Rosen berg, and it's your son that died, then  it really doesn't matter that only 5,000  others died.""  There are times when we must make  war. There are times that I would be  willing to declare war. But I am not  willing to do it now because we are not  willing to declare war on homelessness,  and we are not willing to declare war  on AIDS, and we are not willing to de clare war on poverty in this country.  I am sorry. I really hope that we do  not go  to war. But I suspect that we  will. And after we win this war, if my  colleagues want  to call it a victory,  then maybe  I will  travel  to Kuwait,  and I will ask the emir and his cousins  to fund  the poverty programs  in my  district. After all, it is the least they  can do after we restore them to their  throne.  Mr. McCANDLESS. Mr. Speaker,  I  yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut [Mr. SHAYS].  ",1991

The President  should be  given  the authority  to use  the  full  power of our Armed Forces to get Iraq  out of Kuwait. This is an option that  should be made available to our Presi dent. The fact is, diplomacy works only  if there is a strong economic and mili tary force to back it up.  I want  this  issue  to  be  resolved  peacefully, diplomatically. But regret fully, Saddam Hussein doubts our re solve. He doesn't believe we will use  our military  force.

188,784,1,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, in 1935 Italy  invaded Ethiopia. Writing after  the  World War  of which  that  invasion  proved to be  the opening shots, Win ston  Churchill  reflected  that  Mussolini's designs were unsuited  to  the ethics of  the 20th century,  that  they belonged  to  the Dark Ages and  that such conduct was both obsolete  and reprehensible.  Both Italy and Ethiopia were mem bers of the League of Nations. Church ill called it a test case for that ""instru ment of world government upon which  the hopes of all good men were found ed."" The league failed that test. It im posed sanctions which Churchill noted  merely stimulated the Italian war spir it.  Churchill, writing from  the wisdom  of years of greatness, said that Britain  should have  interposed her fleet and  gone to war, if necessary. If ever, he  said,  ""there was  an opportunity of  striking a decisive blow in a generous  cause with the minimum of risk, it was  here and now.""  Mr. President, it is again 1935 and a  dictator has  invaded Abyssinia. It is  1932 and Japan has slashed into a help less China. It is 1938 and Germany has  goose-stepped into Czechoslovakia.  Once again, Mr. President, a dictator  is on  the march. But  this  time  the  world is different. There is an effective  world body, there are powers ready to  take action on behalf of that body, and  there  is no countervailing  threat  to  stay our hand.  If it is necessary we are prepared and  capable to act in the cause of preven tion of aggression, justice for the weak  and defenseless and, dare I say, free dom and democracy.  There are those among us Mr. Presi dent, who say that Kuwait is a monar chy, far from home and hardly worth a  fight or the expenditure of resources,  let alone  the blood of one American  soldier. The  same might have been  said, Mr. President, the same was said  of China and Ethiopia. By the time the  democracies decided to fight it was a  very near thing. By the time America,  over  the vehement  opposition  of  a  strong body of isolationism, edged to ward supporting the forces of democ racy it was almost too late; for mil lions of  innocent men, women,  and  children it was too late.  Mr. President,  I  hear whispers of  those  voices  today.  I  hear  in  this  Chamber  the faint echo of men  like  Senator William Borah who believed  that  reality  and  a wide  ocean  de manded that we  look to our own de fenses;  that we  abandon  democracy  outside this hemisphere as a lost cause.  Mr. President, I remember as a young  man, hearing John F. Kennedy tell this  body and the Nation in his State of the  Union Address that the mere absence  of war is not peace. As long, Mr. Presi dent, as one nation may subdue an other free and  independent state by  force of arms there is no peace. As long  as one nation may at will threaten to  strike the cities of another and attack  her civilians with poison gas and weap ons of mass destruction,  there  is no  peace.  As long, Mr. President, as Iraq con tinues to occupy, and pillage, and plun der, and lay waste to Kuwait, as long  as .the Iraqi Army continues to rape,  and torture, and brutalize, and murder  the people of that tiny land, for that  long, Mr. President there is no peace.  The question before this body today  is an essential one of constitutional  implications. May the President fulfill  his role as Commander in Chief, and  what  is our  role  in  relation  to  the  President?  I would say this to my fellow Sen ators. Over the years I have served in  Washington  I have  learned  that one  does not take military action by com mittee. That is  the duty,  it was deMr.  signed by the Founding Fathers to be  the job of our Chief Executive.  We have a part as a body, most cer tainly. If we disapprove of the action  taken we may force  its cessation by  terminating funding. If we wish to halt  an action  in advance we may order  that no funds be spent. We have  the  power to declare war. What we do not  have is the power to make war.  The President must be able to deal  with  foreign hostilities with  a  free  hand; to use the diplomatic corps and  the Marine Corps with equal facility,  subject only to our power to force a  halt to actions we deem contrary to  the national interest.  President,  at  this  point  and  based on what we know about Saddam  Hussein and the dark forces which rule  Iraq, I do not believe that allowing the  President to conduct a strong foreign  policy is against that interest. Until he  shows me  otherwise  I  believe  that  George Bush, President of the United  States, a man who has seen the face of  war in person, will act with the utmost  concern for protecting the lives of our  service men and women.  I urge the President, to spend money  rather  than  lives,  equipment  rather  than humanity, and to follow the tradi tion we have always had in wartime, to  never send a man where we can send a  bullet.  Before I close, Mr. President, I would  like  to address one other point. We  have heard much over these past days  and weeks about the failure of our al lies  to come  to our support. Since I  have quoted  so much  today  from a  British statesman, I would like to men tion a special relationship, our alliance  with Great Britain.  It is an alliance which for 80 years  has held firm, and which once again  shows  the unyielding bonds between  our two peoples. There are 35,000 Brit ish troops in the gulf; soldiers, sailors,  and airmen a  significant number of  their  overall military.  They  have  placed  themselves at America's dis . posal, and under American command,  to join us in the fight, and if necessary,  to lay down their lives at our side. Mr.  President, there can be no stronger or  finer expression of brotherhood.  Mr. President, I will close with an other  thought by Winston Churchill:  ''There is no merit in putting off a war  for a year if when it comes, it is a far  worse war and one much harder  to  win.""  Mr. President, all the evidence shows  the Iraqis are stalling for time while  they  improve  their defense  and at tempt to destroy our coalition. Delay  will only strengthen their hands and  harden  their hearts.  If sanctions are  working, America can stay its hand. If  sanctions are not enough, then let us  strike while the coalition stands firm  and our convictions and our morale are  high. Let us achieve a clear-cut victory  and get our troops out of the Middle  ",1991
189,875,1,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,  The  Chair now recognizes under the unani mous-consent request the Senator from  Washington.  THE PERSIAN GULF CRISIS  ,1991
190,875,1,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, on the  profound question  facing each of us  here as Members of this Senate,  the  columnist  Charles  Krauthammer  wrote:  The choice between containment and war  is  agonizingly difficult. The outcome  for  each  is highly uncertain. But choosing  in  contingent circumstances is the essence of  policymaking.  Now that choice is ours and only ours  to make. We have no more grave or  consequential responsibility.  On November 28  the United Nations  authorized its members, including the  United States-and I quote, ""to use all  necessary means"" to vindicate its au thority and  force  Iraq  to withdraw  from Kuwait on or after January 15 un less it has already done so voluntarily  and in compliance with earlier resolu tions of the United Nations.  The President of the United States  has now asked us, under the Consti tu tion, to grant him that precise author ity.  The majority  leader's  resolution,  while lauding and supporting the goals  of the President and of the United Na tions, denies  the President  that au thority and only states that the ""con tinued  application  of  international  sanctions  and  diplomatic  efforts  to  pressure Iraq  to  leave Kuwait  is  the  wisest course at this time.""  In the course of their arguments dur ing this debate, proponents of the ma jority leader's resolution have stated  the choice simply and starkly as war or  a continued reliance on sanctions.  Because  they  have misstated  the  choice we will make, because they have  asked the wrong question,  they have  reached an answer, a conclusion, that  is not only wrong but profoundly dan gerous to the future peace and security  of this Nation, not to mention that of  the nations of the Middle East.  The primary goal of the President's  policy, as well as of that asserted by  proponents of the majority leader's res olution, is the total and unconditional  withdrawal of Iraqi  forces  from Ku wait.  As a  consequence,  the first proper  question to ask, Mr. President, is this:  What evidence is there that sanctions,  however effective, will work to secure  this goal?  One part of the answer to that ques tion, about which there is no dispute  whatsoever, is that a period of almost  51/2 months of reliance on sanctions has  not resulted in the slightest degree of  progress  toward attaining  that goal.  No  glimmer of  flexibility has  been  demonstrated by the Iraqi aggressors.  William Webster, Director  of  the  Central Intelligence Agency,  testified  as long ago as December 5, 1990---and I  quote, ""that there is no evidence that  sanctions would mandate a change in  Saddam Hussein's behavior and  that  there was no evidence when or even if  they would force him out of Kuwait.""  Our  intelligence  services  tell  us  today that sanctions will not adversely  affect  the  strength of Iraq's ground  forces during any foreseeable period of  time. There is no discernible crack at  this point in the position that Saddam  Hussein and  the Government of Iraq  have taken ever since the onset of their  aggression.  On  the other hand, all must admit  that certain positive results of sanc tions are equally clear. No one disputes  the proposition that exports from Iraq  have been cut off almost completely. In  addition, Mr. President, 90 percent of  Iraqi imports have been blocked. Cer tainly the standard of living of the peo ple of Iraq is lower today than it was  before  sanctions were  imposed. But  these results, gratifying as they may  be, are not the goal of our policy. Iraqi  evacuation of Kuwait is that goal.  If we examine  the history of Iraq  since Saddam Hussein's ascension  to  power, we note that he waged an 8-year  war against his eastern neighbor, Iran.  That war  dramatically  lowered  the  standard of living of the people of Iraq  and killed and wounded hundreds of  thousands of its citizens, young and  old. This sacrifice did not change Sad dam Hussein's course of action for ape riod of 8 long years, nor did it under mine his power over a nation he rules  with an  iron hand. We  should not,  therefore, underestimate the ability of  Iraq to absorb pain.  During his entire history in office,  Saddam Hussein has used the bulk of  his substantial oil revenues to build up  his armed services rather than the in frastructure  of  his  nation  and  the  standard of living of the people of his  country. These deprivations have been  accepted by the Iraqi people for dec ades.  Why should we expect that economic  sanctions  alone will  cause  Saddam  Hussein to loosen his hold on Kuwait  this year, next year, or ever? Nothing  in his record or in history leads ration ally to such expectation. Will a leader  who will accept war rather than with draw do so because his people line up at  food markets? The question answers it self.  Mr. President,  the bottom  line  is  that  there  are  no  rational grounds  upon which to believe that sanctions,  standing alone, will change the mind  and course of Saddam Hussein and will  gain for us agreement on his part to  withdraw from Kuwait.  The case  for  sanctions, Mr. Presi dent, is based upon vague and foolish  hopes, on self-delusion, and on an all  too natural desire to avoid hard ques tions and harder answers.  But, Mr. President, the debate does  not end here. The case for the majority  leader's position, as stated in its best  and in a proper light,  is better than  that stark contrast between war and  sanctions. In fact, it is better than it is  outlined in the resolution which he has  presented to this body.  It was articulated most thoughtfully  by  the distinguished  senior Senator  from Georgia  [Mr.  NUNN]  in  these  words-and I quote him:  I  continue  to  support President Bush's  original  strategy-economic  sanctions,  a  continued military threat, and patience.  But, Mr.  President,  the majority  leader's resolution, as drafted and sup ported by  the Senator from Georgia,  destroys utterly and without hope of  salvation the Senator's own position.  If the majority  leader's resolution.  passes,  there will be no  ""continued  military threat."" It will disappear as  certainly and completely as last year's  snows. We will be left with sanctions  alone and,  inevitably, at some  time  thereafter, with nothing at all except  the face of defeat.  This is not to say that the policy of  sanctions accompanied by a  credible  threat of force was hopeless from the  beginning.  Perhaps we might  have  acted differently in August or taken a  different course of action in November,  and  it  is  possible  that  acting dif ferently  on  one  of  those  occasions  would  have  had  different  results,  though this Senator doubts it.  But what  is past  is past,  and  to  change course today would most cer tainly be disastrous to us, disastrous to  our allies, to Kuwait, to Saudi Arabia,  to the promises of a real and effective  United Nations, disastrous to the cause  of security and, yes, disastrous to the  cause of peace.  The proponents of the majority lead er's resolution, of course, do not agree  that  the course  they propose elimi nates a credible threat of force. Their  resolution  is  studded with bellicose  language, with  threats, with  state ments of high purpose-at every point  except for its operative language.  But, Mr. President, when will those  threats be carried out? When will the  resolution's sponsors determine  that  sanctions have failed? Its proponents  studiously  and  totally  avoid  those  questions. Do  they  seriously  assert  that the United Nations coalition will  continue to be nurtured and strength ened in its support for the use of armed  ",1991
191,888,1,Mr. MACK.," Again, the central argu ment against authorizing the President  to use force has to do with sanctions. I  have said over and over, it is the opin ion of the Central Intelligence Agency  that these sanctions will not have the  kind of impact that those who support  the sanctions idea are suggesting.  One additional point. All during the  debate today the impression has been  given that to not use force now and to  give sanctions an opportunity to work  has no risk related to it.  In other words, we could go ahead  and try this 6to 12-month extension of  time without really having  to worry  there is not any risk. All we are trying  to do now is wait and see if it would  work, no risk attached. I disagree with  that, and I would like to raise several  points to make my case.  The first consequence  is that there  will be other international decisions,  or other decisions on international for eign policy that this Nation will have  to make, and our decisions will be af fected by our attempts to keep the coa lition together. I would use several ex amples  to  indicate  that that already  has occurred. Not long ago, Syria used  its military power  to  impose on the  country of Lebanon its idea and its so lutions for government in Lebanon. If  the coalition had not been in place, if  it had been months before that coali tion had been put in place, Syria never  would have invaded Lebanon, the Unit ed States would not have, in essence,  turned its back on that use of force.  A second point: The United States  voted several times now to condemn Is rael in the United Nations. I suggest  that that vote for condemnation never  would have taken place if it had not  been for us trying to hold that coali tion together.    A third point: We have been reading  in the last several days, the last sev eral weeks, that Soviet forces are now  in the Baltic States and in other repub lics. We have also seen where they have  taken over printing presses in some of  the republics. And we also understand  that censorship is now finding its way  back in to the Soviet press. I suggest  that the comments we have made to  ",1991
192,927,1,Mr. STUMP.," Mr. Speaker, last week I intro duced House Joint Resolution 55, proposing  an amendment to the Constitution of the Unit ed States to grant the President line-item veto  authority. House Joint Resolution 55  is  iden tical to a measure I introduced last Congress.  For many years,  I was hesitant to endorse  a line-item veto, believing that Congress could  control Federal spending and ensure the prop er appropriations of public moneys without in terference by the executive branch. However,  as  the deficits mounted, and  the burden on  the taxpayers grew, it became increasingly ob vious  that Congress would never voluntarily  restrain its spending or resist the temptation to  put a little something in each appropriation bill  for the folks back home.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The failure of Congress to enact the types  of budget reforms which were necessary  to  ensure  that each dollar spent was put  to  worthwhile and productive use has contributed  greatly  to  the growing  loss of public con fidence  faced by  this body. Congress has,  quite honestly, failed in its duties to protect the  public purse and the public knows it.  Mr. Speaker,  it is said  that old habits die  hard. This  is particularly true of the  tax and  spend habit of the liberals-their unrestrained  desire to spend what we do not have and take  from the taxpayers what they cannot afford. It  is past time that we curbed unnecessary Fed eral spending. Giving the President the author ity to veto individual items in an appropriation  bill would be an important first step toward this  goal.  SID LANGER: A  SENIOR STATES MAN OF AMERICA'S GAS  INDUS TRY  HON. WIWAM LEHMAN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 11, 1991  ",1991
193,927,1,Mr. LEHMAN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week, south Florida lost one of its modern day  business giants: my friend, Sidney W. Langer.  Sid was a self-made ma~a true business  and community leader. I knew him for over 50  years; we both came  to Miami  in  the same  year. He was a  fine and dependable  friend  who was generous with both his time and con siderable talents. He helped many south Flo ridians  through his work  in numerous chari table organizations. He was also an astute  businessman, building a tiny enterprise, Sun  Gas Co., into the second-largest gas utility in  the State.  Mr. Speaker, the imprint of Sid Langer will  long be apparent in south Florida, and we will  miss him.  I would like to share with my col leagues the  following article of his  life which  appeared in the Miami Herald.  SIDNEY LANGER, FOUNDED HIALEAH  (By Lydia Martin)  Sidney W. Langer, chairman and chief ex ecutive officer of City Gas Company of Flor ida, which supplies natural and propane gas  to more  than  80,000  customers  in Dade,  Broward and Brevard counties, died Friday  of a heart attack.  Mr. Langer, 81  founded  the Hialeah com pany in 1949. He continued running it until  his death.  ""He came in every single day,"" said his son  Jack. ""He was a tough old bird who loved his  work. He would have never retired. If he had  retired, he would have been dead in six days,  not even six months.""  Mr. Langer, who was born in New York and  moved to Miami in the 1940's, got his start in  the gas business at age 19 with $600 he had  saved from working odd jobs.  He had said he was thumbing through the  pages of a magazine when an ad for gas  jumped out at him. He traveled to Rochester,  N.Y.,  to meet a salesman and arranged to  sell propane in the Catskills.  In the winters, business in the resort area  became slow. So Mr. Langer opened a branch  in Miami in 1935. It was called Sun Gas Co.  and it operated only in the winter.  925  Eventually, he sold both companies and  volunteered  for  the military  just before  World War II.  After the war, he and his family settled in  Miami and he started Dade Gas Co. By 1949,  Dade Gas was one of the largest bottled gas  companies in the country.  The company, renamed City Gas, later sold  natural gas and in 1988 was acquired by NUI  Corp. of New Jersey.  Mr. Langer became a member of NUI's  board of directors and stayed on as chief ex ecutive officer of City Gas Co.  ""Sid Langer was one of the senior states men of America's gas industry,"" said John  Kean, president and chief executive officer of  NUI, ""Sid was a  true pioneer in the gas in dustry, starting out with a small business  that he eventually built  into  the second largest gas utility in Florida.""  Mr. Langer, a past president of the Gas In stitute of Greater Miami  and of Temple  Judea in Coral Gables, devoted much of his  spare time to local charities.  He gave time and money to Miami Chil dren's Hospital, Cedars Medical Center, the  University of Miami, the United Way of Dade  County,  the Miami Heart Institute, South  Miami Hospital, the Boys and Girls Clubs of  Miami and other groups, his son said.  Named after him is the Sid Langer Kendall  Boys and Girls Club.  Mr. Langer is survived by sons, David and  Jack; grandchildren, Marshall and All1son;  sister, Helen Blinder; and wife, Irene.  Services are scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday at  Temple Judea in Coral Gables, Shiva serv ices will follow at Jack Langer's house in  Coral Gables.

194,927,1,Mr. MACHTLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  in recognition of the 50th anniversary of Paw tucket West/Shea High School.  Former alumni and the present student pop ulation should be very proud of this institution.  For 50 years the high school has provided its  students with quality education. We must re member that it is not the building we are cele brating, but the hard work and determination  of the faculty and students.  Gathering as many as 1,300 alumni, faculty,  and guests  together  for a celebration of 50  years of hard work, is no small feat.  It is de monstrative of the good feelings and pride of  former students and faculty members.  It is with great pleasure that I salute Paw tucket West/Shea High School.  It  is a  role  model  for our State as well as the Nation.  I  wish  them continued success  in  their excel lence  in providing  their students with a  fine  education. I hope that the legacy of the school  carries on for another 50 years.  ",1991

198,992,1,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. President, since the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the world has  united to condemn,  in judgment,  the  Iraqi Government. President Bush has  sought every possible diplomatic or po litical solution. The world and America  now demand resolution of  the chaos  created by Saddam Hussein. Hussein  seeks ""just and dignified treatment.""  That was what his Foreign Minister  told Secretary of State Jim Baker just  this week. Yet he has consistently dis played a character void of human de cency, dignity, and justice.  The situation is clear now. In fact, to  quote  the former Assistant Secretary  of Defense Richard Perle, ""If America  fails when the issues are so clear, the  aggression so unambiguous,  the value  so fundamental, the international com munity so united, how will America  fare in a far more common condition of  confusion, divided opinion, ambiguity  and moral uncertainty?""  The world is united-and I have  to  commend President Bush for the effort  ",1991
199,1018,1,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President, last week  I took the Senate floor and stated that  I would not support any action by any  administration  that unnecessarily or  prematurely  commits American  sol diers  to offensive military operations  wherever world conflicts may occur.  This morning I voted against war and  in favor of Senate Joint Resolution l,  which would have continued the appli cation of international sanctions and  diplomatic efforts to pressure Iraq to  leave Kuwait. Regretfully, it failed.  This afternoon Mr. President, we find  ourselves at a critical crossroads in our  Nation's history. The Bush administra tion-in keeping with article 1, section  8 of  the Constitution-bas come  to  Congress and requested specific author ization  to  initiate offensive military  actions in the Persian Gulf if Saddam  Hussein's army isn't out of Kuwait by  the U.N.-imposed deadline of January  15, 1991.  As we  consider  the President's re quest today, there are two very impor tant issues which must be addressed.  One  issue is procedural. It has  to do  with a very fundamental constitutional  prerogative. That is, which of the three  branches of our Federal Government  has the responsibility and authority to  declare war?  The  second  issue-related  to  the  first-is substantive. Will the Congress,  as duly elected representatives of the  American people, authorize our Presi dent to send troops into battle in the  Persian Gulf to achieve the commonly  held objective of restoring  the  terri torial integrity of Kuwait as a nation  state in the Middle East?  Concerning  the procedural  issue,  I  am very pleased that the Bush admin istration has chosen  to avoid a  con stitutional confrontation between  the  executive and  legislative branches of  government  over  this matter.  The  wording of the Cons ti tu ti on and  the  matter. The wording of the Constitu tion and the accompanying historical  records appear to be quite clear. How ever, the practice of this and previous  administrations with respect to Amer ican  troop deployments and offensive  engagements  has-over  time-been  troubling to congressional leaders and  constitutional scholars.  Under the Constitution, war powers  are divided. Congress has the power to  declare war and raise and support the  Armed Forces  (article  I,  section 8),  while  the President is Commander in  Chief (article Il, section 2). It is gen erally agreed  that as Commander  in  Chief,  the President is empowered to  repel  attacks  against  the  United  States.  During  the Vietnam war, however,  when the United States found itself in volved for many years in an undeclared  and unpopular war, Congress sought to  reassert its authority to decide when  the country should become involved in  a war or the use of armed forces that  might lead to war. As a result, On No vember 7, 1973, it passed the War Pow ers Resolution (Public Law 93-148) over  the veto of President Richard Nixon.  This legislation asserted Congress' ex clusive authority and denied the Presi dent's authority to decide for war or  peace.  Only last week, President Bush was  holding steadfastly to the view that he  had the authority to use force without  a declaration of war by Congress and  without any explicit authorization.  Needless to say, the American public  breathed  a  collective  sigh of  relief  when the President changed his view  and recognized the constitutional im perative that he must obtain congres sional  approval  to  iniaite  offensive  military action  in  the Persian Gulf.  This was a welcomed development and  coincided with my cosponsorship of the  Harkin resolution (S. Res. 8) which re affirms the widely accepted legal view  that it is Congress and Congress alone  that has the power to declare war.  Let me turn now to the substantive  issue of whether Congress should re spond in the affirmative to the Presi dent's request that it approve the ""use  of all necessary means""  to get Iraqi  forces out of Kuwait.  I supported the President's decisive  action to send U.S. military forces into  the Persian Gulf under the auspices of  the United Nations. There is no ques tion that this action was necessary and  appropriate in the face of the Iraqi in vasion and occupation of neighboring  Kuwait. Such unprovoked aggression  by any nation should not be tolerated  in a world governed by laws. The re spect  for  international boundaries  is  fundamental  to  the maintenance of  world peace.  Following Iraq's illegal  takeover of  Kuwait, the United Nations has adopt ed  12  resolutions  over  the  past  5  months in an attempt to resolve  the  crisis peacefully and without the use of  force. The center piece of the U.N. ini tiatives was an agreement  to apply  economic sanctions against Iraq which  would result in its peaceful withdrawal  from Kuwait.  ",1991

201,1031,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.  ,1991
202,1031,1,Mr.  THE GULF RESOLUTIONS  BUMPERS.," Mr.  President,  I  spoke on Thursday evening regarding  the  two  resolutions which we  just  voted on in a very highly charged and  dramatic time in the Senate an hour  ago. I would like to make a few addi tional comments about that vote.  First of all, I do not question the sin cerity of a single Senator as to why he  or she voted the way they did. I have  never seen a time where I thought par tisanship played a  smaller role, even  though the votes might indicate other wise.  I think the American people mostly though  they are divided deeply over  this whole issue-instinctively want to  support the President, but they are not  prepared to go to war.  My mail and my phone calls have  been  evenly divided  for  some  time,  even though for the first 4112 months of  our presence in Saudi Arabia, since the  invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, my mail  had been running about 10 to 1 against  war.  Mr. President, there is a side of me in the interest of candor-that would  like  to  launch at least a preemptive  strike immediately to take out all the  chemical and biological weapons, stor age and manufacturing facilities, and  to eliminate all of Saddam Hussein's  nuclear facilities, even though I think  he is probably a long time away from  developing a deliverable nuclear weap on. I am talking about years.  Mr. ROBB assumed the Chair.  ",1991
203,1031,1,Mr. BUMPERS.," But, Mr. President,  my vote today was calculated on the  proposition  that force  should be  the  last  alternative  and  that  constitu tionally I had a duty to either agree to  give  the President authority to com mence hostilities any time on or after  next Tuesday or  to  join  the  ""Wait Just-a-Minute Club""  and  say  let us  wait a  few more days,  a  few more  weeks without giving up the option for  the use of force sometime before sum mer sets in, and the belief that diplo macy and the sanctions ought to be al lowed  to  at  least  be  given  every  chance.  I  am mildly  optimistic  about  de  Cuellar's visit to Baghdad, and I think  Saddam would much rather cut a deal  with the Secretary General of the Unit ed Nations or the President of France  than he would with us. I think that if  Saddam believes  that he  is going  to  have  to leave Kuwait and all  the 100  Members of this body believe that, he  may be prepared to do it by negotiat ing  something with  somebody  else.  That  is  fine. President Bush,  to his  credit, has said that is fine with him.  But whatever they agree to cannot be a  condition for his withdrawal.  The other  thing, Mr. President,  is  what do we lose by waiting 30, 60, or 90  days? The answer is we not only do not  lose anything, we gain. The reason we  gain  is because everyday that passes  because of the embargo, Saddam's mili tary apparatus is denigrated, one more  tank without a tread, one more person nel  carrier without an  engine,  one  more antidefense site that has been de graded and inoperable and highly so phisticated aircraft unable  to fly for  lack of spare parts. Whereas we still  have 50,000 to 100,000 men on the way to  Saudi Arabia. So we become stronger  in  the next 60  to 90 days and he be comes weaker. We  lose nothing if we  wait.  But to repeat the ultimate argument,  it  is  this: When we  talk about 1  to  20,000 men and women dying, I am talk ing about Americans.  You do not have to search your con science very long among the 100 Sen ators to answer the question would it  be better to  take  that chance, what ever it is, no matter how slight,  to  allow diplomacy or  the sanctions or  both to work and avoid that kind of  bloodshed, or should we just preempt a  strike right now, commence hostilities,  because we know that Saddam is a ty rant. That is not a sufficient justifica tion. There are  tyrants all over  the  world. We have been in bed with a lot  of them.  Everybody knows we would have a  very difficult time maintaining 430,000  men and women in the desert for an other 8 months. I do not know whether  we  could  do  it  or  not.  General  Schwarzkopf said we could but that it  would be infinitely preferable to spend  another summer  in  the sun  than  it  would be to start the killing. That is  our field commander in Saudi Arabia.  Mr. President, there is another side  of me  that worries about what our  vital  interests  are. When  I  spoke  Thursday evening  in this Chamber, I  pointed out I  thought we understood  what our vital interests were in Viet nam and we found out, after 55,000 men  had been killed and 700,000 wounded,  that we had no vital interest in Viet nam.  How many wars have been  fought  throughout history,  and  how many  lives have been lost as a result of a pre mature action, maybe because of some",1991

207,1057,1,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the Hamilton-Gephardt reso lution.  As  I've talked to my constituents over the  last few weeks about what to do in the Per sian Gulf,  I  think a  lot about my boyhood  friend John Waden.  John Waden grew up five doors down the  block from my home  in Malden.  In 1966, he  came back from Vietnam in a body bag. I had  looked up to John Waden, but at his wake I  looked down at his closed casket and won dered why he had died. As I went from adult  to adult,  I searched  for an answer. No one  could explain to me what the war in Vietnam  was all about. I swore then that if I were ever  in any position of power, I would do everything  I could to assure that before any young per sons were asked to lay down his or her life for  our country, we would be able  to explain to  that young person's friends and family the rea sons why.  So far, I haven't heard any explanations that  would satisfy the loved ones of the new gen eration  of  John Wadens who  now  stand  poised to fight in the Persian Gulf. Some say  that Saddam Hussein is a Hitler who must be  stopped; that if we don't use force to drive Iraq  from Kuwait, we will only whet Saddam's ap petite for further aggression, much as Neville  Chamberlain's appeasement at Munich en couraged further Nazi aggression.  As my mother often says, if you don't start  out working smarter, you'll end up working  harder.  If one drop of American blood  is  spilled in the sands of Saudi Arabia this win ter,  it will be because  for  the  last decade  America has not worked smarter. This failure  can be directly traced to four public policy fail ures by the Reagan and Bush administrations  that, taken together, have established the con ditions for U.S. military involvement in the Per sian Gulf crisis.  First, energy policy.  In 1980,  the Reagan Bush campaign called  for  the elimination of  the Department of Energy. To make good on  this campaign promise, President Reagan 8Jr  pointed a dentist named James Edwards as  Secretary of Energy. Edwards testified before  Congress that he  intended to shut down the  Department so he could ""be back  in South  Carolina for hunting or fishing in April or May.""  When questioned on how he could possibly be  serious about such a timetabl~et alone the  49-059  0-95 Vol. 137 <Pt. 1) 34  wisdom of such a move-Edwards joked ""the  fishing is good in June or July as well.""  A ""Gone Fishin'"" sign has hung on the door  of  the  Reagan-Bush  energy  policy  ever  since-automobile  fuel  economy  standards  rolled back, appliance and building efficiency  standards  gutted,  energy  conservation  re search slashed, alternative energy  research  cut. The Department of Energy, which,  in  1980, had earmarked more than two-thirds of  its  total budget  for civilian energy programs  and one-third for nuclear weapons, was by the  end of the decade spending two-thirds of its  funds on nuclear weapons and only one-third  on civilian energy programs. Ten years  later  the United States still has no long-term energy  independence strategy, and U.S. oil  imports  have soared  from 34  to over 50 percent of  total consumption, thereby immersing us ever  deeper in the insanity of Middle Eastern poli tics.  Second,  nuclear proliferation. During  the  1980 campaign Ronald Reagan claimed  that  nuclear proliferation was not ""any of our busi ness."" Once in office the Reagan-Bush admin istration cut back on enforcement of United  States nuclear nonproliferation  laws, allowing  Iraq to obtain access to sensitive technologies  used  in  its nuclear weapons program. More over, the administration sat on the sidelines as  Iraq manipulated oil exports to blackmail Euro pean countries  into supplying  it with nuclear  technology and assistance that it could use to  build the bomb.  Ironically, the Bush adminis tration now warns of Saddam Hussein's nu clear ambitions, but when Israel  launched an  air strike against Iraq's Osirak nuclear power plant  in 1981 , to halt Saddam's drive to ac quire nuclear explosives,  the Reagan-Bush  administration sharply criticized Israel's coura geous action. During the several months fol lowing  the  raid,  the United States actually  worked with  Iraq on various U.N. resolutions  condemning Israel.  Third, chemical weapons. In 1983, Saddam  Hussein  began  using  chemical  weapons  against  Iranian troops and  in 1988, he used  nerve gas against the Kurdish minority in Iraq.  The Reagan-Bush  administration  turned  a  blind eye toward Iraqi use of chemical weap ons and in 1988 it successfully opposed con gressional efforts to impose sanctions against  Iraq for its use of such weapons. During this  same period, America's moral stance against  the use of chemical weapons was undercut by  the Reagan administration's efforts to break a  longstanding U.S. moratorium on production of  lethal nerve gas-including  then Vice Presi dent George Bush's three tie-breaking votes in  the U.S. Senate  in  favor of new chemical  weapons production.  Fourth, the tilt toward Iraq. In 1980, Saddam  Hussein invaded Iran.  Instead of condemning  this  act  of  ""naked  Iraqi  aggression,""  the  Reagan-Bush  administration  tilted  toward  Baghdad, and in 1982,  it removed  Iraq  from  the  list of  terrorist nations-thereby clearing  the way  for providing  Iraq with agricultural  credits. By 1984,  the United States restored  full diplomatic relations with  Iraq and shortly  thereafter  it reportedly began providing Sad dam with covert intelligence support, including  satellite photographs of Iranian military forma tions.  four  It has  to war.  By July 1990, Congress was pressing  to  end the pro-Iraqi tilt of United States foreign  policy, adopting measures that would cut off  agricultural credits to Iraq until it complied with  international agreements on human rights and  weapons  nonproliferation.  In  response,  the  State Department issued a statement oppos ing this legislation, saying that ""measures now  under consideration would not help us achieve  United States goals with Iraq.""  Incredibly, when  Iraq escalated  its war of  words with Kuwait over oil  production  in creases last July and began threatening war,  State Department officials testified before Con gress that the United States was unlikely  to  respond sharply to an Iraqi military action, not ing  that  the United States had ""no defense  treaty relationship with any gulf country"" and  that ""we have historically avoided taking a po sition on border disputes or internal OPEC de liberations."" The State Department also  in structed  the United States Ambassador  to  Baghdad, April Glaspie, to tell Saddam Hus sein  that ""we have no opinion on  the Aratr  Arab conflicts,  like your border disagreement  with Kuwait.""  Given this sorry record, is it any wonder that  we are today facing a Saddam Hussein armed  with chemical weapons and ballistic missiles  and on the verge of acquiring nuclear explo sives within  the next decade? Will we now  compound these previous blunders by plung ing America head  long  into a costly military  confrontation with Iraq?  There  is an alternative  parts.  First,  instead of launching a bloody offen sive war, we should maintain a multinational  military force in Saudi Arabia to contain Sad dam Hussein and deter any further  Iraqi ag gression. A policy of containment and deter rence won  the cold war against  the Soviet  Union;  it can certainly  lead  to a successful  resolution of the gulf crisis. Remarkably, with  the end of  the cold war, both  the United  States and the Soviet Union stand united  in  opposition  to Saddam Hussein's  invasion of  Kuwait, making it possible for the entire world  community to join in demanding an Iraqi with drawal. Now we need  to give  this unprece dented exercise  in  international cooperation  more time to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.  But we must also demand that all partici pants in the coalition arrayed against Iraq bear  their fair share of the burden on containment  and deterrence. Our European and Japanese  allies, who are heavily dependent on imported  gulf oil, should increase their contributions to  the multinational military force  in  the gulf. At  the same time, we should expect greater Arab  support for the joint effort. The Saudis, for ex ample, are realizing a windfall profit of up to  $150 million a day from increases in the price  of oil since the onset of the gulf crisis. They  should be asked  to use all of !heir windfall  profits to help defray the costs of Operation  Desert Shield.  Second, we shoWd give the eoonomic sanc tions  time  to work. Those who argue  that  sanctions alone wHI not  force Saddam  from  Kuwait are mistaken. Iraq invaded Kuwait for  economic reasons, desiring access to Kuwait's  rich oil reserves and wanting to shed the bur den of the huge war debt it owed Kuwait for  financing Saddam's war against Iran.

I believe, with a great deal of reluc tance, that diplomacy is best served by  the threat of imminent military power.  For that reason, I  reluctantly oppose  the  resolution of my colleague,  the  gentleman  from Missouri  [Mr. GEP HARDT].  it  I rise in support of the Solarz-Michel resolu tion and  in opposition  to  the Hamilton-Gep hardt resolution.  I have  listened  to my con stituents,  for as their representative,  is my  role  to do my best to  reflect their concerns.  They are, though, divided in their assessment  of what vote  I should cast in these next few  hours. But I must perform as our Constitution  requires and the ultimate decision on how  I  vote  is mine alone.  I share with all my col leagues the gravity of the charge. It has been  a difficult struggle.  I wonder  if this Nation can actually  insure  we are setting the course for a tyrant's retreat  from tyranny.  I doubt the world's need for oil  is dearer than the blood that will be shed for  it. As the original House sponsor of the U.S.  Institute of Peace, I believe in conflict resolu tion but  I fear each day  is yet another step  away from all peaceful means of ending this  crisis.  I question  the years of confusing and  mistaken administration  foreign policy which  has  led us to this time and place.  I anguish  over the fate of our brave troops. I am haunt ed by words read  long ago, the author since  forgotten,  that said,  ""War would end  if  the  dead could return.""  Yet with all my doubts and all the ramifica tions of those doubts, I choose to vote to give  the President the authority he has requested.  I believe  the chances  for peace, as we ap proach  the U.N. deadline, are  indeed more  likely  if Saddam Hussein believes  this great  country of ours is united.

212,1083,1,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of  the Hamilton-Gephardt  resolution. When  this crisis began, I had hopes that a long-term  policy of diplomatic pressure and economic  sanctions was  likely to succeed.  I still have  those hopes, and  I continue  to support  that  strategy.  After the  invasion of Kuwait on August 2,  President Bush and the international commu nity acted quickly and effectively to halt Iraq's  Army, impose a comprehensive embargo, and  ensure that Iraq got no financial gain from its  capture of Kuwait's oil fields.  We have had some successes.  Iraq's ar mies have been halted. Iraq can no longer buy  weapons abroad. Before  the crisis,  Iraq ex ported about 3 million barrels of oil per day.  The sanctions have cut  that  to zero.  Iraq's  other imports and exports are almost entirely  cut off, and Iraq's GNP has fallen by 40 to 50  percent. That  is an economic blow greater  than any our country has ever suffered. I know  there have been leaks, and I know the risks of  erosion over time, but I still believe the sanc tions need more time to work.  I think the case for continued sanctions re mains  valid. The Desert Shield  force has  blocked  his aggression  and  is  now  large  enough to defeat any attempt he could make  against it. Iraq is blockaded by sea. The inter national  community  has  branded Saddam  Hussein the aggressor, and  is resolute  in  its  determination to stop him and reverse his an' nexation of Kuwait. His neighbors, Syria and  Turkey, have joined the international coalition  and show no  inclination to leave. Egypt,  the  most populous of the Arab nations, shows no  signs of wavering in its support.  If Iraq refuses to leave Kuwait, the policy of  sanctions, containment, and prolonged pres sure will do permanent damage to Iraq's econ omy, make it much more difficult for Saddam  Hussein to sustain his bloated military, and set  a precedent for  future  international coopera tion against aggression by  Iraq or anyone  else.  I believe  that  the policy outlined by  the  Hamilton-Gephardt resolution is a sound strat egy. I know that some say we have made no  progress up to  this point. The  Iraqi Foreign  Minister's performance  in Geneva strength ened  their argument. But  I believe  that  the  most successful resolution we can ask for is  that  Iraq  leaves Kuwait without a shot  fired.  And with that in mind, regardless of what the  Congress does today, I urge the President to  use sanctions as our preferred policy  in  this  crisis.  ",1991
213,1083,1,Mr. MCMILLEN of Maryland.," Mr. Speaker,  now that we have provided  the President of  the United States the authority to use force to  carry out U.S. and U.N. policy in the Persian  Gulf, I believe that all possible avenues must  be pursued. With that in mind,  I have written  President George Bush on this day imploring  him to give diplomacy one last chance to re solve this crisis peacefully. While I support the  Presidential authority to use force in this crisis,  I feel it must be used only as a last resort.  I  would  like  to  include  that  letter in the CON GRESSIONAL RECORD.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:  I  realize that this  letter reaches you on the eve of momentous  events in the world, however, I implore you  to consider it.  As you know,  the Congress of the United  States has now provided you the authority  to use force to carry out American policy in  the Persian Gulf if and when you deem it  necessary. I supported this authority for a  variety of reasons which I outlined during  the debate in the House of Representatives.  But most of all,  I believe  that our Com mander in Chief should have every available  option during this time of tension.  Nevertheless, I believe that all other op tions should be exhausted before this Nation  employs force.  I have discussed  this crisis  with many of my constituents and some of  them are concerned that we are rushing into  a war without using all means necessary to  avoid violent conflict. Therefore, I respect fully request that diplomacy be given one  last attempt to resolve this crisis peacefully.  Even  though  the congressional  resolution  authorizing force requires you to report to  the Congress that all diplomatic efforts have  failed, the American people must be certain  that force is being used only as a last resort.  We must be confident that if American men  and women are being sent into battle, it is  being done because all other means of peace ful resolution have failed.  I believe you now have the flexibility  to  convince the leader of Iraq that the United  States is committed to use force and you can  use this tool in a last effort of diplomacy. I  urge you to seriously consider this option  when weighing the consequences of your de cision.  TOM MCMILLEN.  voting  issues affect the  ",1991
214,1083,1,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  against a declaration of war today.  Supporters of  the President have  raised  three points to which I would like to respond:  the issues of stopping territorial aggression, of  protecting human  rights, and preserving oil  supplies.  How does each of these  United States?  On aggression, the aggression has stopped.  Saddam Hussein has been contained. Yes,  the aggression  is yet to be  reversed. But  it  took us 45 years to do that after World War  II. What is the hurry? What is the rush to war  after just 6 months?  As for human rights, they do not exist in the  Persian Gulf as we know and revere them  in  our country.  I wish they did, but the monar chies of the Middle East have never extended  what we consider basic  rights  to  their  resi dents. War will not change  their moral and  ethical traditions which have evolved over cen turies.  The issue of protecting an oil supply-large ly for Europe and Japan-is too crass a dis regard of human  life  to warrant serious de bate. For those who persist,  it should suffice  to point out that the United States is insolvent.  We are in a deep recession. To increase our  deficit and debt by over $50 billion should turn  the most aggressive warriors away from com bat.  President Bush  is anxious  to go  to war.  Let's  review  the options  foregone. President  Bush has been an ally of Hussein. President  Bush has funded the abuse of human rights in  El Salvador and  refused  to act against  the  murderers of priests, women, and children  in  El Salvador-yet he now  rushes  to express  concern about Kuwait. Upset about territorial  invasions? What about Nicaragua?  I  listened  to serious debate  for almost 3  days. Despite all of the  flag waving, energy  saving, Presidential  loyalty, and saving our  prestige arguments, there was nothing said to  justify  the deaths of  tens of  thousands of  American service men and women-not  to  mention the civilian population that would  in evitably be slaughtered.  As  I  listened,  I could  find no  reason, no  issue, not one scintilla of patriotic calling  to  convince me to vote, on behalf of my constitu ents, to risk the life of one U.S. citizen at this  time.

217,1109,1,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in  support of the Solarz-Michel bipartisan  resolution.  Mr. Speaker, this is a unique time in world  history. For the last 5 months, we have seen  the world stand together and condemn the ag gression of Saddam Hussein and  the  Iraqi  Government. Never before has the world been  so united against such a brutal transgression  of the rights of a sovereign nation.  The  resolutions before us  today  raise  the  question of whether Congress should grant  the President the authority to use force if Sad dam Hussein's forces do not leave Kuwait be fore January 15. I believe that in the effort for  world peace  this Congress must stand with  the President and the world and support the  U.N. Security Council resolution.  In  light of Secretary Baker's disappointing  meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz  in Geneva  this week, when  Iraq  refused  to  participate in any negotiations for an uncondi tional and nonmilitary resolution to this situa tion,  it is more  important than ever that the  United States present a united front with the  rest of the world.  I believe the Solarz-Michel  resolution is the best approach for a peaceful  solution. A vote against this resolution would  most certainly be interpreted by Saddam Hus sein as evidence of division and paralysis in  the world coalition.  By demonstrating our confidence in the U.N.  policies, we will grant the President the trump  card he needs to bring about peace. We can  only negotiate peace from strength. Saddam  Hussein is a dictator and, therefore, only un derstands power. He must know we are seri ous and will take every step necessary to stop  the destruction of an independent country and  the murder of an innocent people.  This Congress must send Saddam Hussein  a clear message that this country will not toler ate naked aggression. We cannot permit Sad dam Hussein to benefit from his brutalities because if he does, he will surely strike again.  Clearly, none of us wants to go to war. We  all pray that this situation is resolved peace fully. However, this vote  today  is not one to  declare war, but to decide which  is the best  path  toward peace.  I believe  this bipartisan  resolution will give the President the power he  needs to force  Iraq out of Kuwait and  is the  best course to prevent bloodshed of our young  men and women stationed in the Persian Gulf.  For these reasons, I support the Michel-So larz resolution.  ",1991

221,1109,1,Mr. SCHAEFER.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in support of the Solarz-Michel resolu tion.  Mr. Speaker, this debate and the following  votes will undoubtedly be the most important  of this Congress. Despite  the gravity of the  issue, the right course of action is clear. The  only reasonable decision Congress can make  is to support the President, and endorse the  Michel-Solarz  resolution.  I do not make  this  decision  lightly with a nephew on  the  front  lines and another  ready  to go. The best  chance for peace, in this the 11th hour, is to  make credible  to Hussein the threat that he  faces the destruction of his army, as well as  his government,  if he  fails  to withdraw  from  Kuwait.  Congress has demanded a say in our policy  toward Iraq. Now we are making that decision  with the whole world looking on. Do we stand  with the President and the world community,  or do we falter, and allow Saddam Hussein to  tighten his grip on Kuwait? There are  those  who want to give sanctions more time. When  this crisis started, we were told that sanctions  would yield results in 6 months.  Now we are told it will take more months or  a year, or 2, while he continues to sneer at  the nearly unanimous condemnation of his ac tions and eventually  lead  to a draft of our  young men and women. Our own CIA Director  informed us that the sanctions have been inef fective.  I find  it hard to believe that Hussein  will succumb to economic pressure when he  now ignores the threat from the nearly half a  million troops massed against him on his bor der.  Our  troops have sat  in  the desert  for 5  months. How much  longer should we keep  them there? We all know of the hardships they  face, as well as the special problems for those  serving  in the National Guard and Reserves.  We have given  Iraq every opportunity to re consider  its  invasion. President Bush  invited  the  Iraqi Foreign Minister to meet with him,  and offered to send Secretary of State Baker  to  talk with Hussein, but  these moves were  rebuffed. Only recently did  Iraq agree to the  meeting between  their Foreign Minister and  Secretary Baker, but Iraq refused to even con sider the demands of an outraged world.  It is  now time to give our President the authority to  act decisively.  We must recognize that the Middle East is  vital to America's interests, and that Hussein's  brutal actions pose a direct threat to them. We  must also understand that America must pro tect  these  interests, even with  force. As a  former marine,  I know what this could entail,  and do not take this position lightly. However,  we cannot allow  international  lawlessness to  go  unpunished,  let  alone  rewarded. With  adoption of the Michel-Solarz resolution,  the  decision between war or peace will solely be  that of Iraq.  It is time to act as one, and provide a united  front to Hussein.

223,1109,1,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr.  Speaker,  be cause I, too, honestly feel that it is the  best chance  for peace,  I will support  the Solarz-Broomfield-Michel biparti san resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in firm support of  the only resolution before us today that holds  any  chance  of  a  peaceful  solution--the  Michel-Solarz resolution.  I would  like nothing more  than  to put my  faith  in continued economic sanctions  in  the  hope that they alone could force Saddam Hus sein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait. How ever,  the  recent events  in Geneva and  the  rhetoric  from Baghdad have convinced me  that this course cannot succeed.  I believe that Saddam still doubts the will of  the  international  force on his borders to use  armed  force  if necessary to  liberate Kuwait,  largely because he doubts the will of those of  us in this Chamber to authorize the President  of the United States to employ United States  troops.  It  is my deepest hope  that passing  the  Michel-Solarz resolution today and giving the  President  that authority, will  finally convince  Saddam that we are, in fact, serious, that we  are willing to stand up for the  inviolability of  recognized borders and  the preservation of  true, lasting peace.  I believe that Saddam understands only the  language of power and strength; that he has  no intention of giving up anything unless he is  forced to do so and that diplomacy and sanc tions mean nothing to this terror-monger and  brutalizer of his own people, let alone those of  other nations.  This authority, that contained in the Michel Solarz  resolution, speaks  the  language  that  Saddam understands. Furthermore, each day  that we wait without sending this message to  Saddam consigns the people of Kuwait to a  living hell of near unimaginable proportions.  In a report of Iraqi human rights violations in  Kuwait released by Amnesty International last  month account after account of beatings, tor ture,  and  rapes  are  documented by eye witnesses. The longer we wait, the less of Ku wait there will be to retrieve and rebuild. No,  we must force Saddam to withdraw now.  Furthermore, it is important to recognize that  this is not the last Congress will hear on this  matter.  Indeed,  the Michel-Solarz  resolution  requires  that before exercising  the authority  granted to him by the resolution, he shall pro vide the Speaker of the House and President  pro  tempore of the Senate a specific deter mination  that all appropriate diplomatic and  other peaceful means to obtain compliance by  Iraq with the U.N. Security Council resolutions  and  that  those means have not been and  would not subsequently been successful.  The  resolution  further stipulates  that  the  President shall submit to Congress a summary  of his efforts in this regard every 60 days.  Mr. Speaker, it is only fair to point out that  the President is not rushing to war. After all,  he has  tried again and again and again  to  meet with Saddam to try to come to a peace ful resolution and he has been ignored. Also,  as we all know, the Iraqi Foreign Minister re fused even to accept President Bush's letter in  a last minute attempt for a peaceful solution.  The President will do all  that he can  to  achieve our goals peacefully; that is plain. It is  not our President who  is rushing to war, but  Saddam Hussein.  ",1991
224,1135,1,Mr. DEFAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in strong  opposition to the Solarz-Michel resolution. By  this act,  the United States will become  the  only member of the anti-Iraq coalition willing to  make a declaration of war.  I deeply fear that  we also will be the only member of that coali tion willing to sacrifice its economic well-being  and the lives of thousands of its young people.  Time draws short, and a terrible dark night  approaches. Yet it is not too late, if only be cause  it must not be. This war will only be  stopped by those who refuse to allow it.  It is not to late. It must not be.  Today is an unspeakably tragic day. For the  sake of our Nation and the stability of the Mid dle East, I hope and pray that President Bush  will have the wisdom to use restraint and allow  sanctions time to do the job.  ",1991
225,1135,1,Mr. RIGGS.," Mr. Speaker, as a new Con gressman, I can't pretend to be an expert on  foreign policy.  I am a citizen-legislator deeply  concerned about matters of war and peace,  who has been given the grave responsibility to  act on behalf of my constituents, and in some  small way,  the people of America.  I cannot  shirk  this  responsibility or my conscience  in  these matters of war and peace and of life  and death.  President Bush  is  to be commended  for  stopping Saddam Hussein's ruthless advance  in its tracks. He has quickly deployed United  States forces and succeeded in protecting the  borders of Saudi Arabia. He has rallied the na tions of  the world-including  fractious Arab  States and  former enemies-to oppose ag gression and  to  implement an  international  embargo against Iraq. He has breathed new  life into a moribund United Nations, rekindling  the hope of a world of peaceful  international  order.  The President has set  four United States  goals  in Kuwait which have been repeatedly  stated  in U.N.  resolutions.  I stand with  the  President foursquare behind these goals, but I  must differ on how  they are  implemented.  I  strongly believe that aggressive action by the  United States at this time would not only result  in the potential loss of thousands of American  and civilian  lives,  it would undermine one of  the Presidenfs and the U.S.'s principal goals:  the creation of long-term stability in the Middle  East.  Our own military  is unable or unwilling to  give us a worst case scenario of casualties,  military and civilian. Five former Chiefs of Staff  have warned against the dangers of a pre mature attack. Conservative opinion makers  like Patrick Buchanan, George Will, and Paul  Nitze have urged restraint. Why? A massive  conflict in the Arab world could result in an ex plosion of factionalism, terrorism, and perhaps  even an angry backlash of Islamic fundamen talism.  The  prudent  alternative  is  to  stay  the  present course. We have cut off Iraq's sale of  oil, resulting in a 50 percent cut of that coun try's GNP.  Intelligence  reports say  that  the  international embargo has  interdicted more  than 90 percent of Iraq's imports and exports.  I am deeply concerned about the continuing  threat of Saddam Hussein even if he is evict ed from Kuwait. But I must respectfully submit  that the administration has not convinced me  that  the  immediate  threat of  this despot  to  U.S. security overrides the compelling reasons  for caution  in this  incendiary situation.  Iraq's  economy  is  limping backward  into scarcity.  Hussein's military machine daily deconstructs  because of  the unavailability of spare parts.  His development of nuclear capability  is ren dered  impossible because of  the embargo.  The sanctions are tightening a noose around  Hussein. They should be given more time.  Diplomatic efforts have not been exhausted.  It may be possible that the United States and  Iraq cannot negotiate, but there are third par ties more  than willing  to make an effort  for  peace. The United Nations and especially the  Arab countries should be given  the  time  to  seek a peace  that ensures  the  liberation of  Kuwait and sets the stage for further conflict  resolutions in the region.  War now also ensures a tremendous finan cial burden on Americans. Even if we just hold  the line in Saudi Arabia, we will have to main tain an expensive military presence sufficient  to deter any further acts of aggression.  If we  go to war now those costs accelerate tremen dously, and  if we clobber Hussein, we will  have to pay for the unwelcome task of occu pying  Iraq until a stable nonbellicose govern ment can be established  there. Dollars pale  when compared to sanctity of life, but here we  are talking about an action that can result in  both the unnecessary emptying of our Treas ury and the loss of life.  On one hand, we have a international em bargo and a naval blockade that we know is  working. On the other, military force promises  a dice roll in the region, where even the best  case promises immediate casualties and long term instability in the region.  Make no mistake, Saddam Hussein did not  invade Kuwait to free Palestine. There should  be no linkage on these questions, and if there  is justice in this world Hussein will have to pay  for his brutality.  But we must have a wider vision of the fu ture. We  have come  to  the brink of war  against a strongman whose power is derived  from the anti-Western sentiment in the region.  President Bush has worked a miracle in align ing former enemies against this despot. Now,  if we are able to reach a peaceful solution to  this problem,  the stage has been set  for a  multilateral  conference  on  the  issues  that  threaten peace and stability in the region.  We need also to look toward a future not  dependent on  fossil  fuels. Oil dependence is  both a political and environmental liability. The  message is clear: We must begin to work for  energy independence and to develop sustain able energy resources.  This is a difficult time for me.  I understand  the strong feelings on both sides of this ques tion, and I'm especially cognizant of the need  to support our brave young men and women  in  the Saudi desert and  the Persian Gulf.  If  war does break out, we must stand strongly  behind  them. But now even  in  this darkest  hour, we must continue to search for a peace ful solution.  I have had  to  throw the normal course of  politics to the wind in my search for truth and  the correct course of action. In the end, I have  not been convinced that diplomacy has been  exhausted or that sanctions won't work. I can  only conclude that if I must err, it must be on  the side of caution.  ",1991
226,1135,1,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. Speaker,  this  is  the most  important and difficult vote  I have cast in my  congressional  career. The  vote before  the  House today is whether we will authorize the  President to go to war against Iraq or continue  to support  international economic sanctions  and exhaust all available peaceful options in  resolving the Persian Gulf conflict.  I rise in opposition to the resolution offered  by Representatives STEPHEN SOLARZ and BOB  MICHEL which would authorize the use of Unit ed States military force against Iraq. I cannot  give the green light to the President to go to  war.  Instead,  I am casting my vote for inter national sanctions  in order to prolong peace  and  for continued diplomacy.  I join my col leagues in voicing my strong support for the  Hamilton-Gephardt concurrent resolution.  Hundreds of my constituents and concerned  Americans from around the country have con tacted my office to express their reservations  regarding our vote today and their objections  toward taking  the path toward war. Many of  them have sons, daughters, or  family mem bers  in  the Persian Gulf serving on board  ships or  in Saudi Arabia. They are patriotic  Americans who  love  their country and are  working hard to provide a decent life for their  families.  I have heard from veterans who served in  Vietnam,  the Korean War and World War  II.  Others were students  in  the 1960's and  re member how deeply our country was divided  during that period. They come from all walks  of  life. Yet,  the agony of  their message  is  clear. Our  country  should  not go  to war  against Iraq.  Mr. Speaker, I am torn by the heartfelt mes sages of my constituents,  the global  role of  our country as a world  leader, and the stark  brutality of  Iraq President Saddam Hussein  with his weapons of mass destruction. Presi dent Hussein  imposes a clear and present  danger to the Middle East and world peace as  long as he occupies Kuwait. You can be as sured that I am firmly committed to reversing  Iraq's brutal and illegal occupation of Kuwait.  However, war is a grave and serious under taking and  inevitably, American  lives will be  lost and an untold number of our service men  and women will return wounded. Yes, the vote  today is a troubling one. But I believe we must  stay the course for a little while longer.  At this time the wisest course of action to  follow  is  to continue with  international sanc tions and diplomatic efforts to pressure Iraq to  leave Kuwait. We must be patient and give  sanctions every opportunity to work, while at  the same time maintaining our military option.  After all, sanctions are working.  Sanctions have completely shut off the flow  of Iraqi oil to the world market and have de nied  Iraq  the huge oil  revenue  that has  nanced  its development.  Iraq's GNP has alfi ",1991
227,1148,1,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, I believe  most of us unders'tood how former Secretary  of State Shultz  felt when he  lamented  that  nothing is ever really over in this town. Con sequently, when something really is over, and  it  represents a genuine success  for United  States foreign policy, we should stop and take  note.  The State Department  led an exceptional  U.S. Government effort under Mr. Shultz's  leadership to end a classic political and bu reaucratic struggle  that had outlasted every  Secretary of State for the past two decades.  That effort has been continued by, and now  has yielded success for, Secretary Baker and  the Bush administration.  I am referring to the  action of the U.N. Security Council on Decem ber 22, 1990, recognizing that the 1947 U.S.  administered  trusteeship ended  for  the peo ples of the Marshall  Islands, Micronesia and  the Northern Mariana Islands on the basis of  events which occurred in 1986.  On November 3, 1986, President Reagan  signed Proclamation 5564, declaring that the  United States had fulfilled its obligations under  the 1947  trusteeship  for  the Pacific  islands,  and that the trusteeship agreement no longer  applied to the islands. This action brought into  full effect political status agreements which the  Reagan administration,  represented by Am bassador Fred M. Zeder  II, had concluded  with  the democratically established constitu tional governments of Micronesia and the Mar shall  Islands. The agreement with  the North ern Mariana  Islands was negotiated by Am bassador F. Haydn Williams on behalf of the  Ford administration. Congress approved these  agreements  in  two comprehensive pieces of  legislation, Public Law 94-241 and Public Law  99-239.  These agreements, and the constitutions of  the island governments, were approved by the  peoples concerned  in U.N. observed plebi scites,  and  the U.N.  Trusteeship Council  adopted resolutions-most notably Resolution  2183 of May 28, 1986-confirming that the is landers had freely expressed their wishes re garding self-government in valid acts of self determination. U.N.T.C. Resolution 2183 spe cifically stated that the United States had sat isfactorily discharged its obligations under the  trusteeship.  Under its Covenant of Political Union with  the United States,  the Mariana  Islands  just  north of Guam became the Commonwealth of  the Northern Mariana  Islands  [CNMI] under  the sovereignty of the United States. The Cov enant extends United States citizenship to the  people of the CNMI and partially applies the  U.S. Constitution while bringing the islands of  that chain into the U.S. for most legal and po litical purposes.  Under the unprecedented Compact of Free  Association, the Federated States of Microne sia [FSM] and the Republic of the Marshall Is lands [RMI] became sovereign, self-governing  nations with separate and distinct citizenship.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The RMI and FSM have full  internal self-gov ernment and conduct their own foreign affairs  and treaty relations. This includes control of all  land and ocean resources in accordance with  the international law of nations.  Under the Compact the U.S. retains author ity and responsibility to provide for defense of  the islands, a commitment which other micro states may come to envy as they pursue eco nomic prosperity and political stability  in  the  post-1989 world order which is now evolving.  The Compact of Free Association can be ter minated by the islanders in favor of independ ence at any time, or in favor of another status  involving  the U.S.  if mutually agreed. Thus,  the duration of free association may be indefi nite, although the current Compact has a term  of 15 years, or it may result in transition to an other form of self-government, depending on  the wishes of the people concerned. This is a  very creative arrangement, and other major  powers . may want to model relations with au tonomous areas after  the U.S. approach  to  free association.  The RMI and FSM already exchange am bassadors with Washington, as well as with  the numerous other nations which recognized  that self-determination, not the timing of Secu rity Council action, was  the controlling  legal  and political criteria under Article 76 of  the  U.N. Charter  for achieving self-government.  The Security Council's action on December 22  eliminates any pretext for impeding further the  universal acceptance of the new status of the  RMI and FSM, as well as the CNMI.  The language of Security Council Resolution  683 of December 22, 1990, is significant be cause  it states  that  the applicability of  the  trusteeship has  terminated based upon entry  into force of the status agreements in 1986. In  other words,  it constitutes a determination by  the Security Council  that  the process which  took place in 1986 had the effect of satisfying  the objectives of the trusteeship with respect  to  the peoples concerned. This confirms  the  position taken by the U.S.  in numerous  law suits and policy debates on  the question of  trusteeship termination.  It is also important to note what the resolu tion does not say. For example,  it does not  state in the present tense that the trusteeship  is ""hereby"" terminated, or anything to that ef fect. This  is noteworthy because during  the  process  for approval and  implementation of  the Compact there were those who asserted  categorically that the.U.S. could not implement  the  agreements  until  the Security Council  adopted a resolution approving U.S. actions  and  expressly  terminating  the  trusteeship.  While those who write law review articles and  editorials critical of U.S. policy in the trust terri tory found that view irresistible, the U.S. quite  properly insisted that interpretation and imple mentation of the U.N. Charter provisions relat ing  to  termination were matters to be deter mined through political,  legal and moral per suasion between the member states. That is  what diplomacy and the U.N. are supposed to  be all about.  The  theory that the United States and the  governments of the trust territory could not im plement the forms of self-government chosen  by  the people without  first  jumping  through  hoops in the Security Council to get a resolu tion would have given any permanent member  January 12, 1991  of the Security Council the ability, by veto, to  prevent  the U.S. and  the people concerned  from bringing an end  to  the anachronistic  trusteeship  regime even  though  the people  had spoken. In essence, it would have made  realization of self-determination by the  island  peoples an entirely discretionary matter in the  hands of any member of the Security Council  with the veto under Article 27 of the Charter.  Since  the  islanders,  unlike  the  concerned  member states of the U.N., never consented  to be subject to the trusteeship, the notion of  self-government being held hostage  to U.N.  formalities was perceived in the islands as a  form of ""international colonialism"" being  im posed by the United Nations.  In this case,  it  could have  led  to abuse of the  trusteeship  system  to  frustrate  rather  than  facilitate  the  form of self-government chosen by the people.  The proposition that a permanent member  of the Security Council could veto implementa tion of acts of self-determination recognized by  the Trusteeship Council and the  international  community as valid and consistent with  the  U.N. Charter simply was not acceptable to the  United States. Indeed, in 1947, when he took  the floor  in  the House of Representatives to  argue  in support of President Truman's pro posed bill approving  the  trusteeship agree ment, Representative Mike Mansfield  from  Montana explained to his colleagues that the  very  reason  the Pacific  islands  trusteeship  was being designated as ""strategic"" under Ar ticle 82 of the U.N. Charter was to prevent the  U.N. from having a veto over U.S. actions. In  fact, Mansfield cited the U.S. veto power as  assurance  that  the U.S. could prevent  the  U.N.  from,  in his words, ""* * * asserting ef fective control  * * *"" over administration of  the  islands.  It was Mansfield's view that the  onus of contending with the Security Council  veto  threat would be on any member state  which might seek to prevent the U.S. from im plementing a particular course of action or pol icy with respect to the trust territory. A mem ber country opposed to U.S. activities would  have to raise the issue in the Security Council  and propose a resolution of disapproval.  Mansfield's analysis, while never popular at  U.N.  cocktail parties, was  prophetic.  Forty  years of intervening U.N. practice may make  his views unfashionable today, but until very  recently it was a virtual certainty that the So viet Union would have vetoed a resolution ap proving termination of the trusteeship regard less of the merit of the U.S. position. As to the  U.N.  itself, only  in  the  last decade has  the  U.N. bureaucracy realized that it was making  itself irrelevant by providing nothing more than  a forum  for propaganda and verbal violence  against the United States. In recent years the  members of  including  the Soviet  Union, began to recognize that the U.N. never  could  realize  its potential  to promote peace  and prosperity in the world if it did not begin  to address itself to the substance as well as  politics on its agenda. It was only very recently  that it became possible for the issue of trust eeship termination to be taken up in a rational  and fair environment within the Security Coun cil.

228,1161,1,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House,  the gen tleman from Maryland [Mr. HOYER]  is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1991
229,1161,1,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  follow  the  gentleman  from  Ohio  [Mr.  MCEWEN]. The message  today will be  that the Congress on both sides of the  aisle speak with one voice. We articu late, I believe, the united voice of the  American public.  The previous speaker, the gentleman  from Ohio [Mr. MCEWEN] gave us a re view of history. That is critical. It is  critical  that we  remember what has  happened in the past so that we are not  condemned to relive it.  The  gentleman  from  Ohio  [Mr.  MCEWEN] mentioned a number of dates:  August  23,  1939,  Stalin  and Hitler  signed a  nonaggression pact. As Mr.  McEWEN indicated, 1 month later there  were  secret  protocols  which  were  signed to that pact giving Stalin a free  hand in the Baltic States, independent,  free peoples. Two dictators,  two mur derers, sat down at the table and di vided up what they thought would be  the spoils of war.  I will not repeat a number of other  dates that went between, but on De cember 23, 1989, just a little over a year  ago in the Soviet Union, newly emerg ing as a people that could discuss his tory with  truth, a  radical shift from  the prior 50 years in the Soviet Union.  On December 23,  1989,  based on  the  Yakovlev committee's report,  the So viet Congress of People's Deputies, by a  vote of 1,432  to 252, adopted a  resolu tion condemning  the secret protocols  as, and I quote from the Soviet proto cols, ""legally untenable and invalid.""  What conclusion could we draw from  that? It was  that  the absorption of  Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia was le gally untenable  in  the words of the  Yakovlev committee's report as over whelmingly supported and voted on by  the Congress of the People's Deputies.  We went through, Mr. Speaker, a se rious, somber difficult and, yes, for the  Members  of  this Congress  and  this  country, a gut-wrenching debate.  D 1300  And what was that debate about just  24 hours ago? It was, in the final analy sis, about  the defense of freedom.  It  was, in the final analysis, about inter national law. It was, in the final analy sis, as to whether people were going to  be able to live free in the New World  Order or live as they had so often in  the past, under the heel of the dictator,  the heel of the military dictator.  Mr. Speaker, I  rise as chairman of  the Commission on Security and Co operation in Europe, the Helsinki Com mission. In August 1975, Mr. Brezhnev  and Mr. Ford and the leaders of 33 of  the nations set their hands and seals to  documents  that said we will  resolve  differences in peaceful fashions.  That was, of course, subsequent  to  Hungary. That was subsequent to the  Prague uprising. It was in affirmation  of the U.N. Charter, which said that we  will not by force of arms change the  will of the people, change borders, or  subject smaller nations to autocratic,  illegal, avaricious  invasion by  larger  and more militarily mighty neighbors.  That has happened, of course, in Ku wait and, as has been pointed out so  dramatically,  is happening in Lithua nia. The tanks, the symbol in today's  world of  the ability  to  invade, were  there. The picture on the front page of  the Washington Post shows a human  being, a Lithuanian, who speaks out  only  for  freedom and  for  the  rights  that that citizen ought to enjoy under  the Helsinki final act, under the United  Nations  Charter,  and  under  that  Yakovlev Committee finding that the  taking of Lithuania was legally unten able, Mr. Gorbachev. It was legally un tenable. Your Congress of People's Dep uties, 1,400  to 200, said it was legally  untenable. You should not be  there.  You should withdraw. You say you did  not know. Legally untenable.  Mr. President, the Wall Street Jour nal on Friday,  just 4 days ago, said  this. I quote from the Wall Street Jour nal  of  January  11,  1991:  ""Mr.  Gorbachev's statement urged  the  re public's government""-speaking of the  freely elected government of Lithua nia-""to abide by the Soviet constitu tion."" Legally untenably imposed upon  the free people of Lithuania. That is  what Yakovlev and his committee said.  That is what 1,400 members of the Con gress of People's Deputies  said, not  Steny Hoyer, not the President of the  United States, not this Congress, but  the elected leaders of the Soviet Union  said, ""legally untenable.""  Mr. Gorbachev said that nevertheless  they should abide by the Soviet con stitution-and  listen  to  this-""and  hinted that he was under pressure  to  introduce direct presidential  rule  in  Lithuania. In a throwback to the rhet oric of the past, he accused Lithuania's  leaders of 'hiding behind the mask of  democracy and seeking to implement a  policy, the goal of which is to reestab lish a bourgeois regime and order.'""  I ask, my friends, could Joseph Sta lin have said it any more chillingly or  directly than that? Not only were the  actions of 1939  legally untenable, but  the actions of 1991 are legally unten able.  Mr. Gorbachev, withdraw your troops  from Lithuania, from Latvia, and from  ",1991

An article by Dr. John Cox, a British  chemical engineer, suggests  that sig nificant  climatic  changes  could  be  caused should Saddam Hussein success fully  ignite Kuwaiti oil wells during  the course of a gulf war.  According  to Dr. Cox,  the environ mental risks include regional climatic  changes affecting some 1 billion people  within 1,000 miles of Kuwait;  the cre ation of an equatorial ozone hole in the  stratosphere; the development of acid  rain from the sulpher and nitrogen con tained in the burned Kuwaiti crude oil,  reducing crops  in affected areas sur rounding  the  gulf;  and  significant  human casualties as a  result of crop  failures,  ultraviolet  radiation  and  other climatic changes caused by the  possible burning of some 3 million bar rels of Kuwaiti oil a day.

235,1252,1,Mr. DODD.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today  to  introduce S. 5,  the Family  Medical Lea.ve Act of 1991. I am pleased  to be joined in this effort by the distin guished  majority  leader,  Senator  MITCHELL; Senator KENNEDY, the chair man of  the Labor  and Human Re sources  Committee;  Senator  PACK WOOD; and more than 30 other cospon sors.

Mr. President, as we look back at the  accomplishments of the lOlst Congress,  I think few would argue that 1990 was  the most successful year for America's  working families in over a quarter of a  century.  The  passage  of  the  com prehensive child care legislation, which  I might add not only did we pass the  authorizing  legislation but an appro priation of a significant amount of dol lars in pressing times was also adopted,  and I might point out that was done so  with  the  tremendous support of  the  presiding President pro tempore of the  Senate, and I thank him personally for  that once again, we were able to pass  that legislation and put some decent  dollars in that program, a major exten sion of Head Start, and other human  service programs, generous changes in  Medicare eligibility criteria are just a  few of the many accomplishments that  we in this Congress in the lOlst made  on behalf of American families.  Unfortunately, one critical piece of  legislation, the Family Medical Leave  Act, never became law last year.

The  legislation  that we  are  introducing  today is virtually identical to the leg islation which passed both Houses by  wide bipartisan majorities in the pre vious Congress.  I believe that the American family,  the children of this Nation, certainly  have cause  for optimism in  the 102d  Congress.

236,1317,1,Mr.  BIDEN.," Mr. President,  today I  am  introducing  the Drug Emergency  Areas Act of 1991 to fight the spiraling  problems of drug trafficking and vio lent crime in our Nation's cities and  comm uni ties.  The drug and violent crime epidemics  are taking their toll on U.S. cities un like any natural disaster  in modern  history. Each year,  thousands die  in  drug-related  violence  and  overdoses.  Tens of billions of dollars are lost in  health costs and lowered productivity.  The  drug  crisis  has-literally-de stroyed neighborhoods in every major  city in this country.  Congress and  the President  recog nized  the need  to provide emergency  Federal aid to the hardest hit cities as  far back as 1988, when the Anti-Drug  Abuse Act was enacted. This law di rected the President to designate cer tain areas of the country as ""high in tensity drug trafficking areas"" and to  provide immediate Federal aid to these  areas. And to ensure that emergency  aid was provided  immediately, Con gress appropriated $25 million in Octo ber 1989 for the areas to be designated  by the President.  Unfortunately,  the White House re sponse has been plagued by bureau cratic delays and inefficiency.  More than 2 years after the high-in tensi ty drug  trafficking area  legislaMr.  tion was signed into law, not a single  Federal dollar-not a single extra po lice officer or treatment bed-had been  delivered to these hard-hit areas.  That's why 16 of my colleagues and I  are  introducing  the Drug Emergency  Areas Act of 1991 as an alternative to  the President's plan. Our legislation is  simple and direct. It would:  Provide $300 million-six  times  the  amount  in  the President's antidrug  plan-in emergency Federal assistance  to those areas of the Nation hardest hit  by drug trafficking, abuse and related  violence;  Direct that emergency Federal aid be  available not only for big cities, but  also to rural and suburban areas, where  the drug crisis has overwhelmed  the  ability of State and local law enforce ment agencies to respond; and  Allow funding for both law enforce ment and prevention and  treatment  initiatives-to attack the problem at  every possible level.  President,  there  is  one  addi tional-and perhaps the most critical difference between this new initiative  and the President's plan.  My bill offers direct Federal assist ance to the cities and counties where  the drug problem hits the hardest, and  where emergency assistance is needed  the most. Federal assistance  to drug  emergency areas should be delivered  the same way we help areas affected by  natural emergencies-directly  to  the  local officials who know what needs  doing, and how best to do it.  This bill is identical to legislation I  introduced last year, S. 2313, which was  endorsed by  the  former President of  the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Richard  Berkley, and the mayor of New York  City, David Dinkins. The bill  is also  strongly  supported by  the National  League  of Ci ties  and  the Delaware  League of Local Governments.  Mr. President, drug trafficking and  abuse in our cities is a national emer gency. We need an emergency response.  I believe  the Drug Emergency Areas  Act is a major step in the right direc tion.  I ask unanimous consent  that  the  bill, an explanatory factsheet, and a  chart comparing this legislation with  the President's plan be printed in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at this time.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as fallows:  s. 16  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

237,1343,1,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing in the 102d Congress a  bill that the Senate should have adopt ed in the lOlst Session, the Interstate  Greyhound Racing Act of 1991. This  legislation, when enacted, will regulate  interstate commerce with respect  to  interstate  parimutuel  wagering  on  greyhound racing. I say that we should  have passed this bill, Mr. President, be cause it provides for greyhound owners  the same protective system that has  proven so successful for owners of rac ing horses. The dog racing industry is  one of increasing interest and impor tance; this bill ensures fairness for dog  owners, and it thereby ensures orderly  growth and stability for the industry.  Eleven years  ago nearly  identical  legislation,  the Interstate Horse Rac ing Act of 1978, was considered by the  U.S. Senate and passed by voice vote. I  hasten to add that the House of Rep resentatives also passed the Interstate  Horse Racing Act of 1978 by voice vote.  The major difference between my bill  and that passed in 1978  is that I am  asking today that we extend to grey hound  owners  the  same  protection  given to horsemen in 1978.  Mr. President, my bill does not re quire that we spend Federal money. It  does not create a new agency of gov ernment, and it does not legalize off track betting. The States legalize off track betting.  This legislation does provide that an  interstate wager on a greyhound race  ",1991
238,1408,1,Mr.  DECONCINI.,"  Mr.  President,  today I  join with my colleague from  Arizona, Senator McCAIN,  in reintro ducing  legislation  to redesignate  the  Salt-Gila Aqueduct of the central Ari zona project  [CAP]  as  the Fannin McFarland Aqueduct. We are introduc ing this bill to recognize the outstand ing achievements of  these statesmen  and their heroic efforts  to get Arizo na's  lifeline,  the  central  Arizona  project, on line.  For my colleagues  in  the Chamber  who are not familiar with the central  Arizona project, I would like to take a  few minutes to explain the purpose and  importance of the project. The central  Arizona project was authorized by Con gress in 1968 to bring our State's Colo rado River allocation to the rural and  metropolitan communities of central  and southern Arizona. The water sup ply in this desert region of the South west consists almost entirely of ground  water. Because of growth and develop ment  in  this area,  the overdraft of  ground water  is nearing  a  critical  stage. The CAP will enable Arizona to  put  its allotment of Colorado River  water  to beneficial use while at  the  same time reducing the overdrafting of  our precious ground water  supplies.  The CAP is, in my opinion,  the most  important Federal project in Arizona.  In 1988, Congress  redesignated  the  first stretch of the project, the Granite  Reef Aqueduct, as the Hayden-Rhodes  Waterway. This was a fitting tribute to  two men who served their State so ably  in their respective congressional bod ies. The legislation we are introducing  today renames the next stretch of the  project after Ernest W. McFarland and  Paul Fannin,  two  of Arizona's out standing leaders who played a key role  in the realization of this dream.  Paul Fannin served as Governor of  Arizona from 1958  to 1964.  In 1964 he  was elected  to  the U.S. Senate and  served in this body until 1976. As Gov ernor of Arizona, Paul Fannin directed  State water agencies and was instru mental in shaping Arizona's water pol icy. He called for an information and  education campaign on the CAP to help  Arizonans realize the great importance  of the project  to  the State's future.  While in the U.S. Senate, he cospon sored and aggressively pressed for the  adoption of the legislation that finally  authorized the CAP.  Ernest McFarland also had a distin guished career in public service, serv ing Arizona as both a Governor and  Senator. He served in the Senate from  1941 to 1952. From 1951 to 1952 he served  as the majority leader of this body. In  1947,  Senator McFarland  introduced  the first bill calling for the authoriza tion of the CAP. While in the Senate,  he was known as the Chief Strategist  for  the CAP.  In 1954, he was success fully elected as Governor and served in  that position for one  term where he  continued his diligent efforts on behalf  of the CAP.  It is only appropriate that we in Ari zona honor these men and their great  contributions not only  to our State,  but to the Nation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the bill be printed  in  the RECORD,  and  I  urge my  col leagues on the Senate Energy and Nat ural Resources Committee  to  take  timely action on this legislation.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 54  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled, That (a) the Salt-Gila aq ueduct of the Central Arizona project, con structed, operated,  and maintained under  section 301(a)(7) of the Colorado River Basin  Project Act (43 U.S.C. 1521(a)(7)), hereafter  shall  be  known  and  designated  as  the  ""Fannin-McFarland Aqueduct"".

239,1421,1,Mr. MOYNIBAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce with Senator DAN FORTH  the Homeless Mentally Ill Out reach Act of 1991.  It has been  just over 25 years now  since President Kennedy  signed  the  Mental  Retardation  Facilities  and  Community Health Centers Construc tion Act of 1963, a legislative effort to  close  those massive institutional for tresses  that had  come  to house  so  many  victims  of mental  disorders.  Prior to that, caring for the mentally  ill had been, for well over 100 years, a  responsibility of the Government. In deed, patients were  the wards of the  State. Then began our efforts in the  1950's and early 1960's to change that  situation. It would not be an overstate ment  to  say  that  these  efforts got  started in New York.  There is something of a history here.  In 1953, Dr. Nathan S. Kline, working  at Rockland State Hospital, set out to  isolate  the active  ingredient  in ser pent-wood-Rauwolfia  serpentina-a  root used from antiquity in Vedic med icine to calm people. When Dr. Kline  was done, he had the chemical reser pine, one of the first tranquilizers. He  published his findings in 1954.  That was the year W. Averell Har riman was elected Governor. It was a  time when mental illness was seen as  perhaps the most pressing problem New  York State faced-bond issue followed  bond issue to build institution after in stitution. On taking office, with much  encouragement for his secretary, Jona than B. Bingham, and Paul H. Hoch,  Commisssioner  of Mental  Hygiene,  Harriman began to consider the impli cations of Dr. Kline's discovery.  As Jonathan Bingham's assistant, I  was present at the meeting in the Gov ernor's office in the spring of 1955 when  it was decided to provide the tranquil izer when appropriate  to all patients  systemwide. It was a $1.5 million bet.  Almost  immediately the population  of State mental institutions began to  decline. It peaked in Harriman's first  year at 93,314. In 1988, it was down to  18,699. A few weeks after the meeting in  the Governor's office in Albany, a law  was enacted in Washington setting up a  joint Commission on Mental  Illness  and Health. The Commission's report  was finished in 1960,  the year John F.  Kennedy was elected President. The  Commission  proposed  that  tranquil izers be used nationwide and that new  community based mental health care  arrangements be made for patients who  responded. In time, we had a name for  this new  institution,  the Community  Mental Health Center. President Ken nedy set up a  task force to propose a  program to establish community based  systems of mental health care delivery.  As an Assistant Secretary of Labor,  with a New York background, I was a  working member of that task force and  did much of the drafting of our report  to the President, who  thereupon pro posed legislation. The task force report  outlined a Federal program to facili tate improvement and progress in the  treatment of the mentally ill. Our ob ject was the elimination of the State  mental hospital in the course of a gen eration. Community based services to  the mentally ill was the model for ap propriately and  successfully  treating  the large incidence of illness in soci ety.  As of 1980,  the population of State  hospitals and residential care facilities  nationwide was  down  to  255,000  pa tients. Many of these individuals will  continue  to be deinstitutionalized or  will be in and out of the hospital. Some  will become homeless without followup  care.  The  problems  of  deinstitu tionalization  and  ""noninstitutionalization''-persons  in  need of psychiatric services but never  institutionalized-persist and the will  to accomplish at a minimum the goals  of the 1963 Community Mental Health  Act  legislation appears  lacking. Pa tients ready to be integrated back into  the  community  as  well  as  those  nonpatients  in need of care have no  place to go.  The  legislation we are  introducing  today will provide immediate help to  the estimated 25  to 40 percent of the  homeless population that is mentally  ill. It will ensure that States identify,  evaluate, and develop a plan of care for  the mentally ill homeless population.  Mobile outreach activities will be un dertaken in metropolitan areas to the  homeless mentally ill as a condition of  participation in the Medicaid Program.  Outreach  teams composed of mental  heal th professionals  and others will  identify mentally ill persons in need of  medical treatment, and provide trans portation  to assessment/referral cen ters. The assessment/referral  centers  will  provide  emergency  psychiatric  intervention, psychiatric evaluations,  medical  treatment  necessary  to  achieve stabilization, temporary room  and board, assistance  in applying for  entitlement programs,  referral  serv ices, an individualized treatment plan  and  case management. A National  Commission for the Homeless Mentally  Ill will also be established to study the  availability, accessibility and composi tion of mental health services for this  population. The Commission will spe cifically review the implementation of  the Community Mental Health Center  Act of 1963, Public Law 88-164, examin ing the need  to complete  the  imple mentation of that law. Based on these  findings,  recommendations  will  be  made to Congress for  the overall im provement of services to this targeted  population.  This bill is not a perfect one. But no  one piece of legislation can be reason ably expected to correct problems that  have been made more than 30 years in  the making. There are difficulties with  treating the mentally ill homeless pop ulation. We attempt here  to address  the most pressing ones. What, for in stance, should we do about those peo ple who,  though  they need our help,  refuse it? In our bill, we defer to State  laws on involuntary commitment. This  may be the best answer.  We as a society can no longer toler ate having our homeless mentally ill  who live among us remain out of the  reach of our services and care. We can  provide better for them, and we must.  So  let  us, with  this modest  step,  begin.    ",1991
240,1421,1,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President, it is  often said that a nation is judged by  the way it treats the frail and vulner able members of its society.  Most homeless mentally ill are un fortunately not  treated at all. They  have been granted the right to live a  tortured life on the streets, in shelters,  and  in prisons. Tonight, more  than  2,000 mentally ill persons will sleep on  the streets or in the shelters of Wash ington, DC. A 1986 study by  the Na tional Institute of Mental Health found  that 56 . percent of  the  shelter and  street population in St. Louis is men tally ill. Other studies have found that  from 25 percent to 40 percent of home less people are mentally ill.  It is  tragic  that it has become so  commonplace  to see  these vulnerable  people Ii terally lying in the streets, ig nored and neglected. Every morning on  my way  to work,  I pass women and  men sleeping on grates, on benches, on  cardboard boxes, wrapped in layers and  layers of old clothes, muttering and  gesturing to themselves. They have be come  a  permanent  feature.  I  have  asked myself about each person: Who is  she? What happened  to him? Who  is  taking care of this person? Why doesn't  somebody do something?  Mr. President,  I want  to do some thing. The past 30 years have seen rag ing debates between lawyers, psychia trists, and other mental health profes sionals, families, and others as to what  should be done  for  the mentally  ill.  Some argue that we need more commu nity mental health centers, others say  we  need  to  build more  small  psy chiatric  hospitals,  others  argue  for  changing State civil commitment laws  to make it easier to treat chronically  mentally  ill people, and still others  argue for a combination of these and  other proposals. But in the meantime,  there are  thousands of people  living,  and dying, on the streets waiting for us  to resolve this debate. The least that  can be done is to reach out to them,  find out who they are, and offer to help  them.  Senator MOYNIHAN and I today are in troducing  legislation,  the Homeless  Mentally  Ill Outreach Act  of  1991,  which would require all States through  their Medicaid Program to develop and  ",1991
241,1434,1,Mr.  SYMMS.," Mr.  President, what  could be more absurd than to impose  income  tax on a  rebate earned by a  utility customer for energy and water  conservation, while, at the same time,  not taxing the rebate for purchasing a  new car?  It sounds crazy, but that is exactly  what happens. The problem, of course,  is not  that a  rebate  for a  new car  should be taxed, but, that no true re bate should ever be taxed. Taxing re bates is akin to imposing a sales tax to  be paid only when a consumer pays less  than full price.  There was a time when conservation  rebates were excluded from a utility  customer's taxable income thanks to a  provision in the National Energy Con servation  Policy Act  (NECP A].  On  June 30, 1989, however, the NECPA was  allowed to sunset and, along with it,  one of the more sensible provisions of  the Tax Code. On that day, the rug was  pulled out from under conservation ef forts nationwide.  The electric utility industry spends  over $1 billion each year to promote en ergy efficiency and at present involves  more  than 15 million residential cus tomers  in some  type of energy pro gram. These programs enable the cus tomer  to save money and enable  the  utility to reduce demand for energy.  Many commercial and industrial cus tomers, relying on prior law, have used  incentives paid by  the utility  to ac quire more efficient capital equipment.  Under current  law,  these  customers  must include the incentive in their tax able year, turning the incentive into a  disincentive, and driving many com mercial and industrial customers out  of the utility's conservation program.  Why do we choose to punish people who  are obviously doing what is in the best  interest of our Nation?  Utility conservation programs serve  to reduce the rate of growth in the de mand for electricity. By reducing de mand for electricity, utilities are able  to burn  less  fuel. This  reduces  the  amount of pollution generated, reduces  the amount of precious national  re sources consumed, and reduces our na tional  demand  for  imported  energy,  particularly oil. Also, by reducing the  rate of growth in the demand for elec tricity, utilities are able to postpone or  even avoid  the construction of new  generating  facilities,  thereby  saving  money  for  all of  the utility's cus tomers.  However,  conserving  natural  re sources and preserving  the  environ ment go beyond reducing the demand  for electricity. Future water conserva tion, for example, is of particular im portance to my home State of Idaho  and most of the Western States. Water  is the lifeblood of the West and water  conservation  technology  is becoming  more and more marketable. At some  point, farmers may actually be able to  sell saved water to a variety of inter ests,  including environmental organi zations, that want to improve stream  flows  for wildlife and fisheries.  It is  counterproductive  to  tax  the rebates  earned by water company customers  through conservation efforts.  Likewise,  the  benefits of cleaner burning natural gas are becoming more  and more important in those areas of  the country adversely affected by air  pollution. Here again, our energy pol icy ought to be encouraging the use of  natural gas.  The overwhelming consensus at the  Secretary of Energy's National Energy  Strategy public hearings held from Au gust 1989 to April 1990 was that there is  a great need to  improve energy con servation. At a time when energy con servation has become an important na tional goal, it makes no sense to dis courage Americans from  investing in  energy conservation. The  taxation of  utility customers' rebates  is yet an other example of how  the confusion  created by  the Tax Code  leads  to  distortionary and  irrational policies.  The Tax Code should encourage, not  discourage,  the conservation of elec tricity, water, and natural gas.  To put these important conservation  programs back on track, I am introduc ing legislation which will once again  allow  utility  customers  to  exclude  from their taxable income any rebate  received  from a utility for  the con servation  of  the use  of electricity,  water, and natural gas. This is the kind  of sensible environmentalism I  think  we can all support.  I ask unanimous consent that the en tire bill be reprinted in the CONGRES SIONAL RECORD following my remarks.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 83  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled, That (a) part III of sub chapter B of chapter 1 of the Internal Reve nue Code of 1986 (relating to amounts specifi cally excluded from gross income) is amend ed by redesignating section 136 as section 137  and by inserting after section 135 the follow ing new section:  ""SEC. 138.

242,1473,1,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, I am in troducing legislation  today  to amend  the Public Health Service Act  to in clude native Hawaiian health centers  as eligible entities for certain grant  programs.  Mr. President, when the Native Ha waiian Health Care Improvement Act  passed Congress and became  law  in  1988, it authorized the establishment of  native Hawaiian health centers on each  of the major Hawaiian Islands. These  centers are intended to be able to pro vide a variety of health services to na tive Hawaiians, among other activities.  It is therefore appropriate  that these  centers have access  to Federal  funds  for  programs  that  are  available  to  other health centers and similar enti ties.  I look forward to the approval of this  legislation during this next session of  Congress.  By Mr. BIDEN  (for himself and  Mr. THuRMOND):  S. 113.

243,1473,1,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, today I am  introducing  the Drunk Driving Child  Protection Act of 1991. Simply put, this  bill stiffens the penalty for drunk and  drugged driving when a child is in the  car.  Drunk driving is one of the most seri ous public health problems in the coun try.  Each year, more  than 24,000 people  are killed in alcohol-related crashes in others words, one person is killed  every 20 minutes by a drunk driver.  More than a million alcohol and drug  related accidents occur on our high49-059  0-95 Vol. 137 <Pt. lJ 47  ways every year, causing half a million  injuries.  More than 40 percent of all teenage  deaths result from car accident&-half  of these involve drinking.  Children are among the most vulner able victims of  this  type of violent  crime:  According to one study, 56 percent,  more than half, of the children killed  by drunk drivers were passengers  in  their own vehicles.  Unlike adults, children can't just say  no when a parent or other adult who is  drunk tells them to get into the car.  All drunk drivers should  face  stiff  and certain punishment, but when a  drunk driver puts a helpless child at a  risk, such reckless acts should be pun ished even more severely.  That's why  I  am  introducing  the  Drunk Driving Child Protection Act to  increase the penalty for drunk driving  whenever a child is in the car. If there  is a minor present-defined by the bill  as anyone less than 18 years of age-my  amendment allows a  judge to  impose  an additional 1 year in prison and an  extra fine of $1,000 on top of the punish ment of the current penalty for drunk  driving.  My bill will attack the problem of  drunk driving with children in the car  on two fronts. First, the bill will boost  the penalty for drunk driving on Fed eral lands. There are more than 200,000  miles of roads on Federal land, more  than in any single state in the country.  Second, the bill will increase the pen alty for drunk drivers, who are behind  the wheels of buses,  trains and other  common carriers that operate on our  highways.  The bill I am  introducing  today  is  identical  to S.  2545, which was  ap proved by  the  full Senate  late  last  year. I am confident that the Senate  will once again take prompt action on  this bill and that the House of Rep resentatives will move similar legisla tion.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy  of the legislation, an explanatory fact sheet, and a letter from the President  of Mothers Against Drunk Driving in  support of last year's bill be printed in  the RECORD at this time.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  s. 113  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress Assembled,  SECTION 1.

DEAR  SENATOR BIDEN: Mothers Against  Drunk Driving is delighted to stand with you  in support of the ""Drunk Driving Child Pro tection Act of 1990"" Bill which will enhance  the criminal sanctions for  individuals who  choose to drive drunk with minor children in  the vehicle.  No one should choose to ride with an in toxicated driver. However, minor children  rarely have the opportunity to choose. For  example, MADD gets calls almost daily from  divorced parents, ordered to send their chil dren  for visitation with  the non-custodial  parent,  knowing  that  that parent drives  drunk with the child.  An enhancement of up to one year of addi tional  incarceration and up to Sl,000 addi tional fine for each minor child, we believe,  will have a deterrent effect.  We trust that this federal legislation will  serve as an incentive for the states to follow  in enacting similar criminal statutes. We  also believe  this legislation will encourage  states  to  specifically consider patterns of  drinking and driving in determining the best  interest of the child in civil suits affecting  the parent-child relationship.  As  always, MADD  remains  extremely  grateful for your prompt attention  to our  legislative  goals  regarding  drinking  and  driving.  Respectfully,  MICKY SADOFF,  National President.  F ACTSHEET: DRUNK DRIVING CHILD  PROTECTION ACT OF 1991  CURRENT FEDERAL LAW  Drunk driving is punishable under two pro visions of the federal criminal code. Under  the Assimilative Crimes Act, crimes com mitted on federal lands that are not specifi cally punishable under the federal criminal  code are punishable under the state law in  which the federal land is located. Thus, when  a federal judge sentences a person for drunk  driving on federal land, the judge applies the  state penalties.  Also, the 1986 drug bill made it a federal  crime to operate a common carrier (e.g., bus,  ",1991
244,1525,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to introduce today, along with  Senator BIDEN, legislation which would  establish a United States Marshals As sociation.  In 1989,  the U.S. Marshals Service  celebrated  its  bicentennial  anniver sary. Created by the First Congress in  the  Judiciary Act of 1789-the U.S.  Marshals and the Federal judicial sys tem were established in the same legis lation. George Washington appointed  the first 13 marshals, and for the next  150 years the Marshals were the only  Federal agency authorized to make ar rests and enforce Federal law.  Though best known as  the frontier  lawmen, U.S. marshals were the first  Secret Service men and even took the  population census every 10 years until  1870. Because they perform general pur pose law enforcement duties, Marshals  are often confused with the CIA, FBI,  the county sheriff, and other law en forcement agencies.  U.S. marshals,  appointed  by  the  President, are under the jurisdiction of  the Justice Department. Last year, the  2,694 marshals-including 94 marshals  and  2,600  sworn  deputies-arrested  15,000 Federal  fugitives and approxi mately  10,000  State  fugitives-more  than all other Federal law enforcement  agencies combined. They protected 505  judicial facilities and 1,611  judges and  magistrates. Their responsibilities in clude not only ensuring security and  proper decorum in the courtroom, but  also providing personal protection for  judges, U.S. attorneys, jurors, and wit nesses while away from the court fa cilities when warranted. Their court  security officers detected 55,970 weap ons at courthouse  checkpoints,  and  they administered  the Witness Security Program with its 5,500 protected  witnesses  and  6,000  witness  family  members. The Marshals' National Pris oner Transportation Network  trans ported 92,000 defendants to 333,987 court  appearances, and  last year  the mar shals managed more than $1 billion in  property  seized  from  alleged  lawbreakers in the National Asset Sei zure and Forfeiture Program.  I feel it is only appropriate to elevate  and strengthen public knowledge of law  enforcement in general, and the U.S.  Marshals Service in particular by in troducing this legislation to establish a  U.S. Marshals Association. The legisla tion is modeled after similar legisla tion which established  the National  Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the  National Park Foundation. Governed  by a board of directors, the association  would be a  charitable and nonprofit  corporation and would not be an agen cy  or  establishment  of  the United  States. The directors would serve for  terms of 4 years, and the legislation re quires that they be knowledgeable and/  or  experienced  in  law  enforcement  matters.  I urge my colleagues to support this  worthwhile legislation.  By Mr. THURMOND:  S. 135. A bill to provide that a justice  or judge convicted of a felony shall be  suspended from office without pay;  to  the Committee on the Judiciary.  SUSPENSION WITHOUT PAY OF CERTAIN JUDGES  Mr.  ",1991
245,1525,1,Mr.  THURMOND.,"  President,  today  I  am  introducing  legislation  which provides that a  justice or judge  convicted of a  felony  shall be  sus pended from office without pay pending  the disposition of  impeachment pro ceedings.  I  believe  that  the  citizens of  the  United States will agree  that  those  who have been convicted of felonies  should not be allowed to continue to  occupy positions of trust and respon sibility in our Government. Neverthe less, under current constitutional law  it is possible for judges to continue to  receive a salary and to still sit on the  bench and hear cases even after being  convicted of a  felony. If they are un willing  to  resign,  the  only method  which may be used  to remove  them  from  the Federal payroll is impeach ment.  Currently,  the  Congress  has  the  power to impeach officers of the Gov ernment who have committed treason,  bribery, or other high crimes and mis demeanors. Even when a court has al ready found an official guilty of a seri ous crime, Congress must then essen tially retry the official before he or she  can be removed from the Federal pay roll. The impeachment process is typi cally very time consuming and can oc cupy a great deal of the resources of  Congress.  Mr. President, one way to solve this  pro bl em would be to amend the Con s ti tu ti on. Today, I am also introducing  a Senate resolution providing for for feiture of office by Government offi cials and judges convicted of felonies.  While I believe  that a constitutional  amendment may be the best solution  to the problem, I am also introducing  this statutory remedy  to address the  cfilrent situation.  This legislation will provide  that a  judge convicted of a felony shall be sus pended from office without pay pending  the disposition of  impeachment pro ceedings. The Framers of the Constitu tion could not have intended convicted  felons  to  continue  to  serve on  the  bench  and  to  receive  compensation  once  they have violated  the  law and  the trust of the people.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to carefully consider this legislation.  By Mr. DOMENIC!  (for himself  and Mr. BINGAMAN):  S. 136. A bill  to extend public land  order 6403 relating to the Waste Isola tion Pilot Plant, and  for other pur poses; to the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources.  EXTENSION OF PUBLIC LAND ORDER 6403   Mr. DOMENIC!. Mr. President,  I  rise  today  to  introduce,  along with  Senator BINGAMAN,  legislation to pre vent  the Department of  the Interior  from moving forward with the Depart ment of Energy's application for an ad ministrative withdrawal of the waste  isolation pilot plant  [WIPP]  site  in  New Mexico.  Our Nation's nuclear defense  pro gram has generated large quantities of  transuranic waste. This waste, which  primarily consist of objects contami nated by plutonium and other man made  radioactive elements, are cur rently being stored at interim storage  sites around the country, including Los  Alamos National Laboratory  in New  Mexico.  The United States has pursued a pol icy  to develop a method  to perma nently dispose  of  transuranic waste  generated by national defense facilities  at a site where they can be safely iso lated from the environment. The waste  isolation pilot plant is designed to test  that policy.  From the beginning, it has been un derstood that WIPP is to be an experi mental facility.  Before  any  tests with  transuranic  waste can commence at WIPP, the DOE  must have the land on which WIPP is  located rewithdrawn  from  the public  domain, as  the  land withdrawal  that  permitted WIPP to be constructed at  the site expires in June and does not  permit tests with  transuranic wastes  at the site. The land withdrawal can ei ther be done administratively by the  Department of the Interior or legisla tively by an act of Congress.  Because of my concern for the heal th  and safety of New Mexicans, I oppose  DOE's application for an administra",1991
246,1564,1,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, today I  am  reintroducing  a  bill which will  eliminate an inequity which exists in  the Medicare Program for Social Secu rity Disability Insurance [SSDI] bene ficiaries.  There  is a  small number of SSDI  beneficiaries who are eligible for Medi care but who have failed to enroll be cause  they  have  health  coverage  though the extension of their work-re lated health  insurance or a  spouse's  employment-related health care plan.  If these individuals ever need to enroll  in the Medicare Part B Program, they  will be subjected to a 10-percent pen alty for each year they delay enroll ment. The bill will address  this  in equity.  Mr. President, as you know Medicare  was first enacted in 1965 to provide fi nancial  access  to vital heal th  care  services to our elderly population. In  1973, Medicare coverage was extended  to disabled individuals entitled to So cial Security disability insurance for 24  months or more. Since its inception,  the program has experienced enormous  growth. In 1990, it is estimated that 30  million elderly and 3.3 million disabled  individuals will receive benefits in the  Medicare Program. It is clear that this  program is serving a vital source of ac cess to health care services.  When Medicare was first enacted, a  10-percent annual  surcharge was  as sessed against those who delayed their  enrollment  in  the voluntary part B  supplemental medical  insurance  of  Medicare. This provision was enacted  to create a disincentive for individuals  who were planning to delay enrollment  until  they became ill and in need of  health care services. The provision was  based on sound actuarial accounting  and was designed to assure a sufficient  amount of premiums to assist in the  funding of the program. At that time,  there was a maximum of a 30-percent  penalty because the enrollment period  for the part B of Medicare was limited  to 3 years. In 1972,  the limited enroll ment period was abolished. Congress,  however,  failed  to  repeal or cap  the  part B surcharge. We now have a small  population of individuals who have in curred a  substantial penalty for  late  enrollment, and for whom assessing the  penalty does not make sense.  The  bill  I  am  introducing  today  would  address  another  circumstance  where individuals are being inappropri ately penalized. A small number of dis abled individuals who are qualified for  Medicare as a result of their eligibility  for SSDI, receive their health care cov erage through a spouse's employment related health care plan or through the  continuation of their own work-related  health plan. They are  reducing  the  Federal Government health care costs  and  they should not be penalized for  their efforts. This bill will eliminate  the part B premium penalty for the dis abled  person  and/or  disabled  spouse  who are enrolled in a group health care  plan  provided  by  the  beneficiary's  former employment or a spouse's cur rent or former employment.  Mr. President, those individuals who  choose to enroll in Medicare part Bin surance at a  later date because  for  some reason  their previous insurance  coverage was terminated should not be  penalized unfairly. These disabled indi viduals have to pay an additional 10percent surcharge yearly for each year  they delay entrance into Medicare part  B during which time  they were actu ally  saving  the Federal Government  money because they were using work related coverage.  Congress  recently  addressed  this  problem and  rectified a  similar cir cumstance where old age and survivors  beneficiaries were  being  inappropri ately penalized. Included in Public Law  97-248,  the Tax Equity and Fiscal Re sponsibility Act of 1982 [TEFRA], was  the working  aged  provisions which  made Medicare the secondary payer for  certain elderly workers. The provisions  amended the Federal Age Discrimina tion Employment Act [ADEA]  to re quire employers to offer their employ ees aged 65 to 69 and their dependents  the equivalent health care coverage as  their younger  employees.  It became  clear that it would be inappropriate to  penalize these individuals and subject  them to the part B pre mi um surcharge  if enrollment  in  the part B program  would  simply duplicate  their work based health care coverage. This  in equity was corrected with the passage  of Public Law 98-369, the Deficit Reduc tion Act of 1984  [DEFRA] which ex empted these individuals from the sur charge.  I urge all my colleagues to support  this piece of legislation and help  to  eliminate  this inequitable and unfair  situation. We must persist in our ef forts of making Medicare affordable,  accessible, and fair  in its design and  implementation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the bill text be printed in the  RECORD upon the conclusion of my re marks.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 157  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. ELIMINATION OF LATE ENROLLMENT  PENALTY UNDER PART B OF MEDI  CARE FOR CERTAIN DISABLED INDI  VIDUALS.

A bill to extend the period of  unemployment compensation for  indi viduals  involuntarily  separated  from  the the Armed Forces; to the Commit tee on Armed Services.  VETERANS' UMEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President,  I  rise  today to address the need for equality  in  the  treatment  of our men  and  women in our Armed Forces.  We now face the most urgent crisis in  the way we treat our military person nel since the days in which we carried  out massive personnel cuts following  World War II. Last year we mandated  that our Armed Forces must be  re duced by upward of 500,000 personnel.  Even given the exigencies surrounding  the current crisis in the Persian Gulf,  we still must reducethose forces.  At the very moment we ask them to  risk  their  lives, military men  and  women are bewildered  and  confused  about their future careers. They know  that the coming cuts in the all volun teer military are going to be large, but  they have no  idea of how their lives  and those of their families will be af fected.  These men and women are vol un teers. They joined to serve their coun try. Most joined to make the military  a career. We must act to protect them.  Now of all times, we need to show them  that we care. We must show them that  their service and sacrifices are appre ciated by a grateful country.  This is why I believe we must fully  address  the need  to protect the men  and women of our volunteer military  force. Our current system still does not  provide  the needed protection. Many  elements are based on the assumption  that virtually all military personnel  will either leave military service at a  time of their own choosing, or retire  with substantial benefits after making  the military their career. The reality is  that tens of thousands of fully quali fied personnel will be forced to leave  military  service  years  before  they  planned to do so, and often with only  limited notice.  We have already made an important  beginning in dealing with  this si tua tion. Last year, we passed legislation  that will take account of this new re ality. We required the development of a  transition plan that will provide  im proved separation pay, unemployment  compensation, relocation and outplace",1991
247,1590,1,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President,  I  am  today  introducing  the AIDS Control  Act of 1991  a  comprehensive bill de signed  to  treat AIDS as  the public  health issue it is rather than the civil  rights issue that some want it to be. I  have no doubt that if we take this vital  step,  the spread of this lethal disease  can be  substantially  reduced,  if not  curbed entirely.  Mr. President, the AIDS Control Act  of 1991 is similar, but not identical to,  a bill I introduced on January 25, 1989.  Let me  first address  the distorted  priorities which guided AIDS  legisla tion in the lOlst Congress. The Labor/  HHS  appropriations  bill  alone  con tained over $2 billion in AIDS research,  education, and treatment programs. In  fact, AIDS spending  is so  far out of  control that it is now the only disease  which had its own chapter in the com mittee report. The report states that  the number of AIDS cases in America  rose 9 percent over last year, yet the  AIDS budget has grown 37 percent in 1  year.  In 1989, 731,000 people died of heart  disease, and $219 million was spent on  research. That same year, 494,000 peo ple died from cancer; we spent $1.24 bil lion on research.  Now let's look at funding for AIDS.  During 1989, AIDS was responsible for  22,500 deaths, less than half of the num ber of Americans who died of diabetes  and less than one-third of the number  who died of flu.  Yet we spent more on AIDS related  research than we spent on research for  heart disease and cancer combined.  In 1990, 36.2 percent of the Federal  health research, education, and preven tion budget was spent on AIDS. Yet  AIDS accounts for only 1.3 percent of  all deaths in America.  Mr. President, the AIDS lobby says  such out of control and unfair spending  is warranted because of the greed and  indifference of our society. The AIDS  lobby also argues that we have to take  into account the years of lost produc tivity as justification for such spending.    Well let's examine that argument for  a moment. In 1988, cancer caused 24,052  deaths among people under 45; prenatal  conditions caused 18,527 deaths; heart  disease, 17,520 deaths; and AIDS-12,912  deaths.  Mr. President,  in  this country, ap proximately 39,000 children die before  the age of 1 each year. That is 64 years  of  lost productivity  from  the most  helpless, most innocent segments of so ciety.  The National Commission on AIDS  says  that  the disease deserves more  funding because it is contagious while  diabetes, caricer, and heart disease are  not.  In  fact,  AIDS  is  contagious  through behavior. A change in behavior  among  two high-risk populations, ho mosexual men and IV drug users, would  reduce the spread of this disease with out one more dime of Federal money or  the discovery of a cure.  In fact Mr. President, AIDS is such  an isolated disease that a homosexual  male who lives outside of such areas as  New York, Los Angeles, and San Fran cisco, has less a chance of getting AIDS  than he does of dying of cancer or  heart disease.  The  unwarranted  concentration  of  Federal resources on AIDS has created  problems  for other diseases  such as  Alzheimers, the cruel, devastating kill er of senior citizens, which afflicts 4  million Americans  and  takes more  lives in 10 months than AIDS has taken  in 10 years.  The American people are often ac cused a being indifferent to the suffer ing of the AIDS community. A look at  this appropriations bill says otherwise.  ",1991
248,1616,1,Mr. GORE.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today to introduce for myself and for  my distinguished colleague from Colo rado, Senator WmTH,  the World Envi ronment Policy Act of 1991.  I will be pleased to cosponsor another  measure which my colleague will de scribe at another opportunity here. But  I would like to talk about the World  Environment Policy Act of 1991  and  urge my colleagues  to cosponsor  it,  consider adopting  its provisions, and  place it high on the list of priorities  during this session of Congress.  The  bill  I  am  introducing  today  builds upon legislation, S. 201,  that I  presented to my colleagues in the first  legislative  session of  the  lOlst Con gress.  In the 2 years that have passed since  that  time we have made  important  progress.  Several provisions  of  that  bill, for example, the provisions calling  for a phaseout of chlorofluorocarbons,  and other substances destroying our  protective ozone shield; provisions reg ulating toxic and smog-forming emis sions from utilities and cars and fac tories were incorporated into the his toric clean air  legislation  this body  passed last year.  I would like to commend the major ity  leader,  Senator MITCHELL;  the  chairman of the Environmental Protec tion Subcommittee, Senator BAucus;  Senator  CHAFEE;  Senator  DUREN BERGER; and many others who labored  long and hard to secure passage of that  landmark law. Through their efforts we  will  indeed  have  a  cleaner  and  healthier America.  I was proud  to have been able  to  make a small contribution to the work  which  took place under  their  leader ship.  Other provisions of S. 201 have also  helped to form  the basis of action in  the last Congress. But, obviously, we  still have a great deal to do. We and  the rest of the world have barely begun  even to consider what will be involved  in order""to really confront not only the  problem of global warming but  the  deeper, underlying crisis  in  the rela tionship between our civilization and  the global environment.  On February 4, historic negotiations  on climate change will begin here in  the United States as the world starts  to move in the direction of confronting  the issue of global warming. With re gard to that issue, which I believe is  the single most serious manifestation  of the global environmental crisis and  represents the single greatest environ mental threat that our planet has ever  faced,  the agenda being pursued by  President Bush, who described himself  as the environmental President, I have  to say is long on rhetoric but woefully  short on  substance and on commit ment.  Many of us have noted  the Presi dent's  resolve-whether  or  not we  agree with  the way  in which he has  made decisions  in  foreign policy-in  standing up to  threats that may not  have  been  readily apparent without  leadership pointing out what  is  in volved. I wish there were the same kind  of  resolve  in  the White House  to  confront this threat to the global envi ronment.  We here  in Congress,  in numerous  subcommittees and committees, have  explored the nature of this problem. I  have worked on it before with the Sub committee  on  Science,  Space,  and  Technology as well as at international  meetings  with  counterparts  from  around  the world who are extremely  concerned about  the consequences of  global warming.  I have heard that, at many of those  meetings, spokesmen of the adminis tration  have made  statements  that  have  left  other participants  incred ulous. The excuses offered by the ad ministration for their inaction on glob al warming were really empty and hol low.  Just last week we saw the release of  the new  figures  showing  that world  temperatures in 1990 made 1990 the hot test year since records have been kept.  The present occupant of the chair was  one of 15 Senators who  joined me  in  sending a letter to the President, not ing that fact and asking for a bolder re sponse to this problem.  Of course scientists for a  long time  have been telling us about the relation ship between  increased emissions of  greenhouse gases and rising world tem peratures. It was in 1979 that the Na tional Academy of Sciences reported  that, ""if C02 continues to rise, there is  no reason to believe that these changes  will be negligible."" And the academy  warned  that ""A wait and see policy  may mean waiting until it is too late.""  This  legislation  that  I  introduce  today-and I ask unanimous consent to  put a summary of the legislation in the  RECORD  following my remarks  is  in tended to confront this problem.  I might say also, Madam President,  that in November,  the Second World  Climate Conference took place in Gene va. The administration's position be came unquestionably apparent  there.  Reviewing a decade of work done under  the auspices of the World Climate Pro gram, the First Assessment Report of  the  Intergovernmental Panel on Cli mate Change, and the early stages of  the International Geosphere-Biosphere  Program, the scientists--some 750 from  more than 100 countries--issued an un equivocal  and  unanimous  warning.  They said, ""If the  increase of green house gas concentrations  is not lim ited,  the  predicted  climate  change  would place stresses on natural and so cial systems unprecedented in the past  10,000 years."" We simply cannot afford  to ignore warnings any longer.  And it seems that the administration  knows that it can no longer doubt the  science. But, it is not yet out of ex cuses. As described  in a  recent New  York Times article, the administration  is now  relying on an EPA study  to  show that the United States, in fact, is  acting to counter global warming. But,  let us read the fine print.  What  their  so-called  stabilization  plan actually provides  for  is an  in crease of carbon dioxide emissions of  some 15 percent.  So much for an aggressive strategy of  response. The  legislation I am  intro ducing today calls on the administra tion  to quit  its obstructionist delay  tactics. Very shortly, with the begin ning of  the climate negotiations  in  February, we will have an opportunity  to begin developing solutions  to  this  problem. I think that it is incumbent  upon the administration to come to the  table at those negotiations fully pre pared to help devise effective solutions  because  the  truth is  that the United  States, created and exacerbated many  of  the  environmental  problems  the  world faces.  Moreover, because we, in comparison  with many of  the  countries of  the  world, are blessed with impressive sci entific and technical resources, the ef fectiveness of any strategy will depend  not only upon our cooperation but also  upon our leadership. This bill I am in troducing  today  calls on  the White  House,  in  full  recognition of our re sponsibilities, to work with the world  community  to ensure  that the worst  consequences  of  global  warming drought, massive crop failure,  severe  storm  systems,  chronic  famine  and  flooding-are not realized.  While the intensified greenhouse ef fect is a global problem that demands a  global solution, it is imperative that  each nation get its own house in order.  In that regard, the bill I am introduc ing today prescribes several measures  that I believe can effectively contrib ute  to our efforts  to combat global  warming. Among the policies described  in the bill is a system to curb green house  emissions  by  creating  a  tradeable emissions scheme. I will talk  more about that in a moment.  The bill also requires methane emis sions to be controlled, especially from  landfills, and sets up a scheme to make  recycling a No. 1 priority for the Fed eral Government, especially in Federal  procurement activities. The bill also  places a penalty on gas guzzlers and of fers a rebate on so-called gas sippers.  Madam President, in light of recent  disturbing reports that the administra tion will not fulfill its promise with re gard to energy policy-and why not, in cidentally, open up a brand new energy  policy as part of the responses to the  dangerous events in the Persian Gulf the proposal calls on the White House  to present such a policy. Aggressive  measures to develop and implement re newable energy and conservation tech nologies, such as those put forward by  ",1991
249,1629,1,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President,  I  in troduce  today  a  proposed  constitu tional amendment that would author ize the President to veto or reduce in dividual items of appropriation in bills  and resolutions. The line-item veto or  reduction authority is, I believe, a nec essary step  in helping  to bring  the  chronic budget deficit under control,  and I have long supported it. Together  with  the budget reforms enacted last  year in the budget agreement between  the President and the Congress, the au thority of the President to veto or re duce  specific  items of appropriation  provides  a  realistic  opportunity  to  stanch the deficits from which we have  suffered recently.  The budget process has run amok in  recent years. A  line-item veto would  provide a valuable institutional check  on unfettered spending and  trade-off  pork-barrel projects that do not serve  the national interest but are buried in  lengthy appropriations bills. Currently,  the President cannot do anything  to  control this form of congressional ex cess. Standing alone, the veto will not  solve our deficit problem, but it will  help by allowing the President to stop  or reduce funding should he deem the  programs  too  expensive  or  un necessary.  I believe that it is preferable to grant  to the President not only the authority  to veto completely individual items of  appropriation, but also  to grant him  enhanced rescission authority. Studies  in States whose Governors  exercise  line-item veto authority suggest that  while a straight line-i tern veto, an up  or down on a specific item of appropria tion, have little effect on spending and  budget deficits, enhanced rescission au thority does have a significant effect  on  spending. Therefore, my proposal  contains both a veto provision and a  provision to allow the President to re duce individual items of appropriation.  Many claim that the line-item veto  would result in an intolerable shift of  power from the Congress to the Execu tive and undermine the carefully craft ed balance of power established by the  Founding Fathers. Mr. President, no  one is more sensitive than I am to the  respective roles of the Legislature and  the Executive and the need to retain a  balance of authority between the two  branches. While it is a peculiarly legis lative  function  to decide how much  money  to spend on Government pro grams,  there  is no reason for a  linei tern veto to be considered any more of  an infringement on the separation of  powers than the President's ability to  veto bills at all. The veto power serves  a crucial function in our system. As Al exander Hamil ton recognized  in Fed eralist 73,  the veto provides ""an addi tional security against the enaction of  improper laws * * * to guard the com munity against the effects of faction,  precipi tancy, or of any  impulse un friendly to the public good, which may  happen to influence a majority of [the  legislative] body."" The purpose for en acting a  line-item veto  fits squarely  within this reasoning.  The ultimate authority of the Con gress  to decide how  to allocate and  spend the Federal Government's money  is protected by my proposal. Under this  proposal,  the Congress could override  the President's veto or  reduction of  any specific item of appropriation by  simple majority vote. This override by  simple majority,  rather  than by  the  two-thirds majority needed to override  a veto of an entire bill, provides ade quate  protection  for  congressional  spending authority, Any item of appro priation that cannot command the sup port of either the President or a simple  majority of the Congress is simply bad  policy and should not be approved at  all.  Mr. President, the issue of the line item veto has been pending for several  years. In the 101st Congress, the Judici ary Committee favorably reported two  different versions of the line-item veto  amendment, although the full Senate  never considered  the matter.  I hope  that this is the year in which we  nally enact this worthwhile idea.  I ask unanimous consent  that my  resolution be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the  joint  resolution was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  fi S.J. RES. 4  Resolved by  the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled, That the following article  is proposed as an amendment to the Con stitution of the United States, which shall be  valid to all intents and purposes as part of  the Constitution if ratified by  the  legisla tures of three-fourths of the several States  within seven years after its submission for  ratification:  ""ARTICLE""SECTION 1.

250,1642,1,Mr. ADAMS.," Mr. President,  along  with Senator TOM HARKIN, I am intro ducing today a resolution authorizing  the use of U.S. Armed Forces for defen sive purposes in the Persian Gulf. This  resolution authorizes U.S.  participa tion in multilateral efforts to restore  the sovereignty of Kuwait and to deter,  and,  if necessary, defend against fur ther Iraqi aggression.  I  introduced a  similar measure, Senate Joint Resolu tion 386, at the end of the lOlst session.  Last Saturday, the Senate, by a nar row margin, approved United Nations  Security Council Resolution 678, which  authorizes the use of force after Janu ary 15  if Iraq  fails  to withdraw  its  troops from Kuwait by that date. Let  there be no mistake, that vote was the  moral and practical equivalent of a  declaration of war. As a result, we are  now in a state of war with Iraq.  Last week's debate was  truly his toric, and Saturday's vote marked only  the sixth time in its history that Con gress declared war. It was a painful and  difficult vote but a necessary one. And  I am proud to have joined with Senator  HARKIN on the first day of the session  to have interrupted the Senate's rou tine schedule and forced the Congress  to decide whether our Nation should go  to war, before the first bullets start to  fly in the Persian Gulf.  Al though the Senate has spoken, it is  the right of individual Senators to lend  their voices to the choir of those op posed to going to war in the gulf. The  resolution I am introducing today out lines a policy of containment, not inva sion, in the gulf. I'm proud that signifi cant portions of this measure, which is  similar  to  the one  I  introduced  last  year, were  incorporated  into Senator  MITCHELL'S  and  NUNN'S  resolution,  Senate Joint Resolution 1, which went  down to narrow defeat on Saturday.  I supported the President's original  policy goals in the gulf. I support the  defense of Saudi Arabia. I condemn the  invasion and subsequent destruction of  Kuwait. And I strongly oppose Saddam  Hussein's cynical ploy to link his inva sion of Kuwait with the Arab-Palestin ian conflict.  But I do not believe that the solution  to Iraqi aggression is an invasion by  United States-led forces.  I cannot en dorse the U.N. Security Council resolu tion setting the January 15 deadline for  the use of force  to remove Iraq from  Kuwait. And I oppose President Bush's  offensive policy provoked by the rapid  escalation in the number of U.S. troops  in the gulf, which was announced when  Congress was out of session and initi ated without our approval.  I know I speak for all my colleagues  when I state that there are significant  points of agreement on both sides of  the aisle as well as among the Amer ican people on U.S. policy in the Per sian Gulf. We all oppose Iraq's invasion  of Kuwait. We are all seeking the with drawal of Iraqi troops from that coun try. And we are all united in support of  the courageous men and women of the  U.S. armed services now stationed in  the gulf.  However,  the narrowness of Satur day's vote reflects a deep division over  the President's offensive policy in the  gulf. That division is just as profound  among the American people. And I ex pect that if war begins, and I pray that  it does not, policy differences will con tinue both  in Congress  and  in  the  American  public  over  the  correct  course  of action our Nation  should  take in the Persian Gulf.  Today, we face solemn and troubling  times. We are praying for peace, but we  are expecting war. On Saturday, we  voted our conscience on whether to go  to war. Today, we devote our prayers  for those Americans in the gulf whom  our Nation will ask to fight that war.  I ask unanimous consent  that  the  text of my resolution be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  the  joint  resolution was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S.J. RES. 20  Resolved by  the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION I. SHORT TITLE.

251,1655,1,Mr. ESPY.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday, January  13, 1991 , marked the third anniversary of the  passing of one of the world's greatest leaders:  President Chiang Ching-kuo of the Republic of  China.  The  eldest  son  of Generalissimo  Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Ching-kuo was born  on March 18, 191 O, and died on January 13,  1988. He was elected the sixth President of  the Republic of China in May 1978, and was  reelected for a second term on May 20, 1984.  During his' second  term  in office, unprece dented political and economic  reforms were  implemented, making Taiwan one of the freest  and richest countries in the world.  In  the  last 3 years since Chiang's death,  under the  leadership of President Lee Teng hui, Taiwan has continued on its path of politi cal and economic progress. Taiwan's major  opposition party,  the Democratic Progressive  Party, has competed  fairly and squarely with  the ruling Kuomintang at all elections; senior  Kuomintang  lawmakers elected on the main land have been urged  to  retire and many  have;  travel  restrictions  to mainland China  have been considerably eased; an unofficial  organization to handle Taiwan-mainland affairs  has been established; and more informal dia log between Taiwan and mainland China will  be  forthcoming.  Economically,  Taiwan  has  maintained  its predominance  in Asia, being  the 13th largest economic entity in the world  and having more than $70 billion in foreign re serves.  Taiwan is a major economic power, to say  the  least. When  I visited Taiwan last August  with four of our colleagues, I tried very hard to  find the key to Taiwan's continuing success. I  believe I have found part of the key: Taiwan's  success lies in a superb team assembled by  President Lee Teng-hui. This Cornell Univer sity scholar and statesman is a man of vision.  He sees the Republic of China as a happy citi zenry exercising  individual  rights  to pursue  their best economic  interests. To help him  reach  that goal, he has Vice President Li  Yuan-zu, a distinguished German-educated ju rist and educator,  to articulate  the views of  both government and people. Then  there  is  Premier Hau Pei-tsun with whom my delega tion and I met last August. A former military  man, Hau  is committed to democratic  ideals  while  insisting that there can't be democracy  without law and order. A no-nonsense prag matist, he has implemented many needed po litical reforms since assuming the role of Pre mier last summer. We urged his continued ef forts in that regard.  Mr. Speaker, perhaps no one better projects  President Lee's world vision  than my  friend,  Foreign Minister Fredrick Chien. This true-blue  Yale man was Taiwan's former representative  in Washington, DC.  In my conversations with  him,  I have always found him personally en gaging and politically insightful. To assist his  President in projecting Taiwan's proper role in  the world, Chien,  for  instance, has strongly  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  supported  an  AOC  overseas  development  fund to help Third World and developing coun tries to help themselves. Chien and his associ ates, namely Vice Ministers Johnny Chang  and C.J. Chen, have also offered support to  the United States, Jordan, and other Arab  States during the current Persian Gulf crisis,  Through thick and thin, President Lee Teng hui, Foreign Minister Fredrick Chien, and his  colleagues have always been friends to Amer ica.  Taiwan's  pro-American  stance  has  also  been ably articulated by  its  top Washington  envoy, Minister Ding Mou-shih.  Tirelessly,  Representative Ding has singled out his coun try's efforts in reducing its trade surpluses with  us. And  in  recent days Representative Ding  has analyzed for us why it is in everyone's in terest to have Taiwan as a member of GATI  and other international organizations.  Mr. Speaker, Taiwan's success is no fluke.  It is the end result of its leader's vision, team work, and  industry. As we honor  the  late  President Chiang Ching-kuo on the third anni versary  of  his  death,  I believe President  Chiang would be happy  to know  that  the  seeds he had sown many years ago on a bar ren  island have now borne rich  fruits for the  world to see, to admire, and to share.  EVENTS IN LITHUANIA  HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 14, 1991  ",1991
252,1655,1,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, a tragic event  took place  in Lithuania  this weekend.  I am  deeply saddened by  the violence unleashed  on peaceful protesters and deplore the need less loss of life that has occurred.  Deeply troubling questions are raised by the  events in Lithuania: Was this an isolated inci dent, or does  it represent a turn  toward re pression? Was  the  crackdown ordered by  President Gorbachev or by an overzealous  local military commander? To what extend did  President Gorbachev set  the stage  for  the  tragic deaths by threatening to  impose direct  rule  from Moscow? Did  the Soviet Govern ment wait until world attention was focused on  the Persian Gulf in the hopes that their crack down would go unnoticed?  America must press for answers as to why  and how  these  terrible events occurred and  urge in the strongest possible terms that the  Soviet Union return  to the path of expanded  human  rights and  freedom embodied  in  the  policies of glasnost and perestroika. Instead of  violent confrontations, both Lithuania and the  Soviet Union should seek to establish dialog  and political compromise.  While all Americans hope  that  the Soviet  Union  continues  its  transition  from  authoritarianism to a more democratic system,  we must not close our eyes to the possibility  that  Soviet  Foreign  Minister  Eduard  Shevardnadze's warnings of dictatorship could  come true. If this incident is, in fact, the begin ning of a more repressive era  in the Soviet  Union, it will have a negative effect on our re lations with  that country.  It is now up to the  Soviet Government and the leaders of Lithua1653  nia to take action during the coming days to  reduce tensions in Lithuania and return to the  path of dialog and political compromise.  BLOODSHED IN LITHUANIA  HON. RONALD K. MACHTLEY  OF RHODE ISLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 14, 1991  ",1991
253,1655,1,Mr. MACHTLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the savage  force used by  the Soviet security  forces  in  Lithuania yesterday offers frightening evidence  that the Soviet Union may be moving in one  of  two nightmarish directions-its  leadership  headed for either chaos or dictatorship.  There is no justification for the brutal attack  initiated against the peaceful and democratic  Lithuanian people. The reaction to this sudden  and violent offensive against  the citizens of  Lithuania has drawn both shock and outrage  from the international community. The Lithua nian people have responded with bravery and  integrity, and the hearts of the American peo ple are with  them as  they meet this difficult  challenge.  The Soviet Union has for several years pro gressed on a course of democratic and peace ful change. The actions  taken yesterday  in  Vilnius are completely at odds with  that pro gression, and put at risk the new era of mutual  understanding which has been steadily grow ing between our two nations.  The  issue of Gorbachev's  involvement  in  this crisis is critical for determining the future  course of the Soviet Union, and will play a piv otal role in deciding the fate of all of the Baltic  nations. However, whether President Gorba chev ordered the Vilnius assault or has  lost  control, and become subject to the will of his  army  generals  and KGB  security  officials,  Gorbachev must take responsibility for the im mediate crisis. It is up to Gorbachev to return  to diplomatic negotiations and dialog with the  legitimate governments of  the Baltic States,  and to take immediate steps to ensure no fur ther injury or loss of life.  That the attention of the world is drawn to  the crisis unfolding in the gulf does not mean  that the eyes of the  international community  are not also riveted to the events in Lithuania  and the other Baltic States. The events of yes terday have posed a powerful  threat  to  the  ability of the Soviet Union to participate suc cessfully  in a new world order based on  democratic and human  rights.  I  firmly hope  that President Gorbachev will take heed of our  President's statement on the Lithuanian crisis:  Legitimacy is not built by force.  It's earned  by the consensus of the people, by openness,  and by the protection of basic human and po litical rights.  THE CHINESE LANGUAGE  JOURNALIST ASSOCIATION  HON.

255,6,5,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, the sub ject of the morning, the capital gains  taxation rate, I think is a most impor tant  subject,  and  one  that  I  com pliment my friend from Wisconsin for  bringing to the floor this morning.  Some people  seem  to believe  that  there is a conflict between tax fairness  and  tax proposals  to encourage eco nomic growth. In my opinion, that is  not correct. The conflict is between in come  redistribution  and  economic  growth, not between fairness and eco nomic growth.  I  think people,  for example, would  agree with  this,  that  taxing capital  gains due  to  inflation  is unfair;  in  other words,  to tax someone because  they purchased a fixed asset, a home,  in most cases and because of inflation,  the home appreciates in value. Then,  when  they  sell  the home,  they are  taxed on  the  increased value of  the  asset-not that it increased in value; I  should say in the increased price due to  price inflation.  Just to give you an insight into this,  Mr.  President,  about  64  percent  of  Americans own their own homes; an other 20 percent own some form of in vestment, whether through IRA's, indi vidual  retirement  accounts,  401(k)  plans, or what have you. The vast ma jority of our population  is currently  subject to a tax on inflationary gains.  That is an enormous amount of unfair ness.  This is not just a matter of a little  unfairness spread widely. It is easy for  a taxpayer who holds an asset for a few  years to actually end up paying an ef fective  tax  rate of 100 percent. Mr.  President, I believe even  the hardest  liners  in  the Iron Curtain countries,  probably  Joe Stalin  himself, would  have a hard time justifying that.  So my point is that if we do have to  have capital gains taxes, which I per sonally philosophically think is a mis take-I think it slows down  jobs;  it  slows down economic growth; and that  we would have a better opportunity for  more people at the low end of the eco nomic ladder if we just got rid of the  capital gains  tax, but be  that as  it  may, if we have to have one, which the  body politics in this country is saying  that we do, then I think we should at  least all agree that we only have to pay  the tax on real value gained, and the  way to avoid taxes on inflationary cap ital gains is to index them for  infla tion. With this one step, we could dra matically improve the fairness of our  tax system.  Indexing capital gains is also a pow erful  tool  for  encouraging economic  growth. By excluding the part of a cap ital gain that is the result of changes  in the price level, indexing reduces the  effective capital gains tax so that no  taxpayer will have  to pay more than  the statutory rate.  As anyone who has ever bought or  sold an investment will tell you, and I  think  that probably covers everyone  who ever served in this body, the pros pect of a capital gain has a  lot to do  with why the asset is purchased. A high  effective capital gains tax reduces the  willingness  to buy  assets.  In other  words,  it creates a  tremendous dis incentive on savings and investment,  and savings and  investment  is what  provides jobs, and that is the way you  give people at the low end of the eco nomic ladder that great chance that we  talk about  in America,  so  they can  crawl up that ladder and have a share  of the economic pie.  If the economic pie is to grow, if our  economy is going to generate good jobs  and growing real incomes, we have no  choice -we have to save; we have to in vest. And  the only way  to get there  from here is to reduce the barriers to  saving and investment. Just simply re duce the barriers. And we could do this  if we did not do anything else to the  capital gains tax except index the cap ital gains tax.  We would be making one giant step  forward toward a more fair Tax Code  for the working American people, who  work and save and invest and buy a  home. It would help all of those people.  Those  are  all  of our  constituents.  Those are the backbone of America.  There are a lot of other things that  we can do to encourage saving and in vestment. We can bring back the IRA  to where it was prior to the 1986 tax re form. We can improve the capital cost  recovery  system. We  can make  the  R&D tax credit permanent. But I want  to say again: One of the best ways to  get the barriers down is to just simply  index the capital gains tax.  There is another way of looking at  the need for indexing capital gains. Ev eryone would agree that insurance is  an important part of our society and  our life. Most people buy life insurance  and automobile  insurance. Most em ployers  provide medical  insurance;  most businesses are faced with having  to buy liability insurance. In short, we  buy a lot of insurance in this country.  Recognizing  its  social value, Con gress has encouraged most forms of in surance with  special  tax  treatment.  There is one form of insurance, how ever, which is critical to our future and  which for reasons that defy logic, the  Congress has chosen to deny. This, of  course,  is  insurance  against  being  taxed on inflationary capital gains.  It is absolutely immoral to tax peo ple on Government-caused inflation: As  an asset increases in price but does not  increase in value, and then the person  sells the asset, they have to pay a tax  to the Government. It is absolutely in explicable to me how anybody can say  that is a moral, fair system.  Congress has recognized  the  impor tance  of  inflation  tax  insurance  in  other areas. Prior  to 1981,  a worker  could suffer a loss in take-home pay be cause, even though the worker's pretax  Wages would keep pace with inflation  thanks  to cost-of-living adjustments,  the tax bite grew even faster because  the  tax bracket and key deductions  were not indexed for inflation.  Thankfully, Congress . overcame  the  tradition in 1981, and changed the law  to that income tax brackets, personal  exemptions, and  the standard deduc tion would be  indexed  for  inflation.  This was a great step toward a more  honest and fair tax system.  Now that the American people have  had that experience with bracket in dexing, I would not advise buying stock  in  the political career of anyone  so  foolish to tamper with bracket or ex emption indexing.  It would simply be very. very un popular with the voters who now un",1991
256,32,5,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I cer tainly want to pick up on the distin guished  chairman's  last  observation  about how, when we were in the gulf  region, we were  struck, particularly  those of us who saw service in World  War II and Korea, by how the pinup of  the Persian Gulf was in sharp contract  to the pinup of earlier conflicts. It was  the letters, the posters devised by the  young people of this country in an out. pouring of their understanding of this  conflict and  the purposes  for which  their older brothers and sisters were  engaged  in  taking  risks  to preserve  freedom.  I  appreciate  the  chairman's senti ment on that because there were four  main parts to this conflict: The leader ship, which I will address momentarily;  The men and women who saluted and  followed the orders; the logistic chain;  the allies; and then I think maybe as a  fifth there was the home front, home town,  the village green, U.S.A.  that  turned out in a manner unlike any in  my lifetime since the closing days of  World War II.  Mr.  President,  in  addressing  the  pending  legislation,  I wish  to  com pliment the chairman, the staff, major ity and minority, of the Senate Armed  Services Committee. This is a Senate  Armed Services Committee bill. Let us  not lose sight of the fact we had the  prime  responsibility. There  came  a  time when we recognized, and the lead ership of  the Senate  recognized,  the  importance of embracing other pieces  of legislation which, although not di rectly, indirectly impacted on the ben efits, as we now term it, for the men  and women who served in the gulf and,  indeed,  those back here at home  in  many instances.  I commend the majority leader, the  Republican leader, Senators GLENN and  MCCAIN,  for working together against  odds which at times appeared to me to  be insurmountable, given the volume of  the  legislation and  the uniqueness,  I  will use that word, of some of the ideas  that came forward. But we have seen  miracles performed around here and,  indeed, this was a miracle, too, to put  this  in one package  in our bill,  the  Committee on the Armed Services, and  make it a part of the other important  technical legislative components which  the  chairman  has  adequately  ad dressed.  I see no benefit to the Senate for me  to review the very fair and objectiv~  analysis of those other technical parts  of the bill over which our committee  had the principal jurisdiction. I do not  foresee in the course of such debate as  we may have on this piece of legisla tion any differences with  regard  to  those elements and components as ad dressed by the chairman.  I would like to return, however, and  parallel my remarks with those of the  chairman in regard to this conflict. It  was  extraordinary  in  the  annals of  military history, all military history,  not just United States but worldwide  military history. We had in place at  this  time  leadership which  I  have  termed almost providential: A President who had experienced combat, who  understood  how  to  lead men  and  women in times of combat; we had gen eral officers, we had flag officers of the  U.S. Navy and the Marine Corps and of  the Air Force who had extraordinary  professional  capability and  training,  and  they had under  their  immediate  supervision  the most  extraordinary  grouping of men and women in the his tory of our Nation, everyone being a  volunteer.  It was  the All Volunteer  Force. It was their first major test.  Yesterday afternoon, I received a call  from an individual for whom I have un limited admiration. It was my privi lege  to  serve with  him  from  1969  through 1972 in the Department of De fense, Melvin Laird, then Secretary of  Defense. We reminisced about the ori gins of  the All Volunteer Force and  how at  that  time President Richard  Nixon, together with Secretary of De fense Laird, and the two Chairmen of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff, really worked  on this. They took the risk, in the face  of. unprecedented turmoil here on the  home front toward a military action, of  shifting to the All Volunteer Force. In deed, it was a risk; there was no prece dent in the history of our country for  having an All Volunteer Force. The  war was continuing to be waged. The  transition was made.  The  concept  worked. The concept worked because  this country has as its greatest asset  the men and women of  the Armed  Forces, the young men and women who  are willing to come forward and vol un teer and the officers and noncoms who  were to work with this ever evolving  and changing group of young people.  And on the home front, I hope many of  our colleagues have experienced as  I  was privileged-I underline privileged to  experience  the  first homecoming  from  the gulf of Virginians who had  gone forth. In this instance it was at  Langley,  a  historic air base  in our  country in Virginia, the First Tactical  Air Wing, which Senator NUNN and I  and  Senator  STEVENS  and  Senator  INOUYE had visited only weeks before in  the gulf. As the planes were taking off  during our meeting with the airmen,  around the clock performing missions,  little did we know at that  time, al though  it was predicted,  forewarned  that we would begin  the ground ele ment-it  is often called  the ground  war; that is a misnomer-of the major  conflict,  the air element having per formed brilliantly for some weeks, we  would be back home greeting the very  people we met in the gulf.

But I experienced at Langley  an outpouring of love and affection, of  respect, of admiration, of confidence of  the American people for those individ uals.

258,45,5,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I rise  to support the Desert Shield authoriza tion.  One of the most important parts of  this bill is the package of benefits for  Desert Storm veterans and their fami lies.  I commend those involved in assem bling  this  package.  Senator GLENN  chaired a  task  force  of Democratic  Senators to make recommendations on  needed benefits for Desert Shield per sonnel. On the other side of the aisle,  Senator MCCAIN chaired a similar task  force. Both task forces and their re spective chairmen deserve credit  for  their work in assessing the various pro posals.  Under  the  leadership  of Senators  MITCHELL and DOLE,  the proposals of  the two task forces were melded into a  package of benefits that I believe are  fair and compassionate to our troops,  while being fiscally responsible.  I want to draw particular attention  to the parts of the benefit package that  affect military families.  After the parades are over and the  yellow ribbons have come down, mili tary families affected by the gulf con flict will try to return to their normal  lives. The benefits contained  in  this  legislation will ease that transition in  four concrete ways.  First, the package would bolster the  counseling and mental health services  available to military families.  It contains $30 million for enhanced  family support services, including addi tional school-based counseling for mili tary children. It also provides funds for  family counseling and crisis interven tion, as well as assistance with employ ment,  housing,  transportation  and  other needed services.  The package also delays cuts made  last year in the mental health benefits  offered in the military heal th care sys tem. This is no time to cut these bene fits. Military families should have ac cess to appropriate mental health care  during the critical readjustment period  following the war.  We saw the ravages of war on fami lies during Vietnam. We know that sep aration and reintegration  is difficult  for everyone. And, we must do all we  can to help these families cope.  A study by the Veterans' Administra tion  vividly  demonstrates  the  need  even years later. One in three Vietnam  veterans has suffered from drug or al cohol dependency; 40 percent have been  ",1991
259,58,5,Mr. WARNER., If I could ask a ques tion  for  clarification. Was General  Scowcroft National Security Adviser in  1988?  ,1991
260,58,5,Mr. NUNN., No. He is now.  ,1991
261,58,5,Mr. WARNER., I feel that the Senator  was projecting that.  ,1991
262,58,5,Mr. NUNN.," The general was a retired  general in 1988, a private citizen.  ",1991
263,58,5,Mr. WARNER., He was  associated  then with Dr.  Kissinger  in  inter national consultation. So it may be a  situation where what we do  today we  can undo tomorrow.  ,1991
264,58,5,Mr. NUNN.," He may  have  indeed  changed his mind. I do not know. That  study was cochaired by Bill Perry, who  most of us would stipulate knows more  about  R&D  and  complicated  tech nology than anybody I have seen come  through  the Department of Defense.  There are a lot of people who feel this  way and a  lot of people on the other  side. Certainly, the Senator is correct,  and he makes his point well. General  Scowcroft was not then the National  Security Adviser. Those were the days  when  he  could  let  his mind  flow  unimpeded by any philosophical hang ups.  At that stage he was able to make  completely  objective  observations.  Now he does have more restrictions,  and I agree with the Senator on that.  ",1991

266,58,5,Mr. NUNN., Has that cleared the Of fice of Management and Budget and the  other procedures it has to go through?  ,1991

268,58,5,Mr. NUNN.," I thank the Senator.  Mr. President, the amendment cites  the Soviets' relentless modernization  of its strategic offensive capabilities  and that is certainly a trend that con cerns us all. It is a puzzle to me how a  country with as many  serious  eco nomic problems as they have can con duct what is indeed an amazing strate gic nuclear program. While their mili tary on the ground is having all sorts  of problems and being cut back, their  strategic  nuclear  programs  are  not  being cut back.  I hope that will change, but so far  the Senator is right it has not. It wor ried all of us. However notwithstanding  this trend, President Bush announced  in the State of the Union message last  month  that he was  refocusing SDI  away from defending against a  large scale Soviet strategic attack in favor  of protecting against ""limited ballistic  missile strikes whatever their source.""  Will this new limited protection sys tem require a wholesale abrogation of  all ABM Treaty restrictions on devel opment and  testing, as recommended  by the amendment? Or might we not be  able to develop,  test and even deploy  an effective limited protection system  within the current limits of the treaty  or,  if required, with  some  far more  modest  amendments  than  rec ommended here?  These questions have not been an swered because the President has not  made it clear for  the benefit of the  American public. They are saying how  does all this effect me? The phase 1 sys tem we were  planning before,  if  it  worked out  just  like everybody was  saying, and if we did have a ballistic  missile  attack  against  the United  States,  the  good  news  is  it would  knock down, if it works and everything  goes according to plan, some 50 percent  of the Soviet's SS-18's.

269,136,5,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to introduce today the Product  Liability Fairness Act, which embodies  the text of S. 1400 from the lOlst Con gress. This legislation is the same as  that which was reported by the Senate  Commerce Committee by a vote of 13  to 7, had a hearing before the Senate  Judiciary  Committee,  and  unf ortu nately was not acted upon before the  last Congress adjourned.  I am joined by 30 of my colleagues,  from both sides of the aisle, who have  cosponsored this bill because they rec ognize  the need  for  the  reasonable,  moderate reform of our product liabil ity rules.  The effort to enact product liability  reform has been one which the Senate  Commerce Committee has considered  since 1981. We bring before the Senate a  measure that is balanced, does not de prive injured victims of any causes of  action, does not contain any limits, or  caps, on damages, and has the cospon sorship of almost one-third of the Sen ate.  President Bush and his administra tion are strongly  in support of  this  measure. The President called for prod uct liability reform in his State of the  Union Address last year. His Competi tiveness Council, headed by Vice Presi dent QUAYLE, continues to make this  issue its No. 1 priority. All of this is re flective of the concerns that large and  small businesses alike have with our  current system.  Our product liability reform measure  is justified on several grounds. We have  a system that is slow in compensating  victims who  deserve  compensation,  costly to all parties, and unpredictable  due  to the State by State patchwork  that we have today. Above all, we seek  a system based on fairness.  Provisions of our bill would address  the costs imposed on all parties by the  current system. The transaction costs  see  the  lawyers of both  the plaintiff  and the defendants taking in as much,  or more, than the injured parties. Re cent data collected by  the National  Machine Tool Builders Association in dicates  that in cases  involving  their  members in 1989, only 17 percent of the  moneys paid out went to claimants.  However, it is important to note that  our legislation would not reduce  the  costs by restricting the rights of per sons to sue for damages, or by institut ing caps on the amounts that could be  recovered. There were understandable  objections made  by  the  organized  consumer interests to these provisions  in prior bills. Thus, this bill may not  lower insurance rates or premiums the  way former bills would have.  Rather, thanks to the establishment  of some uniformity on certain matters,  both parties should be able  to better  assess  the nature of their cases, and  even possibly take advantage of the ex pedited settlements or alternative dispute resolution systems in the bill. The  uniformity we seek will make the as sessment of risk easier, and thus help  to stabilize the insurance market.  It is important to note that we have  a  national problem  that deserves a  moderate, Federal approach. Though  the  current  rules  have  developed  through  the  judicial activism of the  various State  courts,  the  time has  come for Congress to recognize the bur dens our current system is imposing on  interstate commerce, U.S. competitive ness, and American innovation.  Let me briefly describe  the major  provisions  of  our  produ~t liability  package which will reduce unnecessary  legal costs, provide incentives for the  manufacture of safe products, and pro vide more fairness to all concerned:  This measure establishes procedures  designed to expedite the settlement of  product liability cases. The rules are  based on rule 68 of the Federal Rules of  Civil Procedure. This will help reduce  the burgeoning and unnecessary legal  costs that hamper the current system.  We  encourage  the States  to make  greater use of alternative dispute reso lution procedures, to also help reduce  the legal costs.  The product seller provision also ad dresses the unnecessary legal costs of  the system. Today product sellers are  brought  into almost every case, and  yet liability is imposed on them in less  than 5 percent of the cases. Under our  bill, sellers are only to be held liable  for their own negligence, for failing to  provide warnings  from  the manufac turer,  for breaching an express war ranty, or when the manufacturer is un available.  Legal costs are also saved by the pro vision dealing with the interaction be tween the product liability system and  the workers compensation system. We  have  taken steps  to help keep  these  two systems separate, and avoid  the  excessive and unnecessary lawsuits be tween manufacturers and employers.  Another priority is creating  incen tives for safety. Our joint and several  liability provision maintains joint and  several liability for economic damages.  We only eliminate joint and several li ability for noneconomic damages such  as pain and suffering. Thus, plaintiffs  can recover their full economic losses  from  any defendant,  but defendants  would only be  responsible  for  those  portions of the noneconomic damages- such as pain and suffering-which they  caused.  Our package also encourages safety  by barring  the claims of  individuals  who are the cause of their own injuries  because they were intoxicated or under  the influence of illicit drugs.  The cause of fairness is advanced by  the extremely proplaintiff statute of  limitations. The  time begins  to  run  upon  the claimant's discovery of the  harm and the cause of that harm. This  is a more proplaintiff standard  than  most current State standards now in  existence.  Fairness is also provided for in our  statute of repose, which sets an outer  time limit for liability at 25 years for  capital goods, where the injury is cov ered by workers compensation.  Fairness is also the thrust of the pu nitive damages provision. We recognize  the quasi-criminal aspect of these dam ages, which are intended to be awarded  in  egregious  cases, not  every  case.  Therefore we  establish  a  national  standard for their imposition and the  burden of proof required. Thus,  these  damages are to be awarded where the  claimant establishes by ""clear and con vincing"" evidence that the harm evi denced a ""conscious, flagrant indiffer ence to the safety of those persons who  may be harmed by the product."" We  have a burden of proof that falls be tween  the normal  civil  standard of  ""preponderance of the evidence"" and  the criminal standard of ""beyond a rea sonable doubt."" The punitive aspect of  the cases may be heard separately from  the case  in chief if the defendant so  elects.  No one wants manufacturers to in troduce unsafe products or keep them  in the marketplace. However, it would  be equally abhorrent if the uncertain ties of our product  liability system  were to prevent new, useful, and safer  products from being brought  to mar ket. The cost to society of innovations  never pursued, or improvements never  made, is not obvious at first blush-but  it  is nevertheless a  cost  that hurts  American  consumers, manufacturers,  and workers.  There has been some research indi cating  that  the  rapid  expansion  of  product liability law, which the courts  were pursuing in the past, has slowed  somewhat. The courts themselves may  be moving  the  judge-made  law away  from the situation where even reason able manufacturers are held liable.  Professor Henderson, of Cornell Law  School, who has been conducting this  research, cautions:  However, to conclude that this trend will  resolve all of the serious inequities and legal  conundrums that still exist would be a mis use  of  the  data  collected  in  the  study .... The better, more efficient way to  address some of the profound problems prod uct liability law has caused our legal system  and society is  through  thoughtful, sparing  and modest  legislation  at  the  Federal  level. ... S. 1400 is a worthwhile attempt at  some of the needed reforms.  It is our job to make this attempt a  reality with this legislation in the 102d  Congress.  Another point was made in our hear ings last year-that this is neither a  proplaintiff, nor a  prodefendant bill.  And just because it is balanced between  the rights of the parties, not favoring  the  plaintiffs,  does  not make  our  amendment anticonsumer. The most  anticonsumer effects which I have seen  ",1991
270,149,5,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President, I  rise today to offer a bill that is vital  for the survival of the general aviation  industry. Close  examination  of  the  problems plaguing the general aviation  industry is critical if we are going to  help this industry survive. In the past  11 years, we have witnessed a dramatic  decline in the sales of general aviation  planes. In 1990 fewer than 1,200 general  aviation planes were sold. Compared to  the 17,000 sold in 1979, that is a decrease  of over 90 percent. In the process, we  have lost thousands of high-technology  manufacturing jobs.  During  the  same  period,  liability  costs for the industry have soared from  $24 million to well over $200 million an nually. This nearly tenfold increase in  liability costs is not due to an increase  in accidents-the accident rate has im proved steadily. It is due solely to the  size of damage awards and the expand ing number of situations in which man ufacturers  are  held  responsible  for  damages from general aviation acci dents. In short, with general aviation  accident rates going down while liabil ity costs are soaring, we need to ask  serious questions about the standards  to which aircraft manufacturers are  held under our current tort system. We  also need to find constructive answers,  such as the General Aviation Accident  Liability Standards Act.  The problem, Mr. President, is that  there is no uniform standard which ap plies to liability cases for this indus try. The result  is  inconsistent court  judgments from State to State and, in  turn,  instability and unpredictability  in the industry.  This point was recently  illustrated  by Russ Meyer,  president of Cessna  Aircraft which is based in Wichita, KS.  Cessna  is  the second  largest general  aviation aircraft manufacturer in the  United States and, until 1986, also the  world's leading producer of piston-pow ered airplanes. Cessna stopped producing piston aircraft in 1986, in large part  due to the liability crisis. Russ Meyer  has said  that Cessna would approve  plans to resume production of single engine aircraft within 24 hours of con gressional action to address the prod uct liability system.  The need for a uniform Federal prod uct liability standard is clear. A Fed eral standard will correct the legal in consistencies which exist for this oth erwise fully federally regulated indus try. The Federal Government regulates  the industry from design to production;  the air traffic control system is feder ally operated and regulated. The Fed eral interest and presence in aviation  is all pervasive except in one area-liti gation  is conducted under  individual  and widely varying State laws. Federal  product liability standards, a corner stone of this legislation, would provide  uniformity and predictability.  When a manufacturer sells an air craft, the new owner is responsible for  the  inspection, maintenance, and up keep of that aircraft. As long as a man ufacturer  provides  the  required  warnings and  information, he should  not be held liable for an accident that  results from the owner's failure to per form  these responsibilities. This, Mr.  President,  is not  the manufacturer's  responsibility.  To address this, this bill establishes a  20-year statute of repose  for aircraft  and replacement parts-which begins  anew each time a system or a part is  replaced. In this way, we are not allow ing anyone who is at fault to get off  the hook, but we are ensuring  that  manufacturers  are  held  responsible  only for those wrongs they have com mitted, and no more. It is worth noting  that the European Community is far  ahead of the United States in reform ing its product liability standards, in cluding  the  institution of a  10-year  statute of repose. This is half the 20year statute proposed in this bill.  The bill also retains both strict li ability and joint and several liability  between the manufacturers of all sub systems and component parts, and it  enacts  com para ti ve  responsibility  among other parties.  I believe it is important to point out  what the bill does not do. It does not  cap damages in any way. It does not  cap or limit attorneys' fees. It does not  waive  the  responsibility  to  supply  warnings against dangers regardless of  the age of  the product.  It does not  limit warranties given by the manufac turer. Nor does it limit a person's right  to sue.  As the sponsor of the General A via tion Accident Liability Standards Act,  I am pleased to be joined by a biparti san group of 24 Senators in support of  this measure. This bill also has  the  support  users of general aviation, a combina of both manufacturers  and  tion that is unique for a product liabil ity reform bill. In addition, the administration continues to support this leg islation as it has in years past.  As  you  know, Mr.  President,  the  issue of aviation liability reform is not  a new one. While we continue to debate  the  issue  here  in  Congress,  rapid  changes have been taking place in the  global marketplace.  When the European Community con solidates its markets in 1992, our do mestic industries will face new chal lenges  in  the  trade arena. With 1992  just around the corner, we cannot af ford  to overlook  the realities of the  problems for our general aviation in dustry if the Congress does not act ex peditiously on  this bill. With  sales  down among major manufacturers, our  foreign  trading partners are readying  their planes for export to our country.  Wichita, KS,  is currently known as  the Air Capital of the World,  largely  because of  the prowess of  the  thr.ee  major general aviation manufacturers  based  there. A change  in  this status  would not only hurt the  industry in  Kansas but would also further weaken  our domestic industry.  General aviation is a major part of  our national air transportation system  and is today facing a crisis of unprece dented proportions which is related to  the tort system. While rising product  liability costs are not the only factor  contributing to the decline of the in dustry,  they are certainly among the  most significant. I urge my colleagues  to support this legislation.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would  like to express my deep appreciation to  my distinguished colleague from Kan sas for her efforts. I am pleased to once  again offer my strong and enthusiastic  support for this legislation.  Quite frankly Mr. President, I cannot  believe that we are standing here again  discussing this issue. This is the fourth  Congress  in a  row  in which my col league from Kansas has introduced this  measure. Passage of  this bill  is not  only of tremendous importance to our  aviation  industry,  it is vital  to our  country as a whole. Although it is fo cused on one sector-general aviation,  it has broad implications.  Aviation is now our most prominent  mode of transportation. It is  to  the  20th century what railroads were to the  19th century. As we move toward the  year 2000,  aviation will only assume  greater prominence as we struggle to  compete in the global marketplace.  Here in this country, we are fortu nate to have a rich and proud tradition  in the field of aviation. Our ""firsts"" are  many:  the Wright Brothers,  the first  transoceanic  flight,  the first  jet air craft. These all belong to the United  States. Yet we are losing our edge.  This decline was vividly illustrated  in a hearing on another issue that took  place before the Aviation Subcommit tee several years ago. One of the wit nesses was Col. Frank Borman, former  Air Force pilot, former astronaut, and  ",1991
271,175,5,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today, with my distinguished colleague  and warm friend, PAUL SIMON, to intro duce legislation creating an additional  bankruptcy judgeship for the Southern  District of Illinois.  Justice is best served when the sys tem is able to deal effectively and effi ciently with the cases before it. The  Southern District of Illinois, unfortu nately, is overwhelmed with cases, and  is therefore, not able to serve the peo ple effectively or efficiently. The prob lem is not with the judge and staff of  the southern district. They are doing  Yeoman's service. The problem, simply  put, is another judge is needed to han dle the ever growing caseload.  Mr. President, the Southern District  of  Illinois  encompasses  38  counties,  constituting over 15,000 square miles. It  is larger than the States of Massachu setts, Connecticut, Rhode  Island and  Delaware combined. Yet, there is only  one judge for this sprawling area.  Judge Kenneth Meyers,  the  sole  bankruptcy judge in the district, hears  cases in East St. Louis, Alton, Mt. Ver non,  and Effingham,  IL. He  is con stantly on  the road. While he some times gets a hand  from  two  retired  judges, their continued service is by no  means assured.  One of the criteria for an additional  bankruptcy judgeship is the caseload in  a district. According to the Adminis trative Office of the U.S. Courts, the  average weighted caseload hours per  bankruptcy judge in the United States  is 1,254 hours. The tentative standard  for the authorization of an additional  position  is 1,500 weighted hours per  bankruptcy  judge. The Southern Dis trict of Illinois had a  total of 1,655  weighted hours in 1990, clearly above  and beyond the tentative standard.  The current heavy caseload is not an  aberration, Mr. President. The caseload  in the district has grown consistently  over the last 10 years, while there re mains only one judge. In 1981, over 1,400  bankruptcy petitions were filed in the  southern district. In 1990,  the number  of petitions had ballooned to over 3,800.  There may be no other one-judge dis trict in the country with a higher num ber of filings.  Further, the Southern District of Il linois has a higher total caseload than  13 of the 29 bankruptcy court districts  with  two  judges. Mr. President,  the  time for redress of this problem is now.  There is a process for judges to follow  in order to request an additional judge ship. A number of factors other than  weighted case hours are considered by  the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts, which ultimately makes rec ommendations  for  additional  judge ships. The southern district is pursuing  a  favorable recommendation from  the  administrative office for an additional  bankruptcy judgeship.  However, it may be fall before  the  next  recommendations are made  for  additional judgeships. The evidence in  favor  of  an  additional  bankruptcy  judgeship for the Southern District of  Illinois is clear and convincing.  The burden of Judge Meyers must be  alleviated. The band-aid solutions em ployed to date will not solve the prob lem. An additional judgeship is needed  in short order for justice to be served,  and served well.  I urge my colleagues' favorable con sideration of this legislation at the ear liest opportunity.   By Mr. HEFLIN:  S.J. Res. 93. Joint resolution to des ignate the period of September 13, 1991,  through September 19,  1991, as ""Na tional Ballroom Dance Week""; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.  NATIONAL BALLROOM DANCE WEEK  ",1991
272,175,5,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, today I  rise to introduce a  joint resolution to  designate this week of September 13 to  September 19, 1991, as ""National Ball room Dance Week.""  The origin of dance dates back  to  primitive man as he made dancing the  expression of emotion. Recorded his tory shows us that there was no civili zation that did not know of dancing.  Egyptians, Hebrews, Assyrians, Hindus,  Romans, and Greeks all danced. The  Greeks held dancing in high esteem,  and from there the Romans continued  the  development  of  dancing.  The  Roman fancies introduced the world to  a new age of leisure and irresponsibil ity through their celebrations of dance.  ""Le Bal Des Ardents"" was one of the  first great, recorded celebrations which  occurred in the late 14th century. From  this  time point on, numerous grand  ball celebrations continued the gayety  of dance: The Grande Fete D'Amour at  Versailles,  the Jubilee Masquerade at  Ranclagh,  and  the Sultan's Ball at  Constantinople to name a few.  Today people continue to dance and  mainly for one reason: enjoyment. So cial dancing is one of the main forms of  interaction in our society. From the  early Basse, Paranes,  and Quadrille  dances, today's society has the Swing,  Fox-Trot, Cha-Cha, and the ever beau tiful Waltz.  Ballroom dancing has been around in  various forms since early civilization  and it has been a crucial factor in the  development  of mankind. Numerous  groups have increased the interest in  the Tango, the Lindy, and the Rumba  in the past few years, and I believe it is  important to commemorate this grand  form of dance with  its own  special  week of recognition.  Mr. President, I ask my fellow Sen ators to join their fun-loving constitu ents of the big band era and those of  more current  times that cherish  the  frivolity of ballroom dancing in spon soring  National  Ballroom  Dance  Week.

273,188,5,Mr.  DECONCINI.," Mr. President, on  February  23,  1991,  Edward  M.  Hallenbeck  retired after 29 years of  Government service. As  the Regional  Director of the Bureau of Reclamation  for the Lower Colorado Region, Ed was  headquartered  in Boulder City, NV.  With the indulgence of my colleagues I  would like to take this opportunity to  recognize the achievements of this out standing public servant.  In 1963, 4 years after graduating from  South Dakota State University with a  B.S. degree  in electrical engineering,  Ed began his Reclamation career by  working as an electrical engineer  in  Huron, SD.  In 1966, he moved  to the  Boulder City regional office where in  1968 he was named chief of the Power  Operations and Maintenance Branch.  In 1969, he moved to Phoenix as assist ant manager  of  the  Parker-Davis  project and was promoted to manager  of the project in 1971. Mr. Hallenbeck  was appointed to head the Bureau of  Reclamation's Arizona Projects Office  in 1980. In this position he had the re sponsibility  for  planning  and  con structing the central Arizona project,  or CAP,  the  largest single water re source project ever authorized by Congress. In February 1986, he was named  Regional Director  of Reclamation's  Lower Colorado Region.  Among the many awards and honors  that Ed has received are the National  Water Resources Association Distin guished Service Award and the Meri torious Service Award of the Depart ment of the Interior.  Edward  Hallenbeck's  accomplish ments have resulted in efficient oper ation of the Lower Colorado River Sys tem, enhanced delivery of power and  water for public use, and an improved  image of the Bureau of Reclamation.  Ed has been a terrific resource for me  and my staff and a tremendous public  servant for our country. His expertise  and dedication have been particularly  helpful for Arizona and I am sure that  I speak for the rest of the delegation  when I say that he will be missed.  I ask that this body join me in con veying this country's gratitude for Ed's  devotion and exemplary service to the  United States of America.   ",1991

My colleague  from Texas, Senator  BENTSEN, has been an advocate of re forming the Federal billboard law, and  has provided  important  leadership in  this area which is much appreciated. I  regret that his name was not printed  on  the bill. Senator BENTSEN's con tribution to  this legislation has been  extremely valuable, and it is important  for people to know that he is an origi nal cosponsor of S. 593.  IRENE CONLAN   ",1991
275,188,5,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President,  in  light of the overwhelming solid waste  disposal problem currently facing our  country,  I  thought  it appropriate  to  bring to the attention of my colleagues  the efforts of Irene Conlan of Scotts dale, AZ.  Irene, while working for the Arizona  Department of Health Services, wit nessed the disposal of hundreds of laser  printer cartridges into trash bins. She  was aware  that  the cartridges were  costing  the State of Arizona  tens of  thousands of dollars annually, and fur thermore,  she  knew  that  these  nonbiodegradable  units  were  being  dumped into Arizona landfills.  Irene was unable  to accept such a  squandering of resources and energy  and decided  to actively combat  this  wastefulness. When she  left her posi tion with  the Department of Health  Services, Irene learned how to recycle  laser printer toner cartridges and pro ceeded to set up a remanufacturing lab oratory in her garage. Today, 2 years  later, her company, Cartridge Tech nology Network,  Inc.  [CTN],  has 20  manufacturing centers, with Western  and Eastern regional headquarters.  Although Irene  is pleased with  the  rapid growth of her company, she  is  equally proud of the more than 40 tons  of nonbiodegradable waste  that CTN  has kept out of Arizona landfills alone.  At a  time when our country faces  enormous  environmental  challenges,  Irene is a fine example of what a con scientious citizen can do  to confront  these obstacles. I ask that all of my  colleagues  join me  in  applauding  Irene's noble and ambitious undertak ing and in wishing her continued suc cess in the future.   CBO BUDGET ESTIMATE FOR THE  NIOBRARA  SCENIC  RIVER DES IGNATION ACT OF 1991  ",1991
276,188,5,Mr.  JOHNSTON.," Mr. President, on  March 7, the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources filed  the report to  accompany S. 248, the Niobrara Scenic  River Designation Act of 1991.  At the time this report was filed, the  Congressional Budget Office has not  submitted its budget estimate regard ing this measure. The committee has  since  received  this  communication  from the Congressional Budget Office,  and I ask  that it be printed  in  the  RECORD.  The budget estimate follows:  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE,  Washington, DC, March 12, 1991.  Hon. J. BENNETT JOHNSTON, Jr.,  Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.  DEAR MR.  CHAmMAN: The Congressional  Budget Office  has  reviewed  S.  248,  the  Niobrara Scenic River Designation Act of  1991, as ordered reported by the Senate Com mittee on Energy and Natural Resources on  February 27. 1991. CBO estimates that enact ment of S. 248 would result in additional  management and study costs totaling about  $750,000 over the next five years, assuming  appropriation of the necessary amounts. Ad ditional costs are likely to be incurred after  1993 for  land acquisition, facility construc tion, and operation of the new river areas;  however, we are unable  to estimate  these  costs at this time. Enactment of S. 248 would  not affect the budgets of state or local gov ernments.  S. 248 would designate 70 miles of  the  Niobrara River in Nebraska as a scenic river  and would grant recreational river status to  another 25 miles of that river and to a 39mile segment of the Missouri River. An addi tional 6-mile segment of the Niobrara would  be studied for possible inclusion in the Wild  and Scenic River system. The Department of  the Interior (DOI) would be directed to estab lish a Niobrara Scenic River Advisory Coun cil and a recreational river advisory group  for the Missouri River. These groups would  provide advise to DOI on the management of  the rivers. The blll would also require DOI to  prepare two studies: one on the feasibllity of  creating a national recreation area adjacent  ",1991
277,201,5,Mr. MCCLOSKEY.," Mr. Speaker, last  Friday the community of Bedford, IN,  and hundreds of friends and admirers  bade farewell to 20-year-old Brian Lee  Lane, a marine hero who was killed in  one of the  last major battles of the  war.  Brian fell February 27  as his unit  bravely  fought  to  free  the Kuwait  International Airport from Iraqi forces.  He loved to hunt, fish, and camp with  his father. He liked working with his  hands and carrying out projects in in dustrial arts classes.  Brian was assigned to the 1st Marine  Division's 3d Battalion, 7th Marines, an  infantry unit. He  left high school  in  1988 when he was 17 to enlist in the Ma rine Corps. While in the Marine Corps  he worked on his high school GED. He  loved the Marine Corps. Everybody who  knew Brian knew that he was ready to  lay his life down for his country. As his  father said, he was tough and he want ed a challenge, ""To know him was to  love him.''  His father, Michael Lane, remembers  that Brian was always for the under dog. ""He couldn't stand to see a big  guy pick on a little guy. He was always  ready to help another person.""  Brian's mother is Mrs. Beverly Oliver  of Pinhook, Lawrence County, IN.  Brian will always be fondly remem bered by those he loved and those who  loved him. He will be a hero forever.  JAPANESE ON OFFENSIVE FOR  AMERICA'S GOLF COURSES  (Mrs. BENTLEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute, and to revise and extend her  remarks.)  ",1991
278,201,5,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker, it ap pears we can get people's attention to  economic problems by mentioning the  sport of golf; Last night, I stayed here  to call attention to the American peo ple that the United States Open will be  played at Pebble Beach, which is now  Japanese owned. A national  treasure,  Pebble Beach, now a public golf course,  may no longer be available to Americans if the Japanese charge a $750,000  membership to Japanese members.  The Pebble Beach sale packaged four  . golf courses  together, and gives  the  Japanese prize facilities and land for  high-priced homes. The intended use is  for Japanese golfers and tourists, not  the American public-unless they are  very rich.  One hundred and sixty courses have  been acquired by Japanese companies  or Japanese-backed groups. Total Japa nese investment in golf courses was Sl  billion in 1990.  It is estimated by the year 2000 the  Japanese will own 1,000 American golf  courses-and I would guess only  the  best  ones. American  golfers  should  carefully  check  the  sales  of  these  courses, including Pebble Beach, to see  if they are subject to any Federal regu lations, particularly  if there  is S&L  money in the sale.  Golf friction now exists between the  United States and Japan.  Instead of crying fore golfers can cry  bonsai. Will we have  to plant a  flag  with the Rising Sun on each green?  NEW HOPE FOR DEMOCRACY IN  SERBIA  (Mr. MOODY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute, and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1991
279,201,5,Mr. MOODY.," Mr. Speaker, at long  last, democratic  forces are asserting  themselves in Serbia, Yugoslavia.  Massive  street  demonstrations  in  Belgrade have  revealed growing dis satisfaction with the repressive, auto cratic rule of Slobodan Milosovic and  his Communist directorate. The crowds  have been demanding an end to Bel grade government control over TV and  press, the dismissal of the Secretary of  Interior, who controls the political po lice.  After  facing violent crackdown by  the Milosovic regime,  the demonstra tors have had  their  initial demands  met. In light of Serbia's historic tradi tion of democracy we hope  that this  new  prodemocracy  movement  will  grow.  The current demonstrations  follow  earlier laudable democratic changes in  Croatia and Slovenia. These two repub lics have made it plan that they will  not remain in a nation where Serbian  control remains autocratic and Com munist-dominated.  D 1210  Therefore, these recent developments  in Serbia could well signal a new era of  badly needed political reform and hope  for the entire country.  Only when all six Yugoslav Republics  have made internal reforms to be truly  democratic can the country of Yugo slavia survive. This must include not  only a free press but also free courts  and especially tolerance and protection  of minority populations in each repub lic. Only then will all citizens feel se cure, and only  then will ethnic con flicts subside .  From having lived there, I know that  the wonderful people of Yugoslavia- Croatians,  the Serbs,  the Slovenians,  and others-deserve a  full measure of  democracy  after  45  years  of Com munist-style central control and auto cratic government.  The new demands for democracy in  Serbia augers well for all six republics.  TIMELY ACTION ON RESOLUTION  TRUST CORPORATION FUNDING  (Mr. BAKER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
280,201,5,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. Speaker, it is appar ent  that many Members of Congress  subscribe  to a very simple economic  theory: If you wish to make a small  fortune you must first start with a  large one.  As the owner of the world's largest  real estate corporation, the Resolution  Trust Corporation, we own 45,000 pieces  of real estate, the single largest asset  the American taxpayer has, in the hope  that we can pay off the failed savings  and loan industry costs.  It is apparent we must move forward  quickly as each day of deliberations  costs  the American  taxpayer S8 mil lion. It is clear we must move forward  with funding in a reasonable manner.  The existing body of  law, over 1,000  pages governing the actions of the Res olution Trust Corporation in FIRREA  is far more than sufficient regulation  of the expenditure of these funds.  We must act. We must act timely and  we must act for the sake of the Amer ican taxpayer.  UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION  REFORM  (Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1991
281,201,5,Mr. LEVIN of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker,  here is the state of the unemployment  comp system in this country. If you are  laid off through no fault of your own,  most often you are not covered at all.  If you are covered, you often wait in  line or wait weeks for your first check.  And if you receive a check, you often  exhaust benefits after 26 weeks and  have to go on welfare.  Michigan just triggered on to the ex tended benefit program. It took close  to 10-percent unemployment to do so.  The  unemployment  compensation  system is a safety net with more holes  than twine, and this is for the working  people of America.  Congressmen DOWNEY. PEASE, and I  introduced yesterday a bill that would  reform  the weekly benefit structure,  ",1991
282,214,5,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 5 minutes  to  the distinguished  gentleman  from Virginia  [Mr. BATE MAN].  ",1991
283,214,5,Mr.  BATEMAN.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  the  distinguished  gentleman  from Alabama  for  yielding me  this  time.  Mr. Chairman and my colleagues, I  speak  to you with some very mixed  emotions about the legislation that is  before us. Essentially I would say that  I like what is in it. I am certainly not  displeased at the enhancement of bene fits  for our people  in  the uniformed  services. I think they are in order and  imminently well-deserved, nor am I op posed  to reviewing and elevating the  package of benefits available  to  this  country's veterans to whom we owe so  much.  My concern is the process by which  we are doing this, and with that I take  very, very strong exceptions.  The basic purposes of the legislation  before us are to authorize expenditures  directly associated with  the prosecu tion of Operation Desert Shield/Storm,  something obviously we must do.  To add  to  that without  the proper  analysis, without the fullest of hear ings and consultations a package of  personnel benefits and veterans bene fits is not the wisest way to do what it  is we are all interested in doing.  The personnel benefits, as I have in dicated, I am supportive of. I think if  anything they avoid some of the ex cesses that might be described almost  as a piling on, if you look at some of  the proposals that have been circulated  in terms of how to benefit our people in  uniform  who  served  in  Operation  Desert Shield; things, ""as generous,"" if  I may put that in quotes, as sugges tions that every reservist called to ac tive duty should get from  the public  Treasury a sum up to $40,000 as an off set against any possible loss of income  that was lost as a result of having been  called into active duty as a Reservist.  So it is not an extravagant package  and I would not want anyone to feel  that it is; however, we started off with  legislation, knowing little if anything  as to how it would be scored, and how  it would be dealt with under the Budg et Deficit Reduction Act of 1990. We  know virtually less today than we did  when we started.  Now,  the bill as it came from  the  committee had provisions in it that the  sums for  these benefits would not be  funded unless it was from the Special  Foreign Assistance Act. That provision  is essentially, as I take it, going to be  removed by amendments already made  by the rule that came to the floor or by  other amendments which will be pend ing.  How much better it would have been  for the leadership of this House and for  the appropriate  committees  to have  gotten  together along with consulta tion with the Budget Committee and  put together a package such as  this  that could be  laid before  the House  with certainty as to how it was going  to be  funded, what  its  implications  were in terms of the Budget Deficit Re duction Act.  It bothers me more than a little that  depending on how the course of amend ments voted upon later today will go,  we may by virtue of expending money  for these benefits in this bill both for  veterans and for the uniformed services  end up requiring a reduction in exist ing benefits paid to military personnel  and to veterans. I do not think that is  really what the will and the desire of  the House is to do, and yet that may  end up being exactly what we do.  In the reconciliation bill last Octo ber, we mandated upon  the Veterans'  Administration a reduction of $3.6 bil lion in expenditures over a 5-year pe riod. It requires reductions in a number  of veterans' benefit programs that are  very, very Draconian and we should try  to seek ways to avoid it. How tragic it  would be if by enhancing veterans' ben efits in this bill we make those reduc tions in expenditures even more Draco nian and even create other reductions.  We have simply got to face up to the  consequences of the Budget Deficit Re duction Act as passed and we ought to  knowingly  do  this offbudget or we  ought to do it onbudget, knowing ex actly where we are headed in terms of  how these programs will be funded.

285,214,5,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of H.R. 1175 and the Desert  Storm veteran's benefits package it in corporates.  I would  like  to  salute  Chairman MONTGOMERY for his wisdom  and  tireless commitment to ensuring  that the veterans of this Nation receive  what they so courageously earned.  Mr. Chairman, I am one of the over 18  million veterans who has taken advan tage of the GI bills. When I came out of  the service after World War II, the GI  bill paid my tuition, fees, bought my  books,  and  supplies,  and provided a  subsistence allowance. In that day they  paid enough for me to attend Columbia  University Law School.  Should our commitment to our veter ans be any less today than it was then?  Surely, not.  The veterans of the Persian Gulf war  have performed their duty to this Na tion and they have done it in spectacu lar fashion.  Victory in the gulf came from supe rior leadership, clarity of purpose, su perb planning, and most importantly  faultless  execution  by  highly  com petent, highly skilled soldiers.  Gone are  the days when a  soldier  needed to know little more than how to  pull a  trigger. Today he must be able  to use lasers, computers, and all sorts  of high-technology wizardry.  Yet many of these soldiers are  the  non-college-bound  youth  that would  have fallen between the cracks of soci ety had they not joined the military.  In  1987, Adm.  James D. Watkins,  newly retired Chief of Operations for  the U.S. Navy, testified in a series of  hearings before  the  Joint Economic  Committee, entitled, ""Competitiveness  in  the American Workforce.""

286,240,5,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Chairman, I re serve the right to object.  The CHAIRMAN pro  tempore  (Mr.  DOWNEY). The Clerk will  report  the  amendment, as modified.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment, as modified, offered by Mr.  WASHINGTON: At the end of the bill, add the  following new section:  SEC. 504. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING AS SISTANCE  TO  UNITED  STATES  SMALL BUSINESSES SEEKING TO BE  COME  INVOLVED IN THE REBUILD ING OF KUWAIT.  (a) FINDINGS.-The Congress makes the fol lowing findings:  (1) The men and women of  the Armed  Forces together with allied forces have suc cessfully liberated Kuwait and the independ ence and sovereignty of Kuwait have been  fully restored.  (2) Much damage has been done to the in frastructure, environment, and industrial ca pacity of Kuwait and reconstruction of Ku wait's economy is desperately needed.  (3) Small businesses have always been the  backbone  of a  prosperous United States  economy.  (4)  57  percent  of  the United  States  workforce, totaling more than 67,000,000 indi viduals, are employed by businesses with  fewer  than 500 employees and  these small  businesses account  for  50  percent of  the  goods and services produced by all United  States businesses.  (5) Small and minority businesses are play ing an increasingly important role  in pro moting a positive trade balance between the  United States and its international trading  partners.  (6) Small and minority businesses have ex pressed an interest in helping in the rebuild ing and reconstruction of Kuwait, but face  inherent difficulties in competing in foreign  markets and in obtaining a share of procure ment contracts from  foreign governments,  particularly procurement contracts which  are awarded in distant parts of the world.  (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.-lt is the sense of  Congress that(1) the President, the Administrator of the  Small Business Administration,  the Sec retary of Commerce,  the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Export-Im port Bank, and the Overseas Private Invest ment Corporation should cooperate in pro viding assistance  to United States  small  businesses seeking to become involved in the  rebuilding of Kuwait;  (2)  the Administrator of the Small Busi ness Administration should conduct a public  information campaign using its local and na tional offices to advise United States small  and minority businesses about becoming in volved in the rebuilding of Kuwait;  (3) United States companies that have been  awarded contracts pertaining to the rebuild ing of Kuwait should whenever possible seek  to subcontract with United States small and  minority businesses; and  (4) all businesses that have been awarded  contracts pertaining to the rebuilding of Ku wait should seek to hire where approppriate  veterans of the Armed Forces.  Mr. WASHINGTON (during the read ing). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous  consent that the amendment, as modi fied, be considered as read and printed  in the RECORD.  The  CHAIRMAN  pro  tempore.  Is  there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?  ",1991
287,240,5,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Chairman,  re serving the right to object. Mr. Chair man, I have all the respect in the world  for  the gentleman who asks for  this  unanimous-consent request. My objec tion  is not over any  issue of merit  whatsoever.  My objection is over the way that the  Republicans were treated in the Com mittee on Rules, whereby 10 Democrat  amendments,  including  the  gentle man's, which I supported in the com mittee, were allowed, and no Repub lican amendments were allowed other  than one by the Republican leaders.  We Republicans have a very  innoc uous amendment, miniscule  in costs,  which simply says that all returning  reservists who have IRA accounts, indi vidual  retirement accounts,  shall be  able to benefit from the exemption of  any 10-percent penalty on those IRA's  should they meet a hardship and have  to withdraw those funds early.  All I am asking is that we have a  gentleman's agreement that the unani mous-consent by the gentleman from  Arizona [Mr. RHODES] will be allowed  to go through and that he will be al lowed to offer his very simple amend ment. That would cut the ratio down  from 10 Democrat amendments  to 2  simple Republican amendments.  Mr. Chairman, I would now continue  to reserve the right to object.  ",1991

290,240,5,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Chairman, let me re spond to the gentleman from New York  on the issue of the amendments.  I understand the gentleman's point  there.  In  the attempt  to make  the  amendment modification that the gen tleman from Texas here is offering, we  tried to work  the deal that the gen tleman is suggesting and try and get a  unanimous consent all around that the  Republican side be able to offer their  amendment. I  think that we ran into  problems. The gentleman already has  had a discussion with the gentleman  from Massachusetts [Mr. MOAKLEY] and  the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Ros TENKOWSKI] on the issue, and we cannot  get that unanimous consent.  So I guess where we are in there, and  let me suggest to the gentleman from  Texas,  that if he would withdraw his  unanimous-consent,  that  unfortu nately, we will not be able to deal with  the  amendment  that  the gentleman  from Texas, in the way that he wanted  to, but I  think we can perhaps deal  with it in conference, but I  think we  cannot get  to where  the gentleman  from New York wants to get.  The CHAIRMAN pro  tempore. Does  the gentleman from New York  insist  upon his reservation of objections?  ",1991
291,240,5,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Chairman, con tinuing my reservation of objection, I  would say just say again that I have all  the respect for the gentleman. I sup port his modification. We are not argu ing the merits. I will not withdraw my  objection. Not only  that,  this is not  just the beginning. This will carry on  this week, next week, and  the week  after. The point is going to be made  that there has  to be fairness  in this  House.  I object, Mr. Chairman.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Objec tion is heard. The unanimous-consent  request is denied.  ",1991
292,240,5,Mr. WASHINGTON.," Mr. Chairman, in  that event, I withdraw the unanimous consent request.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair would  advise  the gentleman that it has al ready been objected to.  ",1991

294,240,5,Mr. WASHINGTON.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself  such  time  as  I may  consume.  Mr. Chairman, I understand the ob jection of  the gentleman  from New  York did not really concern my amend ment. It was on something totally dif ferent. I would like to thank the gen tleman from New York as well as the  chairman, the gentleman from Massa chusetts [Mr. MOAKLEY], and the mem bers of the Committee on Rules  for  making my amendment in order under  the rule, and also I would like to thank  the chairman, the gentleman from Mis sissippi  [Mr. MONTGOMERY],  and  the  chairman, the gentleman from Wiscon sin [Mr. ASPIN], and the ranking mem ber, the gentleman from Alabama [Mr.  DICKINSON], and the staffs of both com mittees as well as my colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Michigan  [Mr.  ",1991

296,253,5,Mr. KANJORSKI.," First of all, Mr.  Speaker,  I want  to compliment  the  gentleman. I happen to agree with his  thesis. The one thing this House needs  on  the S&L disaster  is debate. The  American  people  do not understand  what happened, what is  the problem  now and what is the problem in the fu ture.  The only way we can cast light to the  American people as  to what  the dif ficult problems are within the adminis tration and this Congress in handling  this complex problem is to have adequate time for debate, so I  think the  gentleman makes a very worthy point.  I just want to take some time to ana lyze with the Members who may not be  present in the Chamber today what is  going  to be  transpiring  in  the next  short term. As I understand the rules,  there will be a request from the Rules  Committee to adopt a rule, to allow an  hour of debate for the passage of the  funding authorization for the RTC.  There are certain significant votes  that will be taken. Unfortunately, the  first vote, as I u,nderstand it, will be a  vote  to consider  the question of the  motion for the passage of the rule it self.  In order  to do  that, under  the  rules because it is within the 24-hour  period of the Rules Committee meet ing, that will require a two-thirds vote  of the House to suspend the rules to be  allowed to move on and consider the  rule;  the problem being that we will  not have debate on that question, and  that is the important real issue here,  because once the rules are allowed to  be waived and the rule to be consid ered, then the rule will be debated for  an hour, but it will only require at that .  point a majority vote, which clearly  the leadership on this side of the aisle  and on that side of the aisle, on our  side of the committee and on their side  of the committee and in the adminis tration, apparently have all gotten to gether and agreed  this  is something  they can get a  sufficient number of  votes on without a lot of debate and a  lot of consideration.  So I would urge the gentleman to re alize  this and certainly stay on  the  floor with this, but to alert the Mem bership of the Congress  that may be  watching this now that the most sig nificant vote will be to be present and  ",1991

298,266,5,Mr. BACCHUS.," Mr. Speaker, I came  here  to Congress prepared  to do  the  right thing, to make the hard choices.  I am still prepared to do that. I want to  do the responsible thing. I am prepared  to act responsibly.  I believe the RTC needs more money.  I came to that conclusion reluctantly.  But I am less than overwhelmed by the  job that the RTC is doing in my State.  Members may not realize it, but the  RTC  is exempt from all Federal pro curement laws. The RTC has been in  business for nearly 2 years but has not  yet produced audited financial state ments. If you or I were to go to a bank  and ask for a  loan, we would be ex pected to give them audited financial  statements.  The RTC is asking for what amounts  to $78 billion. That is five  times and  then some what we spent on the space  program, and yet they are unwilling to  tell us how they have accounted for  what they have done thus far.  I want to do  the responsible  thing  and I am willing to give  them more  money, but  I  am unwilling  to give  them a blank check.  Some have said  there  is no alter native. There  is  one.  I  offered  an  amendment  in committee which has  the endorsement of the National Tax payers Union. It has the support now of  many other Members of this body, in cluding the chairman of our Financial  Institutions Subcommittee,  the gen tleman from Illinois [Mr. ANNUNZIO]. It  would give  the RTC $15 billion now.  That is how much they say they need  right away  to  resolve  those  institu tions  that are currently  in receiver ship, and it would authorize up to an  additional $15 billion more, but on a  dollar-per-dollar basis as they sell off  assets in the rest of this fiscal year.  That is a workable compromise that we  can build on in committee, and that is  a bipartisan compromise that we can  make. That is a responsible way to ap proach this challenge as a Congress.  Thomas Jefferson looked toward an  America that he hoped would offer, in  his words, wise and frugal government.  Giving a blank check to the RTC  to night is not wise and it is certainly not  frugal.  I have met at length with representa tives from the RTC.  I have examined  their papers. Not all of the $150 billion  that they have in assets are market able, but  they have acknowledged  to  me that they currently have $40 billion  in liquid marketable assets that could  be sold off in a way that would save the  taxpayers money. Let us not give them  a blank check.  ",1991

300,266,5,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. Speaker, I appre ciate the chairman yielding this time  tome.  Ladies and gentlemen, we all could  probably  figure  out  a  bill  that we  would rather have than this one, even  an RTC that we would rather have than  this one. There are many on this side  of the aisle who were disappointed that  specific provisions did not get in. There  are many on this other side of the aisle  who are disappointed that specific pro visions did get in.  But one thing that we can see clearly  throughout the long journey of this bill  from committee and now onto the floor  is  that unless  there  is a  bipartisan  agreement this bill will not pass, and  pass it must. It must pass because the  bottom line is sort of like some other  things,  it got a  bad name, and  it's  called a bailout. Who are we bailing  out? We are bailing out depositors. We  are bailing out our average constitu ents who  innocently put their money  into institutions and now simply want  it back when the institutions fail. They  are relying on Uncle Sam's guarantee.  We have all sorts of other agenda  items that many of us would like to at tach to this train. We tried it. We tried  it last night. We tried it in committee,  and because this bill is such a slippery  bill, and by slippery I mean that Mem bers would love to slide off of it, any thing that is added makes the bill go  down.  So we have a  real choice here, my  colleagues. We can pass this bill. It is  hardly going to make Members heroes  in their districts, and it is hardly going  to make  them heroes with anybody,  but it is the right thing to do. Or we  can continue to insist that it can only  pass with the provisions that I want,  that he wants, that she wants, so we  will have 435 provisions and no bill and  the depositors will lose.  We all know the right thing to do. It  is to vote for  this bill. It is a  tough  vote, but it is why we are here, and it  is why we are legislators, and I urge  Members to support the bill.  ",1991

302,266,5,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. Speaker, as many  of us know, the United States has the  lowest voter turnout of any industri alized nation on Earth; 50 percent of  the people did not vote in the last Pres idential election and 60 percent of the  people did not vote in the last congres sional election. Listening  to  this de bate here  tonight,  the only question  that comes to my mind is why 40 per cent of the people bothered to vote.  The previous speaker  talked about  two sides of the aisle. I suggest that he  was implying that there are basic dif ferences of opinion. I think most Amer icans do not perceive  that. They see  one big aisle, and they would like to  see people in this body begin to stand  up for the working people and the poor  people and the elderly people who are  getting ripped off outrageously by this  S&L bailout.  I do not accept  the criticism  that  some of us are afraid to vote the $30  billion. I am prepared to vote the $30  billion if that is in fact what is needed.  But at a time when the wealthiest peo ple of this country have seen a tremen dous increase in their income, while at  the same time the standard of living of  working people and poor people has de clined, I will be damned if I will vote  for a proposal which will stick it to the  middle class and the working people.  The fact of the matter is, despite all  of the obfuscation and all of the discus sion, if we need $30 billion we can raise  the $30 billion quite easily. I would sug gest to the Members that all we have  to do is to place a 15-percent surcharge  on  the  taxes paid by  the wealthiest  people on their incomes over $100,000.  That brings in $15 billion. Place a 15percent surtax on the corporate income  tax and we have another $15 billion. If  we add $15 billion plus $15 billion, it  equals $30 billion. We do not have to  pass $100 billion or $150 billion in inter est if we extend the $30 billion over a  30-year payment as we are now con templating. We all know what happens  when we dump  this money onto  the  deficit. Next year we will come back  and cut back more on Medicare, cut  back more  on  education,  environ mental protection, and all of the des perately needed programs in this coun try.  In my view, the real debate has not  yet begun. I would like to see this rule  defeated. I would like to see some seri ous debate, and I really would like to  see if there are two sides to this assem bly here and have at least one side  stand up  and  say  let us have  the  wealthy people start paying their fair  share of taxes.  0 2000  ",1991

The mother,  Minnie Pearl Jurnett, has sent five sons to the  Persian Gulf.  The young men are: Tommy, a 35-year-old  police officer from Nashville, TN, who is in the  Army Reserve; William, a 33-year-old staff  sergeant who was sent to the Persian Gulf in  September with his cavalry group  from Fort  Bliss, OK; Terry, a 32-year-old staff sergeant  who was deployed with an artillery battalion  from Fort Stewart, GA, shortly after  Iraq  in vaded Kuwait; Kenneth, a 24-year-old Navy  gunner who left in November; and Keith, who  is 19 years old and who joined the Army about  11/2 years ago. He was transferred from South  Korea early in January with his artillery unit.  Currently, William and Terry are near  the  Euphrates River  in  Iraq, helping supply  the  massive army that cut off and killed the infa mous Republican Guard. Kenneth is a gunner  on  the battleship U.S.S. Missouri. Keith and  Tommy are somewhere on the frontline.  At the Jurnett home in Maury City, TN, one  wall of the den is covered with photographs of  these sons in their uniforms. These 5 young  men belong  to a family of 13 children who  have always been close to their mother. It was  tough  for  them  to  leave  their mother when  duty called but they willingly went to the Per sian Gulf to serve their country. Only the call  of duty could get them to leave her.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Mr. Speaker, not only do  I pay  tribute  to  these young men who have served so honor ably  in Operation Desert Storm, but  I also  wish  to pay  tribute  to  their mother, Minnie  Pearl Jurnett. She is a shining example of the  family support that our troops have received  during their time away  from home. All of us  know the sacrifices that our men and women  in  the combat zone make, but we must also  remember  the  families of those  troops back  home who, too, must make great sacrifices to  the cause.  The entire Desert Storm undertaking has  proved to be a shining moment in the history  of this country. We can all be proud of not  only the individual efforts made, but of the col lective effort by all the citizens of this country  who have supported our  troops during  this  time of national emergency. It is a proud day  for America, for Minnie Pearl Jurnett, and for  her sons, Tommy, William, Terry, Kenneth,  and Keith. I thank them, and honor them, for  their contribution to continued freedom for all  people in the world.  INTRODUCTION OF NATIONAL  SPORTS PRODUCTS MONTH  HON. TOM LEWIS  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 13, 1991  ",1991
306,305,5,Mr. LEWIS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, we are  all aware of the positive physical and mental  aspects of a healthy  lifestyle. For more and  more Americans,  this means participation  in  an athletic activity.  As  the sports craze of the  last few years  has continued, one  industry has grown  re sponsibly with  the  trend-the manufacturers  and distributors of athletic clothing,  footwear,  and equipment.  Virtually every State in the country boasts  an economic presence created by sports prod ucts. Their impact is demonstrated every year  at  the annual  trade show  in Atlanta which  drew over 80,000 visitors this February.  In addition, money from their trade show are  channeled into several worthwhile programs to  combat drug abuse and encourage participa tion in sports and recreational activities.  In recognition of the sporting goods manu facturers and distributors' impact on our Na tion's economy, health, and youth,  I have in troduced National Sports Products Month.  In  my view, it is important for Congress to recog nize the efforts of this important industry.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to  join as a cosponsor of National Sports Prod ucts Month, and urge the House to pass this  legislation.  A TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY SHULA  HON. LAWRENCE J.

Mrs. Shula  passed away recently.  Mrs. Shula was a teacher who for years bat tled the scourge of breast cancer. A true fight er, she lived a happy and fulfilling life, bringing  up five children, two of whom are also coach es in the National Football League.  Not only did Mrs. Shula help support her  husband and the Miami Dolphins organization,  but she also  fought  for organizations and  ideals that are important to all of us. College  scholarships,  funding  for medical  research,  ending drug abuse-these are but a few of the  projects that Dorothy Shula associated herself  with.

308,305,5,Mr. MCDADE.," Mr. Speaker,  I am deeply  saddened to bring to the attention of my col leagues the death of Warren H. Spencer, a  man who has contributed greatly and self lessly  to his Nation,  the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania, and  the people of Tioga and  Potter Counties, whom  he  so  effectively  served  for over  two decades  in  the State  house of representatives.  Those of us who knew Warren Spencer  consider ourselves fortunate. He was a fantas tic  individual both  in and out of the political  arena. I know of no finer man, no better citi zen, or no more effective legislator than War ren Spencer. He was a devoted family man, a  dedicated public servant, a respected member  of the legal profession, and a valued commu nity leader. He leaves behind a loving family,  countless friends and admirers, and a lifetime  of achievement.  Warren was born and raised  in Wellsboro,  PA. He served as a paratrooper in World War  II, and suffered war wounds, which cost him  an eye and severely  injured his hips and a  hand. That experience, which nearly cost him  his life, made him treat each day as a special  gift.  After military service and graduation  from  Dickinson School of Law, Warren Spencer re turned to Wellsboro to practice law, eventually  forming the firm of Spencer, Gleason & Hebe.  He served in the Pennsylvania State Legisla ture from 1962 to his retirement in 1984.  His talent and energy led to many legislative  landmarks  in Pennsylvania, and he gave his  constituents the best representation they could  have. He specialized  in criminal and  judicial  reform as chairman of the judiciary committee,  and he worked tirelessly as a champion of the  northern tier and all of rural Pennsylvania.  Warren made enormous contributions to his  community. He was a member of St. Paul's  Episcopal Church, the American Legion, Dis abled American Veterans,  v&rious Masonic  groups, and numerous community organiza",1991
309,318,5,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House,  the gen tleman from New York [Mr. LAFALCE]  is recognized for 10 minutes.  ",1991
310,318,5,Mr. LAFALCE.," Mr. Speaker, last year, I was  honored to have over 290 of my colleagues  join me in proposing legislation, H.R. 4494, to  clarify an area of environmental law that ad versely impacts businesses of all types.  Today, I am introducing a considerably dif ferent bill that aims to clarify the exemption in  the Superfund law for secured parties, an ex emption  that was part of the original  law  in  1980. This clarification is based on a draft rule  prepared by EPA, after EPA gave careful con sideration to all  the competing arguments of  environmentalists and  lenders alike. I believe  EPA crafted a balanced rule to accommodate  those competing concerns.  Action on this issue is crucial.  During the 101 st Congress, the Small Busi ness Committee held hearings to explore the  impact of the current uncertainty regarding the  exemption provisions on lending to small busi ness. This uncertainty resulted from a series  of court cases since 1985. This uncertainty  has adversely affected the ability of otherwise  good businesses to borrow funds.  Testimony from government agencies, busi ness  community  representatives,  environ mentalists, and bankers made clear that banks  and other lending institutions are increasingly  refusing  loans  to  creditworthy  small  busi nesses that either use hazardous materials or  are located in areas of possible contamination  because of  fears  regarding potential  liability  generated by court action.  In  the continuing  credit crunch in which we find ourselves, we  cannot  tolerate unnecessary  impediments  to  appropriate lending.  It is noteworthy the EPA itself acknowledged  that legislation might well be necessary, even  if a rule were eventually promulgated, to pro vide certainty through statutory guidance. As  previous EPA testimony indicates, the Agency  is itself acutely aware that the current uncer tainty  is  impacting adversely on the ability of  a  range of businesses  to obtain  financing,  even  for projects directed at environmental  cleanup.  One of the major motivations behind my re vision of this legislation was to address what  I believe to be  legitimate concerns advanced  by the environmental community. This revised  legislation provides important inducements for  the conduct of environmental assessments;  clarifies that lenders and other parties who are  directly responsible for environmental damage  do not escape appropriate but limited liability;  precludes the use of sham trusts to evade li ability;  leaves  in place existing protections  against undue enrichment for  lenders as  the  result of environmental cleanups; ensures that  parties actually exercising  the responsibilities  of owner/operators cannot avail themselves in appropriately of  the exemption; encourages  lenders  to  take action  to  remedy environ mental damage rather  than walk away  from  their collateral; and requires lenders foreclos ing on property to move diligently to dispose  of that property in order to remain within the  bounds of the exemption.  BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE LEGISLATION  The  Comprehensive  Environmental  Re sponse, Compensation and Liability Act of  1980 provides  that owners and operators of  facilities and vessels should be liable for envi ronmental cleanups. The Congress exempted  from  the category of owners and operators  parties who do not participate in the manage ment of a facility while holding indicia of own ership to protect a security interest.  The intent was quite clear. Lenders and oth ers who extend  financing  to borrowers se cured by property should not have Superfund  liability simply because of a financial relation ship. Court cases, however, began  to erode  this exemption, holding parties responsible as  owners or operators who  simply exercised  rights over property as a proper  function of  their security  interest, even  if they exercised  no operational responsibility whatsoever.  In one case, Fleet Factors,  the court went  so far as to suggest that liability for a lender  could attach where contract terms permitted a  court to infer that the lender had the capability  to  influence  through  financial  relationships  hazardous waste decisionmaking. That kind of  language  is exactly what causes uncertainty,  and is reducing the willingness of financial in stitutions to lend, even to creditworthy projects  that might actually effect a positive environ mental result.  Simply put, under  the  law as  it currently  stands, a lender cannot be certain, in making  a loan or dealing with a borrower with an ex isting  loan,  that  it will not unwittingly trigger  unlimited Superfund liability.  I want to reiterate that the secured creditor  exemption already exists. My bill does not cre ate a new exemption for lenders.  The result of the current uncertainty is that  certain businesses have found it difficult to se cure  funds and many  lenders are unable  to  determine whether they should extend credit  or how  they should deal with debtors who  need additional assistance or who are in de fault. While environmental  lender liability has  not been the sole cause of the current credit  crunch,  it has been a contributing  factor  in  many instances across the country.  Not only does the exemption already exist  and  the  uncertainty  have  an  impact  on  financings,  but most parties  have already  agreed  that  the uncertainty should be . rem edied.  PREVIOUS CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION  Last year,  the House Energy and Com merce Subcommittee on Transportation and  Hazardous Materials conducted a  full day of  hearings,  taking  testimony  from all sides on  this  issue--government,  environmental  groups, borrowers, and the financial commu nity. The Senate Banking Committee  con ducted a hearing as well during the summer  months.  Reviewing the testimony, I note that the En vironmental Protection Agency and  the wit ness for the environmental community agreed  that uncertainty should be avoided. The EPA  agreed  to promulgate a rule  that would ad dress the issue. A draft rule has been put for ward, but  interagency  review and comment  continue  to delay  its adoption at  this  time.  Moreover, a rule alone cannot provide ultimate  certainty.  It is noteworthy that the comments  of many of  the agencies seeking  input  in cluded calls for legislative action.  REVIEW OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION  The EPA has done a good job with the draft  rule. They have attempted to balance compet ing  interests and, overall,  their effort adds a  great deal of certainty to the issue. The bill I  am introducing today in large measure tracks  the EPA approach. Indeed, if this bill were en acted  today,  the EPA rule could be promul gated virtually as currently drafted. However,  legislation is necessary to give statutory guid ance, to address a few items omitted by EPA,  and to give certainty to EPA's efforts.  The current approach of Superfund in defin ing owner or operator is retained  in this bill,  but broken down into component parts to pro vide greater clarity as to the precise nature of  the existing exemption.  lndicia of ownership is defined to include in terests for the purpose of securing repayment  of a loan. Here you can contemplate a tradi tional secured  loan  from a bank,  insurance  firm, or government agency. Next,  the terms  ""payment of an  indebtedness"" and ""perform ance of an obligation"" are specified. Among  transactions included are mechanics liens, and  lease financing, such as lease financing trans actions on a net lease basis of the type set  forth  in Federal depository  institution regula tions. Also covered are situations such as gov ernment and private guaranty programs,  for  example, mortgage insurance, packaged mort gages in the secondary market, for example,  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities, and  government rights,  for example,  reversionary  rights in property when a party does not meet  obligations that are part of a government con tract. Finally,  rights acquired  in protecting a  security interest, such as during a workout or  foreclosure, fall within the liability exclusion. It  would be  indeed  ironic and contrary  to  the  goals of the original exemption if lenders had  a right, but could not avail themselves of ap propriate  remedies without voiding  their ex emption.  The key phrase of participating in manage ment  is also defined. Looking  to  the  recent  court case of Bergsoe, which the EPA cited  favorably, and rejecting the Fleet dicta, the bill  ",1991
311,331,5,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President, we have all  applauded  the end of the war in the  Persian Gulf-a war which, under the  leadership of President Bush, was ad mirably  executed  by  the  coalition  forces. The men and women who fought  for us, and their families, deserve our  enduring gratitude.  But there is more work to do as we  grapple with the intricacies of the cur rent situation in the Middle East and  as we attempt to ensure the establish ment of a stable and lasting peace in  this strategically vital area.  During the prelude to hostilities in  the gulf, as well as during the actual  fighting, there was a great deal of le gitimate concern about whether Sad dam Hussein would employ chemical or  biological weapons, as well as specula tion about whether he had been able to  produce a nuclear weapon. Thankfully,  none of these fears were founded. Simi larly, Saddam Hussein's Scud missiles  proved  to be overrated as strategic  weapons and were not militarily sig nificant in the face of Patriot missile  defenses.  The  Congress  and  the  executive  branch have devoted a great deal of the  time and effort to establishing controls  on  the proliferation of nuclear weap ons, chemical and biological weapons,  and ballistic missiles. The success thus  far of such efforts can be debated, and  there is obviously further work to be  done. What cannot be debated is an al most total lack of coordinated effort  both at home and abroad on limiting  proliferation of conventional weapons.  We need to do something about that.  After all, Saddam Hussein would never  have become the offensive threat that  he did if he had not been able to ac quire  thousands  of  tanks,  artillery  pieces,  armored  personnel  carriers,  antiship missiles and other powerful  conventional weapons.  For me, a particular point of imme diate concern is the disposition of the  arms left behind in Iraq and Kuwait. I  hope we learn a lesson from history. In  the last war in which this country was  involved, many weapons  and  over  150,000  tons of ammunition were  left  behind in Vietnam. Some of this may  have rusted away in the  jungles, but  much of it has been set out on the ta bles  of  the  hawkers  in  the  inter national arms bazaar,  to be delivered  to the highest bidder, and has turned  up in countries as far away as El Sal vador. We cannot allow a similar situa tion  to occur with  the weapons  in volved in the Persian Gulf conflict. The  disposition of these armaments cannot  be haphazard or go unmonitored. I have  heard reports  that Soviet arms cap tured in Iraq and Kuwait will be given  to Syria and that other weapons left  behind by coalition forces will be di vided up by the Gulf States. Who  is  going to make these decisions? What  types and amounts of weapons will be  involved? Will  there be a careful ac counting? These decisions need to be  considered carefully. Let's not repeat  the mistakes of the past and provide  more material  for  the black market  arms bazaars or, inadvertently start a  new  round  in  the Middle East arms  race.  The problem of managing stockpiles  of old or surplus arms is not unique to  the Persian Gulf, but exists elsewhere  in the world. What, for example, will be  done with  the stockpiles of weapons  and ammunition  left behind  in Ger many by the Soviet and former East  German armies? The problem is a glob al one, and will  require coordinated,  multilateral efforts to effectively com bat it.

313,357,5,Mr. NUNN.," My remarks will be very  brief, and I do not want  to have  to  move to table until the Senator from  Arkansas has finished his remarks, but  I will move to table at the appropriate  time.  The  reason  is very  clear. We  are  going to have to ward off amendments  on this bill if we are going to get it  passed and if we are going to get it in  law. As unfortunate as it is, we are in  a position of having to table or try to  table, ask our colleagues  to vote  to  table  good  amendments  as well  as  those with which we might not agree.  I happened to be a cosponsor of this  amendment, I believe, when it was in troduced as a bill, so I  think it is a  good amendment. But if it goes on this  package, it is going  to greatly com plicate the procedure here and we are  going  to have a  lot of other amend ments. If we are not able to table the  first two or three of these amendments,  we will probably have 15 or 20 amend ments before the afternoon is over and  the evening.  Of course, we have a group of Sen ators leaving for the Middle East at 5  o'clock this afternoon. We have other  business  to  take care of.  So  rel uc tan tly, even though I agree with the  amendment and I  think it has merit  and I hope it can be put on another  bill,  I will at  the appropriate  time  move to table it.  ",1991
314,357,5,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, although  with great reluctance I also have to op pose the proposal by the Senator from  Arkansas. I  think his motives in this  are excellent. I wish I could support  him. But let me  just briefly address  what happened on the task force and  why some of these  things had  to be  dropped out.  We had many considerations. First  and foremost were the dollars involved.  One of the estimates on the proposal by  the Senator from Arkansas I believe is  $120 million.  I do not know whether  that is still valid or not. I think that is  one we had quoted by, I believe, CBO  originally.  I do not know how  they  made that estimate. So maybe that one  is not valid. But we had  to run the  gamut of a  lot of different organiza tions. One was CBO, which was first to  get an estimate on it. Next was OMB.  Then we had to check what the House  was going to do on  these things too.  That was not the end though, because  the bill still has to go to conference.  We also had to consider what the De fense Department's wishes were.  Let me just run through very briefly  some of the bills that did not make it  into  the  task  force  and  leadership  package.  We  had  a  proposal  by  Senator  McCAIN and me to equalize unemploy ment  compensation  for  separating  military personnel who are only allo cated 13 weeks of unemployment com pensation, to start only after a month  after they are out, as opposed to their  civilian counterparts who rate 26 weeks  of unemployment compensation which  starts the first week after they are out  of work. There were some objections to  that on cost grounds.  I will not belabor that except to say  I very much wanted that bill to be in cluded because I  thought it was pre eminently fair, and I wanted to address  it with  legislation early on.  I  think  plain fairness demands that be done.  But we are deferring  that to  later  consideration because of its broad ap plication into the future, and because  it does not just apply to Desert Storm  specifically. So we are deferring that.  I  also had a  proposal  for  certain  waivers for medical personnel and for  language specialists regarding certifi cation requirements for certain special  pays for people  that are being dealt  with unfairly. That was not included in  the package.  Granted, with  the Bumpers amend ment we can get into SBA and give  small business a  little broader scope,  but that still does not necessarily en compass all  small businesses  in  the  country.  We had another one. Senator SHELBY  wanted penalty-free withdrawals from  IRA's. We could not put that in. There  were technicalities on that one as far  as conferencing with the House. So we  will take that one up later.  We had another bill  introduced by  Senator McCAIN  and me  that would  have increased the Federal income tax  exemption cap on officers from $500 to  $1,000 a month. Once again we deferred  that one.  Senator SANFORD had one on funds to  go to FEMA to support the McKinney  Act,  food and shelter programs. I do  not know whether he is going to ad dress that again here today. That one  once again was one that could be de ferred, and was because there were ob jections to it and uncertainty as to ex actly how much it would cost.  Senator MIKULSKI had a bill-unfor tunately we got it pretty late in the  procesi:r-and she made a statement on  the floor yesterday. She is concerned  about the pay lost by Federal employ ees who were  activated, whose  pay  while they are in the military is going  to be less than their pay would have  been had they still been in their civil  service  jobs. She wanted  to equalize  that pay.  Once again that one was put off to be  consider later. If the Congress is going  to do things like what Senator MIKUL SKI proposed, and like  the SBA pro posal by our distinguished colleague  from Arkansas, then how about others  in civilian life who were activated, who  ",1991
315,370,5,Mr. THURMOND.," I recognize that the  Department of Energy was authorized  last year to begin the process of stop ping  all  rainwater  runoff before  it  leaves  the property.

The water is no more  dangerous than any water that runs off  the Rocky Mountains-all of which  contains radioactive contamination to  some degree. But the local population  is in great alarm because of the fear  that  some  future  rainstorm might  bring pollutants from Rocky Flats into  the reservoir, as it has in the past even  though no past accidents have  made that reservoir water unsafe.

As  a  final note,  I would also ask  unanimous  consent  that  an  article  which appeared in last Sunday's New  York Times appear in the record imme diately following my remarks. If there  is any doubt that we face enormous- and enormously expensive liabilities- in the cleanup of the nuclear weapons  complex, this article should dispel that  notion.

Now the Energy Department has a new prob lem. In some cases it is violating not only  the laws but also the agreements.  Environmentalists say a distressing pat tern is emerging, casting doubt on how the  aging complex of home production plants can  ever be cleaned up.  The most pressing case is at a 37-year-old  uranium processing plant at Fernald, Ohio,  20 miles northwest of Cincinnati. In an al most unprecedented action against another  Federal entity,  the Environmental Protec tion Agency  is trying to collect a  fine of  about $300,000 from the Energy Department.  The  fine  is not for environmental crimes,  which include releasing poisonous and radio active wastes  through  faulty  filters  or  unfiltered vents for years and dumping liquid  wastes into lagoons that leaked into local  waterways. The fine is for failing to live up  to a 1990 agreement with the E.P.A. on what  studies the department would carry out and  what remedial actions it would take.  The fine is not much compared with a de partment budget of $17.7 billion this year,  but  the embarrassment  level  is high.  ""It  shows to us taxpayers that the agency that's  being fined is not complying with the law,  that they are outlaws and  they should be  watched,"" said Shira Flax, a lobbyist for the  Sierra Club.  While  the department agreed less than a  year ago that it would pay fines if it missed  deadlines. It is now arguing that one Federal  agency fining another makes no sense. On  Friday-the deadline for the department to  pay up or appeal its case to the E.P.A. chief,  William K. Reilly-it was given a 10-day ex tension.  Leo P. Duffy, the department's top official  on environmental safety and health,  said  fines would be appropriate against a com mercial operator that was gaining undue ad vantage in the business world by violating  environmental rules. But he said fines were  not helpful if they would reduce the amount  of money available  to his department for  cleanup.  Fernald is not the only problem. Two years  ago the Energy Department agreed with the  state of Washington and  the E.P.A. on a  schedule for stabilizing the most hazardous  wastes,  the highly  radioactive  liquids  in  tanks at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation  near Richland. But last month the depart ment unilaterally announced a delay of one  to two years. The state's Governor, Booth  Gardner, said he was ""astounded.""  NO TECHNICAL TOOTH FAIRY  Mr. Duffy said that it had proved harder  than expected  to  take  samples  from  the  tanks to determine what was in them, and it  made little sense to build a treatment sys tem before  the engineers were certain of  what  they would be  treating. ""There's no  technical tooth fairy that's going to come  along and solve these problems,"" he said.  Last week, James D. Watkins, the Energy  Secretary  told  the House Appropriations  Committee that without a supplemental ap propriation, ""I won't be able to carry out my  duties"" at the Rocky Flats plant near Den ver where a cleanup agreement was signed  with Colorado two years ago. But in other  cases, say critics, the department is violat ing agreements because it failed to ask for  enough money to get the job done. In the  Fernald case, part of the fine is for failing to  carry out diagnostic studies on pollution.  Because the studies have not been done, the  department does not even know what reme dial action will be needed and what to ask  Congress for.  ""This is the Federal system learning how  to work,"" said Susan Wilshire, a policy ana lyst at JK Research Associates, of Hamilton,  Mass., a Department of Energy subcontrac tor that is trying to develop a system to de cide which plants to clean up first.  The bomb makers, who for years plowed  ahead and produced whatever weapons na tional security demanded, with scant atten tion to much of anything else, appear now to  have taken the same can-do attitude toward  cleaning up the mess they created. But they  may  lack the ability. The Office of Tech nology Assessment, in a report released last  month,  said ""progress  in cleaning up  the  waste and contamination at  the weapons  complex is being hampered by a paucity of  data and qualified personnel, inadequate ef forts  to assess possible off-site health im pacts, lack of ready technical solutions, and  public skepticism about government agency  decisions. 1  ""Even the meaning of cleanup is not fully  understood,'' the report said.  MOVING SLOWLY  It has been a long, circular journey for the  Energy Department and its predecessor, the  Atomic Energy Commission. First the bomb  makers insisted that they were not subject  to state regulation, or even the regulation of  other Federal  agencies. But  the Federal  courts  ruled  in  the mid-1980's,  in  cases  brought by  environmentalists,  that  since  Congress had not explicitly exempted the de partment, it was subject to Federal regula tion.  In 1985 Joseph Herrington, then Secretary  of Energy, said that his department would  obey  the  laws and would sign agreements  with  environmental  regulators  specifying  schedules for coming into compliance, much  as a private company would. But the depart ment moved extremely slowly, maintaining  that among other problems  it could not  make commitments that would require ap propriations from Congress, because the ap propriations might not be forthcoming.

319,396,5,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to rise today in support of the  nomination of Lamar Alexander to be  Secretary of Education.  As a former teacher, athletic coach,  and  county  superintendent  of  edu cation, I am vitally interested in the  direction of education in this country,  particularly in times such as now-the  1990's. While the face of education has  undergone changes  to meet new de mands, one thing has remained clear,  and that is-nothing is more important  than  a  sound  education  to  prepare  Americans  to meet  the challenges of  everyday  living. Simply stated, edu cation provides  the  solid  foundation  needed to face the challenges of today.  Mr. President, the credentials and ac complishments of our current nominee  are no secret-a former Governor of  Tennessee and member of the Presi dent's Education Policy Advisory Com mittee, Lamar Alexander has been ac tively involved in addressing education  issues at the State and National level.  As the former president of the Univer sity of Tennessee, he understands the  needs and concerns of educators and  students. He has worked in the trench es and knows from a practical point of  view what works and does not work.  Lamar Alexander brings to the posi tion of Secretary experience in several  different areas of life. He has served as  a law clerk, reporter for a newspaper, a  Senate campaign coordinator, a  legis lative assistant, a White House staff  assistant, a practicing attorney, an au thor, and as a director and adviser to  several companies.  Mr. President, this nominee is also a  past chairman of  the National Gov ernors' Association, a  former  law re view editor at the New York University  School of Law, and a Phi Beta Kappa  graduate of Vanderbilt University. His  hands-on experience in education and  his  broad  background  in  numerous  other areas well qualify him for the po sition of Secretary of Education. We  are fortunate to have a man of his tal ent as the President's nominee.  He  is a man of ability, dedication,  character, and intellect. I am pleased  to support him for the position of Sec retary of Education.  ",1991

332,396,5,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased to announce to my colleagues  the  release  of  the  so-called  Bir mingham Six, a group of Irish nation als wrongly convicted in 1975 for hor rific bombings committed by the Pro visional Irish Republican Army. Ear lier  today  in London's Old Bailey  Courthouse,  the  six  men-Hugh  Callaghan, Patrick Hill, Gerald Hunter,  Richard Mcllkenny, William  Power,  and John Walker-were set free after  the Court of Appeal reversed their con victions.  A year ago, I introduced a resolution  in the Senate-cosponsored by 18 of my  colleagues-that called on the British  Government to reopen the case of these  six men. Within weeks,  the British  Home Secretary at  the  time, David  Waddington, ordered a new police in quiry into the case. In August of last  year, the Government referred the case  to the Court of Appeals.  As I discussed in detail in my floor  statement last year, the men were con victed on unreliable evidence that was  discredited after their trial. The courts  in Britain have finally recognized these  facts. I am pleased that justice, though  long delayed, has now been done.  For over 16 years,  these men have  suffered a gross injustice, languishing  in prison for crimes they did not com mit. Thankfully, their long ordeal has  ended. but nothing can compensate the  men for pain that they-and their fam ilies-have endured for so long.  The case of the Birmingham Six is  not  unique.  Erroneous  convictions  occur in every society. But this case  has  taken on greater significance be cause of its ramifications for Northern  Ireland, where few Catholics have con fidence  in the administration of jus tice. Such views are warranted. To day's verdict marks the third time in 2  years that IRA suspects have been re leased after  it was  discovered  that  ",1991
333,448,5,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to introduce today legislation  to  provide  additional  life  inslirance  benefits  for members of  the Armed  Forces who die as a  result of hostile  fire.  The recent war in the Persian Gulf  was 1an enormous victory for the U.S.  and coalition military forces .. The su perior  leadership, superior equipment  and superior military personnel pos sessed by coalition forces was an im portant factor in ensuring not only a  quick victory but also one  in which  casualties were kept  to a minimum.  But as General Schwarzkopf said, the  minimal number of casualties does not  seem to be a miracle to the families of  those young men and women who lost  their live..s while serving their country.  I am proud that in the wake of Oper ation Desert Storm my colleagues have  moved expeditiously in providing addi tional military and veterans benefits  to  those who  serve  in  the military.  Last week I introduced legislation to  pay a death gratuity of up to $200,000 to  the survivors of military personnel who  lost  their  life while participating  in  Operation Desert Shield.  In addition,  my bill S. 587, would have increased the  maximum  amount  of  servicemen's  group life insurance [SGLI] to $200,000  for military personnel who are killed  while in a combat zone.  I am pleased  that  the Senate has  passed legislation to increase the maxi mum amount of servicemen's group life  insurance from $50,000 to $100,000. How ever, I believe that we should not im pose such a  low cap on the maximum  amount of life insurance available to  military service members.  I  recognize  that  the  increase  to  $100,000 was based on the average size  of life insurance coverage in the civil ian sector. However,  there 0,re many  service personnel who would like to ob tain additional coverage above $100,000.  For those members who have a family  and more than one dependent $100,000  simply is not enough money to ensure  that their family is taken care of or  that their children will receive a col lege education.  The  legislation  I  am  introducing  today would provide supplemental cov erage under SGLI to provide for double  indemnity coverage  to  service mem bers who die as a result of hostile fire.  The bill would cover deaths of service  members who die as a result of hostile  fire from any source and would include  military members who are serving in  dangerous  parts  of  the world  even  though  they are not declared  to be  combat zones.

Res.  95.  Joint  resolution des ignating October  1991  as  ""National  Breast Cancer Awareness Month"";  to  the Committee on the Judiciary.  NIHAN,  NATIONAL BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH   ",1991
334,448,5,Mr.  PELL.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today to introduce a joint resolution to  designate October 1991  as  ""National  Breast Cancer Awareness Month."" I am  delighted that 27 of my colleagues have  joined as original cosponsors, proving  that  the  fight against breast cancer  has strong bipartisan support  in  the  Senate.  Mr. President, setting aside a time of  the year to learn about breast cancer is  really nothing new. For several years,  health  advocates  have  taken  upon  themselves  the  task of setting aside  time in the month of October to bring  attention to this frightening disease.  In cold, hard statistics, the numbers  are quite  staggering.  In 1991, breast  cancer  is expected to strike an esti mated  175,000  women,  25,000  more  women than in 1990. And 1991 will see  about 44,500 women die from  the dis ease-an estimated 500 more women  than in 1990. And breast cancer, which  is already the second leading cause of  cancer death among women,  is likely  to increase further as our population  ages, since a woman's risk of develop ing breast cancer increases as she ages.  Mr. President, many people do not  realize  that breast  cancer can  also  strike men. Though their numbers are  fewer,  their plight is no  less serious:  this year alone, about 900 men will de velop breast cancer; in addition, about  300 men will die from the disease.  In my own State of Rhode Island, the  incidence  of breast  cancer  has  in creased. The American Cancer Society  estimates  that  breast  cancer  will  strike about 1,000 Rhode Island women  in 1991, a  full 11-percent higher than  last year's estimate. Fortunately for  Rhode  Islanders,  those  same  figures  show a decline  in our State's death  rate;  in 1991, about 250 Rhode  Island  women are expected to die of the dis ease, about 9-percent less than were ex pected to die in 1990.  Mr. President, with regard to the in creased  incidence  of breast  cancer,  Rhode Island reflects a national trend.  In 1990, it was estimated that 1 in every  10 women would develop breast cancer  at some point in her lifetime. Current  estimates  indicate  that 1 in every 9  women will develop breast cancer. We  know the numbers are increasing, but  we don't know why. The cause of breast  cancer continues to elude us.  Unfortunately, Rhode Island's death  rate is not representative of a national  trend. In fact, the national death rate  from breast cancer has remained rel atively stable.  That is the bad news.  But  there  is good  news  too,  and  Rhode Island's statistics reflect it: we  can significantly reduce breast cancer  mortality  through  early  detection:  self-examination, clinical examination  by a qualified health care provider, and  screening mammography. The ~umbers  illustrate this best: 50 years ago, the 5year survival rate for localized breast  cancer was 78 percent; now it is over 90  percent. The American Cancer Society  estimates that the use of a combina tion of early detection procedures can  boost  the survival  rate  for  localized  breast cancer to almost 100 percent.  And yet, Mr. President, despite  the  proven success of early  intervention,  many women do not know how to self examine, and some are afraid to do so.  Some women do not seek a screening  mammogram because they are afraid,  either of the procedure itself, or of the  diagnosis it might reveal. Still others  do not seek a screening mammogram  because of lack of access or cost, or be cause they simply don't know the vital  importance of mammography screen ing.  ",1991
335,474,5,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President, I wish to  commend Secretary Sullivan for his re marks yesterday, focusing attention on  the  national  emergency  caused  by  youth homicide. According to the Cen ter  for Disease Control, homicide  is  now  the  leading cause of death  for  black males between the ages of 15 and  19. Both victims and perpetrators are  adolescents: A chilling fact, indeed.  Guns  figure  prominently  in  such  tragic deaths. As Sullivan pointed out,  a black male teenager is 11 times more  likely to die from a gunshot than his  white counterpart. And death by fire arm for all teens increased over 40 per cent from 1984 through 1988, according  to the National Center for Health Sta tistics. Last year, I addressed a part of  this problem by sponsoring  the Gun  Free Schools Act. But we need to do  much more to combat the proliferation  of guns  in our Nation's schools and  streets.  As chairman of the newly created Ju venile Justice Subcommittee, I intend  to take a good, hard look at this entire  crisis. I look forward to working with  Secretary Sullivan in efforts to untan gle causes, repercussions, and possible  remedies for youth violence and pre mature death. While we may not nec essarily agree with all of Secretary  Sullivan's conclusions here, I know my  colleagues on the Judiciary Committee  and in the Senate as a whole share an  admiration  for his obvious  concern,  compassion, and commitment.  Mr. President, I ask that the Wash ington Post story describing Secretary  Sullivan's remarks be printed  in  the  RECORD.  The article follows:  [From the Washington Post, Mar. 14, 1991)  GUNS AND YOUTH: HHS'S GRIM STATISTICS  (By Paul Taylor)  More teenage boys die from gunshots than  from all natural causes combined, and a  black male teenager is 11 times more likely  to be murdered with a gun  than a white  counterpart, Health  and Human Services  Secretary Louis W. Sullivan disclosed last  night in a speech that linked firearms, race  and family breakdown.  ""Do you realize that the leading killer of  young black males is young black males?""  Sullivan said at Hampton University, a his torically black school in Hampton, Va. ""As a  black man and a father of three, this reality  shakes me to the core of my being.""  Sullivan cited a study, to be released today  by HHS's National Center for Health Statis tics, showing that:  Between 1984 and 1988,  the firearm death  rate among  teenagers  increased by more  than 40 percent-to the point where, for the  first time, the firearm death rate for both  black and white male teenagers exceeded the  mortality rate from all natural causes. In  1988, a black male age 15 to 19 was nearly  three times more likely to die from a bullet  than a disease, and a fatal gunshot was 11  percent more likely than a fatal illness for a  white male teenager.  A total of 1,641 Americans age 15 to 19 were  victims of homicide by firearm in 1988, a figure that included 955 black males, 453 white  males, 98 black females and 97 white females.  The number of firearm deaths-a more com prehensive fig11re that includes accidents and  suicides as well as homicides-was 3,226 for  that age group, including 1,634 white males,  1,118 black males, 273 white females and 116  black females.  Unintentional  injuries  are  the  leading  cause of death for all persons age 15 to 34,  with motor vehicle  injuries s.ccounting for  two-thirds of the total. Homicide and suicide  are the second and third leading causes, fol lowed by diseases such as cancer, leukemia  and heart ailments. However, among black  males age 15 to 34, homicide is the leading  cause of death, and firearms are implicated  in 88 percent of these homicides.  ""During every 100 hours on our streets we  lose three times more young men than were  killed in 100 hours of ground war in the Per sian Gulf,"" Sullivan said. ""Where are  the  yellow ribbons of hope and  remembrance?  ... Where is the concerted, heartfelt com mitment to supporting the children of this  war?""  Sullivan shied from any discussions of gun  control. However, Rep. Edward F. Feighan  (D-Ohio) said, ""I can only hope that the in formation  the secretary has presented will  persuade some in his administration to sup port handgun control."" Feighan is lead spon sor of a bill-opposed by the Bush adminis tration-that would mandate waiting periods  for handgun purchases.  Sullivan  spoke  to a  conference on  the  black family and he used the firearm report  for some sharp commentary about family  life.  ''The collapse of the American family in  the past few decades is historically unprece dented  in  the U.S.,  and possibly  in  the  world,"" he said. ""Nowhere is this trend more  apparent  than  in  the  black  community,  where 86 percent of children spend part of  their childhood living in a mother-only fam ily.  ""Some argue that the high rate of single  parenthood has not adversely affected our  children. But, sadly, the research does not  bear them out.  . . . Study after study has  shown that children from single-parent fami lies are five times more likely to be poor and  twice as likely to drop out of school.  : ..  They are also more likely to be involved in  criminal activity, to abuse drugs and alco hol,  to  suffer  ill health,  and  to become  trapped in welfare dependency.""  The secretary proposed no new government  programs to address these matters. ""I be lieve the federal government's role should be  to encourage and assist the spread of local  indigenous"" community organizations that  combat crime and try to restore families, he  said.  Sullivan sought to use his office as a bully  pulpit, as he has  in his crusade against  smoking. He called for a return to a ""culture  of character,"" which he described as ""a cul ture in which parents invest time and atten tion in their children, and the children of a  neighborhood; a culture  in which children  growing up without a father are a small mi nority.""   MANIFESTO FOR THE NEW SOUTH  AFRICA   ",1991
336,474,5,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, the retir ing South African Ambassador, Ambas sador Piet Koornhof, sent me a copy of  a manifesto  that President F.W.  de  Klerk referred to in his recent speech  to the Parliament.  Let me first express my appreciation  to Ambassador Koornhof, with whom I  have had. the privilege of working, for  sending me this manifesto. And let me  add that those of us who have had the  opportunity  to work with him wish  him the best as he returns to South Af rica with a good understanding of the  concerns and desires of the people of  the United States for freedom and jus tice and opportunity for all citizens in  South Africa, and for a good working  relationship with the United States.  The manifesto is another indication  of the positive steps forward that are  being  taken  in South Africa. This  manifesto, the concrete steps called for  by President de Klerk, the greater co operation between Nelson Mandela of  the African National Congress  and  Chief Buthelezi-all of these things are indications that, despite some real  problems that South Africa still has to  overcome, they are moving in the right  direction, and we applaud that move ment.  I ask to insert into the RECORD  the  ""Manifesto for the New South Africa""  that President de Klerk referred to.  The manifesto follows:  MANIFESTO FOR THE NEW SOUTH AFRICA  We, as South Africans from all walks of  life, associating ourselves with the goodwill  and the shared desire for justice, peace and  freedom among the majority of our fellow  South Africans, declareThat a just and fair New South Africa, free  from apartheid, requires a strong South Afri can nation,  That  there  exists,  therefore, an urgent  need for  the leaders of all our people and  communities  to come together to shape a  mutually acceptable new  constitution  for  our country,  That such a constitution should be based  on the rule of law and lay the foundation for  a nation dedicated to justice, democracy and  freedom for all, through the pursuit of par ticipation, peace, progress, and prosperity.  That Christian values and universally ac cepted civilised norms and standards should  be maintained in South Africa together with  recognition and protection of  freedom of  faith and worship,  That all the people of our country should  take part in this endeavour,  That we, to this end, subscribe to the fol lowing:  PARTICIPATION: A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC  POLITICAL SYSTEM  We commit ourselves to the creation of a  free  and  democratic  political  system  in  South Africa, in which:  All people shall be free in this, their coun try of birth;  All the people of our land shall participate  fully at all levels of government on the basis  of universal adult franchise;  The government of the country shall at all  times be based upon the consent of the gov erned;  All people shall be equal before the law,  and shall enjoy equal rights regardless of  race, colour, sex or creed;  The rights of all individuals and minorities  defined on a non-racial basis shall be ade quately protected in the constitution and in  ",1991
337,513,5,Mr. ORTON.," Mr. Speaker, now that the war  in the Persian Gulf is over, pundits and Mon day-morning quarterbacks have sprouted all  over Washington this spring like so many daf fodils. I want to take this opportunity to share  with you the remarks of the Honorable DANTE  FASCELL who recognized the threat to U.S. na tional security posed by Saddam Hussein last  fall, and who later led the difficult but success ful effort  in this body  to authorize the Presi dent's use of force in the Persian Gulf.  As  a  freshman Member,  I  appreciated  Chairman F ASCELL's leadership in what was a  time of profound soul-searching for me. With  that  in mind,  I would  like  to urge my col leagues to take a minute and consider a re cent address by  the  chairman which  con templates the shape of peace taking form in  the Middle East today.  The address follows:  REMARKS OF HON. DANTE B. F ASCELL BEFORE  THE NAPLES COUNCIL ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS,  NAPLES BEACH, FL  Good  evening-as always,  it  is both a  pleasure and honor for me to appear before  you. You know, the other day, Dick Cheney  was briefing Members of Congress on the so  called ""end game"" of the Gulf War. He  in formed Members of the truly remarkable, in deed astonishing performance of both U.S.  forces and  that of the allied coalition  in  bringing the war with Iraq to an end. He also  related a story about elements of the U.S.  VII Corps that took Iraqi POW's who upon  leaving their bunker said, ""God Bless George  Bush."" Dick then told us, ""these PO W's were  obviously  members  of  the  Republican  Guards.""  Seriously though, what I have come to dis cuss with you this evening is the Congres sional perspective on the most serious issue  that can ever confront this great nation of  ours. That subject,  the  issue of war and  peace is, and remains as relevant a subject  than ever before. I say this because now that  we have won the war, it is absolutely essen tial that we win the peace as well.  SUPPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT  As Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, I was a member of the Congres sional leadership consultative group that the  President brought in on a regular and rou tine basis to discuss Iraq's naked, blatant  and illegal seizure and occupation of Kuwait.  During the initial course of these consulta tions we were all hopeful that a peaceful res olution  to  this  crisis  could  be  achieved  through both diplomatic means and eco nomic sanctions.  On October 1st of last year, these consulta tions  resulted  in Congressional  action House Joint Resolution 658-which was craft ed by Members of both sides of the aisle and  among the highest representatives of the administration. Simply stated that resolution  affirmed and congratulated the President on  the actions he had  taken with respect  to  Iraq's aggression  in assembling an  inter national consensus on Iraq's occupation of  Kuwait. This resolution also specified that  both Congress and  the  executive had an  equal role on the issue of war.  At that time, it was our mutual hope that  Saddam Hussein would wake up, and smell  the coffee.  It was our hope  that Saddam  would realize that Americans share a consen sus of opinion to our democratic and Con stitutional principles and are supportive of  our traditional role in opposing illegal and  naked aggression be  it against Poland  in  1939, Pearl Harbor in 1941, or Kuwait in 1990.  IRAQI INTRANSIGENCE  As  stated,  those were our hopes  for  a  peaceful resolution of this crisis. But Sad dam Hussein never budged. Diplomatic en deavors of all sorts were tried. World leaders,  kings,  the Arab League,  the Soviet Union,  the Pope, the Secretary General of the Unit ed Nations, the Secretary of State, and yes,  indeed even  the Iranians endeavored for a  peaceful solution. And in the end, each and  every one of those efforts met with greater  Iraqi  intransigence and bellicosity. All of  those efforts failed. And, while those efforts  were going in, Iraq continued in its brutal  and systematic rape of Kuwait. They contin ued  to  reinforce  their  troops  in Kuwait,  while at the same time turning Kuwait into  an Iraqi fortress of occupation.  It was under these circumstances that the  President again came to Congress to seek au thorization to use military force  to imple ment those United Nations Security Council  Resolutions that were pertinent to this cri sis. I supported the President in this regard  because of my convictions that all peaceful  means toward ending this crisis had been ex hausted. I supported the President in this re gard because of my long-standing belief that  naked aggression cannot be  tolerated. Con gressional support-both Democratic and Re publican-to authorize the use of force was  embodied in Public law 102-1.  This was one of the more difficult decisions  of my Congressional career but I made this  decision  in  the solemn  judgment  that we  were left with no other alternatives. I know  this judgment to be correct as the evidence  of Iraqi horrors continues to mount. We now  know better than ever before that Iraq com pletely plundered its former ally. This rape  was conducted in such proportions so as to  defy any civilized imagination.  We know that Iraq completely sacked Ku wait. We know that Iraq killed babies by  taking them off their incubators which were  sent back to Iraq. We know that Iraq sys tematically tortured the Kuwaiti people. We  know that Iraq killed innocent civilians. We  know  that Iraq committed environmental  terrorism. We know that Iraq endeavored to  fray at the edges of the U.S.-led coalition  through its missile attacks against Israel.  We know that Iraq adopted a scorched earth  policy when the end was near and finally, we  know that Iraq's leadership-especially Sad dam Hussein-did  so with  no  regard  to  human life be it Kuwaiti or sadly enough,  even his own people. Even more sadly, I am  sure that we have only just begun to scratch  at the veneer of these and other yet to be  discovered Iraqi atrocities.  THE AFTERMATH  America went to war against Iraq along  with some thirty other partners in the mili tary coalition. Our objectives in this endeav or were straightforward. Simply stated, the  U.S.-led coalition sought to: (1) preserve the  territorial integrity and economic and polit ical security of Saudi Arabia; (2) seek the  immediate withdrawal of all  Iraqi  forces  from Kuwait; (3) seek the peaceful restora tion of the legitimate Kuwaiti government;  and (4) provide for the protection of Amer ican citizens abroad. We sought these objec tives  peacefully  and we  prosecuted  and  achieved them through war. As I stated ear lier, however, now that we have won the war,  we must strive to win the peace.  SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVES  In the short-term winning the peace will  require Iraqi compliance with each of the  U.N. mandates. This process is currently un derway.  It will also  require Iraqi repatri ation of all coalition POW's and other de tainees. It will also require Iraqi cooperation  on the disarming of all land and sea mines  throughout  the Kuwait  theater  of oper ations. It will require an end to all missile  attacks on  third world countries. Each of  these efforts are also being negotiated but  much more must be done.  An organized plan must be devised to pro vide humanitarian assistance to this strife torn region. We must assess how the global  community, indeed the allied coalition will  address these needs. We-the global commu nity-must prevent the outbreak of disease  in  the Kuwaiti  and  Iraqi  civilian  popu lations. We must seek the solutions to the  environmental disaster that has struck the  Persian Gulf and Kuwait  itself. We must  confront these and other issues systemati cally. The rebuilding of Kuwait-oil fires, oil  refinery capacities, roads, power plants, de salination plants, sewage facilities, hospitals  and housing-will take years but our prior ities in the short-term must focus on  the  human equation. This rebuilding process is  underway and must proceed with haste. In  this regard,  the Kuwaitis are anxious  for  U.S.-led efforts. Indeed, in this regard, some  70% of the first SI billion in reconstruction  contracts have been awarded to U.S. firms.  LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES  While short-term objectives are both log ical and  imminent,  the single most  long term  objective  that  I  believe we must  achieve in the wake of this crisis rests in our  mutual efforts  in bringing about a nego tiated end to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Like  the Cold War, this forty-three year conflict  must be brought to an end-a peaceful and  negotiated end.  When I last checked, more than 30 percent  of all world-wide arms sales were to the Mid dle East. Think about that-more than 30  percent of the global  trade  in arms takes  place in the Middle East. In 1987,  the total  worldwide trade in arms exceeded S56 billion.  In 1988, the total worldwide trade in arms ex ceeded $49 billion.

Last  year,  the House  passed this legislation as part of the  National  Service Act  but  it was  stripped out in conference. This year,  volunteer protection has the support of  the House and that of the YMCA,  the  Women's Clubs, the Farm Bureau, the  Air Force Association, Big Brother/Big  Sister, and many, many others; 250 na tional organizations depend on volun teers in all.  Lawsuits against volunteers are  a  real problem, Madam Speaker, the vol unteer organizations know  this prob lem. Twenty percent of association di rectors report it has hurt recruitment.  The States know it is a problem. A  number have already enacted volunteer  protection laws. The President knows  it is a problem. He recently released a  model volunteer protection law. Only  this Congress has failed  to recognize  the problem by not enacting the Volun teer Protection Act.  The act is simple. It channels  the  lawsuit from the volunteer to the orga nization itself. It protects the injured  and supports volunteers.  I urge all Members to, once again, co sponsor this measure and get behind  this Nation's volunteers, not in their  way.  TRIBUTE  TO  ROBERT  LEWIS  ASACK,  DIRECTOR,  OFFICE OF  AVIATION  OPERATIONS,  U.S.  CUSTOMS SERVICE  (Mr. ENGLISH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
339,526,5,Mr. ENGLISH.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to pay tribute to a good friend  and a stalwart in our country's war on  drugs, Mr. Robert L. Asack. It is with  regret that I stand here today to an nounce  his  retirement  after having  served his country both as a naval avi ator and Federal drug agent for a total  of 27 years. Following 7 years of service  in  the U.S. Navy, Mr. Asack briefly  ventured into the private sector before  reentering the Federal service as a sky  marshal in the early 1970's. Thus began  an illustrious civil service career which  culminated  in 1987 with his appoint ment as the new Director of the U.S.  Customs Service's Office of Aviation  Operations. His rise to the top was not  a fluke. While representing our efforts  on the frontlines of the drug war, Mr.  Asack rose through the ranks with var ious assignments to such places as New  York, Miami, San Diego, and here in  Washington. As he achieved personal  goals in his career, the Customs A via tion Program benefited by his insight  into  the problems confronting a  rel atively  ill-equipped Federal airborne  antidrug smuggling effort. His  input  into the resolution of those problems is  the basis for  the successful record of  achievement compiled by a much mod ernized Customs Air Program.  Frequently referred  to as  the god father  of  today's modern Customs  Aviation Program, Mr. Asack is cred ited with writing the book on air inter diction in that he  identified the air borne smuggling threat and created the  strategy  for  successfully overcoming  that threat. In so doing, he was the ar chitect of  the design document  that  was the basis for the modernization of  the Customs airborne fleet.  As if that weren't enough, Mr. Asack  then oversaw the successful implemen tation of that strategy and leaves Gov ernment service knowing full well that  his personal efforts have contributed  greatly to the successful prosecution of  the war on drugs.  Mr. Asack's commitment  to public  service has truly been exemplary. I join  his coworkers at the Customs Service,  and the many friends he has acquired  during his career, in honoring him for  his dedication and service to the people  of the United States.  OPPOSE MORE FEDERAL  MANDATES  (Mr. BALLENGER  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1991
340,526,5,Mr. BALLENGER.," Madam Speaker,  once again Congress is attempting to  destroy  the  time-honored  system of  flexible employee benefits by pushing  H.R. 2,  the mandated employee  leave  bill.  I  think almost all employers and  Members of Congress will agree  that  leave  benefits make  good  business  sense. The issue is not the leave. The  issue is should the Federal Government  dictate employee benefits for all busi nesses and  their employees. With 39  States already having their own vari ation of this law, and many businesses  offering  it as well, why mandate  it  from Washington.  A January 1991  survey by Penn &  Schoen Associates, Inc., an independ ent corporate and political survey re search firm conducted a survey of pub lic opinion on family and medical leave  was done. The survey found that the  American public does not support fed erally mandated leave. In fact, 89 per cent of those surveyed believed  that  employee benefits should be a matter  decided by employers and employees.  Only 6 percent of those surveyed felt  the Federal Government should man date this benefit.  Leave benefits make good business  sense and  this  is  recognized by  the  American public. However, as this sur vey shows the public does not support a  federally mandated leave policy.  This  Federal mandate  should  voted down. Join me in that effort.  be  PRESIDENT BUSH'S CRIME  PACKAGE  (Mr. RAY asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
341,526,5,Mr. RAY.," Madam Speaker, on March  11, President Bush sent Congress his  1991  crime package. While  there are  elements of this proposal which may  need to be reviewed or modified by the  House and Senate, there are many ele ments which I strongly support.  Last year this House passed a  tough  crime control package. However, dur ing conference consideration, many of  the strongest provisions of this legisla tion were stripped away.  I am pleased that the President's pro posal  takes  a  strong  stand against  crime. Included in his proposal are pro visions  to expand  the  list of crimes  subject to the death penalty. I strongly  support these provisions. I believe we  need the death penalty as a deterrent  to crimes of great magnitude, and I  urge enactment of procedures which  would allow the death penalty to be  used as punishment for grave and hei nous crimes.

343,539,5,Mr. REED.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today in support of the National Lit eracy Act of 1991,  introduced by my  distinguished colleague from Ohio, Mr.  Sawyer and passed  last week by the  House Education and Labor Committee  of which I am a member.  Today, 30 million adult Americans  have  problems with  literacy  skills.  That does not just mean they cannot  read the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  These are people who may not have  the basic reading and math skills they  need  to  read a  bus  schedule, make  change at the store or any of the other  skills that many of us .take for granted.  That is what we mean when we  talk  about literacy.  At the same time as we see rising un employment, we also see the beginning  of a literacy gap between the needs of  the workplace and  the skills of our  workforce.  These literacy problems are ruining  individual  lives but  they are also a  threat to our Nation's well being. Our  economic competitiveness is at stake.  The bill we are discussing today will  help  smalland medium-sized  busi nesses and labor organizations develop  and  implement  literacy programs  to  improve the basic skills of their em ployees.  This legislation also includes teacher  training programs to identify students  with reading.  It will improve library literacy pro grams and expand the reading is fun damental program.  Public and private literacy programs  have long suffered from a lack of fund ing, lack of coordination, and lack of  teacher training.  This bill addresses  these issues and  will go a long way toward insuring that  adults in the United States of America  are able to read a bus schedule, fill in  a  job application form and,  in short,  lead happy, productive lives that con tribute not only  to  their own well  being but also that of the country as a  whole.  Madam Speaker, I hope all my col leagues will support this bill.  ",1991

345,552,5,Mr. GILMAN.," Madam Speaker, this legisla tion addresses some of the serious concerns  our Committee on Post Office and Civil Serv ice has developed in regards to the Adminis tration of the pay for performance system. I  want to commend the chairman of the Sub committee on Compensation and Employee  Benefits, Mr. ACKERMAN, for his work and ef forts in developing a proposal which can enjoy  the support of both the administration and af fected employee groups, and the chairman of  the full committee, Mr. CLAY, for expeditiously  bringing this legislation before the full House.  I am pleased that the legislation addresses  the problem of linkage between a manager's  performance  rating and  the mandated cash  bonus. Under current law, performance ratings  were kept artificially low because cash awards  were mandated upon  the award of an out standing rating. The new  law decouples the  cash  awards  from  the  employee's  ratings  thereby ensuring an employee will not be pre cluded from a higher rating because the agen cy does not have the funds to award a man dated cash bonus.  'lhe legislation also  increases managerial  flexibility by providing that a written evaluation  of an employee's performance may use work  or other job-related objectives in lieu of or ad dition to the critical elements of performance  standards.  H.R 1316 also creates a commission to ad dress future issues which may arise in regards  to  the Federal Government's implementation  of pay for performance. I note the legislation  requires the commission to submit its report to  the Director of the Office of Personnel Man agement by November 5, 1991, and I look for ward to its recommendations.  Accordingly, Madam Speaker, I urge all my  colleagues to support this legislation.  Madam Speaker, I have no further re quests for time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  ",1991

349,552,5,Mr. MCCLOSKEY.," Madam Speaker, I  yield myself  such  time  as  I may  consume.  Madam Speaker, H.R. 831 would des ignate  the postal building located at  5600 Woodland Avenue, Cleveland, OH,  as  the  Jesse Owens Building of  the  United States Postal Service.  The  legendary  triumph  of  Jesse  Owens  in  the  1936 Olympic  games  passed from generation to generation  as one of the great moments in Amer ican history. We often tell the story of  when  the son of a  sharecropper and  grandson of an American slave crushed  Hitler's theory of the superior Aryan  race.  Jesse Owens  returned  from  those  Olympic games as a  new American  hero. A  responsibility  he  combined  with his special concern for the youth  of our Nation. He spent the rest of his  life  reinforcing  to  all  that making  dreams into reality takes a  lot of de termination, dedication, self-discipline,  and effort.  I feel the naming of the post office in  Cleveland, OH, would be a fitting honor  to be bestowed on one of our great  American heroes, and I urge Members  to support this legislation.  I  Speaker,  ",1991
350,552,5,Mr. HORTON.," Madam  yield myself 5 minutes.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup port of H.R. 831  introduced by Con gressman LOUIS STOKES, to designate a  postal  facility  in Cleveland, OH  the  ""Jesse Owens Building of the United  States Postal Service.""  This measure is a fitting tribute to  one of  the most  famous athletes  in  sports history.  Jesse won  four  gold  medals at  the 1936 summer Olympic  games in Berlin, Germany. He won the  100-meter  and  200-meter  races,  the  broad jump, and he was a member of  the winning American 400-meter relay  team. He set Olympic records in the  200-meter race and the broad jump.  The  outstanding  performance  of  Jesse Owens was extremely embarrass ing to Adolph Hitler, the ruler of Ger many. Hitler and his  followers were  hoping  that German athletes would  prove  that  the Aryans-a  term  they  used  for Germans and certain other  people of northern Europe-were supe rior to all other people.  Jesse was born in Oakland, AL,  the  son of a sharecropper. At the age of 7  Jesse's family moved to Cleveland, OH.  Owens excelled in track and filed while  attending Ohio State University from  1933 to 1936. In 1935 Jesse broke three  world records and tied a  fourth at a  college meet in Ann Arbor, MI. Jesse  set seven world records during his ca reer.  Jesse was active in community serv ice, especially youth work. He spoke  eloquently of patriotism, clean living,  and fair play, and he believed that ath letic competition could help solve ra cial and political problems.  I want to congratulate Mr. Stokes on  bringing this legislation to the floor to  honor such a great man, who was not  only a great athlete, but truly an ex emplary human being. It is a most ap propriate tribute to name a postal fa cility in the memory of James Cleve land Owens, or Jesse Owens.  ",1991

354,565,5,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Madam Speaker,  I am  pleased to introduce today the Public Interest  Risk Allocation Act of 1991. I take great pride  in announcing that this important legislation is  cosponsored by my good friend and the rank ing minority member of  the House Judiciary  Committee, HAMIL TON FISH. We recognize the  importance of the private sector in providing  high-risk services to the Federal Government  and hope  that this bill can move  forward  to  provide a fair allocation of the risks involved.  BACKGROUND  The design professional  firms  that provide  architectural and engineering [A-E] services to  the Federal Government share a sense of  alarm and frustration at the escalating liability  exposure  they are asked  to assume under  Federal contracts  for activities  that have a  substantial  risk of injury. Under current Fed eral  law,  the  indemnification protection avail able  to  the design professional  is extremely  limited. This statement outlines the nature of  the risks, the key elements of this bill that is  a response to deal with those risks, and the  benefits-disadvantages  to  the public and  in dustry that accompany such a response.  I. NATURE OF UNACCEPTABLE RISKS  Madam Speaker,  the Federal Government  has a need for and requires the assistance of  design professional firms to address activities  that have a substantial  risk of injury. These  activities include safety inspections, bridge in spections,  asbestos  removal,  hazardous  wastes, mixed wastes,  testing, evaluation, et  cetera. While contracting  for design profes sional services  to address  the  technical as pects of these activities that have a substantial  risk of injury, the Government fails to address  the risk-sharing and public safety aspects of  the  responsibilities which  the  contractor  is  asked  to assume. Without adequate protec tion,  the Government  leaves  the contractor  significantly exposed to catastrophic loss and  the public with severe apprehension with re spect to the ability of victims to recover from  contractors who perform the work assigned in  the event of such a loss. Failure to provide a  reasonable limitation on liability through an in demnification provision will  result  in  further  erosion of the contractor base. In the past 1 O  years, there has been a significant decline in  the participation of responsible contractors  in  Federal activities that have a substantial risk  of injury. As a result, the contractors who re main in the available pool will tend to be those  with few assets who simply count on their abilCONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE  6477  ity to declare bankruptcy  to avoid  liability  in  the event of a disaster or catastrophic  loss.  The impact on the public is enormous.  In certain  limited circumstances,  the Gov ernment has recognized the need for indem nification to obtain the participation of highly  skilled, technically superior contractors in se lected activities that have a substantial risk of  injury. For example,  indemnification has been  provided in legislation and implementing regu lations  for  nuclear  powerplant  contractors,  space  shuttle  contractors, military  research  and development contractors, Federal aviation  traffic control system contractors, and selected  vaccine manufacturers.  In  each  instance  cited  above,  our  col leagues  in the Congress recognized the po tential  for a catastrophic loss. Members also  saw the need for public confidence in the abil ity of the contractor  to perform  the contract  and  to develop an effective solution to meet  the Government's requirements without fear of  exposure of unlimited liability.  Parallel activities that have a substantial risk  of injury with potential for catastrophic loss are  present when a design professional is asked  to perform  the  tasks  related  to  the projects  that have a substantial risk of injury as out lined above.  II. LIMITATION OF RISKS  To combat the reluctance of responsible de sign professional firms to participate in activi ties that have a substantial risk of injury and  public fears about the consequences of cata strophic loss, the Congress must narrow the li ability exposure of  the design professional.  This goal can be met best by a series of sim ple steps designed to share the risk between  the design professional and the Government:  Indemnification of contractors who provide  design professional services for activities that  have a substantial  risk of  injury over  the  amount of reasonably priced and available in surance up to a cap of $5 billion or five times  the contract value, whichever is greater.  Coverage of all defined activities that have  a substantial risk of injury performed by design  professionals clearly acknowledge with con tract clause.  Standard: Liability standard for design pro fessionals: claimant must establish by a pre ponderance of the evidence that design pro fessional services are the proximate cause of  the injury.  Statute of Repose: If suit brought within 1 O  years of date after public use, occupancy, or  control of the project.  Exclusion:  Gross  negligence,  intentional  misconduct, or bad faith of any director, offi cer, or managing official.  Contractor  liable  for proven claims up  to  amount of  insurance coverage-if coverage  available at fair and reasonable costs. Govern ment liable for payments under proven claims  that represent differential between  insurance  coverage and claims up to $5 billion.  Presumption of  indemnification  in  the ab sence of insurance availability at fair and rea sonable price at time contract signed.  Define scope of activities that have substan tial risk of injury to include design professional  activities  to  promote,  facilitate,  or  support  human health or safety, including emergency  preparedness or response, environmental pro tection or cleanup, health or safety regulation,  and  related activities  if the activities  involve  participation  in, support of or assistance  to  that activity, including, but not limited to, activ ity that constitutes conceiving, designing, plan ning,  testing, analyzing, evaluating, advising,  preparing,  assembling, manufacturing,  con structing,  collecting,  producing,  combining,  conducting, performing, controlling, managing,  storing, transporting, supplying, disseminating,  using, applying, operating, maintaining, repair ing, replacing, or disposing.  Ill. IMPACT ON PUBLIC, GOVERNMENT, AND DESIGN  PROFESSIONALS  I would now  like  to share with my col leagues some of the benefits and advantages  to the public, to the Federal Government, and  to the design professionals industry that I an ticipate will derive from this act. If an indem nification bill for Federal design professionals  who contract to perform services that have a  substantial risk of injury is adopted, the impact  on  the  interested parties will be significant.  This impact can be summarized in the follow ing highlights.  The public will benefit in several ways. First,  there will be increased confidence in the qual ity of design professionals who perform activi ties that have substantial risk of injury with the  predictable assurance that victims of a disas ter will receive reasonable compensation.  Although there is a potential limitation on re covery of victims because of the cap, the $5  billion figure  is high enough so that only the  most catastrophic incidents might not be fully  covered.  For  the Government  there are also enor mous benefits. The improved quality of design  professional firms expands the _available pool  and reduces potential for catastrophe. There is  a limitation on Government exposure because  of the cap on liability. Appropriately, the Gov ernment is required to share risk with design  professional  firm. Since  the Government  is  only  responsible  for payment of  the proven  claims differential between insurance coverage  and cap, any potential drain on Treasury  is  kept to a minimum.  From the perspective of the design profes sional firms the bill would remove the burden  of unlimited liability. With predictable coverage  identified at the time of contract award the de sign professional firm will have an incentive to  increase its participation in activities that have  a substantial risk of injury.  Design professional firms recognize that the  bill leaves to the discretion of the OFPP and  the contracting officer the determination of the  availability of  insurance coverage. This  is a  vast improvement over current law since it re quires that contract be identified as an activity  that has substantial risk of  injury  in contract  clause prior to award.  Madam Speaker,  I urge my colleagues  to  give careful consideration  to  this  important  measure and  to  join me  in addressing  this  most serious problem for the members of the  design professional community and  for  the  public.

355,591,5,Mr.  CRANSTON.,"  Mr.  President,  today marks the lOOth anniversary of  the birth of Earl Warren. As the 14th  Chief Justice of  the United States,  Warren presided over one of America's  seminal periods of constitutional law,  transf arming the broad language of our  Constitution  into a  pointed  tool  for  greater  civil  liberties. Earl Warren  emerged as one of our Nation's most  important leaders of the century. It is  appropriate that we should take  this  opportunity  to  recognize  the special  contributions which he has made  to  our country.  The son of a Norwegian-born railway  car repairman and a Swedish-American  mother, Warren was born in Los Ange les and grew up  in Bakersfield, CA.  After completing  law  school at  the  University of California's Boalt Hall  and serving  in World War I, he was  known as a  fierce  prosecutor while  serving as deputy district attorney and  district attorney of Alameda County.  His Statewide reputation grew as he  was elected attorney general and even tually Governor of California. Warren's  image as a liberal-conservative from a  moderately progressive state and his  performance as Thomas Dewey's Vice  Presidential running mate in 1948 fig ured prominently in President Eisen hower's decision to nominate Warren,  in 1953,  to fill a vacancy on the Su preme Court.  President Eisenhower  saw Warren as someone who would not  rock  the boat. But less  than a year  after his confirmation Warren would  lead the Court to one of its most im portant civil rights decisions ever, a  precursor  to  the  profound  social  changes which were to come. The War ren Court was not just at the forefront  of civil rights change but also produced  important  decisions  concerning  church-state relations, school prayer,  legislative  reapportionment, and per sonal rights.  Chief Justice Warren's contributions  to the Court and the Nation have been  well documented. But we  should re member the man, the sense of justice  and fairness that he brought to the law  and to the Nation. As former Justice  Abe Fortas wrote:  He was a constant reminder that the task  of a  judge is always to seek the truth-the  essential constitutional and human values at  stake* * *he was a constant reminder that  neither fear nor the intricacies of the legal  craft should divert justices from this noble  pursuit.  EARL WARREN-A GREAT CIDEF  JUSTICE  ",1991
356,591,5,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, sum ming up the monumental accomplish ments of Earl Warren's distinguished  career is no easy task. As we celebrate  the centennial of the birth of this re markable man on March 19, 1891, we  are especially mindful of the extraor dinary progress by  the Nation under  his leadership as Chief Justice toward  securing the rights and liberties guar anteed to all Americans by the Con stitution.  Earl Warren grew up at the end of  the last century in the small Western  town of Bakersfield, CA. The hardships  he witnessed there made a deep impres sion on him, one he carried with him  throughout his  long career of public  service.  Indeed, with the exception of a  few  early years  in private  practice,  he  spent his entire career in the law en gaged in public service. He was deputy  city attorney for the city of Oakland,  district attorney, State attorney gen eral and a highly successful three-term  Governor of  the State of California.  But Earl Warren's greatest legacy  to  the American people began with his ap pointment by President Eisenhower to  be Chief Justice of the United States.  He held this post for 16 years, a time of  great  change  and  progress  for  this  country that he himself did much to  foster.  The Warren Court championed  the  rights of individuals, of minorities, and  of the weak and disadvantaged, to the  ultimate benefit of us all. Under his  leadership,  the Supreme Court vigor ously  defended  the Bill  of Rights,  upheld  the civil rights of minorities,  wiped out the infamous and invidious  doctrine of ""separate but equal,"" and  firmly established the principle of ""one  person, one vote.""  Chief Justice Warren is perhaps best  known and most widely  remembered  for writing the landmark opinion end ing school desegregation. Brown versus  Board of Education changed the face of  our country and set the stage for the  long fight  to eradicate  the  legacy of  slavery and  shameful discrimination  that blighted the history of our Nation.  In announcing the Court's decision in  the Brown case, Chief Justice Warren  concluded:  In the field of public education the doc trine of ""separate but equal"" has no place.  Separate educational  facilities  are  inher ently unequal.  In later years, the Court applied the  teachings of Brown to other realms of  public life,  in decisions desegregating  beaches, buses, golf courses, and parks.  These  decisions  culminated  in  the  Court's determination in 1963 that:  It is no  longer open  to question  that a  State may not constitutionally require seg regation of public facilities.  In a series of landmark decisions, the  Warren Court ensured that our crimi nal  justice system would respect  the  constitutional  rights of  the accused.  The Court affirmed  the  fundamental  rights  to  be  free  from  unlawful  searches and seizures and to have ade quate legal representation. These deci sions helped to secure the blessings of  liberty for all Americans.  And it was the Warren Court that is sued the historic ruling that State leg islatures may  not  apportion  them selves  so  as  to  reduce  the  voting  strength of particular constituencies.

385,630,5,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Madam President, I  would like to make a few comments to  my esteemed colleague from Indiana,  who. is always very eloquent, and uses  , his facts  to his advantage very well.  But I would like to try and cast it in  somewhat of a different light.  What we are trying to do, those of us  that represent this industry, is find an  option to the serious problems that are  facing us at this moment, which will  result  in  thousands of farmers being  forced out of business. We have an op tion, but we need time.  So the basic question comes down to  this: If you have an option wherein you  can send cows which are badly needed  overseas to assist those nations which  I mentioned before, whether it be  in  Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union,  and  there  is a market out there for  them, and if we can develop the time to  do that, we can reduce the production  and get  the program under control  without the necessity of placing farm ers into bankruptcy.  To give you an  idea of the  threat  that the farmers are now facing as to  going into bankruptcy, let me just give  you an example in Wisconsin. Eighty fi ve percent of their FHMA loans are  now in jeopardy; 85 percent. This could  result in up to a $60 million loss to the  Federal Government.  Now, you multiply  this across  the  country and you are going to end up  with a huge cost to the taxpayers by  going forward, under our present situa tion. We are carefully trying to develop  the beginnings of a program which, if  fully  initiated, will be able  to bring  this under control by bringing the milk  production under control by exporting  cows to foreign countries.  We did this to some degree during the  Dairy Termination Program. Without  even trying to develop the program, we  exported some 65,000 head of dairy cat tle. For every 10,000 head of cattle that  we  export, we  can  save  that many  farms divided by 100 or 1,000  farms.  What we need to do is to give us time  to develop the programs to do that.  We did not get as much time as we  thought we would get because, unex pectedly, the price of milk dropped like  a rock at the beginning of this year,  whereas we had anticipated it would  stabilize  and  gradually  go  down  through the year and we would have  those dairy studies the Senator from  Indiana has indicated were now being  done. We thought we would have those  studies back and we would be able to  do what would need to be done, modify  the M-W or develop a supply manage ment program, to keep farm prices sta ble.  It really hurts me to have an attempt  to make our dairy farmer an enemy of  the consumer. History does not allow  us to come to the conclusion. The dairy  farmer has been the best friend of the  consumer for the last several decades.  Compare  the cost of milk over  that  course of time with any other product,  and studies show  the dairy  industry  has been  the most productive  in  the  Nation, bar none, as far as production  per labor unit is concerned. What this  has meant has been great savings to  consumers all along.  What we are trying to do here is not  to increase the price of fluid milk, but  to take back that part of the price of  fluid milk which is out there now, and  which used to be the farmer's but now  is being picked off by the retailers and  the middle men. We want it back.  Consumers could end up with some  slight increase, we  feel,  in the short  run. I cannot deny that. But, on the  other hand,  this price  increase deals  with only 40  percent of  total dairy  sales. Sixty percent of milk product  does not go into fluid milk. Consumers  are paying lower prices for cheese and  other dairy products. They are getting  the benefit of that precipitous drop in  milk prices which is harming the farm ers.  What we need now, and what we are  asking for,  is time. I do not like this  bill in the sense of a permanent dairy  law. I would oppose that. It would dis rupt my area of the country, it would  hurt  the South, it would hurt other  areas. But we now are even willing to  sacrifice what we might get in the final  analysis by allowing this pooling to go  on now. I do not like it, but I do like  the fact that I can come forward with  a program and see a program developed  which will help other nations in this  world so we can export the overproduc tion to help those nations but not have  to put my friend out of business. To  bring  things under control we  need  time. It is an emergency.  By the time we get to any other solu tion, waiting for August, waiting for  these studies to come back and then  develop to a consensus around the Na tion as to what the dairy policy ought  to be, it will be too late.  The question of whether you send the  cows overseas or the farmers to bank ruptcy, and we believe that the best  thing to do for all is to make sure we  can come up with a humane program  which does not require the indignity of  bankruptcy  for dairy  farmers. When  other alternatives will be available to  us for a short period of time. We need  to raise the price of milk to make it a  living wage for our dairy farmers.  I urge my colleagues to vote for the  Leahy amendment. I yield the floor.  ",1991
386,630,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The Sen ator from New York.  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I  cosponsored this amendment. I did it  not because I think it is a final answer,  as my good friend and colleague, Sen ator JEFFORDS, from Vermont, has in dicated, but because  there  is a dire  emergency in every real sense in the  dairy industry.  Yesterday I visited four communities  in the State of New York: Olean, in the  western part of our State; Buffalo,  again in the western region; Rochester;  and Syracuse.  In each one of  these  communities people who are being af fected, who say they are going out of  business, came  to me. They are  the  dairy farmers. And their plea was one  of great distress, indicating that with  energy prices having gone up, with  taxes having gone up, with cost of busi ness having gone up,  and with  the  prices that they are receiving having  plunged from something in the area of  $14 per hundredweight to $11, that they  face no alternative other than going  out of business.  This loss of their production will not  benefit  anyone,  be  it  farmers,  our  States' economy, or consumers. It is  only going to exacerbate the problem.  It will  take fluid milk  that we des perately need in our region out of cir culation. It is going to drive up prices.  So while I do not suggest I am an ex pert in this area, I can say that those  people are good, hardworking middle class families, who say they are going  to go out of business, and can no longer  operate the farms. This result can only  be a devastating blow to our State. Al ready, New York dairy farmers have  earned $334 million less than they did  last year.  Let me, if I might, share-and I was  unaware of this until just a  few mo ments ago-a personal communication  from our Governor. Let me share this  with my colleagues. He says:  DEAR AL: Over the past six months, dairy  farmers throughout the nation have experi enced a sharp decline in farm milk prices,  causing severe economic disruption for the  dairy  industry,  particularly  family  dairy  farms. I urge your support of efforts to revise  federal dairy policies and programs in order  to restore economic stability in our dairy  production sector.  Dairy farming is the largest sector of the  New York's agricultural industry. With an  annual production in excess of eleven billion  pounds, New York is the third largest dairy  state. The  importance of dairying extends  well beyond the farm gate-to hundreds of  businesses in rural and urban areas that de pend on farm related expenditures and to the  communities that rely on farming activities  for their tax base. Consumers in New York  also benefit from a strong agricultural indus try that provides quality farm products.  The farm milk price in New York has de clined by over $4.00 per hundred pounds since  January, 1990.

Mr. President, these two amend ments have been cleared: One amend ment by Mr. BUMPERS  is needed be cause of the scoring of the committee  amendment and has been cleared on  both sides of the aisle; one by Senators  WmTH and BROWN which does not add  any budget authority or outlays to the  bill and has been cleared on both sides  of the aisle.

390,643,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The  amendments  (Nos.  46  and 47)  were agreed to, en bloc, as follows:  AMENDMENT NO. 46  At the appropriate place, insert the following:    SEC.   COMMUNITY IMPACT ASSISTANCE.  Sl0,000,000  Of the funds provided to the Department of  Energy for fiscal year 1991, not more than  shall be made available  to  the  State of Colorado for community impact as sistance payments to the cities of Broom field, Westminster, Thornton,  and North glenn, Colorado.

391,643,5,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. President, last year  during consideration of the DOD Au thorization, the Armed Services Com mittee discussed at length a problem  concerning  runoff  from Rocky Flats  that was contaminating, or had the po tential to contaminate, drinking water  supplies of nearby residential commu nities.  When the DOD bill was passed last  year, its report language granted the  Secretary of Energy the discretion to  use DOE funds to assist the local com munity in building a water diversion  project  to protect  its water  supply.  Since that time, I am pleased to say,  DOE has cooperated fully  in working  with' the community to plan the diver sion project. DOE representatives both  at Rocky Flats and in the Washington  headquarters have been supportive of  these efforts.  Unfortunately,  Mr.  President,  progress on the di version project has  bogged down in red tape. As I under stand it, DOE is concerned that the dis cretionary authority granted to it in  last year's authorization is not clear  enough for it to make the first pay ment  in  reimbursing  local cities  for  their expenses on the project. DOE has  asked for clarifying language which is  what  this amendment I and my col league  from Colorado propose  is all  about.  The amendment is revenue neutral.  The DOE has already  identified  the  funds for  this project within existing  waste management programming and  has no objection to the language of this  amendment, according to the DOE Of fice of Environmental Restoration and  Waste Management. The amendment,  in essence, directs the DOE to provide  reimbursement to those Colorado com munities whose drinking water is af fected by Rocky Flats runoff.  As many of my colleagues know, the  history of the Rocky Flats is charac terized by numerous problems and acci dents, which have resulted in onand  off-site contamination. Local residents  drank water contaminated with  trit ium  in  the 1970's. Reservoirs serving  the area have plutonium contamina tion in their sediment and on the sur face surrounding  the reservoirs. Sur face water contaminants  include ni trates, chromium, plutonium, tritium,  americium, and excess fecal coliform  bacteria. In the future, ground water  contamination may seep into the sur face drainage, carrying still other con taminants into the drinking water. The  management and operation of the plant  has  created mistrust  of  the  public  water supplies. It is time that we did  something to restore public confidence.  The proposed diversion project is the  first step to a permanent solution ad dressing the drinking water contami nation problem. When  the project  is  completed, Great Western Reservoir  would no longer be used as a drinking  water supply, and Standley Lake would  be protected against runoff from  the  plant,  up  to and  including 100-year  storm event.  Mr. President, this amendment seeks  to finish the job that was started last  year in the DOD authorization. I hope  that the Senate will assist these Colo rado communities in protecting their  drinking water  by  accepting  this  amendment.  ",1991
392,643,5,Mr. BROWN.," Mr. President, I thank  my colleague from West Virginia, Sen ator BYRD, for offering the amendment  to  the dire  emergency supplemental  bill which allows the cities surrounding  the Rocky Flats Plant to move forward  quickly with a project to protect their  drinking water supplies from potential  contamination from groundwater run off from the site.  Before going further, let me take just  a moment to commend my colleagues  on the Appropriations Committee, and  especially Senator HATFIELD,  for his  work to ensure the full $283 million for  Rocky Flats was approved by the com mittee.  When Rocky Flats was built, it was  18 miles  from  the  edge  of Denver.  Today,  the  nearby  suburban  towns  completely surround it. When it was  built, Rocky Flats was one of the most  modern facilities of its day. More than  40 years later however, these same fa cilities are barely adequate to produce  nuclear weapons. They need a thorough  modernization  I  am  told,  just  to  produce on an interim basis.  These two factors, Rocky Flats' prox imity to Denver and the need for con",1991
393,656,5,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President, dur ing consideration of H.R. 1281, the dire  emergency  supplemental  appropria tions bill,  the committee agreed  to  defer the administration's proposed re scissions, transfers, and appropriations  of more than $780 million in housing  and community development programs  to support programs authorized in the  National Affordable Housing Act,  in cluding  the HOPE Grants Program.  While the HOPE and HOME Programs  have obvious merit, I fully concur with  the committee's decision on this mat ter.  Mr. President, for many years I have  supported a variety of HUD Programs  including Urban Homesteading, Nehe miah, UDAG, Rental Rehabilitation  and Supplemental Assistance  for Fa cilities to assist the Homeless. Many of  these programs are now  targeted  in  these rescissions.  Without a doubt, Secretary Kemp has  exemplified great leadership in putting  forth a number of new and valuable ini tiatives and has done much to restore  credibility and accountability  to  the  Department  of Housing,  but  I  feel  strongly that programs such as HOPE  and HOME should be given every con sideration through the regular appro priations process and not on a  dire  emergency supplemental bill. I intend  to work with the VA, HUD Subcommit tee to see if these important new ini tiatives can be  implemented expedi tiously in the new fiscal year without  rescinding funds appropriated for cur rent programs.  ",1991
394,656,5,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President, I  must reluctantly oppose  this amend ment.  Mr. President, I was an original co sponsor  of  the National Affordable  Housing Act, and in fact worked close ly with the Housing Subcommittee on  several of its provisions. So I would  very much like to see these new pro grams funded, particularly the HOME  Program, which includes a set-aside for  community-based groups based on my  own bill, the Community Housing Part nership Act.  However, as strongly as I support the  National Affordable Housing Act,  I  don't think it's right to fund the new  programs now by taking money away  from existing programs.  Mr. President, it's premature to ap propriate money  to  the HOME Pro gram. The States and localities that  will get money for the HOME Program  must first put together comprehensive  housing strategies, and they must do it  after the public gets a chance to par ticipate. Yet State and local officials  are  just getting started in preparing  their strategies and learning about the  program. Officials in New Jersey tell  me that they will not be ready to use  HOME  funds  effectively  for many  months. Municipal officials around the  country are saying the same thing.  Mr. President, it does not make sense  to rush 1991 money into a program that  the recipients aren't ready to use, and  when the same recipients are urging us  to oppose the effort. Particularly when  such funding would be taken from pro grams that help nonprofit, community based groups provide housing, and that  allow us  to  repair  the many public  housing projects that are in dire need  of major reconstruction.  Mr. President, despite my concerns  about this amendment, I want to again  emphasize my support for  the HOME  Program, and my hope that the pro gram will be funded in 1992. As a mem ber of the VA, HUD and Independent  Agencies Subcommittee of the Appro priations Committee, I intend to work  for such funding in the coming fiscal  year, and I am hopeful we can work in  a bipartisan manner to make that hap pen.  ",1991
395,656,5,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, dur ing  the  lOlst Congress,  the Congress  overwhelmingly  passed  the National  Affordable Housing Act. This bill was  the first major housing legislation in  years.  Some of the inventive aspects of this  landmark legislation were:  The HOPE Program, which promotes  low-income homeownership and  resi dent management;  the HOME Housing Grant Program,  which increases housing assistance to  States and cities for vouchers, rehabili tation, and new construction; and  the Shelter Pl us Care Program, an  innovative new service-supported hous ing program for the homeless most in  need.  The Department  of Housing  and  Urban Development has quickly issued  regulations  to carry out  these pro grams. The program  regulations  for  HOPE and Shelter Plus Care were pub lished  in early February. The HOME  Program  regulations were  issued on  February 28 for prepublication review,  and will be published soon.  The administration  is seeking $787  million in supplemental funds for 1991  in a  budget neutral  request. HOME  would  receive  $500 million  in  1991,  HOPE grants would receive $155 million  in 1991, services for frail elderly hous ing would receive $10 million, and Shel ter Plus Care would receive $122 mil lion.

397,669,5,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I yield  myself such time as I may consume,  and then I will yield the remainder of  the time to the Senator from Washing ton.  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to  the amendment offered by my friend  from Oklahoma.  I guess  this amend ment can be best described as a cold  leftover crumb  from  the banquet of  greed of the Reagan administration, a  banquet of greed that said to the work ing people of this country that you can  keep getting less and less but those at  the  top can keep getting more and  more.  Real wages we know have fallen over  the last 10 years of our working people  in  this country. That  is what  this   amendment is trying to do,  to again  tell the working people of this country  that they should accept even less than  they are getting now. For 10 years the  Reagan administration, now the Bush  administration, have been  trying  to  change what has been settled, prac ticed in law since 1937. For 10 years the  Congress has said no. So now what they  are trying to do is by fiat and regula tion what they could not accomplish  by changing the law because the Con gress said ""no.""  Since 1937 we have had apprentice ship programs in this country. Over 30  States now have apprentice councils  and apprenticeship programs. All of the  building trades industry have appren tice programs. It is a way for a young  unskilled worker  to enter  the work  force as an apprentice  to do maybe  some of the menial jobs, to help cut,  but to learn how to do  that journey man's job, whether it is a bricklayer,  laborer, carpenter, pipefitter, cement  finisher, whatever it might be in the  construction industry. It is a way for  young people to get in there, be an ap prentice, and go on to be a  journey man.  This amendment, and what the regu lations that are trying to be foisted on  us by the Bush administration would  do is say, no, we are not going to have  that apprenticeship program any more,  we  are  going  to  have  a  whole  subculture  of  helpers  with  subminimum wages, low wages with no  hope of ever getting out of it; no hope  of ever getting and climbing up that  ladder of apprenticeship, being a  jour neyman.  The  distinguished  Senator  from  Oklahoma  says  if you do  not care  about wasting money, then you can go  ahead and vote against  this amend ment, I guess. We do not care about  wasting money.  You know what wastes money? Shod dy construction, projects that do not  last very long. That is what you get  when you have unskilled construction  people building our buildings.  You can go out and look for yourself.  Find a building that is built with good  union labor. You will  find good con struction that is going  to last for a  long  time. Find one that is not, and  you will find one that will fall down in  a shorter period of time. We are talk ing about here Federal projects. We are  not talking about private. We are talk ing about projects  that come under  Davis-Bacon. This is Federal projects.  I am telling you if my taxpayers, and  myself as a taxpayer, if I am going to  be paying money  to build something  under the auspices of the Federal Gov ernment, I want it to be built well. I  want it to last a  long time. I do not  want it falling down. I want it to be  built  with  journeymen  labor  and  skilled labor.  You want to waste money? I tell you  if you want to waste money, you sup port  the amendment of  the Senator  from Oklahoma. You will get  some  cheap building out there. You will get  a cheap building that will  fall down  and will not  last very  long. Again,  maybe in the short term it might be all  right, but that is another legacy of the  Reagan administration. Just  look at  the short term. Forget about the long term. That is what  this is-a short term view.  Mr. President, we have  tried for a  long time. We should not let them do  by fiat what we would not let them do  by law. I have every reason to believe  that again Congress will say, no, that  we are not going to let them take away  the apprenticeship programs that have  been so vital to our country.  I will close by saying I think one of  the  things wrong  in  this  country  today-we have all of these economic  theories about what is wrong, what is  going on in America-I have always re duced  it  to very  simple  terms, Mr.  President. I think what is wrong in this  country  today  is  that  there are  too  many people making money on money,  and there is not enough people making  money building, constructing, mining,  manufacturing,  raising, growing,  the  things that produce real wealth in this  country.  People that are working out there building our  highways  and  bridges,  skyscrapers, and schools-ought to be  paid well, a decent living wage, where by they can raise their families, feed  them, clothe them, and educate them,  have a home of their own, a car, edu cate  their kids, have retirement and  health care for  the people that build  America. These are  the people  that  build this country, and we can accept  no less than that.  Mr. President, I yield the remainder  of my time, or whatever time he may  consume,  to my distinguished  friend  from Washington.  ",1991
398,669,5,Mr. ADAMS.," I thank my friend, the  Senator from  Iowa,  for his excellent  statement.  I rise today in strong opposition to  the Nickles amendment. I want to echo  what has been said by my friend,  the  Senator from  Iowa, Senator HARKIN.  What we  are  talking about  in  this  amendment  is  to strike Davis-Bacon  and to drive down the wages and work ing conditions of skilled working peo ple in the United States-the people in  the United States who work with their  hands and work with their tools and  build things.  We spent too much time, in recent  years, paying attention to people who  have made money on money and too  little  time  to  the people who  really  work to make this country competitive  and a better country. Competition does  not  come  from making money  on  money.  Competition  comes  from  skilled people being able to do a skilled  job, and do  it well and in a quality  manner, who have been well-trained,  and who like their jobs, and who are  well paid for it, and who can buy their  home and raise their families and raise  their children.  What this amendment attempts to do  is put in place regulations issued by  the Department of Labor of this admin istration that would say: We are going  to put on jobs unskilled people. Yes, it  is  always  a  little  cheaper  in  the  shortrun, to take quality people off the  job, or to say to a quality journeyman,  such as a carpenter, somebody working  in a skilled trade on a job in construc tion, and say he has to work as a help er. That is what this is.  Let us turn this coin around. This is  not just to bring people in at the bot tom. This is a two-pronged attack that  we are trying to prevent. And that two pronged attack is, first, to change the  definition of people working on a  job,  which  they cannot do by legislation,  but do it by regulation so that people  are paid helper's wages  rather  than  journeyman's wages. All those groups  you heard listed by the Senator from  Oklahoma-I hope everybody listened,  because those are the people who are  doing the hiring-they are not the people who are doing the work.

408,682,5,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, I rise  to. inform my colleagues  that  today  marks the 2,194th day that Terry An derson has been held captive in Leb anon.  On Friday, March 16, his family and  the  families of other men still held  captive  in Lebanon  gathered  in  a  ""Tribute to Courage."" It was a tribute  to the courage of Terry Anderson, who  has endured 6 years of captivity. To the  courage of those who have come home,  and  to  those who have died  in cap tivity. But, most significantly, to the  courage of the families who will never  allow their loved ones to be forgotten.  On Saturday, six Beirut newspapers  printed letters to Terry Anderson from  his family and friends. An Associated  Press writer, Mohammed Salam, shares  excerpts from the letters. I ask unani mous consent that a part of this report  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the report  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  ANDERSON MARKS 6TH YEAR AS HOSTAGE  (By Mohammed Salam)  BEIRUT,  LEBANON.-Lebanese  newspapers  Saturday published letters from his family  and friends to Anderson, the longest-held of  the 13 Westerners missing in Lebanon.  It was not known if Anderson would see  the messages, but his Shiite Muslim captors  are known to have sometimes allowed him to  read newspapers and see television appear ances by his family.  His sister, Peggy Say, who has campaigned  tirelessly to secure Anderson's freedom, said  she hopes this year will bring his release.  ""Soon, God willing, you will all be free,""  she wrote. ""But until then, know that your  fellow Americans salute you and pray every  day for your continued strength and cour age.""  Beirut's six Arabic  language dailies pub lished the letters, and the leading paper, An Nahar, also published the original English  texts. Anderson did not speak Arabic when  he was kidnapped.  The pro-Syrian ash-Sharq daily headlined  its report: ""The dean of Western hostages be gins his seventh year in captivity.""  Anderson, 43, of Lorain, Ohio, is Chief Mid dle East correspondent for The Associated  Press. He was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.  The pro-Iranian Shiite group Islamic Jihad  said it holds him.  The  other missing Westerners  are  five  Americans, four Britons, two Germans and  an Italian. Most are believed held by fun damentalist Shiite factions.  The anniversary of Anderson's abduction  coincided with  renewed optimism  in  the  United States that the new political climate  following the Gulf War will speed the hos tages' release.  After Secretary of State James A. Baker  m met with Syrian President Hafez Assad in  Damascus last week, Foreign Minister Fa rouk al-Sharaa promised his country would  exert ""maximum effort"" to help win the hos tages' release.  ""We have  the  feeling  that  the hostage  issue has to be resolved,"" al-Sharaa said.  The weekly magazine ash-Shiraa quoted an  unnamed senior Syrian source as saying that  Syria and Iran also ""agreed . . . on the need  to work for the release of the foreign hos tages in Lebanon.""  Syria has been instrumental  in previous  hostage releases. It maintains good ties with  Iran and  its 40,000 peacekeeping  troops  in  Lebanon  are deployed  in areas where  the  hostages are believed to be held. And it im proved relations with Washington by sending  19,000  troops to join  the U.S.-led coalition  against Iraq in the Gulf War.  But Shiite clerics familiar with the kid nappers' thinking said they saw no real signs  of progress  toward  the hostages' release.  They also noted that Iran does not control  the Islamic Jihad, Anderson's captor.  The clerics, speaking on condition of ano nymity, listed three conditions that must be  met first:  Billions of dollars of Iranian assets frozen  in the United States since 1979 should be re leased.  Israel  should  free  Sheik Abdul Karim  Obeid, a Shiite religious leader kidnapped in  Lebanon in 1989.  The kidnappers must be assured that U.S.  authorities will not pursue them after the  hostages are freed.  Islamic Jihad had demanded that Kuwaiti  authorities release 17 convicted pro-Iranian  terrorists jailed for the December 1983 bomb ings in the Persian Gulf emirate.  Kuwait refused. Two of the men were freed  in February  1989  after  serving  five-year  terms. The  remaining 15 were  freed when  Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.  Beirut newspapers Saturday also published  a letter from Anderson's 6-year-old daughter,  Sulome,  and Sulome's mother Madeleine  Bassil.

Hugh O'Brian has had a  long and distin guished career that has seen him play  in a  wide variety of roles  in movies ranging  from  ""No  Business  Like Show Business"" with  Marilyn Monroe to ""Twins"" with Danny DeVito  and Arnold Schwarzenegger. But he will  for ever be best remembered as the brave, coura geous, and bold marshal of Tombstone, AZ,  March 19, 1991  Wyatt Earp, where he helped define the role  of the no-nonsense Western lawman.  Now, in its ninth year, the Western Walk of  Stars in Santa Clarita, CA, helps us all recall  those celluloid heroes of a generation ago  who helped us  learn that crime did not pay,  that a man's word was his bond, and  that  chivalry and honor were virtues  to emulate.  Certainly,  Hugh  O'Brian  has  earned  enshrinement.  But Hugh also is a noted philanthropist, in  the spirit of volunteerism  that helped make  America great. After a meeting with Albert  Schweitzer, Hugh became a strong believer in  serving humanity, especially  in  the area of  education. That  is why he established  the  Hugh O'Brian Youth Foundation to seek out,  recognize, and reward leadership potential in  high school sophomores.

410,760,5,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to a woman who is truly a credit to  the community of Reading, PA. I am speaking  of Ms. Rosemary Jackson, who is being hon ored by  the National Council on Alcoholism  and Drug Development. Ms.  Jackson has  dedicated 30 years of her life to Reading and  in so doing has played a major role in various  facets of  the community. She has provided  outstanding service and  leadership to health,  social work, cultural,  religious, and outreach  organizations  and  programs.

411,773,5,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  call  the attention of my colleagues  to H.R.  107, which  I introduced on January 3, 1991.  The reasons for this bill are rooted deep in the  history of the United States as well as in the  current needs of the National Guard in several  of our States. We have recently won a war in  a far away place, operating in a cultural envi ronment alien  to  the American experience.  Our country needs our support today;  to be  prepared  for  tomorrow, we must pass H.R.  107 this year.  H.R. 107, a pilot program to run for only 3  years before  reevaluation, would enable  the  National Guard  in a  few States where  the  Guard is noticeably below authorized strength,  to make up this deficit through the recruitment  of immigrants who are qualified in all other re spects save permanent residence status. The  purpose here is to fill the needs of the military,  not only quantitatively, but qualitatively, with  highly qualified natives of dozens of  foreign  nations which, prior to the change in immigra tion regulations in the 1960's, had provided a  significant part of the National Guard and reg ular military manpower  recruitment pool  in  many parts of the country, including the North east.  A competitive advantage can be gained in  the world by understanding that not everyone  operates by the same values, world view or  methodology  as Americans. Understanding  leadership requirements for the United States  in a world where America no longer enjoys the  dominance of the post-World War  II era re quires  that we enfranchise and mainstream  people who can provide our military, American  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  business, and our society with a native under standing of these differences. Historically, mili tary service has been the most effective and  efficient means of  integrating  the  immigrant  into full participation in American society.  Who would have imagined in 1980, that in  1990 it might suddenly become  important to  have native speakers of Lithuanian, Latvian,  Estonian, Polish, Magyar, Romanian, Arme nian, or Arabic available in the Armed Forces  of the United States-including in the National  Guard under the total force concept-to sup port our  intelligence and psychological oper ations capabilities? Who can anticipate our  needs in the year 2000? One thing is certain,  and that is as a maritime nation and a world  power with global  responsibilities,  the United  States cannot afford to neglect the develop ment of these capabilities.  The United States, as a world power with  global responsibilities, still must reach out to  natives of other countries to acquire that extra  dimension which would enable  the Armed  Forces of the United States  to  function  that  much more effectively  ""in every clime and  place"" "" "".""  In keeping with the recommendations of the  Secretary of Labor's Workforce 2000 Report,  H.R. 107 (H.R. 5458 in the 101st Congress),  would give a limited number of immigrants, a  limited number of volunteer nacent Americans,  the opportunity to earn permanent residence  status through honorable military service. That  this  is nothing new, and,  in the  form of this  legislation, that this is professionally to be de sired is attested to by the support of the adju tants general of a number of States, including  New York State, by the Militia Association of  New York and by many other military, veter ans, and ethnic organizations.  What Mr. MANTON, Mr. SOLOMON, Mr. HOR TON, Mr. DORNAN and those others of our col leagues who cosponsored H.R. 5458, sought  was to provide for present defense needs and  anticipate  future  national  security  contin gencies; H.R. 107 would do this. Using only  manpower already present in our States, we  seek to re-implement the principle of the mili tary being able  to enlist  limited numbers of  such immigrants to augment the future effec tiveness of the U.S. military.  H.R. 107 is but a realistic reflection of the  traditional  relationship of  the Armed Forces  and society  in American history. This fact is  explained  in a most  insightful point paper  which has been accepted  for publication by  the U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings, ""Recruit ing of Foreign Nationals for the U.S. Forces""  by Rear Adm. Cathal L. Flynn, immediate past  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense  for  Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict,  U.S. Marine Col. Patrick Collins, former com pany commander in the 3d Recon Battalion in  Viet Nam, and Crndr. William A. Murphy, VMI,  1965, of the U.S. Naval Reserve.  For my colleagues  information,  I  request  that their article be inserted at this point in the  RECORD:  6685  RECRUITING OF FOREIGN NATIONALS FOR THE  U.S. FORCES  (By Rear Adm. Cathal L. Flynn, USN (Ret.),  Col. Patrick Collins, USMC  (Ret.),  and  Comdr. William A. Murphy, USNR)  A LOOK AT THE RECORD  The United States, historically, has been  truly a nation of immigrants if not THE na tion of immigrants. Nowhere has this been  better reflected than in the armed forces of  the United States and in the militias of the  several States. A special exhibit in the mu seum in the base of the Statue of Liberty in  New York harbor makes this point most ex plicitly in the case of the War for Independ ence. The Medal of Honor grove at the Free doms Foundation  in Vall~y Forge, Penn sylvania contains one obelisk per State bear ing the names of recipients of the Medal of  Honor attributable to that State plus an ad ditional obelisk with the names of 150 Medal  of Honor heroes from at least 14 countries  who could not be attributed to any State; in  most cases these were immigrants who had  enlisted in the regular US forces prior to  having established a home of record in the  United States. (The greatest number of for eign-born Medal of Honor  recipients,  254,  were born in Ireland, including 65 of the 150  mentioned above. Of nineteen men who hold  two Medals of Honor,  five were Irish-born  and four Irish American, including Sergeant  Major Dan Daly of the US Marines.) Two  World Wars  as well as conflicts/crises  in  Korea, Berlin, South East Asia, Lebanon,  Grenada, Panama and the Persian Gulf have  seen varying numbers of non-citizens wel come in the ranks of the US military.  By statute, the US Army and Air Force,  and the National Guard, find their recruits  among documented, permanent residents and  citizens of the United States. By tradition,  this has not been the norm,  those lacking  permanent residence status often being ac tively recruited  into  the American armed  forces; at times even lawful entry as a pre requisite  for military  service  has  been  waived.  Although generally conforming  to Army  practices, the naval service, which may be  expected  to be operateing overseas or  in volved in foreign expeditions, has no statu tory prohibition against  replenishing  the  ranks of the US Navy and Marine Corps  through on-site, overseas recruiting of non U.S. nationals. This was  true when John  Paul Jones and John Adams recruited men  from the Irish Brigade of the French Army  to serve as Marines in the fighting tops of  the Bonhomme Richard. It has remained true  in the twentieth century.  One by7product Ludendorf's 1918 offensive  on the Western Front was to find large num bers of the elite of the German Army as pris oners of the United States Second Division,  then commanded by Major General John Ar cher Lejeune of the United States Marine  Corps. Anticipating the end of war, General  Lejeune kept the cream of these POWs in the  custody of the United States Marines; after  the Armistice, they were offered the oppor tunity to continue their military careers in  the United States Marine Corps. Enough of  these volunteered and became Drill Instruc tors on Paris Island  to have unique con sequences for the Marine Corps basic train ing program, consequences which were  to  pay big dividends in the Second World War,  and subsequently.  The Navy still benefits tremendously from  the recruiting of a  limited number of Phil ippine nationals.  ",1991

415,799,5,Mr. OWENS of Utah.," Mr. Speaker, today we  celebrate the 170th anniversary of Greek Inde pendence from the Ottoman Empire and  the  restoration of democracy to  the very people  who  invented  it more  than 2,000 years ago.  The ancient tradition of Greek democracy  is  enshrined in our monuments and public build ings, and finds expression  to this day  in the  very underpinnings of our constitution and way  of life.  I find it truly remarkable that, in spite of cen turies of political  tumult and occupation,  the  Greek people retained  their national  identity,  their unique and rich cultural distinction, and  their strong devotion to Democratic principles  of self rule.  Today, in celebrating Greek democracy, we  celebrate our own. For as Aristotle and Peri cles handed down  the principles of power  emanating from the people and equality under  law, so was the legacy of Thomas Jefferson  and James Madison bestowed to  the Greek  republic in 1821. Adopting the American Dec laration of  Independence as  their own,  the  Greeks sealed a bond which has endured be tween our two peoples ever since.  As comrades  in arms during  the Second  World War and partners today in NATO, both  Greeks and Americans have stood together in  the  face of adversity  to preserve our  fun damental freedoms and democratic ideals.  Nearly 1 million Greeks have immigrated to  these shores and these children of the cradle  of democracy have made America a better  place to live. No ethnic group has done more  to promote the principles of freedom and indi vidual opportunity than has the Greek-Amer ican community.  I am honored  to pay  tribute  today  to  the  people of Greece, whose culture adds  rich ness and stability to our country and whose  commitment to democracy strengthens us all.  ",1991
416,799,5,Mr. ROE.," Mr. Speaker, I want to thank and  commend the gentleman from Florida for organizing this Special Order on the 170th anniver sary of Greek independence from the Ottoman  Turkish rule and the restoration of democracy  to the  land  in which  it was born more  than  2,500 years ago.  It is  indeed a pleasure  for  me  to  join with my colleagues  in paying re spect and homage to both ancient and mod ern Greece and Greeks, who  fought  and  struggled to make liberty and ""democracy"" the rule of the people-the hallmarks and the  rallying cries of their civilizations.  In 51 O B.C.,  the citizens of Athens over threw the last of the tyrants who had ruled that  city for years on end, and created a new politi cal leadership, based on a limited democracy.  They created an assembly of free male citi zens, and elected magistrates  to  lead  their  city. These magistrates were fully accountable  to the assembly. Shortly the world was to wit ness what was to become known as the Gold en Age of Greece, where art, architecture,  drama,  literature, music, philosophy, political  theory, and science were to flourish. Pericles,  Plato, Aristophanes, Aeschylus, Democritus,  and Sophocles are just a few of the illustrious  Greek masters from that rich age who left their  imprint on Western society. Their  legacy  to  America can be seen daily in our monuments  and in our public buildings, in our statues and  in our theaters, and in our political institutions  and in the very fabric of our Constitution.  The model  of  democracy  that  Ancient  Greece  bequeathed  to  the United States'  founding fathers was returned in kind to mod ern Greece when the struggle for Greek inde pendence occurred during  the 1820's. The  modern Greeks had been ruled by the Otto man Turks for 500 years, and it was only to ward the end of the 18th century that the fight  for independence became a reality. The Amer ican  revolution was  the  role model  for  the  Greek one, and  the Greek commander  in  chief, in 1821, made these remarks to Amer ica:  Having formed the resolution to live or die  for you, we are drawn toward you, by a just  sympathy, since it is in your land that lib erty has fixed her abode, and by you that she  is prized, as by our fathers.  On March 25, 1821, 170 years ago,  the  people of Greece declared  their  independ ence, and  initiated a revolution against their  Turkish rulers. After repeated successful bat tles against the Ottomans, the countries of Eu rope joined the Greeks in their war against the  Turks. On September 14, 1829,  through  the  Treaty of Adrianople,  freedom and  independ ence  for Greece, after centuries of  foreign  rule, was regained.  Mr.  Speaker,  the Greek-American  inter relationship has a long and illustrious history.  The ancient Greeks left us a rich legacy, and  in  the modern era, Americans  traveled  to  Greece to fight alongside Greeks against the  Turks.  The Greeks  suffered  tremendously  under the rule of the Nazis, and United States  troops helped liberate them from those tyrants.  Following that defeat, we helped Greece stand  up against the  threat of communism. Today,  Greeks and Americans are partners in NATO.  Over the years, 1 million Greeks have immi grated  to America, enriching and providing  many contributions  to  the American way of  life.  On this anniversary of the beginning of the  struggle for Greek independence, it is only fit ting and proper  to pause  to  reflect on  the  magnificent achievements of both ancient and  modern Greece, and  to consider the  legacy  they have left to all Americans. Every time we  think of the democratic way of life, we owe a  debt of gratitude to the ancient Greeks, and  when we teach our children about the values  and  ideals of  the American Revolution and  what they have meant for America, we should  also  focus on  the accomplishments of  the  modern Greeks and Modern Greece  in their  struggle to be a free and independent nation.

423,812,5,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Speaker, it is  my great privilege to rise today in this,  the most democratic of institutions, to  honor  those  ancient  and  modern  Greeks who offered the precious gift of  Democracy to the world.  In just 5 days, people of Greek herit age  and  the Greek Orthodox  faith,  along with  freedom-lovers  the world  over, will celebrate the 170th anniver sary of Greek Independence Day.  On March 25, 1821,  the Greek people  rose  in  rebellion,  igniting  a  7-year  struggle for  independence  from more  than 400 years of foreign domination by  the Ottoman Turks. The  series  of  uprisings touched off on that historic  day soon led to a widespread revolution  that quickly attracted  international  support and respect.  Mr. Speaker, the Greek people sought  only the right to govern themselves, to  determine their own future,  to firmly  grasp  their destinies. There are  few  more precious rights than this, and it  is one treasured no less highly around  the world than it is here today in the  United States.  Vie are seeing a great resurgence of  democratic movements  around  the  globe. Unquestionably one of the most  significant events of the age was the  fall of the Berlin Viall and the reunifi cation of the two Germanys. On every  continent we  see popular movements  calling for the right of self-governance:  In Eastern Europe, in Asia, in the Bal tics, in Central and South America.  Everywhere we turn, people yearning  only to live free are sending for copies  of our Constitution. They want a true  and proven road map to Democracy.  Vie share with these people a great  debt  of  gratitude  to  the  ancient  Greeks, who forged the very notion of  Democracy. Of course, our Founding  Fathers drew heavily on this concept on the political and philosophical expe rience of ancient Greece-in forming  our Government and  in drafting our  Constitution and Declaration of Inde pendence. These documents now will  carry that message abroad again.  In many instances, that message will  be delivered to individuals still strug gling for  freedom,  still placing  their  lives on the line in their quest for De mocracy. It is my hope that these indi viduals will take inspiration not only  from the ancient Greeks, but from the  Greeks who rose in revolt in 1821 and  persevered for 7 arduous years.  Theirs  is a perfect example of the  ability of mankind to overcome all ob stacles-obstacles that often appear in surmountable-if the desire to succeed  is strong enough. Theirs is an example  that oppressed people  throughout the  world may look to and gain strength  from  in  their struggle  to overcome  their oppressors.  The United States, along with a coa lition of forces from the community of  nations, has only recently concluded a  struggle with a modern-day oppressor.  Saddam Hussein, bent on domination  of his smaller, weaker neighbor, Ku wait, was  forced  to  relinquish  his  dream of conquest.  It took the point of a gun to ensure  freedom  from  oppression  this  time.  Next time it may not because of the  willingness of this coalition of nations  to stand firm in defense of the rule of  law. Another would-be oppressor at an other  time may not be  so quick  to  launch his armies knowing the value  the international community places on  freedom.  Like Operation Desert Storm,  the  Greek war for independence was filled  with remarkable events by many peo ples  in a  common cause. The  roles  played by the Philhellenes-friends of  the Greeks-were instrumental to Europe's recognition of the importance of  the struggle.  The legacy of Lord Byron remains in delibly inscribed in the history of the  Philhellenes.  Byron's  name-carved  boldly into a column of the Temple of  Poseidon at Cape Sounion-is  testi mony  to his brave words  that awak ened not only his home country of Eng land to the plight of the Greeks, but  France, Russia, and other nations, as  well.  The pages of history speak as boldly  of other Philhellenes, too. The Klephts  swept down upon  the  invaders  from  their mountain strongholds. The sea  captains of Hydra broke the Ottoman  naval blockade of the Greek coast, and  today, generations of Greek merchant  seamen learn their trade appropriately  at the Academy of Hydra.  It was  all  these  people-and  the  Greeks  themsevles-this coalition,  if  you will,  of  like-minded  individuals  who saw clearly what was right and  who followed the flag of freedom raised  by a Greek Orthodox priest that very  special March day in 1821.  Mr. Speaker, more  than a century  later, Greece was again engulfed  in  conflict-this time along with the rest  of the globe during some of the darkest  days of Vlorld Viar II.  Indeed,  in the  spring of 1941, Nazi domination of the  European continent was nearly com plete.  Following  a  valiant  struggle  against overwhelmingly superior Ger man forces  in and among  the moun tains  to  the north, Greek forces had  been pushed entirely off the Continent  and were taking refuge on the Island of  Crete.  German  forces  looked  covetously  across the sea to Crete. If captured, it  would provide  them with air and sea  bases from which they could dominate  the eastern Mediterranean and launch  air attacks against Allied  forces  in  northern Africa. In fact, the Nazi high  command  envisioned  the  capture of  Crete to be the first of a series of as saults leading to the Suez Canal.  On May 20,  the largest German air borne attack of  the war commenced  against Greek,  Cretan  and British  forces, battle-weary and crippled after  the withdrawal  from  the mainland.  Vlaves of bombers pounded the Allied  positions followed by a  full-scale air borne assault. Elite paratroopers and  glider-borne  infantry units  fell  upon  the rag-tag Allied soldiers, who val iantly stood firm in the face of certain  defeat.  V/atching death descend upon  them  from  above,  the brave defenders of  Crete-having endured hours of vicious  bombing-decimated  the  crack Nazi  troops at two key airfields. However,  the Germans managed to gain a foot hold at a  third airfield and soon were  being resupplied and reinforced by air.  Seven days  later,  the defenders of  Crete-though clinging to their rocky  defensive  positions-knew  that  they  ",1991

428,825,5,Mr. WYLIE.," As I was saying, but for tunately  for us and  for  the pilot,  I  guess, at that point in time we were  landing, and the first thing we saw on  the ground was the runway, and he was  right on line. Obviously he had been  there many times before.   Another point that I think needs to  be made and reemphasized and reem phasized is when we went out to see  these oil wells, we were issued surgical  masks because of the acrid smell and  the fumes which irritated our eyes and  nose and throat, and I could not help  but be concerned about the long-term  effects on the people in that area. We  were  told that most of the people in  the  immediate area had been moved  out.  0 2000  But on days when the wind changed,  this awful acrid smoke went over the  city of Kuwait, and I cannot help but  imagine that it will have a long-term  health effect on  those people  living  there, and that we are going to have a  monumental health problem on our  hands.  I think that is a good enough reason  for us to try to speed up the process of  putting these oil well fires out to try  to help these people cope with the long term possible health effects it is going  to have on them and the environmental  damage that is obviously taking place.  Maybe we can get some people who are  concerned with environmental protec tion to help in this regard.  ",1991
429,825,5,Mr. WELDON.," Mr. Speaker, the gen tleman might note for the record that  the fields we visited were the Burgan  fields at Ahmedi. That was the specific  location of where we were, just for the  record, so that we have that additional  documentation there.  ",1991
430,825,5,Mr. WYLIE.," The gentleman is cor rect, and we do want  to have  that  available for everybody to see.  I think that it bears repetition that  we also went  through  torture cham bers. I was there. I went through the  torture chambers and saw some of the  instruments of torture which have been  so vividly described by our friend, the  gentleman from California, and it real ly takes a sick mirid to think up some  of these instruments of torture that we  saw.  We saw the pictures of the Kuwaitis  who had been tortured taken by a Ku waiti  citizen who  worked  at  the  morgue as the gentleman mentioned a  little ~rlier. He  took the pictures at  the danger of his own life actually and  brought them out and depicted a hor ror story one would not believe.  ",1991
431,825,5,Mr. WELDON.," Dr. Hamadi.  M.r. WYLIE. Dr. Hamadi,  right.  I  thought at the time if the Iraqis  had spent as much time thinking about  ways that they could better fight the  war than they did developing these in struments of torture they might have  done a better job of fighting the war,  but in any event, it depicts the sick  mind of  the people who  thought up  these instruments of torture.  I am very apprehensive  that  there  were a lot of people who had to carry  these tortures out, a lot of Iraqi sol diers, and what has happened in that  nation which has created this kind of  an atmosphere where you have many,  many people who are living in a coun try who would inflict this kind of inhu mane torture on other human beings.  Well, as we left the torture chambers,  as the gentleman mentioned, we saw  the huge  sandbox  layout which was  quite dramatic of Saddam's war plan.  One can see how completely wrong he  was.  He was  outfoxed  by General  Schwarzkopf  and American  fighting  men and women.  Then after that we went on through  the city, and as  the gentleman from  California mentioned a little earlier, in  that  is  an act of final evil, in a  final act of  evil, I guess is a better way to describe  it, we could see the giant holes in the  buildings which were put there by ar tillery shells for no reason, for no ap parent reason. I mean, they were leav ing  town or  trying to  leave  town  in  their vehicles, but  in any  event,  I  thought  to myself,  ""What kind of a  man could have the kind of a mentality  and what kind of people live in a coun try where such inhumane treatment is  practiced?""  After the meeting there, I went back  that night, and  the next morning  I  talked  to some other businessmen.  I  was able to talk to some Kuwaiti citi zens firsthand when we visited Kuwait,  but I was able to talk to some Kuwaiti  citizens at  the Kuwaiti Embassy  in  Bahrain.  I went  to  the Kuwaiti Embassy in  Bahrain to get a Kuwaiti flag, because  my granddaughters wanted to be able  to take a Kuwaiti flag to school and  share it with their fellow students. I  was not able to get one when I was in  Kuwait, but when I went there to get a  Kuwaiti  flag  for my granddaughters  and was identified as an American Con gressman, and  the place was heavily  guarded, but almost immediately, peo ple came around me, and as some of the  rest of the Members have said, ""God  bless George Bush. God bless Ameri cans."" They  took me  inside  the Ku waiti Embassy  in Bahrain and  there  showed me where I could go and get a  flag. I offered to pay for it. They kept  saying,  ""Thank Bush. Thank Bush.""  And they gave me the Kuwaiti flag and  asked me if I certainly would take that  back  to  the United States and brag  about it and share it with my grand daughters, which I did, of course. They  took it to the school and shared it.  But on another point that I wanted  to make, as  far as  the businessmen  being there, they had a legitimate con cern. Their way was funded by the Ku waiti Government.  There was  some  question  as  to  whether  the  trip  for American Con gressmen could be funded by the Ku waiti Government, and I guess there is  a rule against that, that a foreign gov ernment cannot fund a  trip for Mem bers of Congress, so the Fluor Daniel  Corp.  funded our way. Someone sug gested to me that that might be a con flict of interest, and I cannot see where  there is any conflict of interest.  How could there possibly be a con flict of interest? We were all there for  the same purpose. I mean, we could be  a member of the chamber of commerce  for American  businessmen. And  it  seems to me, are we not there to try to  help American businessmen get some  business?  ",1991
432,825,5,Mr. WELDON.," If I am not mistaken,  the ethics committee ranking member  and chairman both ruled on that before  we left and said that the arrangement  ",1991
433,838,5,Mr.  R.,"F. Mazurkiewicz  intermittently between  October 17 and November 5, 1990, have been  reviewed.  I have been  informed by LMSC  that insurance to cover the risks pertaining  to  pre-existing  environmental  contamina tion  is unavailable.  I have also been  in formed by LMSC that the cost of flight risk  insurance is $650,000 per year plus an addi tional $450,000 per launch, and I have deter mined  that  the cost  is prohibitive. Based  upon my review of the policies, LMSC's in surance to cover other than unusually haz ardous risks appears to be adequate. This ap proval  is granted on  the  condition  that  LMSC maintains  this  insurance  coverage  currently in force, or in the event that insur ance becomes impossible or impractical to  maintain, LMSC will immediately notify the  contracting officer.  9. The actual or potential cost, if any, of  the actions hereby authorized is impossible  to estimate since it is contingent upon the  remote possibility of an occurrence and the  extent of  loss  resulting from  such occur rence. Such an event may never occur; how ever, should a major incident occur, millions  of dollars of damage could result.  10. The cognizant NASA contracting offi cers may authorize the indemnification of a  LMSC subcontractor at any  tier. Any  re quest for  indemnification from first dollar  must be concurred in by the NASA Assistant  Administrator for Procurement.  11. I find that this action will facilitate the  national defense. In the remote event that li abilities resulting from the use of these prod ucts or services or the pre-existing environ mental conditions are in excess of the insur ance maintained  by LMSC  and  its  sub contractors, LMSC and its subcontractors'  continued existence could be placed in jeop ardy, and could make LMSC and  its sub contractors unavailable to continue to sup port space activities and the Department of  Defense.

434,851,5,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I wonder  if the Senator might yield for a couple  of questions.  ",1991
435,851,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Will the  Senator yield?  ,1991
436,851,5,Mr. NICKLES.,  yield.  ,1991
437,851,5,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I agree  with the Senator that Jordan commit ted real fault in siding with Saddam  Hussein in the war. I feel, as I believe  most Senators do, that Jordan has no  claim on our economic or military aid  as a result of that. Especially consider ing past history and the amount of our  aid they have received, I think it would  be wrong for them to expect now, based  on what they have done, that they have  some claim on American economic or  military aid.  Indeed, as chairman of the Foreign  Operations Subcommittee,  I will op pose such a claim.  I  think President  Bush has been absolutely right in sus pending economic and military aid. I  ask the Senator from Oklahoma if my  understanding  is  correct  that  since  February 6,  the President has cut off  all aid except for humanitarian aid?  ",1991
438,851,5,Mr. NICKLES., The Senator is cor rect.  (Mr. KOHL assumed the chair.)  ,1991
439,851,5,Mr. LEAHY.," And,  again,  I  think  President Bush is right. I think he has  used appropriate and commendable dis cretion. I commend the President for  doing it.  I will be happy  to  As  I understand from  talking with  the administration,  the President has  retained the ability to give refugee aid,  disaster assistance, and  food aid be cause of the enormous number of refu gees that are going into Jordan.  I believe what the administration has  done is shown what is basically the hu manitarian  nature  of  the  United  States, that we do not cut off refugees.  That is an entirely different situation  than  economic  and military  aid.  I  would assume the Senator from Okla homa agrees with the President, with  me and others that that is an appro priate gesture?  ",1991
440,851,5,Mr. NICKLES., The Senator is cor rect. Actually in our amendment we  exempt refugee assistance and we do  not touch any agriculture or food as sistance going into Jordan.  ,1991
441,851,5,Mr. LEAHY.,  I also understand  the  amendment repeals the fiscal year 1990  earma1ks?  ,1991
442,851,5,Mr. NICKLES., The Senator is cor rect.  ,1991
443,851,5,Mr. LEAHY.,"  I  think that is appro priate, too. Because if we did not repeal  those earmarks the irony is, no matter  now President Bush felt about this and  no matter how  the American people  felt about Jordan's action, he would  still have to send the fiscal 1990 eco nomic and military aid. So I think that  is an appropriate thing.  I also understand that the President,  if he felt it was necessary to resume  U.S. aid should there be a sudden shift  in Jordan's policy, he could do  that  through the normal notification proce dure, through the appropriate authoriz ing and appropriating committees. Is  that also correct?  ",1991
444,851,5,Mr. NICKLES., The Senator is cor rect.  ,1991
445,851,5,Mr. LEAHY.," This amendment actu ally has the benefit of giving the Presi dent the flexibility and the foreign pol icy tools that he needs, carrying out  policy in a way that I  think reflects  the views of the vast majority of both  Democrats and Republicans in the Con gress. I think it is a good amendment.  I think it ought to be accepted.  ",1991
446,851,5,Mr. NICKLES.," I thank my friend and  colleague from Vermont. I also appre ciate his assistance with this amend ment, that of his staff and also Senator  KASTEN and his staff for their coopera tion. We also had, as the Senator I am  sure is aware, some cooperation from  the State Department trying to craft  this.  Mr. President, it is not our intention  to handicap or  tie  the hands of the  President in any way whatsoever. We  have given the President flexibility in  this amendment. It is my desire and in tent to cut off any military assistance  for Jordan but we have also given the  President flexibility, if it is deemed in  the interests of the United States, if he  thinks Jordan is making a good-faith  effort and a positive contribution to ward the Middle East peace process, he  can come back to Congress and ask for  approval  from  those committees and  receive  assistance  and  basically  go  through the notification process, which  is standard. That is on  the military  side.  The President is also given flexibility  on economic assistance. He can certify  to Congress that he  thinks Jordan is  making a positive contribution toward  the peace process and go ahead and re lease the economic assistance. That is  $35 million on the economic assistance  and $20 million on the military assist ance.  Also, so my colleagues will know, the  amendment I originally drafted would  have banned all military assistance  that is in the pipeline. We have several  years of military assistance that has  not been  totally  spent. We  did not  touch that. You have to abrogate con tracts. My original amendment would  have done that. That was originally my  preference. Again we are trying to give  some flexibility  to  the President but  also at  the same  time  send a  very  strong  signal  that we  do  not  turn  around and just keep giving money to  governments  that  turn  around  and  blast the United States day after day,  in their home country, in their home  region, but also in the United Nations.  King Hussein, and I have met him, is  a very personable fellow. He has mar ried a very lovely American. We have  had him as a guest of the Senate a few  times, in my 11 years in the Senate. He  is  an  articulate  spokesman  for  his  country.  Most of us would  like  to consider  ourselves friends of King Hussein. But I  think we have to look at the current  situation and say, wait a minute, has  his remarks, has his voting record, has  his stance on the Persian Gulf crisis  been deserving of continued American  taxpayer generosity; and I say no.  As a matter of fact, the King's state ments have been very unhelpful toward  solving this problem. They have gen erated strife and animosity. They gen erated hatred. Instead of trying to cool  the hatred and the passions and the un rest in the Middle East, in many cases  the King's statements have done just  the opposite.  Mr. President, I have a copy of King  Hussein's speech and I will have that  printed in the RECORD. But I will just  highlight a  couple of his comments  which bothered  this Senator  and  I  would expect would bother all Sen ators.  I quote one section of it. It says,  quoting King Hussein:  The alternative to a cease-fire is the de struction of Arabs and Muslims-their hu miliation, their exploitation, the trampling  of their honor, pride, and legitimate hopes,  and hatred and strife between the nations.  Talking about the Iraqis:  To them, while we send our love and our  pride as they defend us all and raise the ban ner that says, ""God is great,"" the banner of  ",1991
447,864,5,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I offer  this amendment in the form of a sense of-the-Senate resolution. It calls upon  the Government of Syria to allow all  Syrian Jews to emigrate freely, to re lease  from prison Jews suspected of  having traveled illegally or planning to  do so, urges the administration to con tinue  to make known  to Syrian au thorities  the  important  role human  rights will play in our future negotia tions for peace in the Middle East.  Mr. President, the successful end of  the Persian Gulf crisis marks a new be ginning in our efforts to bring peace to  the Mideast.  The United States played the deci sive role in winning the war. We must  now play the decisive role in winning  the peace.  We must take full advantage of our  diplomatic  opportunities.  First, we  should urge the Arab States to make  peace with Israel. Israel is ready. But  it takes two to negotiate.  Mr. President, I am concerned with  the apparent impetus to place other is sues-issues such as relations with the  Palestinian Liberation Organization,  the future of the role of Palestinians  within Israel-to place these issues in a  priority ahead of pursuing  a whole  array of binational  negotiations  on  longstanding issu.es between Israel and  Arab States.  Mr. President, we should encourage  Arab States to begin at least taking  confidence-building steps that will sig nal their commitment to peace.  Syria will be a key player  in  the  process. In the confidence building cat egory, we should urge the Syrians to fi nally resolve the issue of Jewish emi gration.  Mr. President,  I am  introducing a  resolution  that calls on Syria  to do  just that.  Syria continues  to deny  the basic  human right of emigration to Syria's  4,000  Jews. This constitutes a  direct  violation of the Universal Declaration  of Human Rights to which Syria is a  signatory.  Jews suspected of having traveled il legally or even of planning  to do so  have been arrested,  interrogated, and  subjected to lengthy imprisonment.  Mr.  The  Syrian  secret  police-the  Mukhabarat--engages in 24-hour-a-day  surveillance of the Jewish quarter and  keeps a  file on every Jewish person.  The Mukhabarat monitors all contacts  between Jews and foreigners. Mail  is  read and phone conversations are wire tapped.  As a means of reducing the financial  liquidity of all Syrian Jews, and there by,  their mobility, Mukhabarat  ap proval is required for the purchase and  sale of property by Jews in Syria.  The religious and lay leaders of the  Jewish communities must report regu larly to the Mukhabarat.  Mr. President, we must convince the  Syrians  that we  are deadly  serious  about  this basic human rights viola tion, and we must continue to urge the  administration to make known to Syr ian authorities the important role that  human rights  in  the Jewish commu nity, especially the right to emigrate,  will play in determining future policy  toward Syria.  I urge my colleagues to send this im portant message by  supporting  this  resolution.  SIMON. Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent that I be listed as a  cosponsor.  ",1991
448,864,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  ",1991
449,864,5,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President,  I have  had the opportunity to visit the Jewish  ghetto in Damascus-and that is what  it is,  it is like  the ghettos were 200  years ago  in other cities around  the  world. It is an unbelievable situation. I  think any pressure we can put on Syria  to adopt a more enlightened policy is a  constructive thing.  Let me add one other thing where the  President pro tempore may differ with  me. But we have just gone through the  process again where you are begging  people for amendments. In the House,  if you do not have any amendments,  you move  immediately  to  final pas sage. I am not suggesting that we can  adopt precisely that but if, after an in terim period of maybe 15 or 30 minutes,  we do not have amendments prepared,  then it seems to me, unless  there  is  unanimous consent to the contrary, we  ought  to move  to  final passage. We  waste  just an  incredible amount of  time around here in quorum calls. We  will be in a quorum call from 2 to 4 in  the afternoon or something and then  we will be in session tonight passing a  bill.  I  think  a modification  of  the  House rule is a desirable thing.  I sympathize with the immediacy the  President pro tempore is faced with. I  know Senator BYRD  likes  these very  distinctive Senate rules and probably  disagrees with me on that. But Senator  BYRD  retains  the  right  to be wrong  once in a while.  ",1991
450,864,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Sen ator from West Virginia [Mr. BYRD] is  recognized.  ,1991
451,864,5,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, the distin guished Senator from Illinois is overly  charitable. The Senator from West Vir ginia is often wrong, but not about the  Senate rules.  Mr.  President,  the  two  sides  are  ready to accept the amendment by ",1991
452,864,5,Mr.  GRAHAM.,  ,1991
453,864,5,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," If there  is no further debate, the question is on  agreeing to the amendment.  The amendment (No. 57) was agreed  to.  ",1991
454,864,5,Mr. GRAHAM.," Thank you, Mr. Presi dent.  ",1991
455,864,5,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, patience is  a virtue. I suppose that is about the  only virtue I have. But the motion that  the Senator has suggested, the distin guished Senator from Illinois has sug gested, is an appealing one on its sur face,  and  I am  tempted  to move  to  third reading just to demonstrate how  unwise that motion would be right at  this point.  I am not saying that there might not  come a time that I would move to third  reading.  I  think  the  last  time we  moved to third reading was on a mo tion of mine several years ago when I  moved  to  third reading and  I  think  that was the first time in many, many  years that that motion had ever been  made here in the Senate.  But if I were to move to third read ing,  for example, right now,  I would  catch 10 Senators away from the Hill.  They have gone down  to  the White  House and they will not be back until  20 minutes after 1.  So, I have to consider the situation  in which our colleagues are currently  found. So if I were to move now to go  to third reading, those Senators would  miss a vote or  they would be called  back to the Hill. There are situations  in which Senators are unavoidably de layed in getting to the floor.  I do not think the Senate rules are  our problem, basically. The problem  here is the campaign financing si tua tion in which Senators have to be kept  away  from  the Senate-and also  it  would hold true with the House-kept  away from the Senate, from their com mittee work, from the floor work, from  being with  their  families, but  they  have to engage in the mad money chas ing all around  the country  to  raise  funds in order to stay in public service.  That is not the worst part of it. We  are in hock  to  these special interest  groups. We are slaves to some of the  lobbying groups. I do not have to name  names, but I could. There are certain  lobbying groups in  this country that  wield an  influence over  this Senate  greatly out of proportion to the num bers that they represent. That is the  problem with the Senate.  I will be happy to yield.  ",1991
456,864,5,Mr. SIMON.," If the Senator will yield,  I agree with him completely on  the  campaign finance reform. We are cor roding our system with  the present  ",1991

I think the House may go out  before much longer,  in which case it  will be  tomorrow morning before  the  House can meet and appoint conferees.  I just urge my colleagues to let us get  on with the action on the bill.

485,877,5,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. President, I  thank  my dear friend, the distinguished sen ior Senator from West Virginia, for his  kind accommodation.  Mr. President, in Congress sometimes  we witness change and sometimes we  help cause  it. Sometimes change oc curs dramatically, and other times sub tly. Sometimes change occurs by force;  sometimes change occurs by evolution.  ",1991
486,890,5,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  as cosponsor of the amendment offered  by the Senator from New Mexico to en sure that pregnant women, infants, and  young children are not the victims of  changes adopted yesterday to the milk  price  support program. This amend ment would repeal these modifications  if over 50,000 people are forced out of  the WIC Program as a result of an in crease in milk prices that may result  from these changes.  Mr. President,  the amendment  the  Senate adopted yesterday as offered by  the Senators  from Vermont  signifi cantly changed the dairy price support  program.  it  is  unlikely  that  this  change will go unnoticed by consumers  or by  the Government program  that  buys milk for needy children.  The  Leahy-Jeffords  amendment  raised the price paid for fluid milk by  roughly 30 percent. When asked why  this increase would not trigger an im mediate and proportional  increase  in  consumer prices,  the sponsors pointed  at price gouging by the middleman. Ac cording  to  the  sponsors,  consumer  prices didn't fall when the price paid to  farmers  dropped  last  summer,  so  consumer prices would not go up now,  when the price paid to farmers goes up  again.  Mr. President, we do not have any  idea what actually will happen to milk  prices. There have not been hearings on  this proposal. As far as I know, there is  no  serious economic analysis of  the  amendment's  implications. Retailers  and growers have contacted me to indi cate they expect milk prices to raise  S0.40 per gallon. The bill's sponsors say  they would not increase at all. Whom  do you believe? I would suggest that  the burden of proof is on  those who  would content that normal economic  laws somehow would not apply to this  milk price increase. The Senate's ac tion yesterday was based on wishful  thinking. If we were wrong, if the spon sors of the bill were wrong, the poor of  this country will not only pay more for  a  product  fundamental  to a healthy  diet, but poor infants will have to be  dropped from the WIC Program because  its limited funding cannot cover a milk  price increase for all its current bene ficiaries.  Mr. President, if milk prices increase  by  the 40  cents or more  that some  project, as many as 75,000  to 100,000  pregnant women,  infants, and young  children will have to be dropped from  participation in the WIC funding Pro gram. Others contend that there will  be no increase in consumer milk prices  and the WIC Program will not have to  drop anyone. If they are correct, this  amendment will have no effect. This  amendment is an insurance policy for  pregnant women, infants and children  dependent on WIC in case they are not  correct. If they are wrong, if prices do  rise, and  if the price  increases force  WIC to cut off more than 50,000 partici pants, the dairy modifications adopted  yesterday will be  repealed and chil dren's health and nutrition will be pro tected.

487,890,5,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I  rise in  support of the amendment offered by  the distinguished ranking member of  the  Senate Budget Committee. As  someone with the longstanding inter est and involvement in the Federal nu trition effort, I share his concern about  the impact on the WIC Program of the  amendment offered earlier by the Sen ator from Vermont.  The Congressional Research Service  estimates that 112,500 fewer women, in fants,  and children would be  served  each month by the program under the  dairy provisions authored by the Sen ator from Vermont.  WIC has a proven track record. Study  after study has demonstrated the im pressive health and nutritional benefits  it provides to the women, infants, and  children who participate in it. They are  among the most vulnerable members of  our population, and we should protect  them against a measure  that could  have such a negative effect on  their  health and nutritional status.  I  therefore urge my colleagues  to  support the amendment offered by the  distinguished ranking member of the  Senate Budget Committee.  ",1991
488,890,5,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President,  I am  joining my friend from New Mexico in  his effort to ensure that the all-impor tant  Special  Supplemental  Feeding  Program for Women, Infants, and Chil dren-or WIC-is  not  inadvertently  caused considerable harm by the Leahy  dairy amendment  that was approved  yesterday by the Senate. Hence, I am  voting against the motion to table the  Helms, and therefore, Domenici amend ment.  First of all, I would like to say that  I am sorry to see two well-intentioned  efforts---one meant to help dairy farm ers now under fiscal pressure, and one  meant to preserve important nutrition  funding  for mothers and children-at  loggerheads with one another. There  are dairy farmers in my State, and I  am concerned about  their ability  to  maintain  their  farms. Likewise,  the  WIC Program is extremely important  to my State, and I am concerned about  making sure the program can reach eli gible persons. But I think we acted too  hastily on the Leahy amendment.  I did not support the dairy amend ment. While  it seemed simple on its  face,  its impact is far from clear. In deed,  should  it exacerbate  surpluses  and reduce demand, it could hurt not  only dairy processors and consumers,  but also the very dairy farmers that it  is intended to help. We simply do not  know  if  the Leahy amendment will  help or hurt dairy farmers.  However, one thing that is far clearer  is  the negative  impact  that a milk  price  increase would  have  on  both  dairy processors and consumers. That  is where the WIC Program comes in,  and I would like to focus on this as pect.  Under the dairy amendment approved  yesterday, it is very likely that the re tail price of milk would go up. It is not  unanimous, but that is the conclusion  of  USDA,  dairy  processors,  and  consumer groups. That means consum ers---particularly those of low income would pay more for milk. That also  means additional costs for those nutri tion programs, such as WIC,  that in clude milk as a basic component of  their food package.  As my colleagues know, the WIC Pro gram provides food vouchers to low-in come pregnant women, women with in fants, and children under 5 who are at  risk of serious nutritional deficiencies.  As my colleagues also know, WIC  is  easily one of our best and most cost-ef fective programs. For every $1 invested  in WIC, we save about $3 in long-term  health care costs. And with WIC, we  reach children at  the critical early  stages of development.  We recognize the benefits of WIC, and  that is why every year when Senator  DECONCINI and I spearhead the drive for  increased WIC funding, we get an over whelming,  bipartisan  response  from  our colleagues. Last year 82 of us wrote  to the Appropriations Committee ask ing for an increase in WIC moneys, and  I am pleased and grateful that the com mittee did just that.  One more  recent event: Five  cor porate chief executive officers appeared  before a House committee to strongly  support WIC.  They  called WIC  the  health care equivalent of a  triple-A  rated  investment  and  endorsed  full  funding for WIC.  I mention this background on WIC  because I want to emphasize the over whelming success of, and support for,  the WIC Program.  Milk is an integral part of the WIC  food  package. According  to USDA's  Food and Nutrition Service, fluid milk  accounts for over 23 percent of WIC  food package costs.  Indeed, WIC par ticipants consume over 150 million gal lons of milk every year. Thus, it should  come as no  surprise  that USDA has  noted that ""the impact of any signifi cant rise  in dairy prices on  the WIC  Program would be very significant and  detrimental.""  So  the widely-expected  increase  in  the retail price of milk from the dairy  amendment would hit WIC hard. A re cent analysis by USDA estimates that  a milk price increase of 10 cents per  gallon would cost the WIC Program $15  million in the next fiscal year. Accord ing to USDA, a 10-cent increase would  reduce the monthly food packages by  400,000-that means 35,000 fewer women,  infants, and children would be served  each month.  ",1991
489,903,5,Mr. BURDICK.," Mr. President, I have  reviewed  the provisions cited by  the  Senator from Nebraska.  I agree that  the language included in the fiscal 1991  Agriculture Appropriations Act does  not  allow  the Department  of Agri culture to ignore the provision of the  1990 farm bill requiring USDA to estab lish a separate ASCS appeals division.  The farm bill provision cited by the  Senator mandates the restructuring of  existing agency resources and person nel, and thus does not violate the pro hibition  included  in  this year's agri culture appropriations act  that pre cludes the creation of any new office at  USDA not supported by an advance ap propriation.  ",1991
490,903,5,Mr. KERREY., I thank the chairman  for his interpretation and I urge  the  Department of Agriculture to adhere to  the mandate from Congress.  ,1991
491,903,5,Mr.  BUMPERS.,"  I  thank  Senator  KERREY and Senator BURDICK for rais ing this important issue and for clari fication that section 640 of the fiscal  year  1991  agriculture  appropriations  act should not be interpreted as prohib iting the implementation of the ASCS  appeals process as outlined in the 1990  farm bill.  A few years ago, farmers in Arkansas  were caught in a nightmare of inaction  by the existing ASCS appeals process  and al though most of the farmers were  eventually  exonerated,  the  lengthy  delays forced many farmers out of busi ness. The lesson of that example, and  others, led me to applaud the work of  Senator KERREY and my colleague from  Arkansas, Senator PRYOR, for language  in  the 1990  farm bill  to establish an  ASCS appeals process that will remove  most of  the obstacles  that  farmers  have had in obtaining a speedy and pro cedurally correct means to address any  grievance or complaint they may have  with an action by ASCS.  During  recent hearings before  the  Appropriations Subcommittee on Agri culture, Rural Development and Relat ed Agencies, I submitted questions to  ASCS to determine their intent to im plement this program. Although I have  not received a formal response to my  questions, all indications are that the  answer will be no. In fact, a number of  farm periodicals have already reported  that ASCS plans not to put the new ap peals process in place.  Mr. President, I believe that a failure  of ASCS to provide this Nation's farm ers with the appeals process as outlined  in the 1990 farm bill will be seen as a  breach of faith by farmers who looked  to this new process as a necessary tool  to deal with a very  large and com plicated Federal agency.  ",1991
492,903,5,Mr. BURDICK.," I  thank the Senator  from Arkansas  for his  remarks and  agree that farmers need an appropriate  forum for fair and equitable review of  agency actions. As I have stated, the  provision of the 1990 farm bill  to de velop this new procedure should not be  read as to apply to section 640 of the  fiscal year 1991 agriculture appropria tions act. As  the Senator points out,  the farm bill requires the program be  developed and is not so much the cre ation of a new office as it is the ref ormation of an existing practice.  ",1991

494,903,5,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, I would  like to commend the Committee on Ap propriations on its effort to include in  the  supplemental  appropriations bill  before us additional funding for the ad ministrative  expenses  of  the Unem ployment Insurance Program. Due  to  the  recession,  unemployment  claims  have increased far beyond the level an ticipated when the fiscal year 1991 ap propriations  bill was  being  drafted.  Several weeks ago, I initiated a letter,  signed by 11 of my colleagues, calling  on the committee to provide as much  as  twice  the $100 million which  the  President had requested. We asked for  this higher amount because the state  agencies which administer the program  believe they may need as much as $200  million to provide benefits on a timely  basis to people in need.  Congress has a habit of underfunding  the administrative expenses for the Un employment  Program.  Supplemental  appropriations  for unemployment  in surance administrative expenses have  been required in 10 of the past 18 years.  It is difficult  to predict  the  future  course of the economy. So  it really  should not be surprising that the Ap propriations Committee have difficulty  estimating accurately  the amount of  administrative  funding  that will  be  needed over the course of the year.  For  this  reason,  I and my 11  col leagues asked the committee  to con sider legislating a contingency reserve  fund, to be drawn upon in the event the  committees' projections are wrong.  I  remind Senators  that the Unemploy ment  Insurance Program more  than  pays  for  its own administrative  ex penses; last year the administrative ac count of the UI trust fund generated a  surplus of about $1 billion. These reve nues are being used to hide the size of  the overall fiscal deficit while unem ployed people are  forced  to wait be tween 4 and 6 weeks before receiving  their unemployment checks. This  is  unacceptable.  So while I was pleased that the com mittee appropriated $150 million, and  the White House has agreed  to des ignate this as emergency funding-in deed  I wrote  to  the President  last  month to ask him to do just that-I am  concerned that the $150 million is on  the  low  range  of what  the  states  project their needs  to be. Unemploy ment insurance is the first line of de fense in our society's safety net. The  Unemployment  Insurance Program  is  not the place to scrimp or cut corners.  Companies and workers  finance  this  program directly; the least the Federal  Government can do is ensure that the  program  delivers  the  benefits when  they are needed. During a recession, an  unemployment check is sometimes the  only thing that stands between a per son and foreclosure or even hunger.  For this reason, I continue to believe  strongly that Congress should include  in  this  supplemental  appropriations  bill a  contingency reserve  fund. The  language  I propose would provide an  additional $30 million  in  fiscal year  1991 for every 100,000 person increase in  the average weekly insured unemploy ment  level-including  a  pro  rata  amount  for any  increment  less  than  100,000---above the 3.345 million level as sumed  in  the President's fiscal year  1992 budget request. The moneys would  be appropriated from the employment  security administration account of the  unemployment trust fund.  This is similar to the way the Social  Security system provides for adequate  administrative expenses. I would sub mit that there is an even greater need  for a contingency fund in the UI Pro gram, since it is much harder to pre dict the number of unemployed persons  a year in advance than it is to predict  the number of Social Security bene ficiaries. The former is a  function of  the notoriously unpredictable business  cycle; the latter is primarily a function  of demographics.  It has been my intention to offer an  amendment to the supplemental appro priation bill establishing such a contin gency reserve; however, it is my under standing that the distinguished chair man of the Appropriations Committee,  Senator BYRD,  and  the distinguished  chairman  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Labor, Health and Human Services and  Education,  Senator  have  agreed to pursue this proposal and ad dress it in the fiscal year 1992 appro priations bill. On the basis of these as surances from  the distinguished Sen ators I will withhold my amendment at  this time.  ",1991
495,903,5,Mr. HARKIN.," I would like to thank  the Senator for his courtesy  in  this  matter. He  and his  colleagues have  identified a  legitimate problem area  and put  forward an  interesting and  promising proposal. As he knows,  in  our review of this proposal, we have  had  favorable consultations with  the  Congressional Budget Office with re spect  to how such a  contingency re serve fund would be scored as part of  the budget. I regret, however, that the  administration's lack of support  for  this provision could slow down the sup plemental appropriation bill. Neverthe less, I want to assure the Senator from  HARKIN,  ",1991
496,929,5,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, I would  bet every Senator has had more than  his fill of debate over capital gains. It  seems we've had  to fight  this battle  every year since the capital gains ex clusion was repealed as part of the 1986  Tax Reform Act.  In the last Congress we went through  a long and difficult debate over capital  gains. As the 102d Congress unfolds, it  seems we'll have to go through the de bate again. Those of us who support re ducing the tax are readying our argu ments, as are those on the other side.  And  all  the  time we're debating,  long-term investment is suffering and  taxpayers are subjected to a  tremen dously unfair tax.  This year, when President Bush in cluded capital gains reduction in his  State of the Union Address there was a  near audible  sigh of  relief  in  some  quarters, and of derision in others.  Some opponents of a capital gains re duction criticized the President for of fering up,  in  their words, ""the same  old, tired policies of the past.""  Perhaps it's not the policies but the  politicians who are old and tired.  In any case, I  think it's ironic that  the President  should be  accused  of  bringing back  failed proposals when  the only  thing  failed about  them  is  that  they couldn't overcome certain  powerful interests in the Congress, par ticularly  in  this body, while at  the  same  time his accusers are bringing  back  their own defeated and discred ited policies, such as  job quotas and  higher taxes.  Senators and Congressmen and Con gresswomen may be  tired of this de bate, but the American people are fed up. They are fed-up with talk. They are  fed-up with paying  taxes on capital  gains that are due solely to inflation.  You know what's really sad? No mat ter how it turns out,  if we continue  down the present course we'll be back  at it  in  the 103d Congress,  and  the  104th, and so on. If we pass a broad, flat  exclusion with a 1-year holding period  this year, some body will try to repeal  it next year.  And it'll only be a matter of time be fore  they succeed. Maybe  it'll be re pealed as part of another major tax re form. Maybe it'll be repealed as a sim ple revenue-raiser. Who knows? What I  do know is that it'll be repealed again  on some sad day.  And if we cannot pass a simple cap ital gains exclusion this year we'll try  again next year, and  the year after  that, and the year after that until we  succeed.  Whatever happens, as long as we re main stuck on a broad exclusion for 1year capital gains, the issue will never  be settled, and taxpayers and our econ omy will continue to suffer.  So, what's the solution? How do we  get out of this unproductive cycle?  Simple, index capital gains for infla tion as the bill I am introducing today  along with  Senators CRAIG,  COATS,  COCHRAN, LOTT, and KASTEN proposes.  And give an exclusion  for all assets  that are held for 5 years or more, as  the bill introduced by my fellow Ida hoan, Senator CRAIG, proposes.  I think a large majority of the Sen ate could agree to both indexing and a  long-term  exclusion. This would  re move a great unfairness  in  the Tax  Code-the taxation of inflationary cap ital gains-and would encourage long term investment.  My bill does  two  things. First and  foremost,  it indexes capital gains for  inflation. When a  taxpayer buys and  later resells an asset, he  figures his  capital gains  tax liability. The  infla tion that occurs between the time he  buys the asset and the time he sells it  is reflected in the sale price. Part of  the capital gain reflects a real increase  in its value. But part of the gain re flects the increase in the general price  level. This part of the gain isn't real,  it's a phantom, and  it shouldn't be  taxed.  Capital gains indexing would mean a  taxpayer would owe tax on the increase  in the asset's value, not on its infla tion-distorted price.  To see how indexing works, suppose  you bought a grocery store for $100,000  and you  resold  it 20 years  later for  $250,000. Suppose  inflation averaged 4  percent a year over the period, and the  statutory  tax  rate was  28  percent.  ",1991
497,942,5,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. President,  it goes without saying that the Amer ican people are dissatisfied with their  health care. We have problems of ac cess: One in eight Americans have no  health insurance protection, public or  private. We have problems with costli ness: Insurance premiums and benefit  costs  continue  to  rise  at alarming  rates.  As cochair of  the Pepper Commis sion, I can say that the problems of our  system are agreed upon and well under stood. The challenge now  is how  to  span  the gap between where we are  today, and where we want to be next  year and 10 years from now.  Today, I am introducing legislation  which I hope will be the first plank in  a crosswalk which will bridge the inad equate system we now have, to the im proved  system  the American people  want, and deserve.  I am introducing along with Senator  McCAIN and Senator WALLOP the Amer ican Health Security Act of 1991. This  legislation will help address the issue  of America's uninsured by adding es sential consumer protection standards  into the private health insurance mar ket as it relates to employees of small  businesses.  I invite my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to join me in cosponsoring  this  legislation. This  is a bipartisan  issue and I believe I have crafted a so lution that has great bipartisan appeal.  Today,  over  30 million Americans  lack heal th insurance protection. They  are vulnerable not only  to  the high  costs of medical care, but their very  economic security can be  threatened  by the expense of a major illness.  Significantly, most of the uninsured  are not jobless. It has been estimated  that 70 percent of the uninsured, or  about 20 million people, are either em ployed workers or  the dependents of  workers. Further,  three out of every  four working uninsured  persons  are  employed in small businesses, with the  biggest gap  in heal th  insurance cov erage  occurring  in  companies with  fewer than 25 employees.  Why  is this the case? Is it because  small employers do not want to offer  this important fringe benefit to their  ",1991
498,1020,5,Mr.  JEFFORDS.," Mr. President, be fore our sense of pride and relief over  the Mideast conflict  fades  from our  memory, we should reflect on some of  the underlying causes of that war. Pri mary among these is oil and our desire  to preserve political stability in a re gion with huge  reserves of  this  re source.  Today we are introducing a proposal  to phase in the replacement of gasoline  with  domestic,  nonpetroleum  re sources. I am joined by Senators Do MENICI,  WIRTH,  BURDICK,  BURNS,  DASCHLE, CONRAD, SHELBY, CRAIG, SEY MOUR,  REID,  KERREY,  AKAKA,  and  BINGAMAN.  I've long held an interest in energy  issues, partly from my upbringing in  oil-dependent New England, and partly  from my experiences as a young naval  officer aboard one of the first U.S. ves sels through the reopened Suez Canal  in 1957. Each experience taught me the  inherent advantages  to domestic en ergy resources, an intuition that has  recently been reinforced.  Our recent victory will not end our  problems of oil dependence-it only  In  emphasizes how perilous our situation  remains. Cultural differences and huge  disparities of income cannot help but  lead to more oil interdictions.  Recently,  I had  the opportunity  to  ask Admiral Crowe,  the  immediate  past Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, how important it is to become  energy independent. He replied, ""It is  extremely important. We must become  energy independent even if it results in  a serious reduction in our standard of  living."" The program I am proposing  today will allow us to reach that goal.  And, it will do so with no significant  change  in our standard of living.  fact, it could improve it.  The proposal I will describe today is  not new or Johnny-come-lately. I first  introduced it in the 96th Congress, it  garnered over 100 cosponsers, and was  incorporated as title 5 of the House En ergy Committee's omnibus energy bill  before the bottom fell out of the price  of oil.  I've reintroduced it each session of  Congress since then, during which time  we've  reaped  the  benefits  and  det riments of cheap foreign oil without  taking any significant action  in  the  way of national energy strategy.  In brief, the bill guarantees a market  for alternative and replacement fuels  independent of the price of oil. It calls  on refiners to substitute a  fixed per centage of their total motor fuel prod uct with nonpetroleum, domestic fuels.  A market credit program, a reversal of  sorts to the program under which we  eliminated lead from gasoline, is estab lished to ease the  transition and en courage  the  least-cost  options. All  fuels compete on a  level playing field  with no new subsidies. Candidate fuels  include, but are not limited to, etha nol, methanol, natural gas, electricity,  and liquids from coal or oil shale.  Mr. President, scores of studies re veal the extent of our domestic energy  resources. Clearly oil production alone,  given  that our  total proven reserves  are only equal  to about 5-years con sumption at current rates, will never  bring us to oil independence. For the  record, let me review my understand ing of those which are potential alter native and replacement transportation  fuels.  Biomass alcohols include both etha nol and methanol. A July 1990 GAO re port showed that a  tripling of today's  ethanol capacity can be accomplished  with  relative ease by  the year 2000.  Such action would help establish the  land base, refinery capacity, and dis tribution system for a cellulous-based  biomass industry, which recent reports  estimate will  become  cost-effective  around the turn of the century.  Based on DOE research and projec tions, and from that which I have per sonally observed at its research center,  all of the requirements of my bill can  be met with biomass alcohols, although  nothing  in my bill dictates such an  outcome.  Our most abundant domestic  fossil  fuel  resource is coal, followed by oil  shale. My  proposal  includes  liquids  from  these  resources  as  candidate  transportation fuels, either as a refin ery-blended  crude-equivalent,  or  as  converted methanol or gasoline.  Much progress has been made in im proving  the  conversion  efficiency of  coal to liquids. A pilot project in Ohio,  which  I  recently visited,  achieves a  thermal conversion efficiency above 80  percent  in a  closed system, yielding  clean gases  for methanol  and  elec tricity generation. A clean coal tech nology demonstration plant  in Wyo ming will convert coal to two products,  one solid and one liquid.  These processes,  in addition to  im proving the efficiency of coal utiliza tion, render clean energy products that  help with  the sorts of problems we  grappled with during Clean Air Act re authorization  last  year.  The  tech nologies we develop will not only help  in meeting clean air targets, but will  help other countries, such as China and  the Soviet Union, more efficiently use  their vast coal reserves.  Natural gas is a promising transpor tation  fuel,  as demonstrated by  the  number of initiatives to encourage its  use in private fleets, urban buses, and  large trucks. While projections of our  domestic resource base of natural gas  is somewhat debatable right now, espe cially considering increasing estimates  of coal-bed methane, my bill will en courage efforts to utilize natural gas as  a  transportation  fuel,  but will not  mandate it.  Progress on battery technologies for  electric vehicles has been promising,  and with a new public-private research  effort having recently been announced,  further progress is likely. My program  includes the use of electric vehicles.  Other potential candidate  fuels  in clude propane, hydrogen, fuel cells, and  solar energy.  Allow me to briefly describe our pro posal. First, potential  nonpetroleum  fuels are defined under two broad defi nitions. ""Alternative fuels"" are those  fuels  not  suitable  for  being  incor porated into gasoline and for which dis tinct engines are required. These  in clude natural gas,  propane, and  the  ""neat"" alcohols.  ""Replacement fuels"" are those that  are capable of being mixed with gaso line and used in today's gasoline en gines. These include gasohol, the ether  blends, including the methanol or etha nol constituents, and  liquids derived  from coal, shale, or tar sands.  Under this bill, all of these fuels are  treated equally, based on their relative  energy content.  Under the program, beginning in 1996,  refiners of motor fuels would be  re quired to substitute an increasing per",1991
499,1033,5,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, recently,  I had the opportunity to read a presen tation of Commissioner Catherine M.  Abate, who heads the New York City  Department of Probation, before  the  City Club of New York.  Her call for prevention and construc t! ve efforts seems to me to be so o bvi ously sound it hardly needs to be repeated. And yet, we know we are not  paying attention to this.  I  thought  one  of  the  items in her speech was:  interesting  Over 50 percent of our probationeers come  from the City's poorest neighborhoods. The  average probationer is a minority male, be tween the ages of 16 and 25, placed on proba tion for drug-related felony offense. He  is  abusing either drugs and/or alcohol. A high  school dropout and unemployed, he is func tionally illiterate with few, if any, job skills.  Commissioner Abate  is  the kind of  humanitarian  leader  I would  expect  from Mayor David Dinkins, a leader for  whom I have great respect.  But the practical suggestions of com munity involvement, sensitivity to the  victims, and better monitoring of of fenders is a sound recommendation.  I insert her remarks into the RECORD  at this point.  The remarks follow:  PROBATION PROMOTING PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE  NINETIES  (Remarks by Catherine M. Abate)  Never before has this nation and this City  been challenged on so many fronts. We are  waging one war across our waters, the re sults of which will have a profound effect on  the City for years to come. With the same  determination,  resolve  and  resources, we  must fight our war against crime, drug abuse  and violence at home. It is time for us to  press our cause in Washington and through out the State. It is time for us to say ""Mr.  President, you speak of freedom and human  rights abroad, then let us speak of the same  freedom of each and every citizen to live in  their homes and walk through their neigh borhoods free from fear and violence."" 1991  must mark the time when we in government,  joined with communities  throughout  this  City, act with clarity, vigor and conviction.  Together we must meet the challenge to re store and maintain public safety.  According to the National Institute of Jus tice, last year there were more than 1,000,000  Americans aged 18 years and over in prison  and jail in the United States, and more than  2,500,000 on parole and probation. The grand  total under the control of the criminal jus tice system exceeded 4 million. That number  is nearly 2 percent of the nation's adult pop ulation.  We have seen the prison population more  than double in the last decade. Among the  nations of the world, the United States has  surpassed South Africa and the Soviet Union  in having the highest per capita ratio of its  population in prison.  In New York State alone  the number of  prison beds has doubled in the 1980's. The  City system has grown from 7,000 beds in 1980  to 21,000  today. Unfortunately those  incar cerated soon were replaced by too many oth ers on the street who were willing to follow  in their footsteps. Too many released from  prison returned to their communities no bet ter prepared to live a law-abiding life.  Today more persons are  incarcerated  in  New York State than ever before. Yet crime  has not diminished. Arrests for violent crime  are ever increasing. The percentage of juve niles arrested for felonies has dramatically  increased by 75 percent in  the  last  three  years.  We must ask ourselves, how can we meet  the challenge of crime's insidious and relent less assault upon the quality of life in our  City. We know that not all the solutions are  before us. But we have an opportunity  to  learn from our experiences in the 80's to de fine an action plan for the 90's. One lesson we  have learned is that the focus of our criminal  justice system-whether that be corrections,  the courts or probation-must involve more  than punishment and control. We must be in  the business of preventing crime and shaping  behavior. Prevention, treatment, and law en forcement must become the co-equal corner stones of a justice system that can begin to  effectively stem the tide of victimization.  Fiscal constraints will define future pol icy. It costs the City 58,000 dollars per year  to maintain a defendant at Rikers Island. To  construct an additional 5,500 beds will cost 1  billion dollars. Overtime costs in City Cor rection are currently at 61 million dollars or almost equalling the entire budget of the  New York City Department of Probation.  With escalating prison  costs,  jail over crowding and  increasing violence,  the role  that probation plays in the criminal justice  system becomes even more critical. On any  given day in New York City, over 60,000 peo ple are under our supervision. That is almost  three  times  the  number  incarcerated at  Rikers Island. In fact, more people are on  probation in New York City than are incar cerated in New York State correctional in stitutions statewide.  Over 50 percent of our probationers come  from the City's poorest neighborhoods. The  average probationer is a minority male, be tween the ages of 16 and 25, placed on proba tion for a drug-related felony offense. He is  abusing either drugs and/or alcohol. A high  school dropout and unemployed, he is func tionally illiterate with few, if any, job skills.  The mission of the Department is to pro mote public safety by providing community oriented criminal  justice sanctions and by  assisting the offender to remain in his com munity as a law abiding and productive citi zen. We must honor our contract with the  Courts and the community to violate those  individuals who fail to live up to the condi tions  of  their  probation. But  to  effect  change, probation must do more than proc ess people. We must offer meaningful serv ices and interventions.  To that end, we have developed a resource  delivery concept to enable the probation offi cer to provide  the appropriate services  to  more fully meet the needs of our probation ers. This model will  include medical and  mental health care, drug  treatment, voca tional training, job preparation, direct em ployment referrals,  literacy and  life skills  development. The Department has created a  network of community-based services to en hance the quality of supervision to offenders.  Other City agencies, as well as not-for-prof its, are cooperating in this effort.  We know that we must not only design pro grams to meet the specific needs of offend ers, but that these limited resources must be  directed to  those who present the highest  risk to society. We have strengthened our in tensive supervision programs to better mon itor high risk juveniles and adults.  We are establishing a Day Treatment Cen ter for  those probationers, who despite our  best efforts, are on the road to violating the  terms of their probation sentence. The Cen ter will provide probationers with an inten sive program of rehabilitative and remedial  services for up to 12 hours a day, five days a  week, for a period of 90 to 120 days. On site,  operating within the Center, will be a Board  of Education alternative school, a Depart ment of Employment Tap Center, and a De partment of Mental Health psychiatric so cial work clinic.

500,1046,5,Mr. GALLO.," Mr. Speaker, 1 O years ago, a  group of dedicated individuals under the direc tion of Edward Madara identified a real human  need in Morris County, NJ, and their effort to  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  solve a local problem has resulted in the cre ation of a national resource.  Working within  the health care profession,  Ed and his coworkers came  in daily contact  with people who did not know where to turn  during times of trauma in their lives.  In an effort  to guide people with special  needs to the best source of help and comfort  for them, the founders of the Self-Help Clear inghouse of St. Glares-Riverside Medical Cen ter compiled a list on a single sheet of paper  of some two dozen self-help organizations as  a service to medical center patients.  As the list was circulated, it grew to include  70 groups and was published, under a cor porate grant, as the first self-help directory in  New Jersey.  Today,  the American Self-Help Clearing house is still associated with the medical cen ter, but  it  is now national  in scope, helping  people to find mutual aid and support groups  for problems ranging  from addictions  to dis abilities, from illness to bereavement.  This model program has a long list of firsts  to its credit-the first clearinghouse to be com puterized, the first to provide statewide serv ice, the first to add a toll-free number.  Its computer software program, Mutual Aid  Self-Help Network  [MASHnet], developed by  the medical center's research and evaluation  department,  is used by  15 other clearing houses in the United States and Canada.  The clearinghouse staff members and vol unteers provide  information on  literally  thou sands of free, member-run groups to  tens of  thousands of callers a year, and when there is  a need not currently being met by an existing  self-help organization,  the clearinghouse will  help to establish new ones-more than 580  new groups so far.  The Self-Help Sourcebook, published by the  clearinghouse, describes more  than 600 na tional and model self-help groups and  lists  local and  regional clearinghouses, helplines,  and resources for rare disorders.  Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of the organi zation's 10th anniversary, I ask my colleagues  to recognize the pioneering efforts of Edward  Madara and  the staff of the American Self Help Clearinghouse, St. Glares-Riverside Med ical Center and, most especially, all of the vol unteers who have built  this network of self help and who keep  it running effectively  for  the benefit of all  individuals who need help  and consolation.  A TRIBUTE TO POLICE OFFICER  ALAN C. HALL  HON. JOAN KEil. Y HORN  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 20, 1991  ",1991
501,1046,5,Ms. HORN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute  to a man who served  the people of  Florissant, MO, as a police officer. Alan C.  Hall had a very distinguished career, receiving  commendations  from  the  Florissant Police  Chief on at least three occasions  in his 5112  years on the force.  Mr. Hall, who was 28 years old, shared his  commitment  to  law enforcement with his  fa ther, who is a retired St. Louis city patrolman,  March 20, 1991  and his two brothers who are both police offi cers. Those who worked with and knew Offi cer Hall held him in very high esteem. His un timely death has shocked and saddened our  community.  I extend my deepest sympathy to his family.  INCREASE CHARITABLE  DEDUCTIONS IN AUTOMOBILE USE  HON. lllOMASJ.DOWNEY  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 20, 1991  ",1991
502,1046,5,Mr. DOWNEY.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing  legislation to support the efforts of  people who volunteer their time in a charitable  manner, not for recognition, but for the greater  good of all. We must recognize that in recent  years, greater numbers of  individuals have  volunteered their services to help carry out the  exempt-purpose activities of charitable organi zations, such as Scouting and other youth ac tivities, providing meals to the homeless or el derly, et cetera. In many instances, these vol unteers incur actual out-of-pocket expenses in  rendering services to charities, such as where  an individual uses his or her own car in deliv ering meals to the homeless or elderly on be half of a charity, and is not reimbursed for use  of the car for this purpose.  To support the efforts of these volunteers,  who do not receive any charitable deduction  for the value of their contributed services, I be lieve  that the standard mileage rate allowed  for computation of the charitable deduction for  use of a passenger automobile  in providing  services to a charity should be increased to 12  cents per mile  in order to take  into account  additional out-of-pocket costs of operation.  As  chairman  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Human Services of the Select Committee on  Aging, I have seen countless examples of so cial  service  programs  for  older Americans  which could not function without the voluntary  support of senior citizens. Many of these peo ple use their cars to give friends and neigh bors rides to hospitals, to go to senior centers,  or meal programs where they volunteer their  services. Others volunteer  their  time  to visit  frail elderly people who are unable  to  leave  their homes. This companionship  is  some times the only contact the frail individual has  with the outside world.  I can assure you that  these volunteers are not in  it for the money,  they give freely of their time. It seems only fair  that they are compensated  for the wear and  tear on  their vehicles. Earlier  this year  the  subcommittee held a hearing on transportation  services  for the elderly and  in the course of  that hearing  it became abundantly clear that  transportation is a vital link to assure that peo ple receive services to which they are entitled.  This bill is a step in the right direction.  ",1991
503,1072,5,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, on Saturday,  March 23, 1991, -the Figli di Colom~Sons  of Columbus~f Long Branch, NJ, will honor  one of its most distinguished members, Mr.  Joseph M. Ferraina, on  the occasion of  its  24th anniversary dinner and dance.  I am  proud to add my tribute to this fine educator  and very active member of our community.  Mr. Speaker,  it would  take up an entire  page of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD to simply  set forth,  in  list form,  the many associations  and achievements of Mr. Ferraina. I would like  to offer just a brief overview of some of his  public accomplishments.  Since 1982, Joseph M. Ferraina has served  with distinction as  the principal of  the Long  Branch Middle School, having previously been  an assistant principal. Prior to joining the ad ministrative  ranks  in  the Long Branch public  schools, he was a Spanish  teacher and an  athletic coach.  The  list of Mr. Ferraina's community and  professional affiliations is nothing less than as tounding. In addition to his membership in the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Long Branch Figli di Colombo Club, he is affili ated with numerous other Long Branch-based  organizations, including the Amerigo Vespucci  Society, the Rotary Club,  the Knights of Co lumbus Society, the Elks Club, the Columbus  Day Parade Committee,  the VFW Post,  the  Italian-American Memorial  Association,  the  Spanish Fraternity, the NAACP, SAFE Homes,  the chamber of commerce, the Municipal Alli ance Committee, the Monmouth Medical Cen ter Student Volunteer Program,  the Youth  Concerns Coalition Committee,  the First Aid  Squad and the  Independence Fire Company.  He is also actively involved with such organi zations as the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Coun cil,  the Junior League of Monmouth County,  the Tournament of Champions, the Monmouth  County Parks System, and a host of other pro fessional, academic, and philanthropic organi zations at the local, county, and State levels.  Mr. Speaker,  I believe  that  Joseph M.  Ferraina represents all that we can ask for in  a role model for today's youth. With his strong  communications skills and fluency in three lan guages-English, Spanish, and Italian-his ef fective managerial skills, his commitment to in dividual growth and knowledge, and, most im portantly, his tireless commitment to the bet terment of his community, Mr. Ferraina is an  exemplary educator and citizen.  THE SUM OF $96 MILLION FOR AL LIED  HEALTH  PROFESSIONS  TRAINING, H.R.  1466,  JUSTIFIED  BY  LACK  OF  FEDERAL  PRO GRAMS DURING THE PERIOD OF  1981-89  HON. EDWARD R. ROYBAL  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 20, 1991  ",1991
504,1072,5,Mr. ROYBAL.," Mr. Speaker, today I am very  pleased to join with my colleague, Represent ative BRUCE,  in his  introduction of the Allied  Health Professionals Promotion Act of 1991H.R. 1466-a $96 million  legislative commit ment to Federal training and education for the  allied health professions.  On March 4, 1991, the U.S. House of Rep resentative's  Select Committee  on  Aging,  which  I chair, held a hearing on ""Long-Term  Care Personnel:  Incentives For Training and  Career Development."" Several  findings con cerning the allied health profession were eluci dated at the committee hearing. First, no Fed eral funding programs were authorized to sup port allied health education during the period  of 1981  to 1989. Public Law 100-607,  the  Health  Professions Reauthorization  Act  of  1988, authorized $6 million, but only $737,000  was appropriated for fiscal year 1990. For fis cal year 1991, $1,659,000 was appropriated  for grants and contracts. This amount will  make  it possible to only provide continuation  support for seven grants and fund perhaps an other 10 new projects.  Second,  the current efforts  to  incorporate  care of the aged into allied health curriculum  are  inadequate and personnel shortages are  likely  to  persist and worsen  unless acted  upon.  In was  reported  that  the  Institute on  Medicine [IOM] report, ""Allied Health Services:  March 20, 1991  Avoiding Crises,"" found that the ratio of FTE  physical therapists to registered nurses is 1 :2  in rehabilitation hospitals compared with 1 :43  in acut~ care hospitals.  Third, the shortage of appropriately trained  faculty is a major barrier to curricular reform.  The IOM study concluded that improved edu cation in geriatric care would: First, aid in the  retention of existing practitioners; second, illu minate the rewards of geriatric career for stu dents and augment recruitment, and third, en courage more  faculty  to engage  in geriatric  service and clinical research relevant to long term care. This study underscores the need to  move forward with an initiative that addresses  the allied health personnel shortage.  The Allied Health Professional Promotion  Act of 1991 will: First, provide project grants to  those allied fields determined by the Secretary  to be  in short supply; second, provide allied  health student traineeships; third, provide ad vanced training of allied health personnel; and  fourth, authorize the establishment within the  Health Resources and Services Administration  an Advisory Council on Allied Health. By  the  fiscal year 1994, total funding for this initiative  will be $96 million.  Unless we are willing to tolerate access and  quality problems for Americans of all ages, the  current shortage of allied health personnel  must be addressed now, and future shortages  in  several health professions must be ad dressed before the end of the 102d session of  Congress.

505,1072,5,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, as communities  through our Nation prepare to welcome home  our victorious troops from the Persian Gulf, I  wish to take a moment to commemorate the  special sacrifices made by a family in my own  district. Many  families have more  than one  member serving  in  the gulf. More  than one  mother in this country had two sons in harm's  way. However, the Johnson family of Hunting ton, WV is special indeed. The Johnsons have  six  loved ones who participated in Operation  Desert Storm.  The Johnson  family members who served  with distinction in Desert Storm were: Pfc. Eric  Johnson, U.S. Army, Pfc. Mitchell Johnson,  U.S. Army, Pfc. Larry D. Wright, U.S. Army, S.  Sgt. Carl T. Johnson, U.S. Marine Corps, Sgt.  Brian  K.  Scott, U.S. Marine Corps,  and  D.M.S.-4 Joseph T. Johnson, U.S. Navy.  For one West Virginia  family  to give  so  much is truly commendable. When hearing of  the dangers faced by our troops, the Johnsons  had not one, but six loved ones over whom to  worry,  six  young men  for whom  to pray.  Thanks to the efforts of our outstanding mili tary leadership, the Johnsons are now looking  forward  to welcoming home six proud veter ans.  Though the extent of the Johnson family's  contribution  is  unequaled  in  number,  it  is  ",1991
506,1085,5,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Chair man,  I yield  such  time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Cali fornia [Mr. LEHMAN].  LEHMAN  of California. Mr.  Chairman, I want to begin by thanking  the vice chairman of our committee  and the chairman of the Subcommitee  on Water and Power,  the gentleman  from California [Mr. MILLER],  for  the  job he has done in bringing this bill so  quickly to the floor.  Mr. Chairman, this is a modest piece  of legislation, but it is sorely needed  right now in California. In that regard  and with an eye toward bringing this  matter to a quick conclusion for  the  benefit of everyone in California,  the  gentleman from California  LER], myself, and other members of the  committee who from time to time have  disagreements about what water policy  ought to be or what farming practices  ought to consist of have put those dif ferences aside and attempted  to de velop a  consensus  approach  to  this  problem in California.  [Mr. MIL Mr.  As every Member of the House will be  aware of at the time we finish this de bate, we  are  in  our  fifth  year  of  drought, and as  the gentleman  from  California [Mr. MILLER]  indicated, the  rains we had over  the past week  in  California have been refreshing,  they  have nourished us, but they are cer tainly not going to mark the end of  this disaster, and even with adequate  rainfall for the rest of the year, it will  not undo the previous 4 years we have  had. The reservoirs will not be replen ished anywhere near what would be  substantial enough to head off a meas ure like this.  In cities and towns, particularly in  the San Joaquin Valley but in other  parts of the State as well, people have  been forced  to cut back consumption  by as much as 90 percent. Water deliv eries  to agricultural users have been  cut by 100 percent by the State water  project and 75 percent by the Federal  central valley project.  Fish and wildlife habitat has also  been seriously stressed by insufficient  water flows.  Allocations  of water  have  been  prioritized to protect  the health and  safety of the citizens, to preserve per manent agriculture crops, and to stave  off further decline of our fish and wild life habitat.  Mr. Chairman, no part of my district  has  been  left  unaffected  by  the  drought. Ski areas that rely on ade quate snowfall  to provide  the  recre ation that they do have had a very dif ficult  time. Other  recreational areas  that rely on full reservoirs have been  hard hit as well. Our national forests  are experiencing massive tree kills due  to the loss of water and bark beetle in festation, and at present dead trees are  not being adequately cleared, present ing an almost certain future fire dan ger.  We are in serious jeopardy as far as  our  timber  is concerned. Some esti mates say that one out of every three  trees is either dead or in the process of  dying, and  that will have  long-range  dire economic consequences.  The immediate catastrophe is the dry  soil, the dry leaves, and dry trees giv ing us a potential for the most serious  fire  season we have ever had  in our  State's history.  Agriculture has been especially hard hit, not just this year by the drought  but by the worst freeze in the history  of agriculture in California. Estimates  are that the cost of the freeze alone  will reach $1 billion. On top of that, the  fifth year of drought has brought a cut back in water deliveries in that area,  especially so in the central part of the  San Joaquin Valley where we have had  a billion-dollar freeze and now a short age of water on top of it.  Agriculture  is  the  economic back bone of the valley, and with that trend  fallowing  hundreds  of  thousands  of  acres of land, it translates into second1977-78  the 1989  ary effects on all aspects of the econ omy and the loss of thousands of jobs.  A recent study said as many as 65,000  children in the San Joaquin Valley are  likely to skip meals because their fam ilies are unable to feed them.  0 1120  These are people who have been un employed because of the freeze and be cause of the drought taking land out of  production.  Two disasters in a matter of a  few  months, and unfortunately, to date the  Federal Government has provided only  limited  relief.  During  the  drought, the Government provided over  $1  billion  in  relief. During  Florida  freeze,  the Government pro vided over $60 million in relief. Presi dent Bush, on February 11 of this year,  declared 31 California counties as Fed eral disaster areas, but limited assist ance to disaster unemployment assist ance. The Secretary of Agriculture and  the Administrator of the Small Busi ness Administration independently de clared the availability of the Farmers  Home Administration disaster  loans  and small business disaster loans, but  that is not sufficient. Attention has  been focused away from our plight in  recent months by world events, new  budget rules made the assistance near ly impossible, and people are still un employed with little relief in sight ex cept from  the State government and  private agencies.  Mr. Chairman, I was prepared today  to offer an amendment that would have  allowed irrigators suffering severe eco nomic hardships as  the result of the  drought the opportunity to defer a lim ited portion of that obligation. In Cali fornia's central valley project, irriga tion districts are required to pay for  actual operation and maintenance of  the project. This year that is estimated  to be $37 million, even though most of  those districts will  receive only one quarter of  their usual water supply.  For an  individual district  therefore,  last year's $100,000 obligation  is  this  year's $100,000 obligation even though  district revenues have been reduced by  75 percent. Essentially, this quadruples  the cost for every acre-foot of water de livered.  In 1988, the House drought assistance  bill included the ability to defer pay ments, but that was dropped in con ference because  Interior officials as sured the conferees that they were able  to defer some amount of an irrigator's  obligation during a drought. There was  some confusion about this matter as  the Committee on Interior and Insular  Affairs marked up the bill, and so the  vice  chairman,  the gentleman  from  California [Mr. MILLER], and I wrote a  letter to the Bureau to clarify my con cerns. The answers they provided satis fied  some of  those concerns, mainly  that the Bureau already had the ability  to defer payments by irrigators to face  ",1991
507,1098,5,Mr. MILLER of California.," The gen tleman is correct.  LEHMAN  of California. Mr.  Chairman, I would hope then that the  Secretary would make every effort to  work closely with the Council on Envi ronmental Quality, and that he stress  the importance and emergency neces sity of those most essential activities,  such as well drilling, water transfers,  and  construction of  temporary  salt  water intrusion barriers.  Wherever possible,  I also hope that  the Secretary and the center work in  tandem to plan activities that may re quire an exemption in order to reduce  the time necessary to accomplish that  exemption. I believe that all parties in volved,  the Secretary of the Interior,  the Bureau of Reclamation,  the Con gress, and the President must do our  utmost  to  expedite  the Federal  re sponse to the drought.

510,1098,5,Mr. GEJDENSON.," Mr. Chairman, we  are here at a very ironic moment. The  rains  have  started  and  replenished  some of the drought. But we still have  a crisis in California. Apparently San ta  Barbara  has  water  police  driving  around the city to make sure the citi zens of Santa Barbara are not squan dering a precious natural resource. We  are in the fifth year of a drought. We  are not in the first 6 mont}ls of a prob lem, we  are  in  the  fifth year of a  drought.  For the previous 5 years, as I and  some Members tried to address a proc ess  that  irrationally used water  to  grow crops in surplus, we did nothing.  So for 4 years, as a precious natural re source was depleted, and as we came  here to the floor of the House time and  time again and reached out  to some  Members and said, let us find a. way to  rationalize this process, let us not have  the Federal taxpayers subsidizing crops  that are in surplus, and then spending  billions of dollars bringing water  to  grow more of those same crops.  If this was a welfare mother getting  50 cents more in food stamps, we would  have three-quarters of the Members of  Congress in the well of the House out raged that we were not watching the  taxpayers' dollars. If this was a child  on the WIC Program, we would come  down here and say that we have some  kids that deserve it that are not going  to get it, because we are in a fiscal cri sis, and,  therefore, children who need  the WIC Program are not going to get  it because we cannot afford it.  If this was a Head Start Program, we  would say look, we can only afford to  provide for 25 percent of the kids in the  Head Start Program, even though we  know  the program works,  and even  though we know there is a lot greater  need than we are providing for.  But this water was going to million aire farmers, so  the political process  chugged along. We subsidized the price  of cotton, and then we bring in 3 mil lion dollars' worth of water  to one  farmer to make sure he ends up with a  $7 million profit, not a $4 million prof it.  I  am  going  to withdraw  today's  amendment  because  of  the  narrow  focus of this issue today dealing with  the drought. But I think that this Con gress has to come to grips with the pol icy that is wasting Federal tax dollars,  wasting  a  natural  resource,  and  is  going to force citizens to spend billions  of dollars to bring in new water sup plies.  Mr. Chairman,  I have worked with  the chairman of  the committee,  the  gentleman from California  LER], on this issue before, and I know  he  is supportive. But  to some other  Members, I grew up on a dairy farm  and my family still lives on one in Con necticut. I do not want to pull the rug  out from under farmers in the midst of  [Mr. MIL a bad year. But I do want us to develop  a system that will have us use this pre cious resource in some rational man ner, and that we do not squander tax payer dollars subsidizing multimillion aire farmers.  I think the administration may have  taken a courageous step forward. They  said there ought to be a needs test for  these programs.  If one makes more  than $125,000,  they should not get an other subsidy. Whatever the approach  is, we need to address that as the rec lamation bill  comes  in  the  regular  order.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my sup port for H.R. 355, the reclamation Emergency  Drought Relief Act of 1991. This bill provides  some much-needed  relief  for many of our  friends in California and the West. It will facili tate the needed transfer of water to  fish and  wildlife and allows willing sellers to sell their  surplus water.  I would also like to commend  the vice chairman, Mr. MILLER, and others who  have worked hard to craft this bill.  For the past 4 years of this drought, consid ered to be the worst in 50 years, California's  water distribution system has been able  to  supplement the lack of rainfall  for agricultural  uses with  other  sources,  including  ground  water pumping and the California State water  project. As a result, until  this year  irrigators  have seen little or no reduction in their supply  of irrigation water.  This year, however, we have come to real ize that water is a very limited resource. There  is no longer an unlimited supply. As a result  of this drought, we have come to understand  that by providing water to one user we deprive  another. By providing a farmer with  federally  subsidized water  to grow  ""monsoon-climate  crops""  like  rice or cotton, we are depriving  other users.  Unfortunately, as a result of this worsening  drought,  some  dramatic  steps  have  been  taken  in California. For example,  the State  water project announced cutbacks to munici pal and industrial users by 90 percent of their  normal allocation. The State water project sus pended all deliveries to agricultural users, ex cept for what is necessary to keep perennial  crops alive. And  the Bureau of Reclamation  has reduced its water allocation to agricultural  irrigators by 75 percent. With such steps and  the dire need for drought relief, how can we  subsidize  that relief water  to  irrigate surplus  crops?  My amendment to this legislation would en sure that water provided by this drought meas ure will not be subsidized to irrigate unneeded  surplus crops. This  in hopes  that  it will be  used for other, more necessary purposes.  Mr. Chairman, by providing  this precious  water resource at a subsidized rate for the irri gation of surplus crops, we are depriving farm ers of perennial crops like orchards and vine yards, who are already hurting  from the De cember 1990 freeze.  We would deprive  fish and wildlife of this  precious water. Many species of fish and wa terfowl throughout the region are already con sidered  to be  threatened as a result of  this  drought. If more water is not provided to some  of  these species  they may become endan gered and thus federally protected under the  ",1991

On one side, we  have the President of the United States  and the Secretary of the Treasury and  the leadership of the Democratic Party  and  the  leadership of the Republican  Party all on one side, and on the other  side I suspect we have the vast major ity of the people of the United States.  The  issue,  as others have already  said, is not whether, in fact, we should  raise a significant amount of money, a  sufficient amount of money,  to make  sure  that  the  deposits  are  covered.  That is not  the  issue. We are all  in  agreement on that issue.  The issue is: Do we simply raise $30  billion without having any understand ing of where that $30 billion is going to  come from? Do we simply raise $30 bil lion and dump it into the deficit which,  over a period of 30 years, will become  well over $100 billion, or do we. have the  courage now to say that if we need $30  billion, let us sit down and debate how  we are going to raise that $30 billion?  Which sector of our society is going to  pay that $30 billion?  If we simply dump the $30 billion into  the deficit, let me tell the Members ex actly where  that money  is going  to  come from. In a few months, the Presi dent is going to come up to us, and he  is going  to say, ""Boy, do we have a  large deficit. It is closing in on $400 bil lion. We have to deal with that prob lem, and let us see how we can deal  with it.""  We can cut back on Medicare, we can  cut back on Federal aid to education,  we can cut back on Federal aid  to  health care, Federal aid for cities and  towns. We can raise regressive  taxes.  We can come up with more increases in  the gas tax or other taxes which will  come down heavily on working people,  middle-income people, the elderly and  the poor. That is one way of dealing  with it.  The other way to deal with it, which  to me makes a lot more sense, is if we  need the $30 billion, let us raise that  money in a  fair and progressive way.  Let us ask those people who have the  money,  those  people whose  incomes  have  soared  in  the  last 10 years,  to  start paying their fair share of taxes.  In opposition  to  this present pro posal,  I would suggest  the following:  that if we had a 15-percent marginal  surtax on couples earning over $100,000  adjusted gross income, we could raise  $15 billion. If we had a 15-percent sur tax on  corporate  income, we  could  raise $15 billion; 15 plus 15 is $30 billion.  I  think that that is a  fairer way to  raise the $30 billion we need than have  working people, middle-income people,  poor people, the elderly people have to  pay for this bailout.  So the issue is not whether or not we  need the money. I will agree that we  need the money. The issue is: who is  going to pay for it? This bill does not  address that.  I will not vote for it.

514,1111,5,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman  for yielding me  this  time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of the conference report to accompany  S. 419,  the Resolution Trust Corpora tion funding legislation. It seems to be  the best compromise we could come to  given the circumstances. It is impor tant  that depositors know  they can  continue to have confidence in the Fed eral deposit insurance system.  I  am  pleased  that  the  affordable  housing provisions  and management  reforms approved by the House are in cluded  in  this conference agreement.  These will help improve the efficiency  of the RTC and save taxpayer dollars.  In particular, I am compelled to com ment on the minority contracting pro visions of  the  legislation. There has  been  extreme  resistance  to  dealing  with this issue in this bill. Some have  couched it as a civil rights issue. Some  have called it a quota provision.  Let me  just  say  in  the  strongest  terms that this is not a civil rights  issue; it is not a quota issue. At issue  is whether a Federal agency may con tract for services worth millions of dol lars while paying little or no attention  to the diversity of those who provide  the services. I thought the Congress de cided that question in the 1970's, during  the Nixon administration.  For at least the last 15 years, we have  required agencies of this Government  to be held accountable for  their con tracting policies. No agency is exempt,  not even the RTC-especially not the  RTC.  As the author of the original minor ity outreach provisions contained  in  FIRREA, and one of the sponsors of the  minority  contracting  amendment  which was unanimously approved by  the House Banking Committee, I must  call attention  to  the performance of  the Resolution Trust Corporation  in  this area.  We  have  found,  through  congres sional hearings and oversight, that the  RTC has had a poor record of including  racial and ethnic groups in their con tracting activities. The  latest figures  supplied by the RTC show that while  nonminority men make up 38.1 percent  of the total population, they have been  awarded 80.2 percent of the total RTC  contracts, amounting to 70.3 percent of  the total fees.  By comparison, minority men and  women make up 23.1 percent of  the  total population. Minority men have  received 5.4 percent of the total RTC  contracts amounting to 1.3 percent of  the  total fees. Minority women have  received 2.1 percent of the total RTC  contracts amounting to 2. 7 percent of  the total fees. Clearly, the RTC has a  dismal record of contracting with mi norities.  The conference  report  requires  the  RTC to provide a complete description  of all actions taken by the RTC regard ing  their contracting activities with  minorities  and women.  However,  I  want to indicate that Congress expects  more than just a progress report. As  one of the House conferees who worked  closely on this issue, I would point out  that additional  report  language has  been included in this conference agree ment calling on the RTC to utilize, to  the maximum practicable extent, mi nority  and women  individuals  and  firms in all of its contracting activi ties.  I want to make it clear that the in tent of the language is to reinforce the  statutory minority outreach provisions  contained in FIRREA. The language in  this  conference  agreement puts  the  RTC on notice that Congress expects  improvement in its contracting activi ties with minorities and women, and  we will be carefully scrutinizing their  record in this area. This issue will be  revisited  should  the  record  indicate  that there has not been significant im provement in assuring equal access to  the  economic opportunities  that  re sulted from the savings and loan crisis.  0 1350  ",1991

519,1163,5,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, reserv ing the right to object, I will not ob ject, and on our side we are willing to  go in at 10 in the morning, but I would  make  the  point  to  the Democratic  leadership that, if we could get a sign able Desert Storm supplemental  fin ished and out of here early tomorrow  so Members could  leave as  they had  planned, it would make a great deal  more sense  than  to come  in with a  large number of motions in disagree ment and having a very long process,  possibly going well  in to  the evening,  involving the second bill. As I under stand it, the second supplemental, the  dire emergency supplemental,  is not  necessarily dire and emergency and, in  fact, does not have to get through to morrow. The administration does not  need  that money until after we get  back, and it just seems to our side that  it would be foolish to keep the Mem bers sitting around here for hours all  day, all afternoon, on Friday while the  conferees went to work. There are a lot  of differences between  the House and  the Senate on that bill, so I would urge  the Democratic leadership to consider  bringing in the relatively clean Desert  Storm supplemental that is voted out  of here by about noon, and  then let  Members go on  their way and come  back after the session.

HONORING WOMEN WHO SERVED  IN THE PERSIAN GULF WAR  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  GRAY). Under a previous order of the  House, the gentleman from New York  [Mr. RANGEL] is recognized for 60 min utes.  ",1991
524,1163,5,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, each year  during the month of March, women of  this country are honored in a special  way with the commemoration of Wom en's History Month. This  time  the  honor is especially fitting in light of  the historic action from which our Na tion has recently emerged in the Per sian Gulf.  Each war has its heroes and each war  has its forgotten heroes. Today I rise in  the belief that the women of our mili tary have played a special heroic role  in  the Persian War that will forever  change our perception of the military  capabilities of  the gentler  sex,  and,  hopefully,  the attitude of our society  toward all women.  To those women who fell during this  brief, but terrible war, I offer my pray ers, and to their families, my deepest  sympathies.  The memory  of  these  brave women will forever be etched in  our military history,  for  they have  made  the ultimate sacrifice, as have  their families and loved ones.  Mr. Speaker, our rollcall of honor:  First, those killed in action:  Adrienne Mitchell, 20, of Moreno Val ley, CA, killed by an Iraqi Scud mis sile.  Cindy Beaudoin, 19, of Plainfield, CT,  killed by a land mine.  Beverly Clark, 23,  of Armagh, PA;  and Christine Mayes, 23, of Rochester  Mills, PA; both killed by Scuds.  Cheryl O'Brien, 24,  of Long Beach,  CA, killed in action.  Those  killed  in  cumstances:  Cindy Bridges, 20, of Trinity, AL.  Marie Rossi, 32, of Oradell, NJ.  Kathleen Sherry, 23, of Tonawanda,  NY.  Pamela Gay, 19, of Surrey, VA.  There were two prisoners of war:  Melissa Nealy, 20, of Grand Rapids,  Ml.  Rhonda Cornum, 36, of Freeville, NY.  Thankfully, both have been  freed,  along with our men who were prisoners  of war.  Nineteen other women were among  the 350 U.S. troops who were wounded  in the war.  These women are important, not only  because  they gave  their  lives,  shed  their blood, or gave up their freedom  for their country. They are also unique  in that Operation Desert Storm pro vided  the first experience in our his tory with casualties among  fighting  women.  In Operation Desert Storm, women  piloted some of the 300 helicopters that  airlifted men and equipment more than  50 miles inside Iraqi territory.  The Persian Gulf war is not the first  experience with women in combat situ ations, but it indicates the extent to  which women have become an integral  part of the armed services. 600 women  nonhostile  ciralso were among  the  forces  that  in vaded Panama, including Capt. Linda  Bray, who was awarded an Army Com mendation Medal.  Today, women  represent almost 11  percent of our total Armed Forces, and  the 32,000 women deployed to the Per sian Gulf made up 6 percent of  the  total U.S. force. I would also mention  that approximately 48 percent of the  women deployed to the gulf were mem bers of minority groups.  Women who  served  in  the Persian  Gulf, because there is no more intimate  relationship than that between mother  and child, made some of the greatest  emotional  sacrifices we  have  ever  asked our women to endure. In the Per sian Gulf deployment, more than 16,000  single parents were deployed; most of  them were women.  In addition, more  than 1,200 military couples with chil dren were deployed.  The Persian Gulf war is likely to per manently change the image of Amer ican women in the Armed Forces, mar ried and single. Not only fathers and  husbands, but mothers and wives are  now leaving loved ones at home.  We rejoice in the accomplishments of  women in the military-from the two  highest ranking who are brigadier gen erals to the thousands of other officers  and enlisted women.  To quote Army Lt. Col. O.J. Williams  of Monticello, MI, who left her 12-year old adopted son at home  to serve  in  Saudi Arabia, ""I'm here because I can  do it.""  ",1991
525,1163,5,Mrs. MORELLA.," Mr. Speaker, it is an honor  to pay tribute to the many women who served  their country so courageously  in Operation  Desert Storm. Through  their service,  these  women did more than contribute to one mili tary operation;  they spurred a dramatic  re shaping of society's perception of women  in  our Armed Forces.  Never before have so many women  in the  military been deployed, so close  to combat.  About 32,700 women-6 percent of the Armed  Forces-have served  in  the Persian Gulf.  They served on the front lines preparing fight er  jets  for missions, managing supply  lines  during the ground assault, and staffing crucial  military hospitals. Women chopper pilots flew  airborne  troops  into  Iraqi  territory. Women  joined  their male counterparts  in virtually all  aspects of Operation Desert Storm.  I am especially proud to acknowledge the  service of Lt. Cheryl Peterson, a former me~  ber of my staff who is serving as a head nurse  in the 350th Evacuation Hospital in Saudi Ara bia. Cheryl arrived in the Persian Gulf shortly  after Christmas and  immediately began her  duties at the hospital. I know that Cheryl's par ents have missed her greatly, as we have  missed her in my office. But they know, as we  all know, that without the participation of serv icewomen like Cheryl, Operation Desert Storm  could not have been the success that it was.  We  in the United States eagerly await the  homecoming of all of our servicewomen in the  gulf. As a nation we must remember that, just  as these women pledged their lives in defend ing their country, we at home must pledge our  ",1991

529,1202,5,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, I do not  question that Governor Martinez is a  fine, decent person. Almost everything  that my colleague, Senator THURMOND,  just said, I agree with completely.  When Governor Martinez came into  my office to visit with me, I said the  one thing that I think is essential is an  agreement by the drug czar to restrict  himself and not participate in partisan  politics. We do not permit that for the  Director of the FBI or the CIA by tra dition, and by tradition we should not  do that for the drug czar.  I was one of two who voted in this  body  against Bill Bennett  for  drug  czar. It turned out to be one of the best  votes I ever cast in this body. When  Bill Bennett, as drug czar, went around  the Nation campaigning at Republican  rallies and Republican dinners, and so  forth, somehow we just did not convey  the message that that is not the proper  thing to do.  And so after his position as drug czar,  he was designated to become chairman  of the Republican National Committee.  It turned out to be a very natural tran sition from being drug czar  to being  chairman of the Republican National  Committee. As it turned out, he has de clined that opportunity.  But Governor Martinez has declined  to say, ""I am not going to participate  in partisan politics."" Just as we have  in the Director of the CIA and Director  of the FBI someone who refrains from  that kind of participation,  the drug  czar of this Nation ought  to do  the  same. It seems to me that is basic if we  are serious about this drug war.  And so, Mr. President, I am going to  vote ""no."" I am aware it is going to be  approved, but it is the same vote I am  going to cast if we have a Democratic  administration and we do not get that  kind of commitment from whoever the  Democratic President would designate.  I am going to vote against that nomi nee, too.  We have a good  tradition with  the  FBI and the CIA: you refrain from par tisan politics. We ought to have that  same kind of  tradition  for  the drug  czar. I am going to continue to vote no  on any nominees until we get that kind  of a commitment from the nominee.  I yield back  the  remainder of my  time.  ",1991
530,1202,5,Mr. KOHL.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today  to cast my vote  in support of  Robert Martinez to be Director of Na tional Drug Control Policy. I am hope ful that, as Director, Mr. Martinez will  follow through with the assurances he  gave to me, and other members of the  Judiciary Committee, during his con firmation hearings.  Before receiving his testimony I had  concerns regarding the nomination of  Governor Martinez.  I was concerned  that  he would  over-emphasize  the  criminal justice side of the antidrug ef fort. However, during the hearing,  in  response  to questioning from Senator  KENNEDY, Senator THURMOND and oth ers, Governor Martinez indicated that  he believed a more balanced approach  was in order. On one occasion he stated  he believes ""that everyone who wants  treatment  ought  to  have  it  [E]veryone that wants treatment that  is there for the purpose of freeing him self and herself from addiction or stay ing on a program ought to have treat ment."" According to the nominee, that  will be part of his policy recommenda tion.  (Transcript, February 26, at 86* * *  87 .)  In addition to recognizing the need to  treat drug abusers, Governor Martinez  spoke to the issue of education, and es pecially education of our youth. When  asked about the effectiveness of drug  education, Martinez said:  I have a tremendous amount of faith that  education will work, it is working, and the  proof of it will be when these primary young sters reach those middle school years. (Tran script, February 26, at 245.)  And when queried about drug edu cation programs in the classroom, Gov ernor Martinez again indicated his sup port, saying ""the earlier, the better.""  (Transcript, February 26, at 141.) These  and other  statements on  the  treat ment,  education  and prevention  as pects of the drug war have assisted me  in reaching my decision. But I also had  concerns in two additional areas.  Prior to hearing  testimony on  the  issue of political campaigning while  Director of the Drug Policy Office,  I  had concerns that the office would be  used as a pulpit for partisan politics.  Chairman BIDEN  and Senator SIMON  shared my concerns. But upon specific  inquiries  on  this matter, Governor  Martinez assured the committee that  he would refrain from political activ ity, and that he would not partake in  partisan activities  involving congres",1991
531,1215,5,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. President,  I rise today to support the President's  nomination of Bob Martinez to be the  next Director of the Office of National  Drug Control  Policy. The Martinez  nomination has been endorsed by an  impressive array of political and civic  leaders, drug treatment and prevention  organizations, and law enforcement of ficials. I am pleased to add my name to  that list. Bob Martinez is an excellent  choice to lead America's war on drugs.  Henry Ford  once  remarked,  ""The  question,  'Who ought  to be boss?' is  like asking 'Who ought to be the tenor  in  the quartet?' Obviously,  the man  who can sing  tenor.""  I believe  that  President Bush has chosen  the right  ""tenor"" for the job. Bob Martinez has  already proven that he  is an  innova tive,  effective  leader  in  the war on  drugs.  When  he  served as  the mayor of  Tampa, Martinez played a key role in  forging  the national drug policy rec ommendations of the U.S. Conference  of Mayors. And during his 4 years as  Governor of Florida, Martinez made  the battle against drug  importation  and abuse a high priority. He galva nized public support and initiated sev eral successful innovative programs in  Florida  to combat drugs.  In a State  that was believed to be the entry point  for over 70 percent of the cocaine that  is smuggled into the United States, the  Mr.  leadership of Bob Martinez brought  about Florida's first drop in drug relat ed crimes in years.  Bob Martinez believes in a holistic  strategy to fight drug abuse,  through  education,  enforcement,  and  treat ment. As a former educator, Martinez  is especially  supportive of programs  that educate America's youth  to  the  dangers of drugs. He is committed to  the expansion of treatment programs  for the victims of drug abuse. He will  be a tough, but fair, enforcer of our Na tion's drug  laws. And  as  a  former  mayor and Governor, Bob Martinez will  be especially sensitive to the need for a  State-Federal partnership  in combat ing drugs.  Mr. President, I hope  that my col leagues will join me in confirming Bob  Martinez,  the President's outstanding  choice for the next Director of the Of fice of National Drug Control Policy.  DECONCINI.  Mr.  President,  President Bush's nomination of Gov.  Bob Martinez for Director of the Office  of National Drug Control Policy comes  at a crucial point in this Nation's ef fort to fight drugs. When Congress cre ated this position, it did so in response  to a crisis which threatened our coun try's future. Under the direction of the  first Director, William J. Bennett, the  Office of National Drug Control Policy  took the first step toward developing a  coordinated drug strategy, and the War  on Drugs began.  Since  that time, progress has been  made. There are encouraging signs that  our efforts are paying off. But the drug  crisis is still a reality. In many ways,  we  have  just begun  to  realize how  strong an impact illegal drugs have on  all levels of our society. Drug use has  had a startling influence on our com munities, from the State and local law  enforcement officers who hold the line  on crime and violence in the streets, to  health care professionals who struggle  to meet the special needs of drug de pendent mothers and  their children.  The War on Drugs has not been won  and it will be up to the next Director of  this Nation's drug policy to see that it  is fought with all the power and wis dom this Nation can muster.  I supported the nomination of Gov ernor Martinez in committee, and will  vote for his confirmation. As Governor  of Florida, a State which has experi enced its own drug crisis, he  is well  aware of the problems that illegal drug  traffic creates. Miami is one of the five  designated high  intensity drug  traf ficking areas, and Governor Martinez  knows how important cooperation be tween  the Federal Government  and  State and local agencies is to imple menting an effective drug strategy. His  involvement  in developing a plan on  substance abuse and drug  trafficking  for  the National Governors' Associa tion will be helpful in developing and  implementing  our Nation's plan  to  fight drugs.

535,1267,5,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, in consid ering  the future of the Seawolf sub marine program-and the broader ques tion of the submarine industrial base ! urge all who are concerned to take  special note  of  the unique national  asset which exists in the facilities of  the Electric Boat Division of General  Dynamics, and of the critical  impor tance of this facility to the economy of  the State of Rhode Island.  At Quonset Point, RI, Electric Boat  operates an automated frame and cyl inder manufacturing facility which is  the only one of its kind. This $287 mil lion facility has the capability of fab ricating sections of steel cylinders up  to 42  feet  in diameter which become  the basic building blocks of a nuclear  submarine hull.  The machinery used  to mold  these  sections is not duplicated anywhere in  the world, and the skills needed to weld  and fabricate  the sections reflect the  special training and experience needed  to operate this unique facility.  The  sectional  construction process  made possible by this facility has been  developed in the Trident Program and  will be used to its fullest advantage in  the Seawolf Program. The process per mits installation of prefabricated mod ules of machinery, piping and ~truc­ tural components into the open cylin drical sections before they are joined  to form the submarine hull. Substan tially  improved  productivity  results  since much  complicated  installation  work does not have  to be performed  within the limited confines of the com pleted hull.  More than 4,000 Rhode Islanders work  at this facility and the annual payroll  is some $135 million. Another 3,000 resi dents of our State cross into Connecti cut each day to work at Electric Boat's  Groton facility, where the cylindrical  sections are joined into completed sub marine hulls. So all told, Electric Boat  employs  over 7 ,000 Rhode  Islanders,  making it  the  largest private sector  employer of Rhode Island workers.  I cannot emphasize too strongly the  importance  of Electric Boat  to  the  Rhode  Island economy, which  is al ready reeling under the effects of a re gional recession and a State banking  crisis. In addition to the total Electric  Boat payroll of $248 million to Rhode  Island workers at Quonset Point and  Groton, Electric Boat does business  with some 900 suppliers  in  the State  and  purchases  goods  and  services  amounting to $25 million annually. The  Quonset Point facility generates State  income taxes of $8.5 million and sales  taxes of over $40 million. In a State as  small as Rhode Island, such an enter prise is a giant presence indeed.  But I come back to the point that, in  addition to these drastically important  local considerations, there is a factor  of urgency and importance for the na tional  interest, and  that  is whether  this unique manufacturing facility  is  to continue to operate or gradually fall  into  disuse.  The  loss  of  the  next  Seawolf contract, combined with fitful  competition  for minimal  submarine  production  in  the  future  could well  lead to the latter result.  To my mind, the logic is inescapably  in favor of keeping Electric Boat  in  business, and that means designating it  as the Navy's sole source for the fore seeable  future.  I hope  the Navy will  reach the same conclusion.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",1991

540,1332,5,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I rise  to  introduce  legislation  to  improve  protection and management of Ameri ca's coastal and marine resources and  environment. I would also like to take  this opportunity to express my sincere  appreciation to the chairman and rank ing member of the Committee on Com merce, Science, and Transportation for  inviting me to become a member of the  National Ocean Policy Study. I am de lighted to accept this invitation, and  look forward to working with them.  The United States depends on  its  coastal areas and the adjacent ocean  waters for many uses including human  habitation,  food,  energy and mineral  resources,  recreation,  and maritime  transportation, The coastal part of our  population is growing rapidly, and that  trend will continue. Clearly, our de mands on-and resulting threats t~  our coasts and the oceans also will con tinue to grow.  We owe it to our children and follow ing generations  to  take a  thoughtful  look at how we manage and protect the  coastal and marine environment and  its  resources. We must  resist short sighted policies  that stress develop ment  and  resource  extraction  over  stewardship and environmental protec tion.  Mr. President, while there have been  significant advances in protection and  management of our coastal and marine  environment  in recent years, several  matters remain  to be effectively ad dressed, including:  Limits on the ability of States to in fluence decisions on designation of off shore disposal sites for dredge spoil,  and  concern  over  contaminants  in  dredge spoil disposed of at sea;  Uncertainty about the authority of a  downstream State regarding upstream  permitting decisions and other actions  that may degrade water quality or irn",1991
541,1384,5,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  today I am introducing a bill to save  ancient  cultural  and  archeological  treasures from  imminent destruction.  One of the four sites that this bill will  protect  is currently scheduled  to be  bulldozed for a gravel pit.  My bill will protect four sites rec ommended by  the Park Service mid west region for addition to the Mound  City Group National Monument  in  southern Ohio.  Mound City was established in 1923  and is the only Federal area preserving  and interpreting remains of the Ohio  Hopewell,  a  culture which archeolo gists tell us  thrived in eastern north  America between 200 B.C. and A.D. 500.  Part of the Hopeton Earthworks site  is within  the national historic  land mark but outside the current boundary  of the monument. It is still in private  ownership. The owner-a gravel com pany-recently began removal of a 6foot layer of topsoil to prepare for the  gravel mining season.  In the process they uncovered human  bones at  the site. Park Service and  State officials were notified and  the  bones verified as ancient. Native Amer icans removed and reinterred the bones  elsewhere.  Further mining operations have been  halted-for  the moment-while  rep resentatives of the Park Service,  the  trust for public land, the Archeological  Conservancy,  the private owner, and  others work to prevent the landmark  from further destruction.  Mr. President, this legislation is nec essary  to protect  these ancient cul tural resources. If the gravel company  resumes mining the area, this ancient  site will be destroyed.

542,1449,5,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President,  today I  am making a  formal  request of  the  Comptroller General  that GAO  study  the Internal Revenue Service's admin istration of the competent authority  [CA] process.  Competent Authority provides gov ernments  a means of  resolving dif ferences  in tax treaty interpretations  and facilitates the exchange of tax in formation.  If working  properly,  it  should provide  taxpayer  relief  from  double taxation-that is, paying tax on  income earned in another country both  there and in the United States.  CA  is a  feature codified in all U.S.  tax treaties, and is integral to coopera tion in tax matters between the United  States and its major trading partners.  International tax cooperation has be come essential with the advent of mul tilateral  investment  in an electroni cally linked global economy.  Specifically, the CA mechanism pro vides treaty partners---governments---a  means  to: First, remedy  incidents of  double  taxation;  second,  resolve dif ferences  in  treaty  interpretation be tween  the  contracting States;  and,  third, serve as a point of exchange for  tax information on taxpayers operating  in both countries.  I am concerned by reports from tax payers that the CA process may have  serious problems. Of special concern is  the widely held perception of its inabil ity to provide a most basic  taxpayer  service-the relatively speedy, certain  and fair resolution of double taxation  cases.  METHODOLOGY  The methodology of  the CA  study  will include contact with academics in  the tax field,  international tax practi tioners, United States and foreign cor porate clients who used or avoided the  CA process, and United States and for eign government officials. The objec tives will be to: First, determine how  effective CA has been since  its 1971  codification;  second,  identify  what  changes, if any, are needed to improve  CA's effectiveness; and third, identify  possible changes in the future role of  the CA process.  The scope of the study will also in clude work with foreign  tax adminis trations and CA's to gain an apprecia tion of their structures, policies and  outlook  regarding  the  CA  process.  Three groups of countries have been  identified as important to study: those  that work smoothly with  the United  States, such as Canada and the United  Kingdom; those with which the United  States has an average rate of success in  concluding mutual  agreement proce dures under CA, such as Belgium and  Korea;  and,  those where  the United  States CA has experienced persistent  and sustained difficulty  in achieving  agreements satisfactory to the United  States,  the  taxpayer, and  the other  country, such as Japan and Germany.  CONTRIBUTION TO INTERNATIONAL TAX POLICY/  ADMINISTRATION  The goal of this study is to develop  recommendations  for  making  U.S.  international  tax policy  a  coherent  part of U.S. global economic policy.  The nexus between trade and tax policy  has been largely ignored; a potentially  injurious  omission given  the opportunity for tax subsidies to subvert the  international protections on free trade.  I hope that this study can assist in im proving the service and protection that  U.S. taxpayers are entitled to, improv ing IRS' adminstration of the  inter national aspects of the Tax Code, sim plifying segments of the Tax Code that  place unnecessary resource demands on  U.S. business, improving the level and  means of international cooperation in  .

Res. 81) commend ing the Baltic States for their efforts  to  regain  independence  and  urging  measures to support such efforts, was  considered and agreed to.  The preamble was agreed to.  The resolution, and the preamble, are  as follows:  S. RES. 81  Whereas the United States has never rec ognized the illegal annexation of the Baltic  states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania by  the Soviet Union as a result of the 1939 Pact  between Hitler and Stalin;  Whereas  the Baltic states have  recently  completed plebiscites to determine  the ex tent of public support for their independence,  and such plebiscites were conducted freely  and fairly according to observers who mon itored the voting;  Whereas  the  owerwhelming majority of  people in each Bal tic state expressed support  for independence;  Whereas support and eventual recognition  of legitimate governments would be consist ent with the longstanding United States pol icy of not recognizing  the forcible annex ation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in  1940; and  Whereas the United States can take useful  steps  towards  recognition by establishing  United States Government offices in the Bal tic states to facilitate diplomatic relations,  technical assistance, cultural exchanges, and  other mutually beneficial programs: Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved, That the Senate(1) commends the governments and people  of the Baltic states on their use of demo cratic processes  to  regain  their  independ ence; and  (2) urges the President, if so requested by  the government of any Baltic state, to estab lish offices in the state to facilitate diplo matic  relations,  technical assistance,  cul tural exchanges, and other mutually bene ficial programs.

550,1462,5,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased  the Senate approved Senate  Resolution 81, the Bradley-Biden-Hatch  measure, urging a more activist United  States role in assisting the evolution of  democracy and  self-determination  in  the Baltic Republics.  Last weekend more than 150 million  Soviet citizens voted in a national ref erendum  on  unity.  Initial  results  showed mixed support for  the contin ued maintenance of the union. Poll re ports did show, however,  that Soviet  voters want greater  local autonomy,  want to elect their mayors directly and  want, at least in the case of the people  of the Russian Republic, to elect their  President directly.  These  results came as no surprise.  For years, Americans have been pressing the Soviet leadership, in every pos sible way, to take any small step to ward democratic reform. For years we  were spectacularly unsuccessful.  The United States continued to prod  the Soviets because we held to the be lief  that  democracy  and  self-deter mination were not only the right of all  people, but the desire of all people as  well.  This  belief  has  been  vindicated.  Throughout the Soviet Union and East ern Europe, when people have finally  been given the choice, they have cho sen freedom and democracy over tyr anny and oppression.  Mr. President, we can applaud each  day as a democratic wave moves across  the Soviet Union, and as basic human  and civil rights are slowly obtained hungrily grabbed, in fact-by millions  of people.  But as we watch this wave roll along,  we must do more  than congratulate  ourselves on  the model-and  the en couragement-the United States pro vided.  As loudly as we used to tell the So viet Union that they were desperately  wrong in how they treated their own  people, we must as loudly now tell the  Baltic States that  they are doing  it  right.  We  know, Mr. President,  that  the  words of this body are heard by demo cratic and conservative forces  in the  Soviet Union. Let them hear, then, of  our admiration for the Baltic reform ers' courage and  their use of demo cratic processes to move away from the  Kremlin's control.  Senate Resolution 81 makes clear our  admiration, and more importantly, our  support. It recognizes  the courage of  the Bal tic peoples in choosing democ racy, and commends them for their re cent plebiscites.  The resolution urges President Bush  to take on more of the burden of pro moting democracy and self-determina tion by establishing offices in the Bal tic States. Our presence on the ground  would provide the emerging Baltic de mocracies with practical  assistance,  and would provide  the United States  with a better understanding of events  there.  Mr. President, for decades the United  States has argued and agitated for de mocracy and self-determination. Now  it is growing before our eyes on a grand  scale. We need, very simply,  to stay  closely involved, to show our unwaver ing support, and to let the Soviet lead ership know that this support is the  dominating motive of American  for eign policy.

554,5,12,Mr. NAGLE.," Madam Speaker, during  his  1988  campaign,  President Bush  promised to respect collective bargain ing agreements between workers and  their companies. Yesterday, that prom ise was broken. Just as this adminis tration broke its promise against rais ing taxes on working Americans,  the  White  House  announced Mr.  Bush  would veto H.R. 5. I urge the President  to reconsider.  Major corporations are making war  against white-and blue-collar workers,  their  families,  and  the communities  where they live. Just as they take ad vantage of tax  loopholes,  there  is a  loophole  in  labor  law  that permits  firms to permanently replace workers  who are on strike.  Companies can refuse  to bargain in  good faith. And when workers take a  job action, firms can seize their pen sions, cut  their health benefits, and  hire unqualified replacements  to per manently fill their jobs.  Legislation  awaiting House  action  would change all that. It would prevent  workers  from being permanently  re placed, balance the rights of workers  and management, and restore respect  to the collective bargaining process.  Mr. President, don't break another  promise to America's working families.  Support H.R. 5, the workplace fairness  law.

This year  thousands of people will  make  the  trek  to Horton Bay for a  Fourth of July parade based on  the  premise that laughter is the best medi cine. Here people pride themselves on  not  taking  themselves  too seriously.  Where else can you see the world's only  pizza eating goat? Where else can you  see 49 people trying to earn statehood  with the motto, ""if Texas can do  it,  why can't we!""  Madam  Speaker,  the world  needs  more Horton Bays. July 4 is a day of  good, clean fun in this unique little vil lage on Lake Charlevoix. The least we  could do is honor them by giving them  a State of their own.

556,5,12,Mr.  EDWARDS  of Texas.," Madam  Speaker, few principles are more im portant to our Nation than the concept  of fairness. It is concept embodied in  the very foundation of our democracy,  the belief and conviction that all men  and women are created equal.  Yet today we find ourselves in a time  when children more and more are liv ing in poverty. We find ourselves in a  time when middle class families are  not able to give their children the op portunity to reach their highest poten tial. We find the doors of our colleges  and universities being shut to the mid dle class.  Madam Speaker, it is  time for  tax  fairness. We do not ask that we soak  the rich, but we demand that we stop  drowning the middle class. It is time  for fairness. It is time for recommit ment to the ideals on which this coun try was founded.  GOVERNMENT SHOULD SERVE,  NOT RULE  (Mr. DUNCAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
557,5,12,Mr. DUNCAN.," Madam Speaker,  the  week before last Edward Rendell,  the  Democratic  nominee  for mayor  of  Philadelphia, said it is time to change  some basic assumptions about the pub lic sector. In a hearing in New York  City, Mr. Rendel said:  Government does not work because it is  not designed  to. There  is no  incentive for  employees to do their best, so many do not.  There is no incentive to save money, so it is  squandered.  This is a  liberal Democrat talking,  not a conservative Republican. Yet he  has put his finger on something that  many people are feeling today. People  are becoming angry with elitists  in  government who act like our rulers, in stead of our servants. People are be coming sick of hearing governments  who have doubled or tripled spending  in a  short  time crying about budget  shortfalls.  D 1020  People are fed up with the civil serv ice system that does nothing for good,  dedicated employees but serves to pro tect lazy incompetent ones. There is a  resentment in the land today toward  government, particularly at the Fed eral level, and some Federal employees  are going to have to soon stop demand ing so much while giving so little in re turn.  WE NEED TAX FAIRNESS  (Mrs.  SCHROEDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",1991
558,5,12,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Madam Speaker,  tax fairness, yes, it is a big problem. It  is such a big problem that everyone on  both the right and left, as they have  looked at it, realize that what we did  during the Reagan era of the 1980's was  to shift more and more and more taxes  on the middle class. They are carrying  the heaviest percentage burden  they  have  ever carried  in  the history of  America.  When President Bush campaigned in  1988, he campaigned on relieving some  of  this  tax pressure  for  the middle  class. But somehow he has forgotten  that.  It  seems his  entire  domestic  agenda is nothing but more highways  and more executions. Maybe we could  bind them and make a drive-in execu tion.  I think what we desperately need is  tax  fairness.  If America's  families  could get a  little more money,  they  would certainly be under a  lot  less  stress. And a whole nation of dysfunc tional families can soon become a dys functional nation.  I think we must work on tax fairness,  and the Democratic Party must make  that its No. 1 priority to make that  Tax Code family friendly once again.

560,18,12,Mr. GEKAS.," Madam Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Madam Chairman, I fall in line with  many of the Members who want to see  a balanced budget come about. I have  strenuously supported all measures up  to now  throughout the entire incum bency that I have enjoyed in attempt ing to reach that hallowed place of the  balanced budget, and I will continue to  do so. But for the moment, I will lapse  from that ecstasy of reaching the bal anced budget, for an important reason.  Madam Chairman, I believe that the  entire country was  looking with dis gust and dismay at the leadership of  the District of Columbia for  the last  several years,  and  that  that  seeped  over into a disgust that the Congress of  the United States felt about what was  happening in its neighborhood in the  District of Columbia. But it is new day,  and the new breath of fresh air that the  new Mayor has brought in has restored  a  sense of confidence  in  the citizens  themselves of Washington, DC.  Madam Chairman, more importantly,  for our purposes, it has given the Mem bers of Congress and the people across  the land a new vision of possibilities  for  self-government  at  the  highest  level here in Washington, DC.  Madam Chairman, we cannot at this  moment  feel  great  about  the  new  Mayor and the new breath of fresh air,  and then rip away from her the modest  tools that we are providing with these  appropriations. Even though I feel they  may be budget busters under the termi nology that we use,  this is an emer gency situation. It is just as much an  emergency situation as those kinds of  emergencies which would compel  the  gentleman from Pennsylvania and the  gentleman from California, my fellow  colleagues,  that kind  of  emergency  which would make even them bander  away  for a while  from an effort  to  reach a balanced budget. That is how  strong I feel about it.  Madam Chairman, I want to see this  Mayor succeed. I want to see the neigh borhoods brought back  to a  sense of  order.  I want  the  partnership  and  neighborhoodship  between  the Con gress of the United States and the Dis trict of Columbia to flourish. This is an  excellent time to do so.  I was in a taxicab this morning with  a taxi driver who lives in the District  of Columbia, who said he did not vote  for Dixon; he voted for one of the other  candidates that were on the ticket at  that  time. But he  is  so glad,  even  though he made a mistake,  that the  populace did not make a mistake, and  that it is a change for the better.  Madam Chairman, we  have  to en dorse  that change for  the better and  support the District. This is part of our  domain. This is our neighborhood. This  is part of the future of our country,  from the standpoint of the search for  better government.  The CHAIRMAN.

562,18,12,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," Madam Chair man, I offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  ",1991

564,31,12,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Chairman,  it  would  take me  100 minutes  to  say  thank you to the chairman,  the gen tleman from Kentucky [Mr. NATCHER],  and to the ranking member,  the gen tleman from Michigan [Mr. PURSELL],  as well as other members of the Com mittee on Appropriations, for the par ents and for the children of this coun try.  ",1991

566,31,12,Mr. GOODLING., I am happy to yield  to the gentleman from Kentucky.  ,1991
567,31,12,Mr. NATCHER.," Mr. Chairman, on be half of our Committee on Appropria tions, especially our subcommittee, I  say to the gentleman from Pennsylva nia  [Mr. GoODLING],  I want to  thank  you. All down  through the years you  joined with us, you worked hard, and  there is not a Member in this House  who knows more about education and  health  than you do  and works any  harder to see that these programs are  fully funded and fully authorized.  I  just wanted  to make  that state ment.  ",1991
568,31,12,Mr. GOODLING.,"  Chairman.  I want to thank the committee on be half of the parents and the children for  the 12-percent increase in chapter 1, for  $100 million in Even Start, which will  give us for the first time a State for mula grant program where we are help ing the illiterate parents become more  literate and, at the same time, teach ing them what it is that they can do to  help their own preschool children be come preschool-ready for reading; for  the migrant children, we  say  thank  you for the 9.2-percent increase; for the  President's increase in education pro gram, we  thank you; for the graduate  assistance in areas of critical need, we  thank you, and for all of those who  benefit from Head Start, we say thank  you.  thank you, Mr.  I  Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 2707,  a bill providing appropria tions  for  the Departments of Labor,  Health and Human Services, and Edu cation, and related agencies for fiscal  year 1992.  First of all,  I want  to once again  commend and thank Chairman NATCH ER,  the ranking member Mr. PURSELL,  and  the members of the Labor-HHS Education  Subcommittee,  for  their  continued  generous  support  of  and  leadership in the vital policy and pro grammatic areas encompassed by this  bill.  In particular, I want to express my  appreciation for their continued lead ership  in Federal  support  for  edu cation, which  they  have  certainly  reaffirmed through this bill by provid ing the Department of Education with  a 12-percent increase in discretionary  funding over  the current fiscal year.  Since I have always viewed chapter 1 of  the Elementary and Secondary Edu cation Act of 1965 as the backbone of  the Federal effort to help all disadvan taged students in school, I was particu larly  gratified with  the  bill's  rec ommended  funding  level  for  basic  grants to local educational agencies, a  12-percent increase over  the Congres sional Budget Office's fiscal year 1992  baseline level for these grants.  When  I appeared before  the Labor HHS-Education Subcommittee in early  May,  I also recommended substantial  increases in the funding of two other  chapter 1 components, the Even Start  Program  and  the Migrant Children  State Agency Program. In the case of  Even Start, I pointed out that every thing we had  learned about  the pro gram's results  indicated that it defi nitely warranted an accelerated rate of  expansion. Needless to say, I was de lighted  to  find  that H.R.  2707  rec ommended doubling Even Start's level  of funding for the coming fiscal year,  and that the level provided-$100 mil lion-will for the first time permit the  program to make the transition to a  State formula grant activity, and will  thus allow local education agencies in  all States  to participate  in  the pro gram.  As  for  the Migrant Children Pro gram, I noted that while our efforts to  help these children had been very re warding-most  particularly  through  the accomplishment of reducing their  dropout rate by 40 percent over a dec ade-even  though  the  funding of the  chapter 1 account as a whole had in creased diamatically over  these past  few years,  this has not been reflected  in the funding of the Migrant Children  Program. I am pleased that H.R. 2707  recommends a 9.2-percent increase over  the current fiscal year's funding level  for this program.  I want to thank the Appropriations  Committee for its careful, and to the  extent  possible  favorable,  consider ation of President Bush's educational  rec~  excellence initiatives. I was pleased to  find that the Appropriations Commit tee had taken the exceptional step of  providing bill language which reaffirms  the role of the authorizing committee.  This bill also permits the initial fund ing of such educational  improvement  initiatives  as may  be  authorized  through new legislation if such is en acted prior to the end of the year.  The  committee's understanding  of  the significance of the Graduate Assist ance in Areas of National Need Pro gram continues to be reflected in the  consistency with which  it has  sup ported  its  growth.  H.R.  2707  ommends increasing its funding  level  by 20 percent over  the current fiscal  year. This  increase will permit  the  number of fellowships made available  under this program to jump from 1,493  during this year to 1, 799 during fiscal  year 1992.  In my testimony early last month, I  urged funding Head Start during the  coming fiscal year at the $2.3 billion  level which had been assumed for the  program  in our budget  resolution.  I  was very pleased to see that this bill  assures that Head Start's fiscal year  1992 funding will be not less than $2.202  billion, which definitely puts the pro gram in the growth path envisioned for  it in the budget resolution.  In closing, Mr. Chairman,  I would  like to once again extend my thanks to  the entire Appropriations Committee,  which has continued to demonstrate its  responsiveness  to  some of  the most  pressing needs of our society.  ",1991
569,31,12,Mr. NATCHER.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  1 minute to the gentleman from New  York [Mr. RANGEL].  ",1991
570,31,12,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Chairman, let me  thank  the gentleman from Kentucky  [Mr. NATCHER], the distinguished chair man of the HHHS Appropriations Sub committee, for the outstanding job he  does for the House of Representatives  and the Nation.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  amendment the gentleman from Flor ida [Mr. SHAW] will offer on this floor  in a  few minutes. It attempts to re store some $134 million to the appro priations for drug abuse treatment and  prevention  that are now below what  the President has asked for.  I know,  and the gentleman from Florida [Mr.  SHAW] knows, that this amendment is  out of order.  But I rise because it is the concept  which I support, and because  the so called drug czar has seen fit to politi cize this issue by having a press con ference yesterday on the Capitol steps.  He did no ask me or other members of  the committee whether we could work  with the administration to restore the  funds. He did not ask why the Presi dent of the United States had failed  until yesterday  to  send a  bill  that  would authorize the funds. He did not  ask  for Democratic Members  to  join  with him and his Republican Members  ",1991
571,44,12,Mrs. MORELLA.," Mr. Chairman,  I speak  in  support of an increase in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  [LIHEAP]  in  the  Labor-Health  and Human  Services, Education appropriations bill, H.R.  2707. Almost 2 million families throughout the  country could be cut off from energy assist ance next winter without this increase.  LIHEAP recipients are families with  low in comes, the disabled and the elderly living on  fixed incomes. The average family income for  the majority of LIHEAP recipient households is  less than $6,000 a year. Even at the current  funding of $1.6 billion, LIHEAP serves  less  than 25 percent of eligible households.  In my State of Maryland, proposed alloca tions from fiscal 1991  to fiscal 1992 would be  reduced by more than $13 million. From fiscal  1989 to 1992, the proposed number of house holds served would be  reduced by 27,000.  During this past season, the Maryland Energy  Assistance Program  reported an 11-percent  increase  in applications, while  the available  LIHEAP funds  to assist them has decreased  by 33 percent.  It  is reported  to me  that  for  every person helped with this program, there  may be  four or  five eligible customers who  haven't applied at all for energy assistance. In  addition,  the  recent economic downturn has  created new unemployment,  leading  to  in creased request for LIHEAP funds.  An  increase  in LIHEAP  funding will save  low-income Americans  from choosing which  basic  necessities  they  can  afford. Energy  needs are essential to the quality of life and  cannot be separated  from other necessities  such as education, affordable housing, and  health care. The cost to society for not provid ing these needs can be tragic.  I urge my colleagues to consider the impor tance of LIHEAP and to vote in support of a  funding increase.  Mrs. LOWEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in strong support of this measure, which  will help our Nation make significant progress  in meeting urgent human needs.  I would  like to focus in on several aspects  of the bill which are particularly  important to  our constituents.  First of all, Chairman NATCHER is helping us  move beyond  rhetoric and  toward  reality  in  making education a No. 1 priority in this Na tion. The $2.5 billion  increase  for key edu cation  programs,  including  chapter  1 and  Head Start, is vital to the future of our children  and  the future of our economy. These funds  are urgently needed and should be strongly  supported by every Member of this body.  In addition, I am pleased that the committee  has provided a contingency fund for education  programs, including $250 million for programs  which have not yet been authorized. If there is  action later this year on a comprehensive bill  to improve education, I am hopeful that we will  give serious consideration to the concept em bodied  in  the Link-up for Learning Act, H.R.  812, which  is aimed at helping  local school  districts join with social service agencies in co ordinating and  improving the delivery of vital  social services to at-risk youth.  Second,  I am particularly pleased that this  appropriations measure  includes a major  in crease for the Community Food and Nutrition  Program. This vital program that fights hunger  among  families and children needs our su~  port. As the Chairman understands, there is a  vital link between nutrition and learning. If our  children are not fed, they will not be educated.  This program can make the difference for so  many children across the Nation.  Further,  I am  very appreciative  that  the  committee has seen fit to provide a substantial  increase in vitally needed funds for community  health centers.  In my district and around the  Nation, community health centers are provid ing  lifesaving health care services to patrons  who otherwise would not receive care. Fur ther, the committee has recognized the impor tant role these centers play in reducing infant  mortality by earmarking $70 million  in new  funds for community and migrant health cen ters and by rejecting the President's proposal  to divert funds away from these valuable cen ters.  Finally,  this bill will  reverse  the Supreme  Court's decision  in Rust versus Sullivan and  continue the practice of allowing the millions of  women who  rely on  federally  funded  family  planning clinics to get full  information regard ing their reproductive health as all other Amer icans.  If this provision is not enacted, we will put  women and medical professionals in jeopardy.  As a result of the Supreme Court decision in  Rust versus Sullivan, beginning  in  July, a  woman who goes into a family planning clinic  and needs information about abortion will not  be provided with the medical facts.  This  is  intolerable and dangerous. Those  who oppose abortion have gone too far. They  want to gag doctors by censoring the informa tion health professionals can provide at feder ally funded clinics.  It is totally unfair to even  consider  the prospect  that poor women de serve to receive less comprehensive and inac curate medical  information  simply  because  they must rely on federally funded health care.  Make no mistake about it, if the Rust decision  is  not overturned,  not only would  a poor  woman not be told that abortion is legal, she  would not be able to obtain a referral to a pri vately funded clinic even if her life is in dan ger.  Such restrictions put doctors in a precarious  position. They will be  forced  to choose be tween  violating  their Hippocratic Oath and  obeying Federal censorship  laws. This  is  to tally contrary to all we stand for as a Nation.  Americans understand the importance of pre serving the sanctity of the doctor-patient rela tionship. We want doctors to tell us all of our  options so  that we have  the  information  to  make the best health care choices.  Over 20 medical and nursing organizations  have publicly opposed  the  gag  rule.  Last  week, the American Medical Association said  that legislation to overturn the gag rule ""would  keep the long arm of the Federal Government  out of  the patient-physician  relationship and  assure the traditional privacy of that relation ship."" The AMA also said, and  I quote, that  ""political medicine is harmful to the health of  all Americans.""  Our President has thus far refused to listen.  He has promised to veto this bill if it overturns  Rust versus Sullivan. We cannot let him get  away with that. If we do, we will fundamentally  change our health care system into one based  on politics and not on medical science. This,  in turn, will mean that this country will be pro viding substandard care to its most needy citi zens.  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to  support the reversal of the gag rule and re store the integrity of our Nation's family plan ning programs.  Let us keep politics out of the examining  room by overturning the gag rule. And let us  provide for the future of our Nation by approv ing  this bill, which  contains much needed  funds  that will help us meet urgent human  needs in communities across the Nation.  Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York. Mr. Chair man,  the bill we consider today, H.R. 2707,  makes appropriations for the Nation's most im portant health, welfare, and education pro grams. I am proud to have been a part of the  campaign which this past fall saw the creation  of the Offices of Research on Women's Health  within the National  Institutes of Health (NIH].  As one of  the Budget Committee's newest  members, I worked earnestly to include in the  budget  resolution  for  fiscal  year 1992  lan guage which explicitly conveys Congress' con cern  for women's health research and which  recommends $20 million in direct Federal as sistance  for new research  initiatives  through  both NIH and  the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and  Mental Health Administration [ADAMHA]. H.R.  2707 provides necessary  funding  for  these  new research initiatives which could mean the  difference between life and death for millions  for American women.  Despite startling breakthroughs  in medical  research  in  recent decades, diseases which  target women-breast cancer, ovarian cancer,  osteoporosis,  pelvic  inflammatory  disease,  clear cell adenocarcinoma, and others-re main shrouded in mystery. More than 57,000  American women will die  in  this year alone  from breast or ovarian cancer. Osteoporosis  will cause nearly 250,000 costly and painful  hip fractures before the start of 1992. And per haps most alarming,  the  1 0  to  12 million  Americans exposed to the synthetic estrogen  drug DES still  lives in  fear of the drug's un known effects.  For each of these afflictions,  the statistics  are alarming and all too familiar. We see the  destruction wrought, but we have no grasp of  how or why. For instance, we can observe a  genetic or hereditary trend in the development  of breast and ovarian cancers, but researchers  have  yet  to  identify  the  gene which  pre disposes a woman  to  the development of  these cancers. And, we know  that 1 out of  every 1 ,000 DES-exposed daughters will de velop clear cell cancer of the vagina or cervix,  but we are ignorant of how this risk is inher ited from the mother or how it may be trans mitted to third generation offspring. Further, it  ",1991
572,57,12,Mr. SHAW.," Reserving the right to ob ject, Mr. Chairman, if I might inquire,  as I said in the general debate, I have  an amendment to offer.  My question to the committee chair man  is how many  amendments are  there? I am not trying to prolong this;  however,  I want  to be sure  that all  Members will have  a  chance  to be  heard on their amendments.  ",1991
573,57,12,Mr. N ATCHER.," Mr. Chairman, if the  gentleman will yield, as far as we know  on this side, I would say to  the gen tleman from Florida, we know of only  two amendments, which will  require  very little time.  ",1991
574,57,12,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Chairman,  I with draw my reservation of objection.  The CHAIRMAN.  Is  there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Kentucky?  There was no objection.  Mr. COUGlil.JIN. Mr.  Chairman,  move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I take this time to en gage  the distinguished chairman and  the  ranking minority member  in a  brief colloquy.  The administration is committed to  winning  the war against drugs. The  President has requested large increases  in the Federal antidrug budget every  year; however, given some of our re cent actions, I am concerned about our  resolve in the drug war.  Many antidrug accounts in this bill,  such as the Health and Human Services  block grants and research grants, and  the  Education Department's  emer gency grants, have been funded at lev els  below  the  President's  request.  These drastic reductions will translate  into first the loss of more than 16,000  Federal treatment slots and more than  64,000 State and local treatment slots;  second,  the  inability  to  serve  over  224,000  individuals seeking drug treat ment; and  third,  the  loss of oppor tunity to do some students counseling  and the training of community leaders.  The Chairman, this sends the wrong  message to our cities, our schools, and  our  drug-ridden  neighborhoods. We  cannot afford to walk away from this  fight. Therefore, I would like to engage  the chairman, if I might, in a colloquy,  and offer my assistance and ask if the  gentleman would be willing  to work  with the other body and in  the con ference to increase the drug-related ac counts in these bills in that conference.  ",1991
575,57,12,Mr. NATCHER.," Mr. Chairman, if the  gentleman from Pennsylvania, a mem be:r of the full committee and one of  the  able members, will  yield, Mr.  Chairman, I would like to make  this  statement to the gentleman and to the  committee.  The bill, as  provides  $2.8  the gentleman knows,  billion  for  substance  abuse activities. This amount is some what below  the President's request,  largely  because,  as  the  gentleman  knows, many of the programs in the re quest are not currently authorized.  The committee has followed a con sistent policy of not funding unauthor ized programs above the 1991 level.  The President requested increases for  many of  these programs as well as  funding  for a  new, unauthorized $68  million treatment capacity expansion  program, which the committee had to  defer.  The authorized activities in the com mittee bill in the aggregate are slight ly above the President's request. The  President  requested  $1,191,842,000  for  these activities, and the committee bill  provides $1,192,750,000.  Once the authorization for these pro grams becomes  law,  the Committee  will consider funding  for new or ex panded  programs  requested  by  the  President, and we  join with the gen tleman in his statement to the com mittee as to the importance of these  programs.  Mr. COUGlil.JIN. Mr. Chairman, we  hope that these programs will be au thorized by the time this bill gets to  conference.  In  addition,  the  alcohol, mental  abuse, and drug abuse grants are cur rently authorized. We would hope that  we could work in conference  to fund  both the programs that would be au thorized and those programs that are  already authorized.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the will ingness of the distinguished gentleman  from Kentucky  to work with us on  that.  ",1991
576,57,12,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to engage  in a  colloquy with  the distinguished  chairman of the committee,  the gen tleman from Kentucky, with respect to  breast cancer research and other areas  related to breast cancer that are in the  bill.  Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman from  Kentucky knows, I appeared before his  committee on behalf of my bill, H.R.  2210,  to put $50 million more  in  re search and clinical trials for a disease  that is in epidemic proportions. Once  every 11 minutes a woman finds out  that she has breast cancer.  The gentleman from Kentucky has  been very gracious to me and to others  in hearing our pleas for  this and has  even attended seminars and so on and  stayed the whole time.  So I would ask the gentleman from  Kentucky, can  the gentleman clarify  for myself and  for victims of breast  cancer and  their  families across  the  Nation exactly what this bill does?  I have read the report. There are ref erences to breast cancer, but I would  ask the gentleman from Kentucky by  how much does the bill increase funding for research specific to breast can cer and other areas?  ",1991
577,57,12,Mr. NATCHER.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentlewoman yield to me?  ",1991
578,57,12,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Chairman, it is my  pleasure  to yield  to  the gentleman  from Kentucky.  ",1991
579,57,12,Mr. NATCHER.," Mr. Chairman, as re gards breast cancer,  the President's  budget, as we know, proposes an  in crease of $12 million. This bill  in creases that amount substantially.  A significant share of the $30 million  allotted to the Cancer Institute, per haps as much as $18  to $20 million, is  expected to go to breast cancer.  At least $5 million from the women's  health  study  is  likely  to  focus  on  breast cancer, and a share of the $10  million allocated to the Office of Re search on Women's Health will be for a  study of the link between breast cancer  and contraceptives.  Mr. Chairman,  I  should  also note  that our bill provides $50 million for  the new breast and cervical  cancer  screening program, which is $29 million  above the 1991 level.  As the gentlewoman knows, last year  when we marked up our bill,  the au thorization for the $50 million that the  gentlewoman  from  Ohio  knows  as  much about as any Member of Congress  and has worked harder  than anyone  that I know of, we did not have it in  time for our markup. In the conference  we said to them on the other side, ""We  know it is not in the conference. It is  important enough that we want it in  the conference.""  Finally  they agreed  to $30 million.  That little cut that went across  the  board carried us down to $29 million.  It is fully authorized now.  For  the money  for breast and cer vical cancer screening we have $50 mil lion, the full amount.  When the gentlewoman from Ohio ap peared before our committee, I wanted  to tell her at that time that at her re quest we were  going with  the  full  amount of $50 million, which we did.  ",1991
580,57,12,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Chairman,  let me  personally and publicly thank the gen tleman from Kentucky, and also  the  gentleman  from Michigan  [Mr.  PUR SELL]  and others, but  the gentleman  from Kentucky in particular for his re solve on this matter.  I only hope-I am very, very grate ful-l know I speak on behalf of women  and their families across the country,  because we  know we need more  re search and we want to find a cure. My  only hope is that the Senate will not  have zero in their budget, as they did  in the last Congress, and that the wish es of  the gentleman  from Kentucky  will prevail and, if anything, gets even  stronger, because the gentleman from  Kentucky has always kept to his work  as far as I am concerned.  ",1991

583,70,12,Mr. ANDREWS of Texas.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in support of the Porter language regard ing  title X family planning clinics within  the  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Edu cation and related agencies appropriations for  fiscal year 1992.  Imagine the horror of being raped and be coming pregnant as a result.  Imagine turning  to your doctor for counseling and being  told  that she cannot discuss  the option of your  having  an  abortion because  the Supreme  Court agrees with the administration that abor tion  is not an appropriate method of  family  planning. Unfortunately, many women  today  do not have to imagine this scenario; for them,  it is all too real.  The Supreme Court last month, in Rust ver sus Sullivan, upheld the constitutionality of De partment of Health and Human Services' regu lations-the  s<H:alled  gag  rule-prohibiting  federally  funded  family planning clinics  from  providing any patient information about abor tion.  Implemented by the Reagan administra tion  in 1988,  these regulations prevent doc tors, nurses, and counselors from mentioning  abortion, even if specifically asked.  This Supreme Court decision, however,  is  not even primarily about abortion.  It is about  free speech, medical integrity, and the sanctity  of the doctor-patient relationship.  It  is about  the  trust  that people-especially  the poor place  in  the Government  to assist  them  in  their most  serious  times  of  need. When  women seek counseling on health matters,  they should not have to question the honesty  of their physician nor fear the motives behind  their doctor's words.  Look at this decision from another perspec tive. Many of us, including the Bush adminis tration, think that the legal appeals process is  too  lengthy and cumbersome. But could you  imagine a federally appointed lawyer not tell ing a client of all  the  legal options? Do we  ever want a public defender saying, ""This of fice does not consider it appropriate to appeal  wrongful convictions."" This  is what the Gov ernment,  in effect,  is doing  through  the gag  rule. Because  the Federal Government pro vides funding to the clinics, the administration  thinks it can control the speech and agenda of  the doctors.  It  is a dangerous and ominous  precedent we set when we let the Government  ignore the first amendment simply because it  helps pay the bill.  The Rust decision is a tremendous blow to  the rights of the 3.7 million women served at  federally funded clinics across the country. In  Texas alone, approximately 180 clinic sites  provide such services. Essentially,  the high  court has ruled that low-income women do not  have a  right  to complete  information about  their medical condition and legal options-the  same rights and options guaranteed to women  who visit their private physicians. Poor women  have seen their rights become subservient to  political posturing.  An estimated 600,000 women  treated at  federally funded health clinics have a history  of health problems, such as diabetes or hyper tension,  that might make  pregnancy  dan gerous for them. More and more patients are  testing positive  for sexually  transmitted dis eases,  including AIDS. To not  inform  these  women of the dangers associated with preg nancy is not only bad medicine but an invita tion for medical malpractice.  To  law school students and  legal scholars  throughout the country, Supreme Court deci sions make for interesting intellectual and hy pothetical debates. But to thousands and even  millions of Americans,  the decisions have a  real and profound impact. The Rust decision is  one of those rulings with practical effects on a  large number of citizens. Pregnant women  seeking counsel at Federal clinics will be de nied assistance or will be given incomplete in formation and advice if the Rust decision be comes policy and if the gag rule continues in  force.  It is not surprising that many clinics in tend  to refuse Federal  funding  for their pro grams rather than compromise the ethical obli gations of  their doctors and counselors and  the health needs of their patients.  With President Bush apparently unwilling to  compromise, the burden falls on Congress to  act. Congress must now pass this legislation,  with  the Porter  language  unamended  and  send a loud, clear signal to the Nation whether  we want to side with the millions of American  women who seek and deserve complete medi cal counsel and the 80 percent of Americans  who oppose  the Rust ruling  in  recent public  opinion polls; or whether we want to side with  narrow-minded officials whose zealotry against  choice has led them to support the curtailment  of  first amendment guarantees and an en croachment into the sacred doctor-patient rela tionship. The choice is a clear one.  ",1991
584,70,12,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman  from New York  [Ms.  SLAUGHTER].  Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York. Mr.  Chairman,  because  there  is nothing  more American than the right to free  speech and, if this gag rule stands, next  it will be on teachers and on ministers,  I rise in strong support of this amend ment.  This week the National Commission on Chil dren released a report depicting the plight of  our Nation's children and making an urgent  plea of help  to all Americans. The  report  makes clear that we must invest in the lives of  these young Americans now or else  forfeit  their futures as well as that of our Nation as  a whole.  We have also heard in recent weeks about  providing a choice  for our children  in eduhigh  cation. But while we talk of increasing opportu nities  for American  families we cannot deny  the fact that one in five American children are  living  in poverty and have very  few options.  Many of these children do not even have a  place to call home but instead must seek ref uge in a shelter, at a relative's or in the back  seat of an abandoned car. These children are  so overlooked  that we no  longer even see  them. They have become invisible.  I would like to share the accomplishments of  some extraordinary children around the coun try that have come  to my attention over the  past few months.  There's Apollo, a sixth grader in Baltimore,  who recently was tested as gifted and talented  and  is now excelling  in  the advanced aca demic program of his junior high school.  There's Tommie Jackson, a 9-year-old  in  Jacksonville, FL, who is so bright and getting  such good grades his teachers want him  to  skip a grade.  There's Ronald,  an  award-winning  school artist in Minneapolis.  And  there's Tio, a promising high school  musician in Massachusetts.  All these kids have two things in common.  They have  talent. And  they all have been  homeless.  Over  the past 2 years,  I have heard so  many stories of homeless children and  their  parents battling the odds as they try to stay off  the  streets  and  to  keep  their  children  in  school.  Every year as many as 2 million children ex perience the horrors of homelessness. Home less children  face  tremendous obstacles  in  their pursuit of an education and even  the  most conservative estimates from the Depart ment of Education indicate that at least 67,000  homeless children do not attend school regu larly. Unless we invest in these children now,  we  face  spending  billions  in  the decades  ahead coping with a new generation of home less adults unable to provide for themselves.  Last year  in  reauthorizing  the Stewart B.  McKinney Homeless Assistance Act Congress  approved a measure  I  introduced  that ad dresses  the educational needs of homeless  youngsters. Today the House of Representa tives stands ready to approve a spending bill  that contains  this  little-known but very suc cessful program at a funding level that will en able our country to reap large economic divi dends.  Currently  the Education of Homeless Chil dren and Youth Program  is enabling  thou sands of homeless children across the country  the opportunity to attend school and succeed  once they get there. Under this program local  educational agencies are now applying  for  grants to help provide transportation for home less children,  to set up beforeand after school care and tutoring programs, to recog nize the gifted and talented among them, and  to provide them with school supplies and a hot  meal.  We are already seeing the results of these  efforts throughout the country.  In Costa Mesa, CA school officials are set ting up mobile units in areas where homeless  families congregate so  that children can be  evaluated,  tutored, and offered a quiet place  to do their homework.  In Bismarck, NO, school officials are arrang ing cabfares at reduced rates so that kids in  ",1991

586,83,12,Mr. HYDE.," I thank the gentleman for  yielding.  Mr. Chairman, we have been talking  about information and what a terrible  gag rule it is for the doctor not to give  some pregnant women abortion coun seling or advice rather than send her  where she can get it. What about the  lack of information to a mother and a  father whose daughter finds herself in  an abortion mill being urged to get rid  of this embarrassment, this unwanted  child? What about your daughter, your  unemancipated daughter going under a  surgeon's knife or an aspiration ma chine or whatever method they use to  exterminate that unborn child in her  womb, and not even letting the parents  know about  it? That  is eroding  the  family.  Now,  the majority party has  just  come out with a commissioned report  that wants to give $1,000 tax deduction  to families for each child. They under stand the magic in the words the fam ily. What is more corrosive of the fam ily than having a child go get a major  and  life  threatening, certainly termi nal to the unborn, life-threatening sur gery without even a requirement of no tifying  her  father  and mother? As  though the father and mother are irrel evant to the health and the welfare of  their daughter.  That is what the gentleman seeks to  do and has done, and that is what we  all sit silently by meditating.  ",1991

588,83,12,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," I thank the gen tleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I want to explain to  the Members of the body here in case  any wonder why I did not move to ap peal  the  ruling of the Chair on  the  issue of affirming  the point of order  striking out the parental notification  language. We all know what goes on  around here. That would have been im mediately  followed by  a motion  to  table so the claim could be made by the  members of  the majority party who  control this place that we are not vot ing on the merits of parental notifica tion, we are only voting on the merits  of sustaining the position of the leader ship that you do not want to vote on  the issue of parental notification, and  how you can avoid that is this proce dural  tactic that you have used here  today to gag our ability to give to the  people of this country an indication of  how the 435 Members of this body stand  on the issue of parental notification.  That  is what  is going on,  and  this  Member, strong letter to follow, does  not like that.  The CHAIRMAN pro  tempore. The  time of the gentleman from New Jersey  [Mr. SMITH] has expired.  For what purpose does the gentleman  from Wisconsin [Mr. OBEY] rise?  ",1991
589,83,12,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise to  oppose the gentleman's motion.  The CHAIRMAN pro  tempore. The  gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes  in opposition to the motion offered by  the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr.  SMITH].  ",1991
590,83,12,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, no single  issue is as important to the integrity  of this body as is our willingness to al ways  deal  honestly  and  fairly  and  forthrightly with each other.  And I rise to oppose this motion and  simply to correct some of the previous  statements  that  I  have  just heard  which, in my view, spectacularly mis lead the public in terms of what is hap pening here.  I happen to be one Democrat who in  committee voted for the parental noti fication  language.  I  think  that  that  language was a reasonable effort to try  to reach a compromise on this issue. I  also  happen  to  recognize  that Mr.  DEFAZIO, under the rules of the House,  has a perfect right to try to strike that  language because,  as anyone  under stands who has served here more than  2 days, it is legislating on an appro priation bill.  The Chair was  correct parliamen tarily in its position even though I do  not happen to agree with the practical  result.  The point  I would  simply  like  to  make is this: I do not think this insti tution has to apologize for the debate  we have had here today on this issue,  because at  least  the  institution has  tried to grapple with this question. We  should have done it a  long time ago  more successfully than we have. But at  least  today we  have been grappling  with  this  issue. Whether you  agree  with Mr. WEBER or not, there has been  an honest effort in this place to try to  do that.  I would simply make two points: No.  1, I would plead with both sides, both  the prolifers and  the prochoicers,  to  recognize  that  eventually what  the  public wants from both of us is not just  to win in a narrow sense; what the pub lic wants from all of us is an effort to  try to reach a reasonable point of ac commodation on a most sensitive and  most controversial issue which affects  the basic right  to  life and  the basic  right to privacy, both of which are le gitimate rights to be defended.  And it seems to me,  therefore, that  sooner or later there needs to be some  kind of language, if not the Weber lan guage then some other language, which  may more perfectly preserve the rights  of families in situations to which that  language was addressed.  But I want to say if there is one fail ure of leadership on this issue today, it  does not lie with anyone here; it lies  with the President, because on this bill  and on the foreign aid bill which came  up last week it is the President who is  trying  to rule by holding his breath  and turning blue and saying ""it shall  be this way or no way.""  And I frankly think the country has  a right to better leadership than that.  I think the country has a right to ex pect the President to engage on this  issue. I think the country has a right  to expect that the President will sit  down with  the Congress and  try  to  compromise on this issue so  that we  can find a reasonable proposition which  meets  the sensi ti vi ties of both sides  and maintains the institutional dignity  of this House.  So I congratulate the committee for  trying to do that. I want to congratu late the people who have legitimately  brought  their arguments  to bear on  this issue. I do not want to congratu late those who have chosen to try to  obfuscate  the  procedural  situation  today.  Most of all, I think the President has  an obligation to try to rise above play ing the narrow game of narrow, single interest politics and work out a na tional accommodation on  this  issue.  That is his responsibility-more than  any other public servants-in the coun try.  ",1991

593,83,12,Mr. FAZIO.,"  I  thank  the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly want to as sociate myself with the statements the  gentleman has made about the respon sibilities of the executive and judicial  branches, which have in effect placed  the Congress in a situation of dealing  with this very, very sensitive issue on  an appropriation bill.  I  think it has  to be pointed out,  though, that contrary to some of the  comments that have been made to kind  of obfuscate what  this debate  is all  about,  this Congress,  this House of  Representatives will deal with the re authorization of title X. Congressman  WAXMAN and Congressman DING ELL are  preparing to bring that bill to the floor  this summer. I know Mr. PORTER and  Mr. WYDEN are prepared to debate this  issue in the context of that bill.  Again, on the floor we will be dealing  with these very, very difficult issues,  including the question of parental noti fication and/or consent, which I  think  in the long run is the proper forum, the  proper approach  to dealing with an  issue that needs to be understood by all  the Members and are not to be carried  as a rider on this bill.

598,161,12,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Let me  ask a question. The article ends on a  sour note on those who met at the Sev enth International AIDS Conference in  Florence,  Italy.  It adjourned after 8  days last Sunday. They said probably  it will forego a convention next year,  kill it completely, and certainly not  come to the United States because the  United States has a policy of not ac cepting  immigrants who are  infected  with this always fatal venereal disease.  Has  the gentleman had any of his  constituents-! have only had a few of  mine aware of it-has the gentleman  had any constituent talk to him about  this, because  the average American's  reaction is stunning to me. They say,  ""What?"" We  have a  disease,  always  49-Q59  0-95 Vol. 137 <Pt. 12) 6  fatal, raging out of control, with 1 mil lion infected people. That is a conserv ative low figure. We want to let more  people in with the danger of spreading  that further and faster? Are we crazy?  When  I ask  them what about excep tions, like infected doctors who might  want to come to this conference in Bos ton. They say, ""Of course."" How about  visiting a  friend who  is very  ill or  dying? ""Well, of course."" How about  getting treatment themselves? ""Well,  sure, anybody could be allowed in.""  So again, there is the generous aver age American who has fought wars all  over the world and liberated dozens of  countries. There are always exceptions,  but to let people come into this coun try, and the irony is, because of this  politically driven AIDS crisis we are  suddenly going to release the standards  on gonorrhea, syphilis, leprosy, and a  lot of other diseases, all to give cover  to  the  humano  imnuno  deficiency  virus, to give cover, and we will be left  with tuberculosis.  How many people do we see like Kim berly Bergalis,  an  innocent  victim,  shriveled on a bed, crying to God, beg ging for God to take her, to take her in  His arms. How many people do we see  like  this with  tuberculosis  in  this  country?  I did not get a chance at the press  conference to say this today, but I will  close on it. Every single week now, for  the rest of our  lives probably, more  people will die of AIDS, and most of  them young, in their vigorous produc tive years,  than died in the Vietnam  war. Every single week for 10 years,  but the 2 weeks of the Tet offensive.  Take out the first 2 weeks of February  1968, and we are losing more people to  AIDS every week, with far more ex pense, than young GI's who were killed  on the battlefield, giving the full meas ure of devotion. These people die slow ly. Most  of  them,  like Kimberly  Bergalis, at great cost; $40  thousand  minimum. Some States up to $100,000 a  year maintenance, a  tragedy ripping  apart our young people.  I do not see  250,000 people out there with Tom Hay den, David Dellinger, Jerry Rubin, ana  Abby Hoffman making fools of them selves. I do not see this. Everybody is  saying, ""Go away,"" and that syndrome  has affected the Senate and the House  of Representatives in this Capitol. Peo ple do not want to get at these two lec terns from both parties, and face up to  the health crisis.  There  is only one  conclusion  this  Member can come  to.  It  involves a  three-letter word: s-e-x. Because it in volves sex, because it involves a power ful, arrogant, homosexual, politically  finely honed operation in this country  of activists, people are afraid to discuss  this health crisis. The result is a  to tally innocent, beautiful victim, like a  little saint, Kimberly Bergalis, shriv eled in her bed, pleading her life not be  wasted, that we pass in Congress a bill  to wake up  the medical profession.  They ought to be on the Hill, as a few  courageous ones lobby to get to Mem bers to do this before they have totally  wrecked their profession in the sense of  public relations and broken their faith  with the American people.

The problem is, every day  that we  wait, we condemn more people to get  AIDS, and dying a very horrible death  like Kimberly Bergalis.  I would like to read one section from  the Hippocratic oath which every doc tor takes:  I will apply dietetic measures for the bene fit of the sick according to my ability and  judgment; I will keep them from harm and  injustice.  ""I will keep them from harm and in justice."" They all swear to that. I can not believe that Dr. Acer did not know  that he was violating that oath when  he exposed Kimberly Bergalis and the  other four people  to  the AIDS virus,  along with his other patients.  Let me end by saying one more time  to the family of Kimberly Bergalis and  Kimberly Bergalis herself that I and  my collegues who are very strongly in  favor of this legislation, will work tire lessly over  the next few months and  years to get the Kimberly Bergalis Pa tient and Health Providers' Protection  Act of 1991 passed.

601,174,12,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I rise to  pay tribute to Mr. Herman W. Moore  m who has been honored with a front  page article in the June 3, 1991, Wall  Street  Journal  for  his  outstanding  achievements  in manufacturing man agement. Many  people  consider Mr.  Moore to be a dying breed in the work  force but it is this type of manager who  will keep America competitive as we  approach the 21st century. While many  of his business school classmates have  been lured to the fields of marketing  and finance by the higher salaries and  luxurious offices, Moore  finds  great  satisfaction in his position as the man ufacturing manager for Reynolds Metal  Co.'s Muscle Shoals, AL, plant. The ar ticle quotes Mr. Moore saying, ""I put  up with the headaches, because when I  get home I can say,  'We made some thing today.' You can't have a service  economy without  a  manufacturing  base-you've got to make something to  generate that dollar.""  Herman Moore grew up  in Atlanta  and a small Virginia town as the son of  a  jet mechanic. He received his bach elors degree in industrial engineering  from the University of Dayton before  beginning work with Reynolds Metals  Co. as an engineer. He exhibited his  dedicated work ethic by earning his  M.B.A. at night from the University of  Richmond Business  School  in  1982  while continuing  to work  full work weeks. Since then, Mr. Moore has been  able  to reap the benefits of his hard  work  and  dedication.  He  achieved  gratifying results by transforming an  uncompetitive plant operating at 40percent capacity to a smoothly operat ing plant at 100-percent capacity in 2  short years. By bringing in new teams  of industrial engineers, Mr. Moore was  able to cut costs, improve quality and  safety, and  increase efficiency by 35  percent. His changes enabled the plant  to  set company  records  for profits,  shipments, recovery, energy conserva tion and productivity. Mr. Moore's ef forts were recognized when his plant  was awarded the Chairman's Award Reynolds' top award.  In 1990, Mr. Moore was promoted to  plant superintendent of Reynolds' larg est plant. This position involves man aging revenue of over $1 billion, and  some 2,100 employees. Today, the plant  is running 3 months ahead of schedule.  Herman Moore is a  lost soul in our  economy.  According  to  Lester  C.  Thurrow, an MIT economics professor,  and author of the nenowned book ""The  Zero Sum Society,"" a major deficiency  in our economy is in manufacturing de velopment. Our  economy  has  been  graced with the inventions of the tele vision, radio, and computers, but has  failed to manufacture them efficiently  while also improving quality. Herman  Moore proves that it can be done.  I would like to represent the entire  work force by paying tribute to Herman Moore,  a  man who  joyfully  excepts a 12-hour work day beginning  at 6:45 a.m. Mr. Moore chose to turn  down the lure of a possible $125 million  portfolio  in  favor of $125 million  to  build a plant and see the results of his  work.  I admire Herman Moore's atti tude about his job and about the chal lenges he faces. We need more people  who think like he does when he says,  ""I can't save American manufacturing,  but at least I am doing my part to  make it possible.''  Mr. President, I appreciate the oppor tunity to shed light on the accomplish ments of Herman Moore. I hope  that  my colleagues will  take  the  time  to  read the article from the Wall Street  Journal. Once  again,  I  congratulate  Herman Moore  for  his  accomplish ments and look forward to his contin ued success.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a copy of a June 3, 1991, Wall  Street Journal article be  inserted in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Wall Street Journal, June 3, 1991]  DYING BREED: No GLAMOUR, NO GLORY, BEING  A MANUFACTURER TODAY CAN TAKE GUTS  (By Dana Milbank)  MUSCLE  SHOALS, AL.-It's 6:36 Monday  morning, and Herman Moore is already late.  Whizzing at 70 m.p.h.  through the empty  streets of this northwest Alabama town, he  scarcely slows down even after he enters  Reynolds Metals Co.'s aluminum  rolling  plant here, where he is the manufacturing  manager.  The night superintendent is waiting with  his report. A hinge broke on  the coating  plant's  truck door  and  a  valve  problem  threatens  to shut down  the hot line. The  baler is down and scrap is piling up outside.  One  furnace has stalled, and the bolts are  disintegrating on another. On  top of that,  the production staff is bickering with main tenance and accounting, the union l'las filed  a grievance against a  foreman, and a cus tomer is coming for a tour.  To his business-school classmates now in  marketing or finance, Mr. Moore's job might  seem like punishment. But not to Mr. Moore.  ""I put up with the headaches, because when  I get home I can say, 'We made something  today,'"" says Mr. Moore, a warm, ebullient  man of 38. ""You can't have a service econ omy without a manufacturing base-you've  got to make something to generate that dol lar.""  But this is a rare sentiment these days.  Lured by higher salaries and comfortable of fices, the best and brightest usually overlook  manufacturing jobs.  ""The rewards and financial incentives do  not exist for  someone  to stay within  the  manufacturing  sector,""  says  Robert  J.  O'Meara, a  consultant with A.T. Kearney  Inc. who  recently finished a study on  the  subject with  the National Association of  Manufacturers,  ""Without  these  incentives,  we run the risk of being manufacturing dino saurs in the 21st century.""  The study found that only 59% of American  engineering graduates go  into manufactur ing, compared with over 70%  in Japan. Per haps with good reason. According to a survey  by management consultants Towers Perrin,  a U.S. manufacturing manager  like Mr.  Moore makes an average of $91,713 a year,  while a top marketing executive in a simi lar-size operation earns an average of $229,678  and  a  controller $159,368.  In  Japan,  the  Kearney study  found,  the  salaries among  such executives are roughly equivalent.  And because most manufacturers won't re cruit managers with non-technical back grounds, only some 15% of all college grad uates take manufacturing jobs, according to  a Northwestern University survey. ""Manu facturers are losing out on some excellent  sources of talent,"" says Victor R. Lindquist,  the school's dean of placement.  Even once  inside manufacturing compa nies, those who choose to work in production  often find their paths blocked. Only five of  Reynolds Metals' 25 executive officers came  from the plants, and all four of the chief ex ecutives in the company's history (three of  them Reynolds family members) came from  sales backgrounds.  But Mr. Moore keeps trying. The son of a  jet mechanic who grew up in Atlanta and a  small Virginia town, Herman W. Moore m  majored in industrial engineering at the Uni versity of Dayton. He worked in the plants  as an engineer  in Reynold's management  training program before taking a staff job at  the Richmond, Va.,  headquarters. While  there, he took night classes at the Univer sity of Richmond's business school, earning  his M.B.A. in 1982.  It wasn't any love of manufacturing that  sent Mr. Moore back to the plants-he just  figured it was the best way to climb the cor porate  ladder. So  in 1985, when a  super intendent position opened up at a reclama tion plant in Muscle Shoals, Mr. Moore ap plied, over the objections of his wife, preg nant with their second child. ""I told her we'd  be in Alabama two, three maybe four years,""  recalls Mr. Moore, sturdily built with pre maturely gray hair. In the early days after  moving  to Muscle Shoals, hours from  the  nearest cities of Birmingham or Nashville,  Mr. Moore often came home to find his wife  crying on the couch with their newborn son,  (though she now likes the area).  But for Mr. Moore, from the first, the plant  held an appeal he never expected to find. ""I  was full of admiration for the hourly work ers and foremen who were making things  happen,"" he says. After years in stuffy con ference rooms, Mr. Moore liked the unpre tentious dress and  the quick, no-nonsense  meetings.  The admiration was mutual. The plant's  scrap rate and  its overall costs  improved  under Mr. Moore, and after a year, he won a  promotion to become manager of Southern  Reclamation Co., Reynolds's newly opened  plant for recycling cans.  GETTING RESULTS  There, Mr. Moore had a tougher task. The  plant was operating at only 40% of capacity.  Its costs weren't competitive with  rivals,  and  it wasn't getting much business. Mr.  Moore lured top industrial engineers away  from other plants with better pay and pro motions. He developed  teams  to cut costs  and  improve quality and safety, and peti tioned headquarters for a new $2.5 million  de-lacquering machine.  The results came quickly. After two years  the 60-worker plant was at 100% of capacity.  It had increased its efficiency by 35%.  After setting records for profit, shipments,  recovery, energy conservation and productiv ity,  the plant in 1989 won  the Chairman's  Award for Quality, Reynolds's top recogni tion.  By 1990, a triumphant Mr. Moore was ready  to  turn back  to headquarters. But head",1991

604,187,12,Mr. SEYMOUR.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of  the amendment  intro duced  by  the  senior  Senator  from  South Carolina.  I have  listened very  closely to the debate, and some of the  words I am hearing are ""justice"" and  ""fairness""  and  ""equity."" And  I  am  hearing words on the part of those who  propose this amendment, words to de scribe their position as if theirs is very  close  to what Senator THURMOND has  offered.  I have a differing view. I am not an  attorney, but I  rely on the words of  Abraham Lincoln when he said more  rogues  than honest men find shelter  under habeas corpus. And that is what  this argument is all about. It is not an  argument of  justice  for brutal mur derers; it is an argument of justice for  the victims.  I  heard  the  distinguished Senator  speaking on behalf of  the criminals  who have been convicted. Who is going  to speak on behalf, Mr. President, of  the victims and the families,  in over  250 cases  in my State of California?  When are they going to have justice?  I think there are some very large dif ferences between these two proposals,  and  that  is why  I  support Senator  THURMOND's and Senator HATCH's pro posal, because it will tighten it up, and  the bottom line of all of it is that it  will provide  justice  for victims and  their families and, in fact, create a real  death penalty, one that has meaning  and teeth in the law.  Yesterday, this body took an impor tant and historic step in fighting vio lent crime by expanding  the Federal  death penalty. If enacted, we will send  a  strong message  to  thugs  ranging  from racist skinheads to drug kingpins  that we intend to strike back against  their heinous crimes to the fullest ex tent of the law.  I am a new Member of this august  body, but the leadership demonstrated  by  the  distinguished  Senator  from  South Carolina and  the distinguished  chairman of the Judiciary Committee  is not new to this body, and I commend  the two managers of this bill for their  tireless efforts to achieve a bipartisan  solution on the Federal death penalty.  We  have demonstrated  tremendous  s\].pport  for  expanding  the  Federal  death  penalty  to  various  violent  crimes. We have also stated that our  States should have the ability to fully  and effectively dispense justice against  violent criminals, but our words, our  actions will amount to nothing unless  our actions will amount to nothing un less we demonstrate an equal resolve to  reform the Federal habeas corpus sys tem. And the votes we will make today  will determine whether we  intend the  death penalty to be merely a  tool of  campaign rhetoric or a serious instru ment of tough and effective justice-an  instrument that restores public faith,  integrity, and meaning to the phrase  ""criminal justice.""  Abraham Lincoln once said:  ""More  rogues  than honest men find shelter  under habeas corpus."" Well, this state ment is certainly applicable today, but  the rogues involved here are the worst  kind: Violent criminals on death row.  And the statistics show why these mur derers are the only Americans with any  reason to have faith in our current ha beas system.  ",1991
605,213,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  (See exhibit 1.)  ",1991
606,213,12,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  the  amendment offered by Mr. HELMS,  is  unwise, unfair, and has no place on the  crime bill. A vote to table the amend ment is not a vote for or against the  amendment. There will be ample op portunity next month to deal with all  aspects of  the quota  issue when we  take up the civil rights bill.  The amendment would make it an  unlawful  employment  practice  ""to  grant preferential  treatment * * * to  any individual or to any group on the  basis of race, color, religion, sex, or na tional origin."" That language would do  far more than ban quotas. It would re verse more than a decade of Supreme  Court precedent upholding the use of  affirmative action and outlaw all af firmative action efforts.  The Helms amendment violates  the  Nation's shared recognition that, under  certain circumstances, it is appropriate  to try to increase the representation of  women and minorities in the workplace  by engaging in affirmative action.  President Bush  and Reagan  have  both recognized the importance of af firmative action and have taken steps  which, had the Helms amendment been  law, would have been illegal. Similarly,  the Supreme Court has repeatedly rec ognized the valuable role played by affirmative action and has developed a  body of law defining the circumstances  under which such efforts may be under taken.  We should not overreact to the cry of  quotas by abandoning a valuable  tool  which has been  invoked by  the past  two Republican  Presidents  and  ap proved repeatedly by the Nation's high est court.  President Reagan  personally  dem onstrated that one can oppose quotas  and unfair advantages without also op posing appropriate affirmative action  efforts.  A  long-time  opponent  of  quotas, he promised in the closing days  of his 1980 Presidential campaign  to  name a woman to fill one of the first  Supreme Court vacancies.  He stated:  I oppose  tokenism, and I oppose setting  false quotas.* * *  I am also acutely aware, however,  that,  within the guidelines of excellence, appoint ments can carry enormous symbolic signifi cance.  This permits us to guide by example,  to  show how deep our commitment is and to  give meaning to what we profess.* * *  One way I intend to live up to that com mitment is to appoint a woman to the Su preme Court. I am announcing today that  one of the first Supreme Court vacancies in  my administration will be filled by the most  qualified woman I can possibly find, one who  meets the high standards I will demand for  all court appointments.  It  is  time  for  a  woman to sit among our highest jurists.  True  to  his  promise,  President  Reagan nominated Sandra Day O'Con nor to fill the first Supreme Court va cancy during his tenure. In announcing  the nomination,  the President explic itly  referred back  to  his  campaign  promise that one of his first Supreme  Court appointments would be a woman.  But  if  the Helms amendment had  been  law  in  1981,  President Reagan  would have been committing an unlaw ful employment practice when he ap pointed Sandra Day O'Connor to  the  Supreme Court.  President Reagan did not stand alone  in recognizing that there is an impor tant distinction between granting un fair preferences and engaging in appro priate  affirmative  action.  President  Bush-undeniably a staunch opponent  of quotas-has made clear that he sup ports efforts  to seek out women and  minorities to fill vacancies on the Fed eral  bench. His  administration  has  stated that it is looking for more quali fied female and minority candidates for  Federal  judgeships, and he personally  has written to Senator DOLE requesting  the assistance of GOP Senators in iden tifying qualified female and minority  candidates for the Federal bench.  President Bush has also supported af firmative  action  efforts outside  the  realm of judicial appointments. He has  repeatedly affirmed his support for af firmative action in improving the rep resentation of women and minorities  throughout America's workplaces. Ac cording to Bob Woodward's book, ""The  Commanders,"" Chief  of Staff  John  Sununu once  instructed Secretary of  Defense Cheney that, ""the White House  wanted 30 percent of the remaining 42  jobs in the Defense Department filled  by women or minorities.""  Like Presidents Bush and Reagan,  the Supreme Court has recognized the  important distinction between unlaw ful quotas and valid affirmative action  efforts. In its first opinion directly ad dressing  the  issue of affirmative ac tion, Steelworkers versus Weber,  the  Court held that title VII does not pro hibit private, voluntary affirmative ac tion  efforts designed  to hasten  the  elimination of discrimination.  In a  series of subsequent opinions,  the Court  has  illuminated  the  cir cumstances under which  affirmative  action is lawful. In Sheet Metal Work ers versus EEOC,  the Court held that  title VII does not prohibit a court from  ordering, in appropriate circumstances,  affirmative  race-conscious relief as a  remedy for past discrimination. Rec ognizing that the availability of such  relief may be the only effective means  to ensure  the  full enjoyment of  the  rights protected by title VII, the Court  approved the use of affirmative action  efforts as long as they do not rise to  the level of a strict racial quota, are  temporary, and do not unnecessarily  impair  the  interests of nonminority  workers.  In Firefighters versus Cleveland, the  Court held that title VII does not de prive trial courts of the authority to  enter consent decrees which provide for  the use of  race-conscious  relief and  other affirmative action designed  to  eradicate past discrimination, even if  the  relief benefits persons who were  not actual victims of the past discrimi nation.  And  in  Johnson  versus Transpor tation Agency,  the Court once again  distinguished  flexible  affirmative ac tions plans from  rigid quotas. It ap proved  an  affirmative  action  plan  which allowed consideration of an ap plicant's sex in making promotions to  traditionally segregated jobs and which  set goals for increasing the work force  representation of women and minori ties.  In United States versus Paradise, the  Court made clear that in appropriate  circumstances even  strict one-black for-one-white promotion requirements  may be permissible under  the equal  protection clause. Stressing the harm ful nature of the defendant's actions  and  the fact  that the one-for-one re quirement was  temporary,  the Court  held  that  the  requirement was nar rowly tailored to serve its purposes and  was supported by compelling govern mental interests in eradicating the de fendant's pervasive,  systematic,  and  obstinate discriminatory exclusion of  blacks  and  in  enforcing  compliance  with Federal court judgments.

Many  of my colleagues may be aware of my  long standing concern about mental ill ness. I have long advocated sufficient  funding for mental health research and  services, and I have deeply appreciated  the  leadership of  the chairman and  ranking member of the Labor, Health,  and Human Services and Education  Subcommittee in advancing our under standing of serious mental illness.  It will come as no surprise  that I  have today once again asked the lead ers of that subcommittee,  the chair man and ranking member, to continue  their support of that critical mental  health program.  In  that same  letter, where  I urge  them  to  support mental health pro grams as we have in the past, I seek to  enlist their aid on another important  program  that  I believe deserves  the  strong support of the entire Congress the Community Health Centers Pro gram.

613,278,12,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today  to  introduce  eight bills  which will suspend the duties imposed  on certain chemicals used in manufac turing  industries.  Currently,  these  chemicals are imported for use in the  United States  because  there  is  no  known domestic  supplier or  readily  available  substitute. Therefore,  sus pending the duties on these chemicals  would not adversely affect domestic in dustries.  The first bill will extend  the duty  suspension on five chemicals. They are:  1-Naphtol-4-sulfonic acid and the mono  sodium salt (Neville and Winter's Acid)  which is used in the manufacturing of  reactive dyes for cotton and wool prod ucts; 2,Naphthyl amine-6-sulfonic acid  (Broenner's acid) which is used in mak ing reactive dyes for coloring cotton  and  wool;  2-Naphthyl  amine-1,  5disulfonic acid and the mono sodium  salt (D Salt) which is used in the man ufacturing of reactive dyes for cotton  and wool; 3,Hydroxy-2-naphthanilide, 3Hydroxy-2-naphtho-o-toluidide,  3Hydroxy-2-naphtho-o-anisidide,  3Hydroxy-2-naphtho-o-phenetidide,  3Hydroxy-2-naphtho-4-chloro-2,5dimethoxy  Anilide,  , and  N,N'-bis  [acetoacetyl-0-tolidine]  (naphthol AS  types) which is used in the production  of paints, printing inks, and colorants  for  plastics;  3-Amino-methoxy  benzanilide (anis base) which is used in  the production of Azo pigments. These  pigments are used in the production of  paints, printing inks, and colorants for  plastics.  Mr. President, in the 101st Congress,  I introduced similar legislation to sus pend  the duty  on  these  chemicals.  These  duty  suspensions were  incor porated  into  the Customs and Trade  Act of 1990 and will expire on December  31, 1992.  The second bill I am introducing will  extend  the duty suspension on tetra  amino biphenyl (TAB). This chemical  is  imported  into  the United States  from West Germany. TAB is an essen tial raw material used in the produc tion of a high performance fiber called  PBI.  PBI is a unique heat and chemical re sistant fiber that can be used as a suit able replacement for asbestos. PBI has  a wide range of thermal protective ap plications such as flight suits and gar ments for firefighters, boiler tenders,  as well as refinery workers.  Mr. President, in the 98th, 100th, and  101st Congress,  I  introduced  similar  legislation  to apply duty-free  treat ment  to TAB. These bills were ulti mately incorporated into the Omnibus  Tariff and Trade Act of 1984, the Omni bus Trade Act of 1988, and the Customs  and Trade Act of 1990. The current duty  suspension  for  this chemical expires  December 31, 1992.  Mr. President, the next six bills I am  introducing will suspend the duty on  certain chemicals until December 31,  1994. This is the first time a duty sus pension has been requested for  these  items.  The first bill will suspend the duty  on 2-methyl 2.5 dioxo 1.2 oxaphospho lan, commonly called phospholan. This  chemical is used as a raw material in  the manufacture of polyester fibers for  carpeting.  The next four bills will suspend the  duty on Acet-p-anisidine; Diazo-2,1,4solfonic acid and its salts; 2,4-Dinitro  Aniline; and 3-amino-acetanilide-4-sul fonic acid. These chemicals are used in  the production of textile dyes and pig ments.  The last bill I am introducing will  suspend the duty on 2,3,4,5-tetrachloro1,4-benzoquinone,  commonly  called  Chloranil. This chemical is used in the  manufacture of coatings for electronics  applications.  Mr. President, suspending  the duty  on  these  chemicals will benefit  the  consumer by stabilizing  the costs of  manufacturing  the  end-use products.  There are no known domestic produc ers of these materials. I hope the Sen ate will consider these measures expe ditiously.  I ask unanimous consent  that  the  text of the bills be printed in the CON GRESSIONAL RECORD  immediately  fol lowing my remarks.  There being no objection,  the bills  were  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  .

614,343,12,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. President, Senators  BYRD,  BOREN,  D' AMATO,  FORD,  and  SHELBY  today join me  in introducing  legislation dealing with  the Korean  fighter program.  Just last year, after the Korean Gov ernment announced that it had decided  to purchase 120 F/A-18's, our Govern ment entered into a memorandum of  understanding to allow the sale. But in  March of this year, all of a sudden, the  Korean Government changed its mind  and announced that it was ending the  F/A-18 program. Instead,  the Koreans  announced they were going to purchase  F-16's.  The legislation my colleagues and I  are  introducing today simply extends  the 30-day congressional review period.  Presently, under the Arms Export Con trol Act,  procedures  for  considering  arms sales such as the Korean fighter  program give Congress 30 days, once it  has been officially notified of the pro posed sale,  to pass a  joint resolution  blocking the sale. Our bill says that  Congress shall have 30 days from  the  date of Presidential notification, and  that the  time does not begin  to run  until Congress has seen the agreed to  memorandum of understanding, as well  as all side letters of agreement.  Mr. President, there have been three  requests from Congress for the General  Accounting Office to look into all as pects of this sale. One of the requests  was from my colleagues and me, and  the other two requests were from the  House. This legislation does not-I re peat-does not do anything to preclude  the administration from entering into  a  final agreement with Korea. But is  does provide  the Congress with ade quate time to review this proposed pro gram, and it does ensure that Congress  has access to the agreement for review.  The General Accounting Office,  in  March of this year, produced a report  on the F/A-18. In that report, the GAO  raised a number of concerns over the  industrial  base  assessments  by  the  Navy, and most  importantly, by  the  Commerce Department. For example,  the Navy's analysis did not take into  account the potential Korean competi tion against United States companies  for the spare parts market. The Com merce Department is directed by law to  conduct an independent assessment of  the MOU to include the impact on the  U.S.  industrial base. However, Com merce could not provide the GAO any  evidence of an analysis of the indus trial base  impacts.  I would urge all  Members and their staffs to review this  report which, by the way, is classified.  The Constitution-article 1,  section  8, clause 3--gives Congress the power to  regulate foreign commerce. Arms sales  are, of course, a form of foreign com merce. It is imperative that Congress  have all the necessary information to  carry out this responsibility, including  any  relevant memorandum of under standing. Congress needs  to  see  the  MOU and all  related documents. We  need to see the details of the offset ar rangements. We need to know the de tails of what kind of  technology  is  being transferred.  Just last week, Mr. President, the Of fice of Technology Assessment pointed  out in its report on global arms trade  that the United States has transferred  defense technology on 12 major weap ons systems to South Korea.

615,356,12,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, there  will be no further rollcall votes this  evening.  I  have  discussed with  the  distin guished Republican  leader  and  the  managers, Senators BIDEN and THUR MOND, the best way to proceed with re spect  to  this  legislation  tomorrow.  I  would  like  to suggest  to  the distin guished Republican leader that we re turn  to the bill at 10 o'clock in the  morning, at which time the managers  will proceed to receive and attempt to  dispose  of other  amendment&-there  are, I understand, a  large number re maining-and that we simply operate  on the understanding that the distin guished Republican  leader and I will  meet tomorrow to discuss the subject  matter  just  voted  on,  the  Helms  amendment and the subject matter re lated thereto, and that while we are in  those discussions, pending our report ing back to the managers, there will be  no further amendments offered with re spect to that subject matter on either  side,  and  the managers will proceed  with respect to the many amendments  that relate to the bill itself or to any  other subject matter.  I inquire of the distinguished Repub lican  leader and  the managers as  to  whether or not  that  is an agreeable  procedure to them.  ",1991
616,356,12,Mr. DOLE.," It is an agreeable proce dure, if the majority leader will yield.  I had discussed it with the manager on  this  side,  the distinguished Senator  from South Carolina, [Mr. THuRMOND].  He would like to get back on the bill,  on the basic amendments. He feels, as I  think the Senator from Delware feels,  many of these can be disposed of.  We still have over 70 amendments, as  I understand it. And there are a num ber of Members already asking about  the weekend. So it would seem to me  we ought to try to resolve the so-called  Helms amendment some other way.  So we will agree not to get into that  until we mutually agree otherwise.  ",1991
617,356,12,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, I am  advised that the managers are working  on  a  unanimous-consent  agreement  that would permit Senator D'AMATO to  be recognized at 10 tomorrow, to offer  an amendment, so that we would be un derway in accordance with the under standing just expressed by the Repub lican leader and myself.  In that event, I inquire if we are pre pared to proceed to get this agreement  now.  ",1991

627,369,12,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr. Speaker,  one of  the great pieces of news which  the  world  received  this year was  the successful  movement of Ethiopian Jews to the State of  Israel. This was a great moment for the peo ple of  Israel who were able  to demonstrate  again  to  the world  the essential  reason why  the existence of a Jewish state  is so  impor tant. It was a great moment for Ethiopian Jews  who were given a chance to join other Jews  in a society  in which  they will be  fully  re spected and face no discrimination.  It was a  proud moment as well  for the United States,  and especially for President Bush, who did so  much at the critical moment to  facilitate  this  humanitarian operation.  Among  those who were entitled  to  take a  great deal of pride in this operation are a num ber of Americans who worked very hard for a  long  time  to alleviate  the plight of Ethiopian  Jews. No one  in  this country worked harder  and more diligently over a sustained period on  behalf of this cause than Barbara Gaffin, now  associate director of  the Jewish Community  Relations Council of Greater Boston. Barbara  Gaffin began her work on this issue more than  1 0 years ago.  In  fact,  in 1981 she went to  Ethiopia as part of a fact-finding mission of the  Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.  She has not stopped since then. Freedom for  Ethiopian Jews has been high on her agenda  and she  is entitled to great pride at the  role  she has played in its ultimate success.  Earlier this month Barbara Gaffin presented  a history of American-Jewish efforts on behalf  of Ethiopian Jews in the Boston Jewish Advo cate. Her account is a modest one, and under states the critical role she played in this. I am  pleased to note that she was aided to some  extent in this by her husband, Douglas Cahn,  who was my administrative assistant for most  of the time that I have served  in the House.  I am very proud myself that through Doug,  I  was able  to respond on a number of occa sions  to Barbara's  request  for assistance  in  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  her work, and I join Barbara and Doug and a  lot of other people in this country in feeling es pecially gratified that this particular chapter in  Jewish history has ended so well.  Mr. Speaker, as an example of some of the  good work that is done and  is  too often un chronicled,  I ask that Barbara Gaffin's article  about this be printed here.  [From the Jewish Advocate, June 7, 1991]  BOSTONIANS MOVED A MODERN MIRACLE  (By Barbara Gaffin)  Last week,  the State of Israel  rescued  nearly  15,000 Ethiopian  Jews  from Addis  Ababa. Flown in the belly of overstuffed 747  cargo jets, these Jews, who trace their ances try to the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon,  arrived in Tel Aviv with nothing more than  the clothes on their backs but with their an cient Jewish heritage  intact.  Indeed, the  ingathering of these people gives  renewed  meaning to modern Zionism's goal of provid ing a Jewish homeland.  The movement to rescue Ethiopian Jews  did not begin this past weekend, however. It  was the culmination of years of dedicated ef forts, both public and private, made by indi viduals and groups who,  in a  few  cases,  risked  their lives to help save this nearly  forgotten people.  Long before this most recent airlift began,  the seeds of this campaign were planted. Ac tivists in Boston, throughout the U.S., and  Israel worked to publicize the plight of Ethi opian Jews and create the public and private  will to guarantee that our government would  respond.  In 1979, when I began working at Jewish  Community Relations Council  of Greater  Boston (then known as the Jewish Commu nity Council),  only  a  handful  of people  around the country were familiar with or re sponding to conditions in Ethiopia. Height ening awareness was not an easy task. Few  people were interested. Information was hard  to come by.  In 1981, when I had the opportunity to trav el to Ethiopia in a fact finding mission of the  Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los  Angeles, I went. Even though I was told we  would never be able to meet with Jews in the  villages, my colleagues and I persisted. After  travelling illegally for three days by horse back and mule  through Ethiopia's Simien  Mountains, not only were we able to speak  with Jews, but we were able  to bring two  Ethiopians  Jewish  students  to  Israel and  with  them,  important  information  pre viously unknown to foreigners.  In 1982  I  spent  the  summer  living and  working with new olim at an absorption cen ter  in Beersheva, an opportunity not af forded others because of  the  secrecy sur rounding the escape route of the Ethiopians.  I returned to Boston to provide Jewish com munity members with fresh ideas for their  involvement.  Quietly when necessary, publicly when use ful,  our efforts move  forward. The  JCRC  worked closely with members of Congress to  explore legislative and diplomatic ways  to  establish  relief  efforts  and  evacuation  routes. With an active well-informed com mittee of motivated individuals, Boston area  Jews ensured  that all possible steps were  taken to aid our brothers and sisters in Afri ca. We brought in Ethiopian Jews to speak  before the public. We created slide shows, we  travelled to Washington, New York, and Is rael to meet with whomever could help.  The response public officials and particu larly the role of the U.S. government in both  Operation Solomon last week, and Joshua in  16725  1985 was no less a part of the success story.  When we became aware that several Jews  were imprisoned, we called on Rep. Barney  Frank  (D-Newton), who  immediately  im plored the State Department to raise these  cases with the Ethiopian government. Their  release was  ultimately  secured. Newton  Mayor Ted Mann called on national political  figures to intervene after receiving a chilling  reception  from Ethiopian officials  in  this  country. Sen. Kennedy and former Sen. Paul  Tsongas, who served in the Peace Corps in  Ethiopia,  likewise  pressed Ethiopian  au thorities and the Reagan Administration.  Other Massachusetts officials  joined  the  growing ranks of public officials around the  country who  responded  to our pleas. Con gressional hearings were held, allowing the  true story of the plight of Ethiopian Jews to  be placed on permanent record with our gov ernment.  As Bostonians, we can be proud that we  played an active and vital role in the cam paign to ensure that American support was  there to facilitate this modern day miracle.  We should never forget the potential impact  of one community's efforts as we continue to  channel our energies into other issues of con cern to us as American Jews.  COSPONSOR  THE  KIMBERLY  BERGALIS  BILL:  PROTECT  PA TIENTS  AND  HEALTH  PROVID ERS FROM COMMUNICABLE DIS EASE  HON. WilliAM E. DANNEMEYER  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 26, 1991  ",1991
628,369,12,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker, as you  know, Kimberly Bergalis lies near death in her  Florida home after contracting AIDS from her  dentist. At least four other patients of the late  Dr. Acer also are infected and face a similar  fate. Kimberly's tragic story has prompted mil lions of Americans to ask: What went wrong?  Last week, in an extraordinary letter to Flor ida health officials, Kimberly offered an emo tional and accurate response to that question:  Who do I blame? Do I blame myself? I sure  don't. I never used IV drugs, never slept with  anyone and never had a blood transfusion. I  blame Dr. Acer and every single one of you  bastards. Anyone that knew Dr. Acer was in fected and had full-blown AIDS and stood by  not doing a damn thing about it. You are all  just as guilty as he was.  P.S. If laws are not formed to provide pro tection, then my suffering and death was in  vain.  I'm dying guys. Goodbye.  Today  I  introduced  the Kimberly Bergalis  Patient and Health Providers' Protection Act of  1991. This legislation would require States to  screen health providers who perform invasive  medical and dental procedures for HIV infec tion and hepatitis B.  Infected providers would  not be permitted to perform any invasive pro cedure that poses a risk of transmission to pa tients, unless the patient expressly consents to  the risk.  The  legislation would also give physicians  broad discretion  to  test  for  these diseases  without  the  patient's  consent  prior  to  an  invasive procedure,  provided  the  physician  has a reason to believe that the patient is at  risk for a communicable disease.

629,382,12,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, it is with pleas ure  that  I  rise  today  in  recognition  of  ""Skywarn""-a very  important group of volun teers who protect our lives every day.  When severe weather strikes,  information  on warnings, evacuation, and  shelter must  reach the public with great haste. ""Skywarn""  is a volunteer group  largely  responsible  for  these services.  After receiving a warning from the National  Weather Service, Skywarn watches for the se vere conditions and takes appropriate meas ures to protect the local population.  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to report that there  are over 500  local Skywarn chapters around  the United States. The  importance of  these  groups in saving lives and property is of the  utmost priority.  I would like to take this opportunity to recog nize the local chapter of Skywarn from my 22d  District in New York. Under the able direction  of Dr. Mitchell F. Mayers,  the Rockland Cli matic Station in West Nyack, NY, provides in valuable protection to the citizens of my dis trict.

A TRIBUTE TO ARMIJO IDGH  SCHOOL, FAIRFIELD, CA  HON. VIC FAZIO  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 26, 1991  ",1991
630,382,12,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor  the  centennial  celebration  of Armijo  High School, located in Fairfield, CA. Prior to  1968, every person who graduated from high  school  in  the Fairfield/Suisun area had one  thing in common. At the top of their diploma  read the words Armijo High School. This com mon factor could be traced back 7 4 YElars.  The Armijo High School District was formed  in early 1891, and the first classes were held  later that year. Due  to the small size of the  student body, a rented upstairs room at the  Crystal Grammar School housed all  the stu dents. The school remained there for 2 years.  But as the student population outgrew the sin gle classroom,  a permanent  structure was  built.  In 1893, an ornate building was constructed  on Union Avenue in Fairfield. This was to be  the first of three Armijo High School building  sites.  It was also the first to house a gradua tion ceremony, under  the  instruction of J.A.  Metzler. By the turn of the century, nine gram mar schools were sending their graduates to  Armijo.  Due to a growing student population and an  outdated heating system  in  the  first school  building,  the second Armijo High School was  built  in 1915. This magnificent building was  constructed in a neoclassic architectural style.  In  fact,  the San Francisco World's Fair Pan ama-Pacific  Exposition  of  1915  honored  Armijo's new school with a merit award of ar chitecture. In 1929, a fire gutted the interior of  the building. It was immediately rebuilt and an  auditorium and gymnasium were added.  In 1952 another school was built on Wash ington Street in Fairfield. The students contin ued to travel between the two campuses until  the Washington Street campus was officially  dedicated on April 27, 1961. With  the enact ment of strict earthquake codes, the Union Av enue structure could no longer house students  and was later sold to the County of Solano for  $1.  It now serves as the Solano County Hall  of Justice.  Over the years, Armijo has seen many dis tinguished  individuals pass  through  its halls.  These people have been leaders in business,  education, arts and entertainment, and  the  community. Recently, Armijo has been recog nized both at the State and national level for  its educational excellence. Mr. Speaker, during  this centennial celebration,  I know my col leagues will join me  in saluting the students,  faculty, and employees, past and present, who  have been a part of this fine educational instiJune 26, 1991  tution, and I hope that Armijo's second century  will be as rich as the first.  DEMOCRACY IN NICARAGUA  HON. ILEANA ROS.LEHTINEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 26, 1991  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I wish to  bring to the attention of my colleagues the sit uation  facing the Honorable Azucena Ferrey,  the Third Vice President of  the Nicaraguan  National Assembly. Ms. Ferrey states that she  has endured threats to her life for participating  in the democratic process in Nicaragua.  Ms. Ferrey  recounts  that while  returning  from a legislative session, which discussed re pealing the land seizure laws enacted by the  Sandinista regime, a stranger approached her  car. This stranger spoke to her by name and  said if she supports repeal of this law he will  kill her. Moreover, she states that she is con stantly receiving threats to her safety at public  gatherings and demonstrations.  This crisis must be dealt with before  the  Nicaraguan exiles  in my south Florida con gressional district feel safe enough to return to  their country. This situation demonstrates the  torment and anguish these brave people have  to bear in order to maintain peace and pros perity in a free Nicaragua.  The Nicaraguan exile community and  the  entire world are watching Nicaragua to confirm  the progress of democracy in that country. Ms.  Ferrey and her fellow members of the Nica raguan Congress must feel  free  from  threats  of personal harm if democrary is to success fully take root in Nicaragua. We must all con tinue to support the prodemocrary, prohuman  rights actions in Nicaragua in this difficult time  of reformation.  THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF GIRL  SCOUT CAMP LATONKA  HON. BILL EMERSON  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 26, 1991  ",1991
631,382,12,Mr. EMERSON.," Mr. Speaker, for 40 years,  Girl Scout Camp Latonka  located on Lake  Wappapello, MO, has been the summer home  away  from  home  to  thousands  of  young  women from all over southern Missouri.  The  Indian word  ""Latonka"" means  ""home  by the water"" and this home by the water has  enhanced  the growth and development-so cially, physically, mentally, and spiritually-of  Missouri Girl Scouts for almost half a century.  Yes,  through the years Camp Latonka has  developed  into a multifaceted camp.  In  the  summer sessions, girls are given the oppor tunity to participate in a wide range of activi ties-from swimming, sailing, skiing, canoeing,  to horseback riding, hiking, and environmental  projects, and, of course, no summer camp  would  be  complete without campfires,  folk  songs, and the opportunity to learn to live and  work together in a democratic situation. Camp  Latonka provides this fellowship as well.  ~  --      I    I",1991
632,395,12,Mr. LEWIS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, in voting  today in favor of H.R. 2707, the Labor, Health  and Human Services, and Education Appr~  priations bill,  I do so with some serious res ervations.  This appropriations bill provides vital funding  for Medicaid and Medicare. Funding  is also  provided for many other important programs,  including cancer and AIDS  research, health,  education, drug  treatment, and  job  training.  These programs must be provided appropriate  funding so  that  they continue  to serve  the  needs of our Nation.  I voted  to support the  continued operation of these programs, but I  am hopeful that the excessive funding levels  in this bill will be reduced in conference.  I will work with my Senate colleagues in an  attempt to reduce overall  increased levels of  spending.  If H.R. 2707 returns to the House  from  conference without  substantial  reduo tions, I will be obliged to oppose the bill.  I also oppose the bill's provision that pr~  hibits the use of funds to enforce or implement  HHS regulations that prohibit federally funded  family planning clinics from providing informa tion to clients about abortion.  H.R. 2707 is not the mechanism in which to  attempt to overturn the Supreme Court deci sion  in Rust versus Sullivan. Quite frankly,  I  find it irresponsible that the Democratic leader ship would entangle  these  initiatives through  debate on an  issue which clearly merits dis cussion on its own standing.  I have in the past and will continue to sup port the title X family planning program which  provides critical  resources  for education and  counseling  programs  that  include  prenatal  care, maternal care, child care, and  family  planning programs. The program was never  intended to provide abortion as an option for  an unintended pregnancy.  The Supreme Court ruling  in Rust versus  Sullivan simply enforces existing regulations section 59.9-that prohibit title X projects from  encouraging, promoting, or advocating abor tion as a method of family planning.  As my voting record clearly indicates,  I do  not support spending Federal  tax dollars  to  pay for abortion under any circumstance. Con sequently,  I do not support the promotion of  abortion as an option for an unintended preg nancy under the federally funded title X family  planning program.  In my opinion the attempt to overturn  this  ruling would seriously damage the intent of the  family planning program to support preventive  family planning services.

Mr. Speaker, as  raging oil  fires continue  to smother  Kuwait and damage the entire gulf re gion, both the Bush administration and  the Kuwaiti regime continue to treat  this megadisaster like a routine fire at  the local garbage dump.  If we can rally the forces of freedom  worldwide to expunge Saddam Hussein,  why are we not rallying all possible ef forts to resolve the eminently foresee able oil well disaster that already has  brought major and longstanding dam age  to  the gulf environment and  its  people?  It serves no  legitimate purpose  to  drag our feet or downplay this disaster  because of any impact on public opin ion as to the war. The war is over; our  challenge is to restore peace and secu rity in the broadest sense.  The State Department has taken a  hands-off approach when it comes  to  cleaning up the gulf region. There per sists a laissez faire attitude toward ex tinguishing the fires and cleaning up  the oil slicks.  ""I always call it a catastrophe, not a  problem,"" said Dr. Ali Khuraibet of the  Kuwaiti  environmental action  team,  who was recently quoted in a New York  Times article on the situation in Ku wait: ""If it is just a problem we would  be able to know its magnitude. But at  this point we do not even know  its  scale and magnitude,"" Dr. Khuraibet  continued. He also sharply criticized  EPA Administrator William K. Reilly  for seeming to minimize the health ef fects of the continuing smoke on a re cent visit to Kuwait.  to  We need an all-out effort to complete  a comprehensive inventory of the envi ronmental damage  to  the area, upon  which a reliable assessment of the risk  to human health can be based. Al though health experts downplay  the  danger these fires pose, could not the  blackened  lungs of  recently  slaugh tered goats and sheep in the region be  a  harbinger of human problems  come?  The United States is standing back,  letting the Emir handle the situation.  As a result, the problem is not being  viewed or addressed as the appalling re gional environmental crisis which  it  truly  is but  rather as an expensive  business problem for the Oil Company  of Kuwait.  In fairness to the Emir, the Kuwaiti  oil clean up, as slow a.s it is, is a more  laudable effort than their wretched at tempts at postwar justice.  While some progress has been made  by courageous oil field workers, there  are still approximately 500 wellheads  burning. On June 11, 1991, oil wellfire fighting expert Red Adair appeared be fore  the Senate Gulf Pollution Task  Force. He said that despite the recent  progress,  those fires which have been  extinguished  so  far  are  the  easiest  ones. The hard work lies ahead. He said  the current effort to fight the fires is  inadequate. At the current pace, it will  take 4 or 5 years to do the job. He char acterized the current level of commit ment by the Kuwaitis to extinguishing  the fires and cleanup of the area as a  ""Mickey Mouse"" effort.  Mr. Adair testified he needs cranes,  bulldozers, and more water. He needs  assistance from the military in ridding  the area of the mines left behind by the  Iraqis. He also needs medical support  and would like to have a team of burn  specialists on standby.  And Mr. Adair needs the cooperation  of the Kuwaiti Government and Ku waiti customs officials. What purpose  under heaven does it serve for the Ku waitis to interfere with medical sup plies for  those risking  their lives  to  fight the fires raging there. Yet, Mr.  Adair has stated that customs officers  there recently ruined several hundred  thousand dollars of medical supplies he  had shipped in for burn treatment. The  supplies where ruined due to exposure  to the air after Kuwaiti customs offi cials  insisted  that  the materials be  opened for inspection. With Mr. Adair  and his courageous coworkers risking  their lives, surely the Kuwaitis could  be more cooperative.  In late April, I toured the gulf area  and witnessed the horrifying spectacle  of the massive fires raging in the oil  fields. We are all familiar with the re ports of a  smoke heavy enough  to  block out the Sun, and of soot-black ened cattle wandering past pools of oil  in a  surreal  landscape. We have all  heard the reports about black rain as  far away as Turkey and the Himalayas.  ",1991
635,473,12,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President, the United  States now stands at the peak of its  ability to exercise world leadership in  controlling  the  international conven tional arms trade. We have in front of  us  the development of a new era in  East-West relations and the construc tion  of democratic  governments  in  Eastern and Central Europe. We have a  victory behind us in the Persian Gulf.  And we have the eyes of the world upon  us to exercise leadership in halting the  unmonitored and unrestrained trading  in  conventional weaponry  that has  been a part of the old world order for  the past several decades.  We must seize this opportunity, Mr.  President, before the momentum is lost  and before another Iraq is allowed to  develop. The recent initiative of Presi dent Bush calling for establishment of  guidelines  for  restraints on  conven tional arms  transfers  to  the Middle  East is a welcome step. Yet, our efforts  in mustering  the  international  co operation which  is essential  to any  progress  in  this area must be  com prehensive,  and our approach many faceted. One concept certainly deserv ing of more attention is that of trans parency-in  other words,  increasing  the amount of information that is pub licly  available  about  international  arms transfers. Enhanced transparency  is not an end, but a means to an end. It  is but an initial component of an effec tive multilateral control  regime  for  conventional arms  transfers, yet one  which can go a  long way in fostering  motivation for future steps.  At recent hearings of the Permanent  Subcommittee  on  Investigations,  on  which  I  serve  as  ranking minority  member,  several witnesses  testified  about the increasingly unfettered sell ing tactics prevalent in today's global  arms market. Over 60 nations-many of  them in the Third World-are engaged  in arms manufacture and export. And  most of these are dependent on exports  in order to keep their indigenous de fense  industries viable. Although  the  overall  volume  of  global military  transfers has declined in recent years,  activity in the international arms mar ket has not abated as suppliers vie for  shares amidst increasing competition.  One of the points which was  illus trated clearly by the witnesses at this  hearing  is  the dearth of information  which  exists  regarding  individual  transactions in the conventional arms  market. Although overall arms  sale  volumes can be approximated and cer tain  individual  transactions  tracked,  there is little or no information pub licly available about the vast majority  of conventional arms transfers. With out such information, it is impossible  to assess the adequacy of our existing  regulations or sensibly to contemplate  enhanced controls.  The United States is uniquely able to  take the lead in encouraging greater  transparency in the arms market. Our  defense  industry  is one of  the most  transparent in the world, with congres sional  reporting requirements  for all  major sales built into our export con trol regime. This is not so in other na tions, including many of our NATO al lies, where arms  transfers are often  closely guarded secrets.  Mr. President, a prudent first step  which I would urge be given serious at tention is a call to all nations-in par ticular to our fellow members on the  U.N. Security Council at the coming  Paris conference, and to our NATO al lies-to  introduce  enhanced  trans parency into arms sales-at least to a  degree parallel to that which exists in  the United States. Perhaps we, too, can  go further as time progresses. Yet this  represents a good starting point.  There  are  several ways  to  bring  about enhanced  transparency  in  the  international arms market. The one  currently  receiving  the most  atten tion-including the support of British  Prime Minister John Major-is the in troduction of an arms registry in which  certain information about arms sales  and  purchases  would  be  recorded.  President Bush,  in his Arms Control  Initiative, called for an annual report  on arms  transfers by  the five major  suppliers  to  the Middle East. This  could form the basis of a more com prehensive registry. Although concep tions of an arms registry vary, most  agree that it could be devised in such a  way so as to ensure protection of le gitimate  proprietary  concerns.  One  idea-an idea favored by Great Britain,  Germany, and several other nations would be a registry which, at the out set, would be limited to the main sup plier nations-the Permanent Fiveand would cover  the major weapons  categories as defined in the CFE nego tiations. Such a registry, by including  the vast majority of conventional arms  transactions, would serve as a basis for  enhanced controls in the future.  Institution of an arms registry and  introduction of increased transparency  have  several  other  advantages  rec ommending them: The cooperative and  consultative spirit engendered by mul tilateral  collaboration  to  develop  a  registry would carry over into other ef forts in controlling the arms market.  The international pressures fostered by  participation in such a registry would  exert positive regulatory influence on  traders  in  the  international market.  And,  the  increased attention brought  to arms transactions would assist ef forts to muster increased political will  to bring the arms trade under control.  Mr. President, we have a  large task  ahead of us, yet one which we cannot  ignore.  Increased  illumination of the  extent and workings of  the conven tional arms market and closer multi lateral cooperation are crucial compo nents of a successful strategy for en suring the peace and tranquility of the  new world order.  It  CONCERNS WITH THE  COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY BILL  ",1991
636,473,12,Mr. ROTH.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today to express my concerns with the  comprehensive energy bill, S. 1220, that  the Energy  and Natural Resources  Committee has recently approved.  During my years in the Congress I  have expressed my belief concerning  mankind's responsibility  to  the envi ronment. Simply stated, it is that man  is bound to serve nature through an en vironmental ethic.  Mankind has  the  responsibility  to  pass on a  life-giving,  life-sustaining,  environment to future generations. Our  natural heritage ranks high among our  most priceless and  irreplaceable pos sessions. To loose it would be a loss to  all of mankind.  is  often  exhibited  that  all  ecosystems,  from Alaska  to Africa,  South America to Saudi Arabia, are in extricably connected. Not only can de struction in one small area bruise the  conscience of man, but it can affect the  fragile  ecological balance of  a  tiny  world  that appears more vulnerable  with each passing day.  Perhaps  this  environmental  tran scendentalism is nowhere more appar ent  than  in  the  circumpolar  region  where the wind, water, fish, fowl, cari bou,  and other  animals  and  plants  know no political boundaries.  Whether the pollution that threatens  their pristine and fragile environment  comes from  the Soviet Union, Brazil,  Eastern Europe, or the United States is  of little consequence-especially when  the contamination begins to affect the  native peoples who depend on the eco system.

670,538,12,Mr. BRYAN.," Mr. President, as part of  our  efforts  to  address  our Nation's  crime problem,  this amendment will  combat fraud and corruption in our Na tion's  insurance  industry.  Insurance  fraud  is a growing problem, and has  now become one of the key areas of  concern for State insurance regulators.  As chairman of the Commerce Com mittee's Consumer Subcommittee,  I  began  holding  hearings  earlier  this  year to examine the financial health of  our Nation's insurance industry. This  examination was begun in response to  the growing number of failures in the  insurance industry. Over the past dec ade,  insurance company failures have  grown from an average of 4 to close to  20  per  year.  These  failures  have  amounted  to  billions  of  dollars  of  losses, which are ultimately borne by  policyholders,  taxpayers, and consum ers, through lost investments, bailouts,  and increased rates.  In just the last 2 months, we have  witnessed four of the largest failures in  the history of the insurance industry.  These failures include the takeovers of  the Executive Life  Insurance Co.  of  California and its subsidiary, Executive  Life of New York; the First Capital In surance Co.  located in California; and  the Fidelity Bankers Insurance Co. lo cated in the State of Virginia. These  three  companies  combined  represent  over $80 billion of business, and involve  more  than 800,000 policyholders. Evi dence from hearings held in the Com merce Committee  show  that  these  800,000 policyholders who are located in  all 50 States, are now at considerable  risk of  losing  their  investments and  life-long savings.  In March of last year, a study was re leased by the House Energy and Com merce Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations on insolvency in the in surance industry, the study, which en tailed a 3-year investigation of the in dustry, found that company fraud has  become one of the primary contribut ing factors to insolvency in the indus try.  Such  fraud  includes  deliberate  misrepresentations  to consumers and  policyholders  regarding  the value of  policies and the financial condition of  companies,  falsification  of  financial  records, and submission of false finan cial statements to State regulators all of which severely complicate  the  ",1991

672,564,12,Mr. STEVENS.," I thank the Senator.  Every one of us have used a credit  card. I tell you that the system that we  envision is very similar to a credit card  being checked as you go in to make a  major purchase. The store owner just  runs it through a direct line, dials in  the direct  line  to  the center, and it  checks right through automatically.  The  system we  are  talking about  which we would  finance  through my  amendment is just such a system. The  local gun dealer will call  in  to  the  State agency,  the State agency will  check his card right straight through,  punch in  the name of the purchaser,  and within minutes they will know if  that person is entitled to purchase a  gun.  What happens under Brady? You wait  7 days, and you use your best efforts to  see whether or not the person is quali fied. They are not really talking about  eliminating those who are not quali fied. They are talking about a cooling off period and cooling-off periods just  have not worked. Every State that has  a cooling-off period has a higher level  of homicides by guns than those who  do not. The amendment of mine would  put  into effect a  system  that would  work.  I  thank the distinguished leader for  allowing me to finish that statement. I  thank those who have worked with me.  Above all, I want to say that as far as  I am concerned many obnoxious por tions of gun control in this bill have  now been eliminated. There are still  some others we will  talk about later  but at least some of the obnoxious are  the ones we have eliminated.  ",1991
673,564,12,Mr. BIDEN., I yield 1 minute to the  Senator from Rhode Island.  ,1991
674,564,12,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I have  been a cosponsor of this legislation for  the past 6 years. It works in my State  of Rhode Island. We have a 7-day wait ing period. So the question might logi cally be,  if you have  it why do you  want to impose it on others? The trou ble  is  these  laws  are  a  patchwork  across  the Nation. Our State is very  small.  If one wants  to go elsewhere  without a waiting period,  it is very  easy to do it. So it seems to me impor tant to have a national law.  Right now criminals under the exist ing laws in most States only need lie.  the Senator  Under  the existing Federal  law, you  can just lie. You fill out a form. You  are a criminal? No, I am not. You can  purchase a handgun.  The way this works so successfully in  my State is it allows a period to do the  checks as they have done in the 7-day  period. It has worked very successfully.  I hope  the Brady bill will be  ap proved. Thank you.  ",1991

677,564,12,Mr.  BUMPERS.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to share the story with my  colleagues about  the last year I was  Governor of my State, I believe it was.  We  have  a  veterans' hospital  called  Fort Root. There are a lot of disturbed  veterans  there. One afternoon a vet eran walked away from Fort Root and  stole an automobile, drove about 70 or  80 miles north of Little Rock,  and  walked into a gun shop, small commu nity, and bought a  .357 magnum, no  questions asked. About 1 hour later, he  was  in Harrison, AR, about 50 miles  north, and about 5 minutes  later he  drove up  to a motel, and 5 minutes  after that there were six people dead.  If you had even a national instant  check, and no waiting period, it would  have still happened because you will  not have had time to get his name into  the computer if it were not already in  there. If we had any waiting period at  all, even 24 hours, at least those 6 peo ple might still be alive.  Thank you, Mr. President.  ",1991
678,564,12,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  the  debate about so-called gun control is a  red herring when the real issue is crime  control. Simply put, gun control does  not translate into crime control.  When we enact a  law for the protec tion of society, it must accomplish two  things:  First,  it must  solve  the perceived  problem or show realistically that it  will accomplish something to at least  curb the problem;  And second, the people must have re spect for the law, knowing it is in their  best interest.  The fact is, Mr. President, criminals  don't  buy  guns  from  legitimate  sources. Criminals won't abide by it  and won't be affected by any waiting  period.  It is wishful thinking to assume that  if guns are controlled, crime will be  controlled. Restrictive gun laws do not  and will never strike fear in the hearts  of criminals. There is no deterrent to  using a gun in a crime.  However,  restrictive gun provisions  do send a message to those law-abiding  citizens who want to own a gun. It says  the Government can't trust you. The  Government has to hold you back.  This attitude does not enhance effec tive  law enforcement. Solid  law  en forcement requires the support of the  American citizen. Gun control creates  a  new category of suspects,  and as  such, undermines the trust law-abiding  citizens have in their governments.  Those who live and work in this area  know that Washington, DC, has a very  high crime rate and is often referred to  as  the murder capital of  the world.  Well, the District of Columbia also has  one of the toughest gun control laws in  the country. But you can walk a dozen  blocks from the Capitol and buy a gun.  Unfortunately,  gun  control  doesn't  keep guns from the hands of criminals.  The phrase ""people, not guns, kill"" is  much over-used. But it is a  fact. We  need to address ourselves to the ""Peo ple,"" not  the guns. That is, we need  tough  enforcement of existing  laws,  and we need  to  strengthen criminal  penalties. We have  to  tighten proce dural  loopholes and stop giving con victed criminals unending rights of ap peal.  These are the answers that will begin  to solve our crime problem.  I have another concern, Mr. Presi dent, and it is that this 7-day waiting  period represents just the beginning for  gun control advocates. When the wait ing period proves unsatisfactory,  the  next step may be to limit the right of  our citizens to own guns.  I agree that keeping guns out of the  hands of felons is important. But the  issue is how to successfully do so with out  infringing on  the  rights of  law abiding citizens.  It is  important  to  remember  that  laws are enacted to protect law-abiding  citizens, not to punish them because of  a criminal's choice of weapon. To do  otherwise turns these citizens into in nocent  victims  in  our war  against  crime. That is the wrong approach.  Mr. President, there is no doubt that  this is an emotional issue, but we here  in Government must avoid reacting on  an emotional basis. Yes, we have a seri ous crime problem. Let's try to solve it  by toughening up our enforcement, im posing  the  right penalties,  including  the death penalty, and closing proce dural loopholes which favor the crimi nal. Let's not penalize honest citizens  by interfering with their right to de fend  themselves and  to enjoy  lawful  gun ownership.  ",1991
679,564,12,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. President,  I have  long been a  supporter of the  right of law-abiding American citizens  to purchase and own firearms without  needless and intrusive Government in terference and regulation. Yet I recog nize  that  in a  society as diverse as  ours, with violent crime escalating at  an unprecedented level in many cities  and  towns  throughout our  country,  there  is  a  legitimate  responsibility  that Government has  to prevent cer tain  individuals  from obtaining  fire arms.

680,577,12,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, before  the  distinguished  majority  leader  leaves the floor, might I comment on  the discussion  that he  just had with  the Senate on the bill that he just sent  to the desk for printing and referral.  I am not totally familiar with it, but  I did hear the distinguished majority  leader discuss  it.  I have a  summary  sheet. While I might have objection to  some specifics,  I want  to say  to  the  Senator the overall idea is, in the opin ion of the Senator from New Mexico,  an excellent idea.  I think we both heard Boris Yel tsin  open his discussions with us by saying,  ""I do not want dollars and money,"" and  then he said what he wanted. I think it  49-059  0-95 VoL 137 !Pt. 12l 19  sounded something like this summary.  Not  exactly,  because  he  spoke  dif ferently  than we  in terms of institu tions.  I congratulate  the Senator on  his efforts.  ",1991
681,577,12,Mr. MITCHELL.," I thank the Senator  very much. This bill had been in the  planning stages prior to his visit, but  the visit confirmed in my mind the rel evance of this  to  the ongoing  trans formation in the Soviet Union.  I  thank  the Senator  for his com ments.  ",1991
682,577,12,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to be a principal cosponsor of  the United States Law and Business  Training Program for Soviet Graduate  Students Act. This act will establish a  scholarship program to bring students  from  the Soviet Union to the United  States to study law and business ad ministration.  With this measure, for this first time  a substantial number of young Soviets  will be able  to come  to  the United  States to enter educational programs.  And  they will  come  to  the United  States  to study business administra tion, economics,  law, and public ad ministration.  These  are  the  fields  which will contribute the most to pro moting economic and political reforms  in the Soviet Union.  And what could be more useful at  this moment of history? The Soviet  Union  faces  a  time of  fundamental  change. The old guard of communism is  being  replaced by  free-market  forces  and democratic ideas.  But,  these changes will  take  time.  And no matter what our desires are for  speeding these changes along-the fact  is that it will be the next generation of  Soviet citizens which will  see  these  changes through and indeed, reap the  rewards of this effort.  But to make this happen, we must  help plant  the seeds of change. And  what better way  than  through  edu cation?  One way to do this is to allow young  Soviet citizens to come to the United  States to learn how our system works.  To see democracy in action;  to study  law and business;  to make  the most  valuable kinds of connections-those  between our two peoples.  And what -better way  to plant  the  seeds of change  than  to give Soviet  graduate students the ability to come  to the United States and get hands-on  experience in the business world and to  take that knowledge back to  the So viet Union.  This program will do  just  that. It  will combine formal education at uni versities in the United States with real  world experience provided through in ternships and training in professional  settings.  Furthermore,  it will  ensure  that  these students will return to the Soviet  Union to speed economic and political  reform, by making each scholarship in  the form of a loan with repayment only  to be forgiven after the student returns  to the Soviet Union.  And it will be fair, providing equal  opportunities for students from each of  the Soviet republics and making finan cial need  a  criteria  for  receiving  a  scholarship. It will not be a giveaway  program for those who can afford other  al terna ti ves.  This is a well-crafted piece of legisla tion. I commend Senator MITCHELL for  his leadership on this matter. I hope to  see this act signed into law as one key  mechanism  for  promoting  economic  and  political  reform  in  the  Soviet  Union. We must seize this moment of  history.  ",1991
683,577,12,Mr.  PELL.," Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased to cosponsor legislation estab lishing a Soviet graduate scholarship  program that is being introduced today  by the distinguished majority leader.  As  a  long-time advocate of  inter national exchanges, I strongly support  the creation of a program that would  bring Soviet students  to  the United  States to gain experience in areas such  as business,  law, and public adminis tration. As we have seen with other  successful exchange programs, a  regi men of U.S. study and hands-on train ing in these fields can help create a  cadre of individuals capable of intro ducing  and  implementing  economic  and political reform at home. Indeed,  the administration has already  initi ated some cooperative programs with  the Soviet Union, but these exchanges  have not gone far enough.  During his visit to the United States,  Boris Yeltsin, the newly elected presi dent of the Russian republic, reminded  us that Russia, and indeed the entire  Soviet Union, desperately lacks man agers skilled in the ways of a market  economy. He also suggested that for re form  to  succeed,  the  individuals  charged with implementing any democ ratization  initiatives  or market-ori ented measures, will  need  technical  training and a greater understanding of  the workings of a free market and of a  democratic political system. Mr. Presi dent,  I  believe  that  this  legislation  takes an important step toward meet ing what President Yeltsin and others  have identified as a genuine need.  The United States has a stake in the  success of Soviet reform. In an age of  increased international economic com petition,  I  believe  that  the United  States should have the foresight to re alize that study in United States insti tutions by Soviet students can enhance  trade relationships by providing profes sional and business contacts between  Soviets and Americans. It is in our in terest to offer our experience with de mocracy and the free market to Soviet  students.  In  so doing, we will build  links that will bear fruit as  the stu dents who are  trained  in  the United  States assume  leadership positions in  government and business.  ",1991
684,577,12,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased  to  join with my  colleagues  ",1991
685,603,12,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce a bill to reauthorize  the programs of the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration.  NOAA  performs many  important  services  for  the Nation. NOAA's Na tional Ocean Service manages the Na tion's ocean and coastal resources and  charts our skies and oceans. The Na tional Weather Service  forecasts our  weather  and  provides  hurricane  warnings. The National Marine Fish eries Service has the very difficult task  of managing and conserving  the Na tion's fisheries. The Office of Oceanic  and Atmospheric Research helps us un derstand our atmospheres, oceans, and  marine  resources. And  finally, Mr.  President the National Environmental  Satellite, Data, and Information Serv ice manages the Earth-observing sat ellite  systems  that  support weather  forecasting and provide us with land  remote-sensing capabilities.  In addition  to  reauthorizing  these  very important programs, this bill ad dresses  several  specific needs  that  I  would like to highlight.  This bill would allow NOAA to begin  modernizing  its oceanographic  fleet.  This  fleet  of 23  vessels,  comprising  about one-third of the total U.S. ocean ographic  fleet,  is nearing  its service  life. The average age of the vessels is  now over 25 years and much of  the  equipment on board has not kept pace  with modern  technology for such ac tivities as mapping the oceans or de tecting global change. Furthermore, 6  of the 23 vessels have been deactivated  due to aging.  The condition of the fleet seriously  limits NOAA's ability to carry out its  research and monitoring  responsibil ities. A 1990 report of an interagency  science  and  engineering  group  esti mated that NOAA programs need about  twice as much vessel time to carry out  their missions. The Administration is  completing a plan for revitalizing the  fleet. This bill would allow NOAA  to  begin this modernization effort.  Americans continue to be concerned  about waste disposal, sewage pollution,  toxic chemicals, and oilspills in marine  waters. A recent report by the National  Research Council calls for  increasing  the use of monitoring information for  marine  environmental management,  conducting comprehensive monitoring  of  regional and national  status and  trends, and  improving  the design of  monitoring programs.  The  bill  I  am  introducing  today  would  create  a  national monitoring  program for ocean and coastal waters  to assess current conditions as well as  detect  changes.  This  comprehensive  program would coordinate and enhance  existing efforts of Federal, State, and  local agencies, which currently spend  an estimated $133 million monitoring  the condition of the marine environ ment. NOAA has been particularly ac tive in this effort through its National  Status and Trends Monitoring Program  which collects information at 180 ma rine sites around the Nation.  Monitoring is particularly useful for  assessing the effectiveness of pollution  control  efforts. Massachusetts  resi dents, for example, are about to spend  in excess of $6 billion to clean up Bos ton Harbor. This is an unprecedented  cleanup effort and it is in the Nation's  interest  to determine what will  be  achieved in terms of water quality im provements for this large expenditure.  Finally, this bill authorizes NOAA to  research and develop dolphin-safe fish ing  technologies for harvesting  tuna.  The number of dolphins killed each  year by the foreign tuna fleet is still  unacceptably high. This  is a  serious  concern from both an environmental  and  foreign policy perspective.  It  is  clear that the best way to stop this un necessary slaughter is to develop new  fishing methods that are not dependent  on encircling dolphins.  The National Oceanic and Atmos pheric Administration provides many  valuable services to the Nation and I  am pleased to introduce this bill to re authorize  its many  important  pro grams. I ask unanimous consent that  the full  text of the bill be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 1405  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  the  SHORT TITLE  SECTION 1.

686,629,12,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to honor one of the most dedi cated public servants to ever represent  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  and one of the greatest individuals who  has served in Congress, Silvio Conte.  Sil Conte entered politics because he  wanted to make a difference. Well, Sil  made a big difference for the people of  the First Congressional District and  the United States whom he served for  32  special years. He was a  compas sionate defender of the common man  who never lost sight of the reason he  was elected. Too often, Congress gets  wrapped up in the atmosphere of Wash ington, assuming what happens inside  the beltway  is of the utmost impor tance. But Sil Conte, with his wit and  humor, always brought the issues back  into perspective.  Silvio Conte spent his  life helping  the poor and working class, protecting  the environment, and  trying  to give  each and every American a chance for  the American dream. Silvio saw what  was wrong and tried to correct it, saw  what was right and tried to preserve it;  regardless  of  the  politics  of  the  situtation. His enormous legacy stands  as a monument  to good government  and professional integrity.  Today, Senator KENNEDY and I are  introducing a bill to rename the Pitts field Federal Office Building the Silvio  0. Conte Federal Building. We  hope  this will serve as a small token of our  respect and affection for Sil and a tri b ute to his  tireless efforts to help his  fellow  citizens.  I  ask  that my  col leagues  join with us  to  thank Silvio  Conte for his service and for sharing  part of his special life with us.  ",1991
687,629,12,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of this bill to name the Fed eral Building in Pittsfield, MA, after  Silvio Conte. The people of Pittsfield  have  requested  this  tribute, and  it's  not hard to see why. Sil was a most behr  h  stituents  t  'Ough  t  e ~roprlations  process was 'the stuff of legend. It is  said that all Sil Conte had to -.do wa.s  wa:lk  into  the House Appropriations  Committee room, raise his little-finger,  and western Massachusetts llad a new  Federal project. If he had got .us any  more, we'd have had to call the state  .Conte-chusetts.  His wit and compassion were equally  legendaTy. Perhaps no Member of'Con gress wore his heart more clearly on  his sleeve than Sil, and what a warm  and beautiful heart  it was,  always  reaching out to those in need. Day in  and day out, year in and year out, for  over three decades of brilliant public  service  in  the House of Representa tives, Sil Conte was always there when  his constituents and his country need ed him, advancing America's real pri orities,  standing  firm against unfair  budget cuts, and other proposals that  would damage the goals we share. He  had a deep and abiding sense of com passion for  the elderly,  the sick,  the  poor, and all the others who need our  help the most. And he knew, perhaps  better than anyone in Congress, how to  get the job done with a touch of humor.  You could always count on Sil to make  his point with a prop or a poem that  left us laughing.  It is most appropriate that this Fed eral building, where Sil maintained his  district office since the day it opened,  and which owes its very existence  to  Sil 's efforts,  should be named after  him.

689,629,12,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce legislation that rec ognizes  the month of August 1991 as  Wisconsin Cheese Month.  Mr. President, Wisconsin is the dairy  capital of the United States. Over 75  percent of the milk produced in Wis consin is made into cheese. The major ity of cheese processed in Wisconsin is  exported. Therefore, Wisconsin is a via ble source of feeding Americans and  people around the world.  Cheese  and other Wisconsin dairy  products are vital to many low-income  programs, such as Women, Infants, and  Children [WIC], school lunch programs,  Temporary Emergency  Food Assist ance Program, and other welfare pro grams. It is important that the hard  working Wisconsin dairy farmers, pro ducers,  and processors be  recognized  for their contributions to this Nation.  This year will mark the 100th anni versary of the Wisconsin Cheese Mak ers Association. The Wisconsin cheese  makers association has led the way in  formulating dairy policy in Wisconsin  and across this Nation.

690,655,12,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, when  NAS Whidbey Island was slated for clo sure, the task of challenging Secretary  Cheney's decision was onerous. This  task would  require  the Washington  State delegation and the community of  Whidbey  Island  to work  together  to ward achieving the goal of saving NAS  Whidbey.  NAS Whidbey is one of America's fin est naval air stations. In addition to  the unique training conditions for A-6  pilots, the military personnel who are  stationed at NAS Whidbey  enjoy  a  quality  of  life  unmatched  by most  bases. More  important  to  the people  outside Washington State,  is  that it  will cost the Navy and the taxpayers  more dollars  to close N AS Whidbey  than it will to keep it operating.  The Washington  State  delegation  recognizes the value of NAS Whidbey,  and  I  am pleased  to  say, we have  worked to enlighten the committee on  NAS Whidbey's importance to our na tional defense.  Individual members of the Washing ton delegation disagree on many policy  issues, but they have a strong tradition  of working well on many localized is sues,  the most  recent  being NAS  Whidbey Island.  The Base Closure Commission makes  its final decision on NAS Whidbey on  Sunday. I commend both my colleagues  from Washington State, and the citi zens of Oak Harbor. Together, the citi zens and  the delegation have worked  diligently to provide the Base Closure  Commission with  the  information  to  make a balanced and fair decision.  When delegation members  testified  before the Commission, Senator ADAMS  reaffirmed that if NAS Whidbey closes,  the A-6,  and EA-6  community will  move  to NAS Lemoore. The crowded  airspace at NAS Lemoore will under mine A-6  and EA-6  training. Rep resentative AL SWIFT's district will be  most  affected  by  this  decision. He  thoughtfully outlined community im pact. Representative NORM DICKS  ap plied his military expertise to explain  why this closure would be detrimental  to America's national defense. Rep resentative  JOHN MILLER  accepted  a  base closure in his own district for the  cause of keeping NAS Whidbey open.  Representative RoD CHANDLER used his  experience as a pilot to highlight NAS  Whidbey's unique all weather training  and electronic jamming opportunities.  Finally, I asserted that the Navy will  end up spending more  to close NAS  Whidbey  than it could ever possibly  save. Together,  the delegation effec tively argued why NAS Whidbey should  remain open.  The Washington State delegation has  worked hard indeed, but at the core of  our efforts lies the dedication of the  Oak Harbor community. Never once did  they hesitate to provide us with a nec essary fact or number. They did an ex ceptional job in wading through infor mation to formulate a direct and per suasive testimony. The community of  Oak Harbor provided  the  impetus  to  make our coalition work. This united  communmity effort gave the Washing ton  State  delegation  unconditional  support  and  strength  in  explaining  NAS Whidbey's unique qualities. I com mend  their dedication and offer my  thanks for their invaluable service.  I  am hopeful  and optimistic  that  NAS Whidbey will remain open, but,  whatever  the  outcome,  I will walk  away  from  this  experience  satisfied  that the Washington State delegation  and the Oak Harbor community did ev erything in their power  to save NAS  Whidbey Island.

692,668,12,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker,  for  over 50 years, Dean Lesher has been publish ing newspapers  in California. He has devel oped a veritable news empire, publishing five  dailies and five weeklies in my county, Contra  Costa,  as well  as  15  other  publications  throughout northern California. He still pub lishes his  first California paper,  the Merced  Sun-Star in Merced County, which he bought  in 1941.  Mr. Lesher's success as a publisher, how ever, is only rivaled by his contributions to the  development of one  of California's  fastest  growing counties. He  is clearly one of  the  most generous members of our community,  supporting a wide range of causes and lend ing his voice to the critical issues of the day.  While it would be impossible to list all of his  invaluable contributions, several  in particular  stand out. Mr. Lesher is a major supporter of  the  regional  center  for  the arts  in Walnut  Creek. He helped open the Battered Women's  Alternatives  transitional  housing  shelter  in  Concord. He supported the expansion of Oak land's Children's Hospital, and he has contrib uted  to  the  restoration of Yosemite National  Park. Every year, Mr. Lesher contributes tens  of  thousands of dollars  for scholarships  to  graduates of community colleges so they can  continue their higher education.  On his 50th anniversary of newspaper pub lishing in California,  I salute Dean Lesher for  his success and his many valued contributions  to Contra Costa County. I would like to share  with my colleagues Mr. Lesher's account of  his early publishing days and the events that  led him to become a major supporter of our  community.  [The article follows:]  LOOKING BACK ON A HALF CENTURY OF  NEWSPAPER PUBLISHING  (By Dean Lesher)  I have now completed 50 years in the news paper publishing business in California. My  first publication in the state was the daily  Merced Sun-Star, a paper we still own.  When I was graduated from Harvard Law  School, I  intended  to practice  law for  the  rest of my life. I got into the newspaper busi ness through a peculiar set of circumstances.  A very dear friend of mine, a  lawyer who  was 25 years older than I, developed an ulcer ated colon, spent 18 months in the hospital,  lost his practice, never regained it and died  of a broken heart. That made a  tremendous  impression on me. It led to a decision to get  into some business that would support my  family in the event my health failed.  The business that I had become somewhat  familiar with was the newspaper business. I  had provided legal representation for several  papers. I also represented the only newspaper  broker between Chicago  and  the Pacific  Coast, and prepared a number of contracts  June 27, 1991  for the purchase and sale of daily and weekly  newspapers.  Since I was enjoying the practice of law in  Kansas City, Mo.,  I decided to buy a daily  newspaper in nearby Nebraska. The problem  was that 11 months after this purchase, the  preliminary census showed the area in ques tion had lost a substantial amount of popu lation during the last 10 years. It was quite  obvious that owning a newspaper there was a  mistake. So  I  sold  it and began  to  look  around for a better growth area in which to  own a publication.  BEGINNINGS IN CALIFORNIA  I came to California and found six publica tions in this state available for purchase. I  was  thoroughly confused. I finally went to  my friend John Martin, who handled all of  the national  advertising  for Montgomery  Ward. I met him in Chicago and presented  my problem, giving the names and details of  the publications in six areas of California.  The second area I mentioned was Merced,  and he immediately said, ""Stop right there.  That's the place I would go. Let me tell you  about Merced and our store there."" After lis tening to his sales pitch on Merced, I gave  him the other four locations. He still stayed  with his conclusion  that the Merced Sun Star was the paper to buy.  I had a cashier's check and a proposed con tract with  the seller's name  left blank.  I  filled both out on a portable typewriter in  Chicago and mailed it to Arthur Stypes, a  newspaper broker in San Francisco.  The net result was that in March 1941, we  purchased  the daily Merced Sun-Star. We  still own the Sun-Star, and all of the daily  papers in Merced and Madera counties in the  San Joaquin Valley.  There were two distinct turning points in  my newspaper career. The first of them ar rived  in 1942,  shortly after Pearl Harbor.  This one was created by  the allocation of  newsprint based upon the purchases of news print the publication had made during the  prior three years.  The Sun-Star circulation was only 3,100,  and we had increased it to more than 5,000  within a year. The net result was that our al location of newsprint gave us only 40 percent  of what we needed to satisfy our increased  circulation.  The newsprint allocated to us cost us $36 a  ton but was only 40 percent of the newsprint  we needed. The remaining 60 percent cost us  $200 a ton on the black market. It was quite  obvious that before long, I would run out of  money.  A CALL TO THE BANKER  I did run out of money in six months and  called on my banker. I explained that I had  run out of money and couldn't go on. His  reply was that I had kept him advised as to  what was happening, and he wanted 30 min utes to think it over.  When I returned in 30 minutes, he handed  me a sealed envelope, telling me not to open  it until I went home. I drove the 14 blocks to  my home outside the city limits with a fear  that he had  turned me down or he would  have shown me the letter immediately.  When I arrived home, a cashier's check for  $15,000 dropped out of the envelope, together  with a letter that I will never forget as long  as I live. The opening sentence said, ""When  you asked for $10,000, I knew you could use  more, so here is a check for $15,000. You are  too valuable a person for the community to  lose, and we have decided  to keep you  in  business regardless of the cost.""  VOW TO REPAY FAVOR  At that point, I stopped reading and broke  down in tears. The banker knew that I would  _          r    11  -I  -'-'  1:      ",1991
693,681,12,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker, as chairman of  the congressional arts caucus, it was my great  pleasure  today  to participate  in  the opening  ceremonies of  ""An Artistic Discovery""-the  congressional high school art competition and  exhibition. This year, 249 congressional dis tricts participated  in  the competition. These  winning works will hang in the Cannon corridor  to the Capitol until May of next year.  Over  the past decade, nearly 2,500  local  contests have been conducted which have in volved more  than 375,000 high school stu dents.  With  140  students  and  their  families  in  Washington to celebrate the opening-as well  as many participating Members, staff, Speaker  THOMAS S. FOLEY, Minority Leader ROBERT H.  MICHEL and other special guests-this year's  festivities were truly a celebration.  I submit my opening comments in honor of  the event to be printed in the RECORD.  STATEMENT OF RON. TED WEISS  It is wonderful to stand before you today  to pay honor to the winners of ""An Artistic  Discovery""-the  tenth annual high  school  art competition. These young artists epito mize the excellence in education and in the  arts which America can  take  such great  pride in.  For what has now been a decade, Members  of Congress have sponsored high school art  competitions in their districts, bringing to gether talented young people, arts educators,  families and local business and community  leaders. Each year, we  in  the Capitol are  treated  to  a  panorama  of  outstanding  artworks. The thousands of visitors who view  these works are simply dumbstruck that the  art was created by high  school  students.  Each of us are overwhelmed not only by the  talent contained in the works, but by the vi sion and humanity which they express.  Congress can truly be proud of this biparti san effort  to recognize and encourage  the  arts and education throughout the country.  But, we must do more. We must ensure that  every student in every school has the oppor tunity to learn and to grow from arts pro grams. For  these are  the programs which  teach our  students  self-expression,  under standing, discipline, and creativity.  There are a  countless number of people  who have worked hard to make ""An Artistic  Discovery"" such a success. certainly the 249  Members of Congress and  their staffs who  participated this year. We are also grateful  to George White, the Architect of the Capitol  and his staff in facilitating this professional  exhibit. Also, we would  like  to  recognize  General Motors for providing both resources  and guidance for the past eight years. We are  also honored to have two of America's most  popular and talented young actors, Elisabeth  Shue and William Baldwin, who have gra ciously come to Washington to help open the  exhibit.  Finally, and most importantly, we wish to  thank  the students,  the artists. It is  they  who we celebrate, they who we respect, and  they who have contributed to the vitality of  our Nation's culture.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  FEDERAL  EARTHQUAKE  INSUR ANCE AS A MECHANISM FOR IN CREASING  EARTHQUAKE  PRE PAREDNESS  THROUGHOUT  THE  NATION  HON. GEORGE E. BROWN, JR.  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 27, 1991  ",1991
694,681,12,Mr. BROWN.," Mr. Speaker, in October 1989  the United States got a strong reminder of the  ever-present  threat  of major  urban  earth quakes, when  the Lorna Prieta earthquake  caused 62 deaths, severe social and eco nomic disruption, and billions of dollars  in  damage  to  the San Francisco Bay  region.  Forty States, in addition to California, are sus ceptible  to damaging earthquakes. Some of  these earthquakes will unquestionably dwarf  the Lorna Prieta quake  in  terms of size and  extent of destruction. The question is this: will  we be prepared?  Over the past three decades I have spoken  on  this  floor dozens of  times  in support of  Federal programs to increase earthquake pre paredness not just in California, but through out  the Nation.  Fortunately,  severe  earth quakes in the United States are an 'infrequent  occurrence, but  this also means  that we  in  Congress tend to be overly complacent about  the threat that earthquakes pose both to our  citizens and to our economy.  For this reason,  I am very pleased that my  colleagues AL SWIFT, whose State of Wash ington has recently been identified as a poten tial site of catastrophic earthquakes, today in troduced a bill  that would create a Federal  earthquake  insurance  program.  Although  I  have some substantive disagreement with the  methods proposed  in this  legislation,  I am  in  support of the overall goal of the bill, which is  to boost earthquake preparedness on a na tionwide basis. For this reason, I am an origi nal cosponsor of Mr. SWIFT's legislation. Con gress needs to pursue the issue of earthquake  insurance energetically and comprehensively  before  the  next  catastrophic  earthquake  strikes.  During  the  last Congress, both Mr. SWIFT  and I introduced Federal earthquake insurance  legislation. Our approaches were quite dif ferent, and represented, on the one hand, our  personal history of involvement with this issue,  and on the other, our shared concern over the  potentially disastrous consequences of major  urban earthquakes.  Mr. SWIFT's bill  focused on  the  importance  of creating the largest possible pool of home owner participants  in  the  insurance program,  in order to create the largest possible Federal  fund to pay out claims, and to offer the broad est possible financial protection  for American  homowners as well as the insurance industry.  My own approach, which reflects my  long time involvement with the National Earthquake  Hazards Reduction Program, was predicated  on the need for communities to adopt and en force building codes that would reduce earth quake damage and  consequent social and  economic  disruption  resulting  from  earth quakes.  I proposed that insurance availability  be contingent upon adoption of these earth quake hazard mitigation measures;  thus  the  17037  insurance program was in fact subservient to  the mitigation program.  The bill  that Mr. SWIFT  introduced  today  maintains the approach that he supported last  year. My decision to cosponsor this legislation  reflects my desire to see meaningful Congres sional scrutiny of this issue, and to remind my  colleagues about  the overall  importance of  earthquake preparedness. Last year, by intro ducing two distinct bills, we highlighted the dif ferent ways  in which  the problem of earth quake insurance and earthquake hazard miti gation could be approached. This year, by in troducing a single bill, we hope to more effi ciently move the legislation through Congress,  with  the clear expectation on my part that a  proper balance between insurance sales and  earthquake mitigation will emerge as  the bill  matures.  Thus, Mr. SWIFT's bill  represents a com promise to the extent that we have settled on  a single legislative vehicl~ne that confronts  the  fundamental  issue of urban earthquakes  and  their disastrous consequences.  It does  not, however,  represent a  final  substantive  compromise, because it is still, in its essence,  a bill that focuses on selling insurance to the  broadcast possible pool of homeowners. All  the same,  the overriding motivation here-to  shield Americans from the disaster of a cata strophic urban earthquake-is shared equally  by Mr. SWIFT and me.  Let me,  for  the  record, briefly outline my  concerns about the  legislation that has been  introduced.  It does contain a mitigation com ponent, and this is a step in the right direction,  and it suggests several avenues for meaning ful  compromise. The bill as  introduced  re quires States  to adopt mitigation programs,  but it does not yet include practical, effective  measures for implementation and enforcement  of  these  programs. Without  enforcement,  homeowners have no incentive to mitigate, es pecially if they know that their property is cov ered by Federal insurance. This has the effect  of encouraging  inadequate construction prac tices,  thus  increasing  Federal  liability  for  losses,  and missing  the opportunity  to  in crease earthquake preparedness. We know,  from our experience with the earthquakes that  have struck California over the past two dec ades, that aggressive implementation and en forcement  of  earthquake  hazard mitigation  measures saves  lives and money. We must  apply this principle to other earthquake-prone  areas of the Nation.  A second concern is that the proposed miti gation program would operate at a statewide  level,  whereas  building  codes  and  ordi nances-the main source of mitigation-are  locally adopted and enforced  in most cases.  Thus,  the bill would  require a whole new  State-based structure  for building code en forcement, whereas an adequate and reason ably efficient structure already exists at  the  community  level  throughout much of the Na tion.  Third,  the mitigation provisions  in  the new  legislation would  apply  only  to  individual  homes. The experience of  the Lorna Prieta  earthquake, however, shows us  that a great  proportion  of  the  disruption  resulting  from  urban earthquakes  is caused by damage  to  commercial structures, public facilities such as  hospitals, schools, and  fire stations, and  life",1991

699,733,12,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, I had  no objection to the amendment of the  distinguished Senator from Ohio, but I  though I might take about 3 or 4 min utes  to discuss  the overall authoriza tions included in this bill before us for  law enforcement in the United States.  First, because some of the language  in the bill which is pending says we are  going  to have new FBI agents, new  DEA agents, and new district  judges,  new U.S. attorneys, I hope no one real ly takes any of that very seriously be cause, actually, we do not need to pro vide for any more.  The truth is we are not paying now  for what are already authorized. As a  matter of fact, some may be interested  in knowing if we think we are provid ing new FBI agents in this bill, the ap propriations bill which came out of the  House  reduced  the  FBI  number  of  agents by 500, that is, 500 less than the  President asked for, reduced the num ber of new U.S. attorneys to zero, no  new ones, and the President asked for  about 65.  So I thought it would be good to re mind  those who are concerned about  crime and fighting crime that probably  none of the provisions in this bill au thorizing more law enforcement fight ers-FBI, DEA, U.S. attorneys-will be  a  reality. They have made  for good  rhetoric but clearly we do not have the  money to pay for any of them.  We are providing less this year than  the President asked  for.  It does not  seem we will have any money next  year; we will have less, and the year  after perhaps even less. So we do not  need any more authorization. What we  need is more priority, that is, restrain  other programs so we can pay for what  we have already authorized.  I  thank  the Chair, and I yield  floor.  ",1991

703,733,12,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, in ac cordance with my prior statement  I  now will seek consent as outlined ear lier  in my colloquy with  the distin guished Republican  leader and other  Senators.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a vote on the cloture motion  that I now send to the desk occur at  2:25 p.m.  today;  that if cloture is  in voked, the bill be completed under the  provisions of rule XXII; that if cloture  is not invoked Senator DOLE be recog nized, without  intervening action or  debate,  to offer an amendment on be half of himself, Senator METZENBAUM,  and others; that the only amendment  to the amendment in order be one to be  offered by Senator MITCHELL  relative  to the State preemption provision on  which there be 1 hour for debate, equal ly divided and controlled between Sen ators MITCHELL  and DOLE;  following  the conclusion or yielding back of time  there be a vote on the Mitchell amend ment followed immediately without in tervening action or debate by a vote on  the Dole-Metzenbaum amendment, as  amended,  if  amended;  and  that  no  amendments to the language proposed  to be stricken or motions to recommit  be in order prior to the disposition of  the Dole-Metzenbaum amendment, as  amended, if amended; and that no fur ther amendments on the topic of fire arms be  in order  to  this bill unless  agreed to by the managers.  ",1991
704,733,12,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, reserving  the right to object, and I shall not ob ject, I think the Senator from Alaska  wishes to be heard on a reservation be cause he has discovered some provi sions that were not called to our atten tion earlier. I think he is now able to  resolve concerns about four out of the  five. I would rather he speak to the res ervation. So  I  yield  to  the Senator  from Alaska.  ",1991
705,733,12,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, reserv ing the right to object, and I do not  think I shall object, I have not seen a  copy of this substitute  that  is men tioned. Will we be able to see that be fore this goes into effect? I would like  to see it. Is it in draft form now?  ",1991
706,733,12,Mr. DOLE.," If I may respond to  the  Senator from Alaska, I have my staff,  along with attorneys, going over  the  draft. The answer is, yes,  the Senator  can see it forthwith.  ",1991
707,733,12,Mr. STEVENS.," I think we should be  able to see that before we agree.  Second,  in that regard,  I have been  trying to pin down the meaning of the  prov1s1on that is section 1239 on page  150, dealing with the receipt of firearms  by a nonresident. I am informed that  was in the President's bill. I thank the  majority staff for giving us that infor mation. I am also informed that its in tent  is  to cover  those  legal  resident  aliens who are associated with the em bassies of foreign countries.  I do not  find any such  limitation, and it was  called to my attention as being a provi sion that might have a serious impact  upon foreign visitors who come  to a  State such as mine to hunt and to buy  guns. They usually end up by giving  them to their guides or leaving them in  this country. This provision, as I un derstand it, would bar anybody from  even delivering to that person a gun for  such a time period.  We are trying to find an interpreta tion of that. I would like to ask if we  can exclude from the restrictions that  are  in  the majority  leader's unani mous-consent  agreement  an  amend ment  to deal with  that section,  in  which we would hope to add an inter pretive provision to make sure it does  not restrict legal tourists in the coun try, for the specific purpose of hunting,  from acquiring a firearm for that pur pose.  It  is my understanding that it  deals with more than just handguns; it  deals with firearms per se.  I  am  informed  that  this provision  does include long guns. This will cover  rifles and shotguns. The other provi sions that we were considering do not.  If that is correct, it is a provision that  is  in a  different category  than  the  handgun  provision we were  dealing  with last night. That amendment dealt  only with handgun provisions. I would  like  to  clarify  that  section  if  this  agreement is entered into.  ",1991
708,733,12,Mr. MITCHELL.," Well, Mr. President,  if I might respond, I am not familiar  with the provision to which  the Sen ator just referred. I first learned of it a  few moments ago and was advised it  was in the President's bill, which was  included in the bill presented here. The  Senator makes a persuasive case and,  on the face of it, without knowing of  any reason to the contrary, I would be  persuaded to be supportive of that ef fort.  The problem with making an excep tion to the agreement is that there are  a number of Senators on our side who  have expressed an interest in offering  amendments, but would agree to per mit the agreement to go forward only  on the condition that there would not  be any amendments. So  if you have  one, I would feel compelled to return to  them, and they may well want amend ments, which may, in effect, defeat the  purpose of this.  I wonder if the Senator would permit  us  to proceed with the understanding  that we will work with the managers  and others and seek  to get that cor rected. I am unable to make a commit",1991
709,759,12,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President,  I would  like  to ask a question of the distin guished majority  leader,  one of  the  sponsors of  the Brady Handgun Vio lence Prevention Act,  title XXVII of  the Violent Crime Control Act (S. 1241).  The legislation directs the Attorney  General  to establish a grant program  to be used ""for the creation of a com puterized criminal history record sys tem or improvement of an existing sys tem,"" and ""to defray the cost to State  and local law enforcement agencies in  conducting background checks on pro spective handgun purchases.""  Michigan has, at great expense, pur chased an automated fingerprint iden tification system [AFIS]. As a result,  Michigan's  computerized  criminal  records  included  fingerprints. Michi gan's AFIS has enabled State and local  law enforcement to solve over 900 cases  they could not have otherwise solved.  In one such case, Michigan police offi cers were able to identify and convict a  man who  abducted and sexually as saulted a 4-year-old girl from a latent  fingerprint on her clothing. This man  is now behind bars.  My  question  to my  colleague  is  whether  the operation and  improve ment of an AFIS would be an eligible  expense under this grant program.  ",1991

719,772,12,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President, it re cently was my great privilege to par ticipate in the 27th Annual All-Amer ican Collegiate Golf Foundation event.  I want to pay tribute to the All-Amer ican Collegiate Golf Hall of Fame in ductees  and  the All-American  team  who gave so generously of their time.  Also, I especially would like to recog nize the foundation's efforts to expand  minority  participation  in  collegiate  golf.  On Tuesday of this week, a  special  ceremony was held at the city hall of  New York which put forth the goals of  the  foundation's minority  golf  pro gram. This program is making consid erable progress in providing opportuni ties for minorities to become involved  in collegiate golf.  Mr. President,  I was especially  im pressed by the efforts made by colle giate golfers. Many people are unaware  of the amount of time and effort colle giate golfers must invest in this sport.  When these young men and women par ticipate in a tournament, they usually  play one practice round, which  is 18  holes, before the actual tournament be gins.  After the 18-hole practice round, the  tournaments  usually  consist  of  54  holes. This means that it usually re quires a minimum of 3 days, plus travel  time, for these golfers to participate in  each tournament. Moreover, most col legiate golfers play approximately 10  tournaments per year.  Considering  this  time commitment  and the corresponding financial obligations necessary to participate in colle giate golf, it is especially difficult for  minorities to become involved in colle giate golf programs. They need finan cial support, and  the Collegiate Golf  Foundation's minority program is a big  step in the right direction.  Mr. President,  I also would like to  pay tribute  to the organizers of this  program: William  Fugazy,  general  chairman; Allen Paulson, man of the  year  in business; Madeleine Paulson,  woman  of  the  year;  Vincent  Sombrotto, man of the year in labor;  and to the many others who have par ticipated in this program. I also would  like  to pay special  tribute  to Rose marie Taglione, who does an outstand ing  job as  the  scholarship adminis trator of the foundation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a message published in the  event's program from foundation chair man William Fugazy be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  the mes sage was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL CHAIRMAN  Tonight marks the 27th Anniversary of the  All-American Collegiate Golf  Foundation  Awards Dinner. What began as an ambitious  dream in 1964 by Arnold Palmer and myself,  has grown into a phenomenal success story.  Over the last two decades, the popularity  of this great lifetime sport has experienced  tremendous growth. During  this  time, we  have watched an illustrious parade of golfers  develop from emerging hopefuls into legend ary superstars.  As a result of the growing interest in the  sport and the generous support toward the  Foundation, our extensive scholarship pro gram has expanded beyond all expectations.  Although the highlight of the evening is to  honor  the  top collegiate golfers and other  prominent figures, the main focus is to pro vide funding for academically deserving stu dents  through our scholarship program. In  addition  to  the hundreds of young people  who  have  received  scholarships  over  the  years,  the Foundation also contributes  to  youth oriented charities,  hospitals,  relief  services and medical centers.  Plans are now under way for the launching  of the All-American Summer Golf Clinic to  introduce and encourage minority youth's  participation in golf.  The success of the Foundation would not  be possible without  the support of people  such as those we are honoring tonight: Allen  & Madeleine Paulson, Vincent R. Sombrotto,  and our Hall of Famers: Patty Berg and Dave  Stockton.  Together with Tournament Co-Chairman,  Peter Bonanni,  and Executive Committee  Chairman Tom Clark, I want to thank all of  you who have been so supportive and dedi cated  to  the All-American Collegiate Golf  Foundation. Your  love and generosity  to ward the Foundation will insure our contin ued success today and in the future.  With Warmest Regards,  WILLIAM DENIS FUGAZY.  CHIN A'S MISRULE IN TIBET  ",1991
720,772,12,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, as the Con gress examines MFN trading status for  the People's Republic of China, we are  faced with many issues and many ex perts. I would like to draw the atten tion of my colleagues to the issue of  China's misrule of Tibet and  to  the  views of Mr. Lodi Gyari, president of  the International Campaign for Tibet  and special envoy of the Dalai Lama.  I have been, for many years, a friend  of the Dalai Lama. He is a remarkable  man-an advocate  for peace  in con frontation against an often violent re gime. I have also been, for too long a  time without resolution, a supporter of  Tibet in its struggle for freedom and  democracy.  The Chinese have been persistent in  their disinformation campaign regard ing the situation in Tibet as well as  China's historic claims  to Tibet,  the  cruelties of feudal rule under the Dalai  Lamas, and  the ""peaceful liberation""  of Tibet by the Red army.  On May 25, China declared a day of  celebration  in Lhasa and unveiled a  monument,  as  high  as  the United  States Capitol dome, to commemorate  the 40th anniversary of their rule  in  Tibet. What transpired in Lhasa that  day was not the cheerful massing of  the Tibetan populace  chanting  pro motherland  slogans,  but  rather  an  around the clock curfew and a perva sive military buildup intended to  in timidate pro-independence demonstra tions. And because Western visitors al ready in Lhasa were restricted to their  hotels,  the  foreign press banned, and  invited Western dignitaries boycotted  this so-called celebration,  reports on  what happened on May 25 are limited  to the smuggled-out accounts of a few  daring Tibetans and the disinformation  of the Chinese press.  I am gravely concerned about the sit uation in Tibet. And as long as the Chi nese pursue a policy of deceit and op pressive rule in Tibet, and are unwill ing to negotiate an arrangement with  the Tibetan government-in-exile  that  would save  that nation from extinc tion, I find it difficult to support the  unconditional extension of nondiscrim inatory trade relations with China.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to read and consider Mr. Lodi Gyari's  article ""Behind the Chinese Curtain""  that appeared  in  the June 15 Provi dence Journal. Mr. Gyari is not a China  scholar or think-tank sinologist. Rath er, he was an eyewitness to China's in vasion and occupation of Tibet and a  survivor of the 1959 flight of some 80,000  Tibetans  to  refuge  in India. His  two  young brothers died in his arms in the  snowy passes of  the Himalayas. He  spent  his  teenage  years  aiding  the  Dalai Lama in the resettlement of his  fellow exiles, and has served as a cabi net member of  the Tibetan govern ment-in-exile. He is the kind of expert  to whom we should listen during these  days of deliberation, and I ask unani mous consent that Mr. Gyari's article  be printed at this point in the RECORD.  ",1991
721,863,12,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent that the Commit tee on Labor and Human Resources be  authorized to meet during the session  of the Senate on Friday, June 28, 1991,  at 9:30a.m., for a hearing on ""Poultry  Safety: Consumers at Risk.""  ",1991

723,863,12,Mr. KERREY.," Mr. President, on Sun day, June 30, Dr. Charles E. Andrews  will retire as the fifth chancellor of the  University of Nebraska Medical Center  [UNMC].  Characteristically,  he  de clined an offer by the board of regents  for a retirement dinner; he didn't have  a prepared speech for the final board of  regents meeting.  I have known Charlie Andrews  for  some 8 years now. He is an inspiration  and he is my friend.  In 1983, we lured him away from West  Virginia University Medical Center. He  brought with him heart, soul, vision,  wit, and an enduring  twinkle  in his  eyes. He showed us foresight, convic tion and a courage to stand by his con victions.  UNMC is today in large part of reflec tion of his expertise, commitment and  boundless energy.  He was instrumental in establishing  the Organ and Bone Marrow Trans plant Program at the Medical Center.  Today  the  liver  transplant and bone  marrow  transplant  programs  are  among the most active in the country.  During his 8 years at UNMC, he has  placed a renewed emphasis on research,  especially cancer research. This has led  to major advances at the Eppley Insti tute for Research in Cancer and Allied  Diseases, which has been designated as  1 of 15 laboratory cancer research cen ters in the United States by  the Na tional Cancer Institute. It is the only  such  facility  located  in Nebraska or  the six adjacent States.  Under his direction, UNMC  opened  the University Geriatric Center in 1989,  a major step forward  in meeting  the  needs of an aging population. UNMC  hopes  this center will eventually be come the first geriatric hospital in the  country.  His contributions have not, however,  been  limited  to Omaha. Charlie An drews provided the impetus for the in novative use of communications tech nology to address health care needs in  rural Nebraska. Today, we teach nurs ing skills  through distance  learning  programs and we provide information,  consultation and support to physicians  and health care professionals in rural  communities through his efforts. The  Rural Health Education Network and  the Rural Health Opportunities Pro gram have put the State on the cutting  edge of education and patient care in  less populated areas.  The UNMC College of Nursing experi enced growth under his stewardship as  nursing programs  for Scottsbluff and  Kearney were  added  to  the existing  programs  in Omaha and Lincoln. A  doctoral program was  added  to  the  nursing  curriculum  in  1990  and  the  Niedfelt Nursing Research Center was  opened in Omaha.  In 1988, he took the lead in making  UNMC one of the first Omaha employ ers to establish a smoke and tobacco  free work environment. Under his lead ership, UNMC  became  the  first  em ployer to affiliate with a health main tenance organization. He  also  insti tuted a general education diploma for  UNMC employees.  Under his direction, UNMC has been  active  in establishing  joint programs  with other Omaha area hospitals, thus  avoiding costly duplication of services.  When Charlie Andrews announced his  retirement  last January,  the Omaha  World Herald ran an editorial which  highlighted  some  of his accomplish ments. I ask that a copy of that edi torial be included in the RECORD.  I, of course, wish  that Charlie An drews had chosen not to retire, that he  would continue to move UNMC ahead.  But, I understand his decision. I and all  Nebraska will miss his  leadership at  UNMC but I expect to continue to ben efit from his counsel and recommenda tions.  The editorial follows:  DR. ANDREWS A STRONG LEADER  Dr. Charles E. Andrews has been a strong  leader and a good manager as chancellor of  the University of Nebraska Medical Center.  He set high goals  for  the medical center,  then worked hard to achieve them.  Dr. Andrews will  leave his post June 30  after seven years. He will  leave behind a  record of excellence in recruiting and retain ing top-level doctors, researchers and teach ers. Under his direction, the medical center  excelled in research and service to the pub lic.  The medical center's work in some fields,  including research on liver diseases and can cer, came to be known internationally. The  university  is  among  the  few  institutions  anywhere  in  the world to specialize in the  use of monoclonal antibodies-synthetic sub stances-to treat pancreatic cancer.  Dr. Andrews is also entitled to credit for  the success of UNMC's transplant programs,  including  the  liver,  solid organ and bone  marrow programs. The medical center has  attracted some of the transplantation field's  top people to its staff.  He has also been the guiding force in the  rural health education network. He has en couraged the recruiting of medical students  who might be likely to return to rural areas  to practice. And he has expanded the medical  center's reach across Nebraska, creating the  Rural Health Opportunities  Program  at  Chadron State College and Wayne State Col lege.  Peers call Dr. Andrews a man of vision who  can be a  fierce  fighter  for  improvements.  ""He is willing to take chances,"" said Dr. Mi chael Sorrell, department chairman for in ternal medicine. ""He has vision and cour age.""  Dr. Andrews was a sensible manager. His  .formula for success: Obtain the best facili ties you can, recruit top faculty members  and researchers and then let them go about  their work.  In a recent interview, he said, ""I think the  medical center is well on its way to becom ing a major Midwest health care, education  and research center."" As the medical center  continues toward that goal, a  large part of  the credit goes to Dr. Charles E. Andrews.   IRAQ's NEW THREAT TO WORLD  PEACE   Mr. McCAIN. Mr.  President,  the  events that have taken place in Iraq  today have proved that Iraq and Sad dam Hussein are still a major threat to  world peace. We must be careful about  rushing into calls for military action,  in Iraq or any part of the world. We  must wait to learn the facts, and we  must wait for President Bush to decide  on a course of action and provide the  leadership  in  this crisis  that he has  provided so consistently since coming  to office. But, we are clearly in a crisis  and we must clearly take suitable ac tion.  The  problem  is  Iraq's weapons of  mass destruction. We have  liberated  Kuwait, we  have  destroyed Saddam  Hussein's military dominance of  the  gulf region, and we have ended his abil ity  to attack other nations success fully with conventional weapons. It is  clear, however, that we underestimated  Iraq's dedication to acquiring nuclear  weapons, and there are growing indica tions  that  Iraq may  also  possess  a  much larger capability to deliver other  weapons of mass destruction than we  had previously hoped.  THE THREAT OF IRAQI NUCLEAR WEAPONS  In the case of nuclear weapons,  the  many experts who denied that Iraq was  near  the point  that it could build a  bomb, and who attacked this reason for  military action in the gulf, have been  proved conclusively wrong. Iraq admit ted after the ceasefire that it had more  than the 48 pounds of weapons grade  uranium that most experts outside of  the U.S. Government had dreamed of  before the war. Where many such ex perts  thought  Iraq might  not have  enough material for a bomb, it became  apparent  that  it clearly had enough  fissile material  for one weapon, and  might well have enough for two.

724,876,12,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President,  I  am pleased  that  the Senate  is now  ready to address the 1991 authorization  bill for the intelligence community. As  you know, a previous version of the bill  was not signed by the President. Sen ator BoREN,  the distinguished chair man of our committee, and I began the  process of working to resolve problems  associated with  the President's veto  when we met with General Scowcroft  and Judge Webster in January. Three  issues were discussed with the adminis tration, all relating to covert action.  The first issue, raised in the Presi dent's message of disapproval last year,  pertained  to  language added by  the  House of Representatives in conference  to the effect that any request to a for eign government or private citizen to  conduct a covert action on behalf of  the United States was deemed to be a  covert action subject  to  the  restric tions and requirements of the bill. The  President believed  this provision was  drafted vaguely, and would adversely  interfere with normal diplomatic ex changes. We have made changes to ad dress these concerns.  Another  issue,  involving the defini tion of covert action and  traditional  Armed Forces activities, has been re solved with the Department of Defense.  The  remaining  issue,  involving  the  definition of ""timely"" notice of covert  actions, has been the most difficult to  resolve. The  law  requires  that  the  President notify Congress before he un dertakes a covert action program. If  circumstances make prior notification  impossible,  then  the President must  notify Congress ""in a timely fashion.""  The definition of ""timely"" was not  nailed down in 1980, when this provi sion was codified. We all are aware of  the unfortunate lack of timely notice  of certain covert action findings during  Iran-Contra. In fact, the Senate at one  point passed legislation requiring that  ""timely"" should be defined as meaning  ""48 hours,"" although this view did not  prevail  in conference with the House  last year.  Our committee and  this President  share a desire to make sure that Con gress be notified promptly of a covert  action finding-if the President cannot  notify Congress before he undertakes a  covert action program. However, get ting from here to there has been enor mously difficult. The President clearly  believes he should not be bound by a  specific time constraint, given his view  that  the Constitution  provides him  with certain flexibility as Commander  in Chief. On the other hand, Congress  has established an oversight authority  that has as a  fundamental underpin ning the requirement th.at we be kept  informed of many aspects of our intelligence activities, including covert ac tions.  Throughout our negotiations, I have  communicated a number of times with  the White House, as has the chairman.  As a result of these discussions, I be lieve that we should adopt the bill now,  and move it into conference with the  House. Certainly, this issue of defining  timely notice will be a major i tern to  be discussed with our House counter parts. For our part, I believe our report  language sets forth our understanding  of what ""timely"" notice means. By the  same  token, we clearly set forth  the  President's view of his constitutional  authority. In fact, our report concedes  that neither  the Congress  nor  the  President is able  to resolve  this con stitutional issue.  I share the concerns of a number of  persons within the administration, and  indeed  in Congress about  this  issue.  Foremost among them is the concern  that, as we codify procedures relating  to covert actions-which has not been  completely done before-our language  needs to be precise. This includes our  report  language where we  interpret  what we believe we have done. If our  definitional language, or our interpre tative language,  is not clear,  then in  the worst case  scenario,  the  special  counsel statute may come  into play.  We must not permit a special counsel  in the future latching on to loose lan guage  to  investigate endlessly or  to  prosecute  unfairly  those  who  get  caught up in political, rather than real,  offenses.  The President clearly believes that,  as Commander  in Chief, a President  possesses strong authority to conduct  operations-covert  and  otherwise without a rigid requirement to provide  notice within a particular  timeframe  to  another  branch  of Government,  namely Congress. While President Bush  has  indicated in correspondence with  both the Senate and House Intelligence  Committees that he will provide notice  ""within a  few days"" of instituting a  covert action program-assuming he  cannot provide notice in advance-he  has been careful to preserve his belief  that the Constitution does not man date this result.  On balance, I believe our report lan guage on ""timely"" notice is carefully  crafted  to meet our institutional de mands, and those of the President.  Mr. President,  I want  to  close by  commending Senator BOREN, chairman  of our committee, for working so dili gently to maintain the covert action  and other reform provisions in our 1991  bill. This session I began service as vice  chairman of the committee, and it has  been a pleasure to work with Senator  BOREN on this important measure. He  made a commitment to include reform  measures in this bill, and he has re sisted the expedient approach when the  going got tough to simply save those  reform  provisions  for  our  1992  bill.  Much of what is in this bill is a credit  to DAVID BOREN's persistence.  I urge the Senate to adopt this im portant measure.  ",1991

729,876,12,Mr.  BOREN.,"  Mr.  President,  the  amendment of the Senator from New  Hampshire is agreeable to the commit tee.

Indeed,  the  committee  has already written to the Secretary of  Defense requesting access  to such in formation and fully expects compliance  with its request.

739,967,12,Mr. MACHTLEY.," Mr. Speaker, today  I begin this special order with many of  my colleagues who may or may not  have  the opportunity  to be here be cause of the holiday schedule and com ing back. This special order is to once  again discuss the notch victim scenario  and try and explain the historical facts  that occurred, and explain the consen sus bill that has been filed here in the  House where there will be a press conference tomorrow to try and get more  of our colleagues to join.  The first question is obviously raised  by the issue of notch, and as I discuss  this, I am sure there are Members who  have had a great deal more experience,  who have listened to these arguments,  who have sat and heard the various ex planations made, who are saying, ""Not  again,  I  thought we  resolved  this  issue.""  Frankly, when I  first heard of the  notch,  I  thought perhaps  it was an  issue of fairness, which has been clear ly thought out, one which has been ar ticulated, and one which did not need a  resolution. However, as I began to re view the scenario, as I  looked at the  record, I looked at what had happened  and what had been intended, and it be came clear to me, at the urging of my  parents who are both notch victims,  that what happened is unintended, and  what has occurred is clear discrimina tion based on nothing more than fortu itous births.  The  first question one might ask,  how many people are really affected by  this notch inequity and the Social Se curity payment system? The estimate  is that some 7 million people were born  between the year 1917 and 1921. An ad ditional 5 million were born  in  the  years 1921 through 1926. There are some  who  try and characterize  the notch  years as a very distinctive category of  years between 1917 and 1921.  As the charts will show, it actually  extends  beyond  1921,  out  to  1926  through  the  transition  formulas.  In  1972 Congress increased the Social Se curity benefits by 20 percent to assure  the retirees in  the Nation that they  would have a standard of living which  was increasing with rising wages and  rising inflation.  0 1350  At the same time, Congress provided  for automatic future  increases based  upon changes in wages. This 1972 law in  effect had automatic changes for wages  and price adjustments. Automatic ad justments after 1972 were to become ef fective in 1975.  In the interim, Congress provided for  an 11 percent increase in 1974.  In 1975, the Social Security Advisory  Council warned that the formula could  become too generous in the next cen tury, and in fact some said that the re payment to those who were retiring in  the next century could in fact exceed  their replacement rate contribution.  It was also intended that the replace ment rate, which is a term of art which  is used when discussing Social Security  benefits, would approximate 42  to 45  percent.  In 1976, it became clear that it was  increasing at the rate which  then in  1977 was 54 percent.  In 1976, President Gerald Ford pro posed that the benefit formula be re vised to slow the increase in benefits  ",1991

742,980,12,Mr. SIMPSON.," Thank you Mr. Presi dent. Mr. President,  I  commend  the  Senator from New Mexico for trying to  make certain that the concept of reha bilitation really does mean something.  I think his motives are good. However,  I must also say, Mr. President, that my  dear friend and colleague, the Senator  from South Carolina, raised a number  of good points as has my able friend  from Utah, Senator HATCH.  This amendment simply allows  the  States a  little bit of discretion in de termining for themselves how to imple ment  education  programs.  Small  States such as mine, the State of Wyo ming,  simply do not have a  pot of  money they can reach into to imple ment these grand programs. The under lying amendment by the Senator from  New Mexico  indeed mandates compli ance.  In a sense we are obviously federaliz ing the way in which the States pro vide their educational services to pris oners. We only promise to help them fi nancially. This is only an authoriza tion in  this bill. We  really have not  spent a dime a.nd do not know if we  will, even  though I  think  indeed we  should with regard to the literacy pro gram.  At  the same  time we are directing  the States not only  to spend money  they may not have, we are telling them  tem that if they do not dive into that pot of  money that we will take away some of  the Federal assistance we may be pro viding to them already, which is a crit ical, I think, defect.  Why do we in a sense then punish po licemen or law enforcement generally  and everyone else in the State justice  systems in order to force  them to do  something they simply may not be able  to afford.  So, Mr. President, I do not think that  is right. I urge my colleagues to sup port this second-degree amendment of fered by the Senator from South Caro lina. We should be leading by setting  an example at the Federal  level and  not by the use of a club. I do indeed be lieve I understand fully what the Sen ator from New Mexico  is doing, and  more importantly, after practicing law  for 18 years and dealing many  times  with the public, and a public defender,  I saw so many times that literacy itself  is the key to any future success,  the  ability to read and write. Since one has  a  little time on his or her hands in  these remarkable institutions, it seems  to me that the theme is very good. I  just have difficulty with mandating  provisions other than  the carrot and  the stick approach.  I thank the chair.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro  pore. Who yield time?  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro  tem pore. The Senator from New Mexico.  ",1991
743,980,12,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr.  President,  I  yield myself 5 minutes of the time al lotted to me.  First, let me commend the Senator  from South Carolina for acknowledging  in his amendment  the  importance of  doing  something  in  this area.  I  do  think that there is a recognition that  we  should move  ahead  in  literacy  training here. I do not agree with the  Senator  from South Carolina  in his  choice of how to move ahead, but for  the first  time  in  this crime bill, we  have at least a recognition under this  amendment  that  there  is an  impor tance to be attached to this kind of an  effort in reducing crime. And that is  the main purpose.  I also want to, for the record, correct  a statement which I made last evening  in the debate, where I indicated that it  was my belief that the Senator from  South Carolina and the Senator from  Utah had both supported, essentially,  the same provision  that my amend ment contained in S. 2, when that bill  came out of the Labor and Human Re sources Committee. I was  in error in  that statement. They did not support  that, I am informed. In fact, they voted  against it. But that bill still was re ported by  the Labor and Human Re sources Committee, and essentially the  same legislation has passed the House,  as I indicated last evening.  The only point I make is that the dis tinction between the two proposals before the Senate is very clear. My bill  would direct the States to pursue this,  would give them 5 years in which to do  it, and would give  them substantial  discretion in how they pursued it and  the nature of the program they set up,  but still would give the U.S. Attorney  General authority to step in and with hold funds,  if he did not believe they  were in fact going forward, as the Con gress would direct in my amendment.  The Senator from South Carolina, on  the other hand, says that we will sup port  these efforts at the State level,  but it is purely discretionary, it is up  to the States whether they decide to do  this. Each State will make up its own  mind.  Mr. President, I think that is a good  issue to be before the Senate. Are we  serious about wanting to move in this  direction, or are we not? Are we in fact  going to put some teeth in a provision  in the law here, or are we not?  Literacy and education are subjects  that all politicians love to support, es pecially at the Federal  level. At  the  Federal level there is very little down side in supporting efforts  to  improve  education or improve literacy because,  generally,  it  is  recognized  and  ac knowledged that it is a State and local  problem, and the States and the local ities really have to deal with them.  I am suggesting here that the Fed eral Government should take some re sponsibility and step  in and commit  money to it, should require that it be  done, should give plenty of leeway-we  are talking about a 5-year lead time to put in place these programs. I think  it is important that we go ahead and  direct that this action be taken.  I ask those who support the amend ment of the Senator from South Caro lina whether we believe that the Gov ernors and the President were intend ing that our education goals be discre tionary, when  the President and  the  Governors said  that one of our edu cation goals was to ensure that every  adult American be literate by the year  that intended  to be discre tionary, as to each State? Was it the  national intent, was it the President's  intent,  that only  those States  that  really agreed with that should pursue  that goal?  I do not believe so. I  thought these  were national goals that we were com mitted to pursue. And, really, through  the legislation which I have offered, I  believe we are making or would make a  significant step toward achieving  the  goal,  particularly  goal No.  The  amendment by the Senator from South  Carolina eliminates any  requirement  that anything be done. Accordingly, I  have to resist it. And I hope the Senate  will defeat  the amendment  that has  been offered.  I yield the floor and reserve the re mainder of my time.

781,1032,12,Mr. KERREY.," Mr. President, I,  too,  want to commend the distinguished oc cupant of the chair, the Senator from  Colorado, for offering this amendment.  I, too, am perplexed. It is hard to un derstand why our friends on the other  side of the aisle will not permit this  amendment to be accepted without the  need for this parliamentary impasse.  It seems to me a rather simple and  easy-to-understand  requirement. We  simply provide  the  taxpayers of  the  United States of America access to the  information about how their taxpayer  dollars are being spent. In particular,  on something as expensive as this and  as controversial as this, it seems to me  it is extremely important to do  that.  Because we  find  the  administration  saying to us that they would like us to  get involved less in the matters involv ing the Resolution Trust Corporation,  that all of our second guessing and  nitpicking  is making it difficult  for  them to make decisions, making it dif ficult for them to carry out an expedi tious handling of the assets.  One of the reasons we are doing the  nitpicking is that the taxpayers do not  know what is going on and they are  asking us questions  that,  indeed, we  are not able to answer. So I applaud  the amendment of  the distinguished  Senator from Colorado. I appreciate his  willingness to bring this out, in par ticular on the crime bill, where I think  it deserves to be accepted and should in  fact be accepted by our friends on the  other side of the aisle, without any dis pute at all. Indeed it seems to me it  would  be  a  commonsense  thing  to  occur, were it to be a part of any other  spending package.  So I thank my colleague for his effort  and appreciate his willingness to make  this fight and make  this stand right  now where,  indeed,  I  think it is ex tremely important we do so.

786,1032,12,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President,  I would  like to join the distinguished Senators  from Vermont and Colorado, Senator  LEAHY and Senator BROWN, in offering  an amendment to the crime bill. The  amendment, which has been adopted, is  the Computer Abuse Amendments Act  of 1991. As computer  technology ad vances,  the  techniques  for  abusing  computers also become more complex.  These  computer  viruses  and worms  have made  prosecution  tenuous  in  many cases. Our amendment, by updat ing 18 U.S.C. 1030---the Computer Fraud  and Abuse Act-will clarify the intent  standard and the types of actions pro hibited. This clarification will benefit  both computer users and law enforce ment in their effort to limit the epi sodes of computer abuse.  We all have heard the horror stories  of computer viruses ravaging a com puter system. Sometimes these acts of  abuse are unintended, while at other  times  they  are  intentional.  This  amendment  recognizes  the difference  between malicious, intentional behav ior, and unintentional, accidental inci dent. As a  result,  the proposed  lan guage treates these different degrees of  intent in a legally appropriate manner.  If  the harm  from  the virus was  in tended, or  the virus was knowingly  transmitted or transmitted with reck less disregard of a substantial and un justifiable risk, the act is punishable as  a criminal violation and a civil cause  of action arises. If, on the other hand,  there was an honest mistake, there is  no violation or cause of action.  Mr.  President,  this amendment  is  identical to S. 2476, which the Senate  passed by voice vote last year. Hear ings were conducted by the Technology  Subcommittee on computer abuse  in  the 101st Congress, and a detailed dis cussion of the amendment, in bill form,  is available in Senate Report 101-544.  Both the computer users and the com puter  industry support  this proposal.  And  the Department of Justice has  gone on record as believing the amend ment will  improve  existing Federal  laws.  Mr. President, I would like to com mend my colleagues, Senator LEAHY,  chairman of the Technology and the  Law  Subcommittee,  and  Senator  BROWN,  for their work on this amend ment.  I believe  that our efforts will  produce a  law which will benefit the  computer industry and computer users  for many years.  We,  the undersigned Senators, in accord ance with the provisions of Rule x:xn of the  Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move  to bring to a close debate on S. 1241, a bill to  control and reduce violent crime.

789,1045,12,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The amendment is as follows:  In lieu of the matter beginning on page 26,  line 19 through line 8 on page 27 insert the  following:  None of the funds in this Act shall be used  to identify or delineate any land as a ""water  of  the United States"" under  the Federal  Manual for Identifying and Delineating Ju risdictional Wetlands  that was adopted  in  January 1989  (1989 Manual) or any subse quent manual not adopted  in accordance  with the requirements for notice and public  comment of the rule-making process of the  Administrative Procedure Act.  In addition, regarding Corps of Engineers  ongoing enforcement actions and permit ap plication involving lands which the Corps or  EPA has delineated as waters of the United  States under  the 1989 Manual, and which  have not yet been completed on the date of  enactment of this Act, the landowner or per mit applicant shall have the option to elect  a new delineation under the Corps 1987 Wet land Delineation Manual, or completion of  the permit process or enforcement action  based on the 1989 Manual delineation, unless  the Corps of Engineers determines, after in vestigation and consultation with other ap propriate parties, including the landowner or  permit applicant, that the delineation would  be substantially the same under either the  1987 or the 1989 Manual.  None of the funds in this Act shall be used  to finalize or implement the proposed regula tions  to amend  the  fee  structure  for  the  Corps  of Engineers  regulatory  program  which were published  in Federal Register,  Vol. 55, No. 197, Thursday, October 11, 1990.  ",1991
790,1045,12,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr. President, this  amendment, which I have submitted,  has been worked out in consultation  with the majority leader, the Corps of  Engineers, and others who are  inter ested in this program.  What we did in committee, Mr. Presi dent,  is provide that with respect to  the section 404 Wetlands Permit Pro gram, any regulations that were adopt ed under that program  that did not  comply with the Administrative Proce dures Act could not be enforced with  money provided under this bill.  What that practically means is that  the regulations, or the manual, as it is  called, which not only defined wet lands,  but  set  forth  the  procedure  under which  the Corps of Engineers,  EPA, and the Fish and Wildlife Service  regulate wetlands-that  the manuals  must be adopted  in accordance with  the Administrative Procedures Act in  order to be enforced.  In 1987, a manual was adopted setting  forth definitions of what was a wetland  and what was not, and providing in ef fect for some discretion in the adminis tration  of  that program. That  1987  manual was  adopted  in  accordance  with  the Administrative  Procedure  Act, which is to say, public hearings,  notice,  the right to make comments,  the right in effect for citizens  to be  heard.  In 1989, another manual was adopted.  This manual made tremendous changes  in the wetlands program. It defined, for  example,  a  wetland  as  being  that  which,  in most years, for 7 days was  wet at a  level 18  inches below  the  ground.  When you consider  the amount of  wetness, particularly in my State, vir tually the entire State is wet for 7 days  during  the growing season 18  inches  below the ground. As a matter of fact,  you could probably make that defini tion by saying at ground level, if only  7 days are being dealt with.  Moreover, the Corps of Engineers was  deprived of  the discretion which  lay  with the Corps of Engineers under that  program. The practical effect was  to  bring in an amount of land nationwide  consisting of 60 million acres, that fig ure being given by the head of the Fish  and Wildlife Service in testimony be fore the House.  You can imagine the effect of includ ing another 60 million acres of land  which, in many cases, was high and dry  or  considered  to  be  high  and  dry,  wherein the Corps of Engineers had ab solutely no discretion, where the value  of property on the day before it was de clared a wetland might be  thousands  and thousands of dollars per acre, and  on the day after it was declared a wet land it would be worth zero because it  could not be developed. Those kinds of  situations pertained all over my State.  Not only was there the loss of prop erty value, but many people who had  done  things  innocently  in wetland  areas-whether it was forming a craw fish pond or farming or filling or dredg ing,  or whatever-were  being  pros ecuted criminally under a set of rules  as to which they had no notice;  they  had no opportunity to be heard. No one  had an opportunity to be heard.  What we  said  under  our  original  amendment was that that 1989 manual,  not adopted in accordance with the Ad ministrative Procedures Act, could no  longer be enforced. Since that time, we  had meetings with  the distinguished  majority leader and his staff from the  Environment and Public Works Com mittee who pointed out that there were  ongoing some 5,000 permit applications  nationwide. And, as the majority lead er said, it was his desire also to have  these rules adopted in accordance with  the Administrative  Procedures Act.  Everyone thought we ought to have no tice, and we ought to have the right to  be heard, but 5,000 applications were  pending under the 1989 manual.  We therefore came up with substitute  language which has just been submitted, and which states that, for ongoing  enforcement actions and permit appli cations uncompleted on the date of en actment of this provision, but which  were based on  the 1989 manual,  the  corps would provide the landowners the  option to elect a new delineation based  on the corps' 1987 manual, or comple tion of the action based on the 1989 de lineation manual unless the corps were  to consult with the landowner and de termine that the delineation would be  substantially  the  same under either  the 1987 or 1989 manual.  In addition, the corps would be pro hibited  from  implementing  the  1990  proposal to increase the fees  imposed  on the public through the 404 program.  That fee increase was an increase, if  I  recall,  from $50  to $500,  to apply,  which might be for only one lot.  As a practical matter, Mr. President,  the Administrative  Procedures Act  provides  for 30-days' notice  so  that  they could comply with the law by sub mitting tomorrow a notice, and the 30  days provided under  the Administra tive Procedures Act would run and be  over with well before the fiscal year.  As  a  practical matter,  I  think  it  would  take  longer  than  the 30 days  stipulated by law. But we are not talk ing about a half a year or a year. We  are talking about a matter of, well, it  depends on how long they would want  to take. But however long it is, it is a  fundamental right. When you are deal ing with not just hundreds of millions,  but billions of dollars' worth of prop erty value and the loss of freedom, in deed the criminal prosecution of people  under a manual, somebody ought  to  have the right to be heard under those  regulations. And  that  is what  this  amendment does. I believe it has been  thoroughly discussed and gone over. So  I yield  the  floor at  this point, Mr.  President.  ",1991
791,1045,12,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President, I want  to  express my  full  support  for  the  amendment offered by the senior Sen ator  from Louisiana, Senator  JoHN STON, regarding the future implementa tion of  the 1989 Federal Delineation  and Jurisdictional Wetlands Manual.  It is so unfortunate and wholly inap propriate that the Environmental Pro tection Agency and the Corps of Engi neers have been unwilling, up to this  point, to subject this manual and other  important wetland memorandums and  directives  to  the normal public com ment process which is provided under  the Administrative  Procedures Act.  Like all other major initiatives to pro tect our Nation's natural  resources,  the wetlands program  is highly con troversial and rarely satisfactory to a  clear majority of concerned interests.  That is to be expected. But it was com pletely unfair and very  improper for  these agencies  to deny  the American  public  their normal opportunity  for  scrutiny and comment.

832,1071,12,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President,  this  afternoon I am introducing legislation  that asks America's military allies to  share in the cost of their own defense.  This bill is similar to an amendment  authored by my friend, Congressman  BYRON DORGAN,  and adopted by  the  House of Representatives  in May. It  asks three things: First, that the Presi dent negotiate cost-sharing agreements  with our military allies to offset Amer ican tax dollars spent for their defense;  second, that a fund be established into  which other nations may contribute if  the President is able to negotiate bur den-sharing agreements with them; and  third, that the administration provide  Congress with an accounting of allied  contributions-whether  in cash or  in  kind-to that fund.  That is all, Mr. President. We simply  want our allies to pay their fair share  of our mutual defense costs; we want  the President to initiate negotiations  designed to achieve a more equitable  distribution of  those  costs;  and we  want a clear accounting of allied con tributions to this effort. This legisla tion  says only  that,  40  years after  America  rebuilt Europe, at  a  time  when  Japan and  the European Eco nomic Community  is prospering and  American workers and  their Govern ment are sorely pressed, the nations we  have defended, and continue to defend,  should be asked to contribute more to  their own defense.  This bill  does not  target  specific  countries or amounts. It simply gives  the President the authority and, frank ly, the motivation to move forward and  negotiate agreements  to provide  for  the defense of those nations in a more  realistic and equitable manner.  Throughout  the  20th  century,  the  United States has demonstrated  its  willingness to assert a  leadership role  in the world in defense of liberty and  democratic principles. In turn, our al lies have enjoyed the security of the  U.S. defense umbrella. While  this ar rangement has served  the interest of  freedom  and  democracy  well,  the  changing  international  environment  dictates a fundamental reassessment of  the nature of our Nation's defense rela tionships with our allies.  We  have  395  bases  in 35  different  countries. We spend $28 billion a year  overseas in direct costs for the defense  of our allies. And, the indirect cost of  that defense has been estimated at well  over $100 billion.  The European members of NATO col lectively have a gross national product  greater than that of the United States.  Despite  that economic power, which  will undoubtedly grow after the Euro pean Community is formally united in  1992,  the people of the United States  continue to spend more on NATO de fenses than the other 15 alliance mem bers combined.  Is that fair?  During  Operation  Desert  Shield/  Desert Storm, President Bush and Sec retary Baker asked a similar question.  Is it fair for the United States to take  on the burden all on our own? And with  unanimity within and without the ad ministration, in this Congress, we said  no; if we are going to commit ourselves  to activity within the Persian Gulf it  must be a shared responsibility. So too  now, Mr. President, we must ask our  allies for that shared responsibility.  During  Operation  Desert  Shield/  Desert Storm, President Bush and Sec retary Baker skillfully constructed an  alliance that included not only  joint  forces and a unified command, but also  payments from the members of that al liance to a mutual defense cooperative  fund  that was used  to prosecute  the  gulf war. The  cooperation  achieved  during the gulf war has shown us that  burden sharing can work. It is time to  establish a more formal mechanism to  promote such burden sharing arrange ments in other parts of the world as  well. Without such a mechanism, bur den sharing will remain more rhetoric  than reality.  To continue to grow and prosper, our  alliances must recognize the changing  international environment and the mu tual burden  that a  regional defense  pact should entail. The United States  can no  longer afford  to defend  the  world alone. We have borne that bur den far longer than any people should.  It has cost us dearly, and frankly, it is  not fair.  America will never shirk its inter national  responsibilities. We  believe  too strongly in freedom and in peace.  But America must now ask  those  to  whom we have given so freely for so  long to begin to share in the respon sibility.  That is all this legislation seeks. It  prepares us for a more equal partner ship with our allies and a better under standing of the  level of commitment  that friends have toward each other. It  is the least we can ask from our allies  and for the American taxpayer.  I ask unanimous consent  that  the  full text of the bill be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 1438  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. DEFENSE OFFSET PAYMENTS.  (a) DEFENSE COST-SHARING AGREEMENTS. The President shall consult with foreign na tions to seek to achieve, within six months  after the date of the enactment of this Act,  an agreement on proportionate defense cost sharing with each foreign nation with which  the United States has a bilateral or multilat eral defense agreement. Each such defense  cost-sharing agreement should provide that  such nation agrees to share equitably with  the United States, through cash compensa tion or in-kind contributions, or a combina tion thereof, the costs to the United States  of maintaining military personnel or equip ment in that nation or otherwise providing  for the defense of that nation.  (b) CONSULTATIONB.-ln  the consultations  conducted under subsection (a),  the Presi dent should make maximum feasible use of  the Department of Defense and of the post of  Ambassador at Large  created by  section  8125(c) of the Department of Defense Appro priations Act, 1989 (10 U.S.C. 113 note).  (C) ALLIES MUTUAL DEFENSE PAYMENTS Ac COUNTING.-The Secretary of Defense shall  maintain an accounting  for defense  cost sharing under each agreement entered into  with a foreign nation pursuant to subsection  (a). Such accounting shall show for such na tion(1)  the amount of cost-sharing contribu tions agreed to;  (2)  the amount of cost-sharing contribu tions delivered to date;  (3) the amount of additional contributions  of such nation to any commonly funded mul tilateral  programs  providing  for United  States participation in the common defense;  (4)  the amount of contributions made by  the United States  to any such commonly  funded multilateral programs;  (5) the amount of the contributions of all  other nations to any such commonly funded  multilateral programs; and  (6) the cost to the United States of main taining military personnel or equipment in  that nation or otherwise providing for  the  defense of that nation.  (d)  REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS.-(!)  Not  later than 180 days after the date of the en actment of this Act, and each 180 days there after, the President shall submit a report, in  classified and unclassified form,  to the ap propriate committees of the Congress con cerning efforts and progress in carrying out  the provisions of subsections (a) and (b).  (2) Not later than 180 days after the date of  the enactment of this Act, and each 180 days  thereafter,  the Secretary of Defense shall  submit to the appropriate committees of the  Congress a report containing the accounting  of defense cost-sharing contributions main tained pursuant to subsection (c).

839,1123,12,Mr. SABO.," Mr. Speaker, our Nation's high ways, streets, and  transit systems provide a  basic source of mobility for the citizens of this  country. However, congestion problems  from  the growth of automobile use now  threaten  this mobility. Experts estimate that delays from  congestion  alone will  result  in  productivity  losses of up to $100 billion annually. Other  negative effects include accident-related fatali ties, increased air pollution, and inefficient fuel  consumption.  It  is vitally  important  that we  take steps to deal with these problems.  That is why, today, I am introducing the ""In telligent  Vehicle-Highway  Systems  Act  of  1991"". This legislation directs the Secretary of  Transportation  to promote and  facilitate  the  implementation of  intelligent vehicle-highway  systems as a component of the Nation's sur face transportation system.  The  term,  intelligent vehicle and highway  systems, or IVHS, refers to the  technologies  that are applied  to motor vehicles and  the  transportation systems upon which they operEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ate. Through the use of advanced computer,  telecommunications, and control  technology,  IVHS can  improve communication between  drivers and traffic control centers, creating an  integrated highway transportation system. This  type of system makes automobile travel safer,  more  efficient,  and more  environmentally  sound.  IVHS currently  includes the use of off-the shelf  technology, such as variable message  signs to alert drivers to traffic problems ahead  and  suggest  alternative  routes. More  ad vanced  IVHS systems would  include the de velopment or application of new technologies  to allow  individual automobiles  to  commu nicate with external systems helping the driver  make decisions and control the car.  A May 1991 GAO report indicates the tre mendous promise  IVHS holds. Some of  the  improvements  include:  reduction  of  travel  times  in congested areas by as much as 50  percent, reduction of fuel consumption by as  much as 1 0 percent through the elimination of  delays and stops, and reductions of up to 15  percent  in  the  pollution  from  automobiles.  Clearly the widespread use of IVHS is consist ent with  the goals of  improved productivity,  clean air, reduced congestion, and  improved  highway safety.  Implementation of  IVHS can  play a significant role by helping to make more  efficient use of the roads, bridges, and tunnels  that already exist. My legislation assures the  rapid  integration of advanced technology  into  our Nation's transportation systems.  Interest and  support  for  IVHS  have  in creased dramatically in the last few years. For  example, a six-nation European effort called  PROMETHEUS would devote $750 million to  IVHS over an 8-year period. Japan also has  initiated major IVHS efforts. But, in the United  States, IVHS has only begun to emerge as an  area for Federal policy action.  Growing Federal  funding  for  IVHS  reflects  the emerging domestic interest, though it still  lags behind efforts being conducted in Europe.  Nonetheless, funding for IVHS has increased  from $2.3 million  in  fiscal year 1990  to $20  million in fiscal year 1991. I believe we must  continue this trend.  We can no longer build our way out of traffic  congestion. American drivers waste 2 billion  hours a year in traffic jams. In my home State,  Minnesota, those wasted hours translate to an  annual economic  loss of more  than one-half  billion dollars. If conditions do not improve, the  number of hours spent  in delays could  in crease fourfold by the year 2005.  IVHS  is being  tested  in various areas,  in cluding Minneapolis, MN. As a member of the  House  Transportation  Appropriations  Sub committee,  I've helped secure $1 million  for  the Minnesota program GuideStar. This sys tem of ramp metering, changeable message  signs, closed circuit cameras, and  incident  management has provided speed increases of  35 percent, accident reduction of 40 percent,  and in some cases increased roadway capac ity by 15 percent. But, by  far  the greatest  achievement is Minnesota's low highway fatal ity rate, the lowest in the Nation.  Mr. Speaker, we can no longer do nothing.  We need to take the necessary steps to solve  our Nation's traffic problems. I believe my pro posal addresses these problems in a reason able way. By using advanced technologies on  17479  existing roadways we can solve this national  problem without paving over any more valu able land. Thank you.  The following  is a section-by-section sum mary of my legislation:  Sec. 1. Short Title: This act may be cited  as the ""Intelligent Vehicle-Highway System  Act of1991"".  Sec. 2. Purpose and Scope: vests the re sponsibility for the Intelligent Vehicle-High way Systems program with the Secretary of  Transportation. It establishes the goals of  the program, which include:  improved effi ciency and capacity of the highway system;  helping attain Clean Air goals; development  of IVHS industry in the United States; re duction of societal costs of traffic conges tion; and improved productivity. In carrying  out the mandates of the IVHS Act, the Sec retary is required to work with the heads of  other Federal agencies, and with the private  sector and research facilities. The Secretary  is also required  to establish standards for  IVHS systems, to enhance compatibility, to  promote adoption of IVHS  technologies,  to  reduce costs, and to establish an information  clearinghouse.  Sec. 3. Advisory Committee: authorizes the  Secretary to use advisory committees in car rying out the mandates of the title.  Sec. 4. Strategic Plan, Implementation Re ports, and Report to Congress: directs the  Secretary  to develop, within one year,  a  strategic plan to implement the IVHS pro gram. In doing so, the Secretary is to iden tify the short and long-term goals of the pro gram, and develop an action plan to help put  IVHS into wide use. One year after develop ing this plan, and annually thereafter,  the  Secretary is to submit to Congress a report  on implementation of the strategic plan. The  Secretary is also required to submit a report  to Congress in two years, on any non-tech nical barriers to significant implementation  ofiVHS.  Sec. 5. Technical, Planning, and Project  Assistance: authorizes the secretary to pro vide technical, planning and project assist ance  to State and  local governments and  other research entities. Multi-jurisdictional  traffic management agencies would be made  eligible for funding under the title. Criteria  for use by the Secretary in determining what  efforts to fund under this section are listed,  focusing on consistency with the strategic  plan developed by the Secretary.  Sec. 6. Applications of Technology: directs  the Secretary to provide direct assistance for  the implementation of IVHS to areas that  would show  the most  immediate benefits.  These  include, among other factors, areas  with high degrees of traffic congestion and  air quality problems.  Sec. 7. Authorizations: For activities under  Applications of Technology  the Secretary  may use funds authorized in section 104(a) of  title 23, United States Code, not to exceed  $150,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1992-1996.  Five percent of the funds would be reserved  for innovative projects that, while consistent  with the Secretary's IVHS goals, would not  otherwise attract  substantial  non-Federal  funding. The Federal share of applications of  IVHS technologies is 80% except for the in novative projects described above in which  case the Secretary may waive the 20% match  requirement.  Sec. 8. Definitions: defines ""Intelligent Ve hicle-Highway Systems"" and ""corridor"".  ",1991

843,1136,12,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. President, recently,  I joined as an original cosponsor of S.  1130,  the Family Farm Tax Relief and  Savings Act. This proposal would pro vide tax relief and a retirement savings  program for farmers. Farmers would be  permitted to defer capital gains tax on  the sale of farm assets by rolling the  sale profit  into an  individual retire ment account.  The Tax Code is particularly unkind  to  farmers. A farmer who works his  whole life on the farm and then sells  part or all of it in order to retire, is  subject to a 28-percent Federal capital  gains tax and additional taxes at the  State level. This does not leave much  to retire on. Recently, my colleague,  Senator KASTEN, the sponsor of S. 1130,  outlined this problem and our proposed  solution  in an excellent article pub lished in the Milwaukee Sentinel. I ask  unanimous consent that it be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Milwaukee Sentinel]  CHANGE TAX CODE, STOP HURTING FARMERS  (By F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr., and Robert  W. Kasten, Jr.)  With over 80,000 farmers, Wisconsin is one  of the leading producers of agricultural prod ucts in America. But as Wisconsin farmers  know,  farming has become an increasingly  difficult profession. And the federal govern ment's tax policies haven't made it any easi er.  If the current recession persists, it is esti mated that up to 4,000 Wisconsin dairy farm",1991

846,1149,12,Mr.  BENTSEN.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to take this time to recog nize the dedicated work of the Senator  from Louisiana  in preparing  the En ergy and Water Development appro priation bill. I express my thanks to  Senator JOHNSTON and his subcommit tee  for  their help on funding of the  superconducting super collider, a very  important project for my State and the  country. Another project was in need  of help as well, the Red River chloride  control project. The project has al ready  taken a  cut  from  the needed  amount this fiscal year to $3 billion in  the House report.  This project is imperative in order to  realize full utilization of surface water  supplies in the States of Texas, Okla homa, Louisiana, and Arkansas. Cur rently, more  than  1,000 miles  of  streams in the river basin are severely  contaminated by natural brines. Con sequently, water in  these streams  is  not suitable for municipal and most in dustrial and agricultural purposes.  Congress authorized construction of  the entire Red River chloride project to  control natural brine sources as a 100percent Federal project in the 1960's.  As part of this agreement, Texas and  Oklahoma  agreed  to  eliminate  any  manmade sources of salt pollution in  the Red River Basin, and the Federal  Government agreed to deal with natu rally occurring pollution. The States  have so far spent $92 million to reduce  the amount of manmade salts. Federal  expenditures  remained  at  a  level  reached 5 years ago, until  last year  when $5 million was  funded.  I have  worked tirelessly to keep this project a  100-percent  federally  funded  project  and it is essential that funding contin ues in order to meet the needs of this  region.  The Red River is a natural resource  that provides for a base of economic de velopment and well-being for Texas as  well as for the State of Louisiana. I be lieve an important part of keeping it a  secure resource  is to provide for  the  cleanup of the natural salt pollution.  I ask Senator JOHNSTON for his help  in securing funding during conference  committee  for  this  very  important  project.  ",1991
847,1149,12,Mr. JOHNSTON.," I commend the Sen ator for his interest in this project and  he is correct that the Red River is an  important natural resource for our re gion of the country. His efforts to pro vide usable water for economic devel opment are important. We were faced  with a difficult situation of balancing  the water resource needs of the Nation  in light of the severe budgetary limita tions. However, I can assure the Sen ator that I will review this matter and  see  if  funds  can be  found  for  this  project in conference.  ",1991
848,1149,12,Mr. BENTSEN.,"  I  thank my distin guished colleague for his assurances to  work in conference committee for the  Red River chloride control project. His  comments are very helpful and I appre ciate his dedicated work.  GUADALUPE RIVER, CA  ",1991
849,1149,12,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to note that the fiscal year 1992  Energy and Water Development appro priations bill as reported by the Senate  Appropriations  Committee  includes  $9,750,000  for  the Corps of Engineers  Guadalupe River project in California  as requested by the President and ap proved by the House.  However, I am disappointed to note  that the Senate committee has strick en language in the House passed bill di recting the corps to proceed with con struction  of  the  Guadalupe  River  project in accordance with the general  design memorandum of January 1991.  This project plan has been cleared by  both the Sacramento district office and  the South Pacific division office of the  corps;  it has  the full support of the  local community, the city of San Jose,  and the Santa Clara Valley Water Dis trict; and it has received full approval  by Federal environmental agencies.  It is my understanding that the corps  headquarters agrees with the district  and division that this GDM is a  tech nically sound, well designed plan. But  the corps headquarters  is  indicating  that the corps does not intend to fulfill  its full cost-sharing burden and instead  intends to shift responsibility for envi ronmental aspects of the project to the  local community.  I believe  that  the Federal Govern ment should share fully  in  the costs  necessary to ensure that the Guadalupe  River flood control project meets basic  Federal  environmental  requirements,  as the January 1991 GDM provides.  Further, I am concerned that the lan guage in the Senate committee report  on H.R. 2427 clouds the issue of whether  the corps will proceed with construc tion of the Guadalupe River project as  identified in the January 1991 GDM.  Again,  this  is  the project that the  local community supports, that has re ceived full approval by Federal envi ronmental agencies, and that meets all  relevant criteria of the 1986 Water Re sources Development Act,  including  cost sharing.  San Jose needs flood protection. We  cannot afford a substantial delay which  continues to leave 100 million dollars'  worth of property at risk. It is criti cally important that the corps be able  to proceed with construction of  the  Guadalupe River project with the funds  provided in this bill.  Mr. President, I would like to ask the  manager of the bill if he would review  th:!;:; situation and see if the committee  could accept the House bill language in  conference.  ",1991
850,1149,12,Mr. SEYMOUR.," Mr. President, I also  rise in support of the House language,  striken by the Senate Energy Commit tee, directing the Corps of Engineers to  proceed with construction of the Gua dalupe River  project  in  accordance  with the general design memorandum  of January 1991.  is my  understanding  that  the  project plan has the strong support of  the city of San Jose, CA,  the Santa  Clara Valley Water District; and local  and national environmental organiza tions. Further, as stated by Califor nia's senior Senator, Senator CRAN STON,  this plan has been cleared by  both the Army Corps of Engineers, Sac ramento district office, as well as the  South Pacific division office.  Mr. President, I respectfully request  that the managers of this bill review  this situation and see if the committee  could accept the House bill language  during conference.  ",1991
851,1149,12,Mr. JOHNSTON., I appreciate know ing of the interest of both California  Senators  in  the  Guadalupe  River  project. I would like to assure the Sen ators that I will revisit the issue when  we go to conference with the House.  ,1991

Once again the subcommittee recog nized  the  importance of funding  the  Mni Wiconi drinking water pipeline in  western South Dakota, allocating $2.45  million for the project. This is $300,000  more  than was appropriated by  the  House.

861,1162,12,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I indicated  last evening to the majority leader we  would have a conference this morning  on  the crime package, a Republican  conference, and I would like to state  what I think the general consensus of  the conference was, although there is  no binding of any members who at tended conference. There are still a few  unresolved matters on this side that we  would like to have resolved before clo ture is invoked because, very frankly,  once cloture is invoked, some of these  (Mr.  matters would not be germane; amend ments would not be in order.  Therefore, on this side of the aisle, it  would be my suggestion that cloture  not be  invoked on  the  first cloture  vote, and in the time interim between  now and hopefully later today, if we  could  have  a  second  cloture  vote  today-if not, it could occur after mid night or it could occur tomorrow morn ing-we could work out some of the dif ferences.  I know that staff is already in the  process of working out differences.  I  am talking about the staff of Senator  THURMOND  and  the  staff of Senator  BIDEN and others who have been di rectly involved in the negotiations.  So I wanted the majority leader to  understand it is not that we are op posed to the bill before us. Some are.  Some will vote against  this bill on  final passage. But there are  three or  four or five areas we would like to clar ify between now and the time cloture is  invoked for  the reasons  that I have  stated.  For that reason, I think the leader is  going  to  find  a  number of my col leagues voting against the first cloture  vote, and hopefully for cloture on the  second cloture vote.

864,1162,12,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, I ap preciate the distinguished Republican  leader's remarks. I regret them.  It was over 100 days ago  that  the  President addressed the Congress, and  repeatedly since then, to stress the im portance of acting on  the crime bill,  originally within 100 days and now as  soon as possible. The Senate has now  been considering  the bill  for over 3  weeks, and every effort to obtain an  agreement to expedite consideration of  the bill has been objected to by theRe publican Members of the Senate.  I know there are things to be worked  out, but we have been at it 3 weeks,  and  I  suspect we  could be at  it 3  months and there would still be things  to work out.  I hope my colleagues will vote for  cloture. I think a vote on cloture is a  test on whether  someone  is for  or  against  the crime bill. There  is no  greater gulf in human affairs than the  gulf between words and deeds. We have  heard  the words. The votes are  the  deeds. The only way we are going to  get a crime bill is to invoke cloture,  and  to proceed  to disposition of this  bill. Otherwise, there is not going to be  cloture, and there is not going to be a  crime bill. There will not be a crime  bill for  the next couple of years al though there will be a lot of talk about  it.  This is the time for action. A vote on  cloture is a vote on whether a Senator  ",1991

871,1188,12,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President,  I  want to take a  few moments here to  discuss an amendment which will be  approved  later  tonight en bloc with  other amendments that has been essen tially agreed to by both sides.  Mr. President, I have been interested  for quite some time in the problem of  public corruption,  and  in particular  that component part of the public cor ruption problem  typically referred to  as election fraud.  Last year the amendment that I am  going  to discuss  in a  few moments  which was cosponsored by  the chair man of the Judiciary Committee, Sen ator BIDEN, was approved. It will be of fered on my behalf later  tonight.  I  would like to take a few moments of  the Senate's time to explain what it is  about.  This amendment,  the Anti-Corrup tion Act of 1991, as I indicated, passed  the Senate last year as a provision in  S. 1970, last year's crime bill. It had the  support of the Attorney General,  the  Criminal Division of the Justice De partment, and  the Senate  Judiciary  Committee.  I have worked  to develop a  com prehensive  law enforcement  response  to the problems of election fraud and  public  corruption,  especially  in  the  wake of the Supreme Court decision in  McNally against the United States.  Three years ago we passed an amend ment to the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of  1988 sponsored by Senator BIDEN and  myself which restored much of what  was  lost  in  the McNally decision  in  terms of the  jurisdictional authority  needed  to go after corrupt officials.  But, Mr. President, a great deal more  is needed to be done, and still needs to  be done through this amendment.  When I initially focused on the public  corruption issue I was primarily con cerned with election fraud. The only  way  to clean up election fraud  is to  bring the Federal Government in, and  give it the authority to prosecute of fenders under Federal law in Federal  court.  That is what Congess did in 1965 in  enacting the Voting Rights Act. It used  the Federal Government's power  to  protect people's voting rights from en trenched local discrimination.

876,1188,12,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President, 3  weeks ago I spoke about this body's  ritual of passing crime bills that have  little  to do with fighting crime and  much to do with political gamesman ship. For the last four Congresses these  crime debates have become forums for  Senators  to come  forward and show  how  tough they can be on criminals.  Because these debates have not focused  on the causes of crime, each of these  crime bills has been a  failure. Crime  rates have continued to rise. Murder  rates have continued to rise. Our jails  are  filled,  but  crime  continues  unabated.  I also said 3 weeks ago that I would  oppose any crime bill which was  the  product of such political gamesman ship. This is such a bill, and yet, I find  myself in a difficult position.  My position is difficult because this  bill now includes the Brady bill-a pro vision that will do something to stop  crime  in America.  I have fought for  over 4 years to see this Senate pass a  waiting period for handgun purchases,  and I am glad it was adopted over whelmingly by the Senate as part of  this crime bill.  The compromise Brady bill will make  it harder for criminals to get guns. It  requires a potential purchaser of a gun  to wait 5 business days,  in effect 1  week, before buying a handgun. It re quires local police to conduct a back ground check during that time, to en sure that felons and other prohibited  persons are not able just to walk into a  gun store and walk out with a hand gun. And within several years, it will  require the implementation of an in stant check system to replace the wait ing period. Any State failing to meet  the timetable for implementation must  maintain  the  5-business-day waiting  period.  ",1991
877,1201,12,Mr. MITCHELL.," I further ask unani mous consent  that  the cloture vote  now scheduled to occur tomorrow in stead occur tonight at 8:30 p.m., with  the mandatory  live  quorum  being  waived, and that in the 30 minutes be tween now and the cloture vote Sen ator HELMs be recognized  to address  the Senate for 20 minutes, and then  Senator BIDEN be recognized to address  the Senate for 5 minutes, and Senator  THURMOND be recognized to address the  Senate for 5 minutes.

881,1201,12,Mr. HELMS.," I thank the Chair.  Let me review quickly. There are cer tain  amendments  on which  certain  Members of the Senate do not want to  vote. We  experienced  that the other  day when I offered an amendment re lating to quotas. The press said that  Helms tied up the Senate. Helms did  not tie up the Senate. Helms was ready  to vote after he offered  the amend ment. But they put in a quorum call  and 10 hours elapsed and the Senate did  not do another thing.  So let us have an understanding of  one  thing,  that  there  are  certain  amendments on which certain Senators  do not want to have a vote.  Now, I have two amendments which I  offered to the negotiators that I would  accept a 30-minute time limitation on  each of them equally divjded so that we  could have a vote. Oh, no. Helms is not  going to have a chance on that. Well,  Helms is going to have a chance to get  a vote one way or another. It will be a  vote to indicate how Senators feel.  Now,  let me  read  you  the  first  amendment and see  if anybody who  may be watching on C-SP AN could pos sibly disagree with it, let alone Sen ators.  At the end of the amendment, add the fol lowing:  ""Title 18, United States Code,  is  amended by adding at the appropriate place  the following new section:  ""SEC.    DELIBERATE TRANSMISSION OF THE  AIDS VIRUS  than $10,000, or  ""(a) Whoever, being a registered physician,  dentist, nurse, or other health care provider,  knowing that he is infected with the Human  Immunodeficiency Virus, intentionally pro vides medical or dental treatment to another  person, without prior notification  to such  person of such infection, shall be fined not  more  imprisoned not  less  than ten years, or both.  ""(b) The provisions of this section shall  not be applicable in the case of a medical  emergency  in which  alternative medical  treatment is not reasonably available.""  (c) DEFINITIONS.-As used in this section (1) the term ""treatment"" means the per formance of any medical diagnosis or proce dure that involves an invasive physical con tact between the patient being treated and  the physician or health professional admin istering the procedure."".  ",1991
882,1201,12,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, I have in  my hand a series of articles taken from  the Raleigh News and Observer,  the  Washington  Times,  and Newsweek.  Each article describes, sometimes  in  graphic detail, the physical and emo tional suffering of hundreds of Ameri cans who have been unknowingly ex posed to AIDS by doctors, dentists, and  health care workers, who are carriers  of this deadly virus.  I have become aware of the case of  Kimberly Bergalis a 23-year-old Florida  woman who is now in the last stages of  AIDS-related tuberculosis, a condition  which is slowly destroying her brain  and body. As  the July 1 edition of  Newsweek  states,  ""sometime  in  the  next few days, Bergalis will probably  become  the first American  to die of  AIDS,  after  being  infected  by  her  dentist * * *.""  For the last few months, Kimberly  has taken her struggle to the American  people, demanding  that HIV -infected  doctors,  dentists,  and  health  care  workers be required to disclose  their  condition  to  their patients. You see,  Kimberly's dentist had AIDS. He knew  he had AIDS, but he refused to notify  his patients of his condition. Now Kim berly Bergalis is about to die, and four  others who were treated by this man  have tested positive for the virus.  On Tuesday, our  former  colleague  and the current Governor of Florida,  Lawton Chiles, visited Kimberly. Gov ernor Chiles put it very plainly:  It's a  lot like being in the presence of a  saint. I told her how much I admired her, I  told her I  thought she'd already protected  lives  that wouldn't have been pro tected before.  many  Mr. President, a June 20, 1991 Gallup  poll found that 95 percent of the Amer ican people believe that surgeons who  know that they have AIDS should be  required to tell patients if they are in fected with the AIDS virus. The same  poll found that 94 percent of Americans  believe that all physicians and dentists  should be required to tell their patients  that they have AIDS if they know they  are infected.  The American people, as always, are  ahead of  the politicians and profes sional activists  in  this country who  have, for too long, treated AIDS as a  civil rights issue rather than the public  health threat it really is.  The story of the brave woman  in  Florida is not isolated. In the State of  Minnesota, a pediatric surgeon contin ued to perform deliveries, and rectal,  and vaginal examinations months after  he found out he had AIDS. In the most  shocking part of  this story, a Min nesota television station broadcast pic tures of this doctor delivering a baby  while his bare arm was covered with  sores.  When asked about the sores by the  mother of the child he was about to de liver,  the doctor said that the sores  were  just an allergic  reaction. This  man knew he had the AIDS virus well  before he delivered that baby. As one of  his patients told Newsweek, ""he takes  an oath to save lives not give a death  sentence.""  In my own State of North Carolina, a  health care trainee at a major hospital  in eastern North Carolina worked with  patients for more  than a year after  finding out he had  the AIDS virus.  Residents of the Fayetteville and Ra leigh areas have begun receiving let ters from military and county health  officials saying that they might have  been exposed  to AIDS because  their  dentists had the disease.  Mr. President I have read the news papers recently and discovered that the  AMA and the American Dental Asso ciation have rejected calls for manda tory AIDS testing. The AMA says it is  up to the doctors to determine if they  should be tested. Responding to the po sition of the professional medical es tablishment,  former Surgeon General  C. Everett Koop told doctors that they  face a loss of credibility if they refuse  to be  tested. He warned, ""be certain  that the public knows that you are just  as concerned about them as you are  about yourselves.""  As usual the medical establishment  and the AIDS lobby have been silent.  The Helms amendment does not re quire that health care professionals un dergo mandatory AIDS testing. We will  visit that issue at another time.  The Helms amendment does say that  if the doctor, dentist, nurse, or health  care worker, performs or is  involved  with invasive medical techniques-that  is a surgeon, obstetrician, or surgical  nurse-and knows he has AIDS and  fails to notify his patients of that fact  he is subject to a fine and jail term of  not less than 10 years. This Senator  feels that is an adequate response to  the rogues in the medical community  who have knowingly and callously ex",1991

896,1461,12,Mr. APPLEGATE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to support the rule. However, I do want  to make a  statement with regard  to  the situation which is facing Members.  To give most-favored-nation status  to China, which is a Communist coun try, is a most foolish notion. Therefore,  I say to President Bush in his consider ation of this, ""No, no, a thousand times  no.""  It is an insult to the American veter ans to say to them, now that they have  fought and sacrificed for the very prin ciples that are being denied other peo ple in the world, we have had 11/4 mil lion people who have died since the be ginning of this country, defending free doms, we have had millions who have  been maimed and have been disabled,  and now we are going to turn around  and say that it is OK if we recognize a  country that denies free speech,  that  denies freedom of the press, that denies  freedom of religion, denies all human  rights. That we as a nation, we are  going to recognize another nation that  strips its people of everything as we  know it in this country.  The President of the United States  says that it is just, and it is moral. I do  not know what book he is reading, but  I  think he better go back  to  the  li brary.  When Nicaragua abused  those very  same principles  that we are  talking  about now,  these very same principles  that Americans have fought for, we cut  them off. We stopped trade with Nica ragua. We  took care of  them  com pletely, and now all of a sudden we are  saying to China that it is all right, this  godless society, it is OK if they abuse  their people.  American  veterans  and American  workers are going  to  lose  their jobs.  Listen, they are going to lose their jobs  to slave  labor-made products. People  who are paid 50 cents a day, and that  may be high, I do not know. They do  not even have a minimum wage over  there. If Members do not think this is  true, just ask the American veterans,  and  the American workers what we  think about most-favored-nation sta tus.  If it is going to be China now, who is  it going to be next? Are we going to  give it to Hussein in Iraq? Are we going  to give it to Quadhafi in Libya? How  about Fidel Castro down in Cuba? Why  do we not just give him most-favored",1991
897,1474,12,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 2212.  It  is  time  that we send a clear  message that the United States will not ignore  China's  abhorrent  human  rights  record,  avanced weapons sales  to countries around  tne world, and unfair trading practices with the  United States.  The Chinese Government's brutal suppres sion of political dissidents  is undisputed. We  all recall the graphic violence and blatant dis respect for human life that took place during  the  government's massacre  in  Tiananmen  Square. China has also refused to become a  responsible member of the world community  with regard to trade and arms control. Grant ing China unconditional most-favored-nation  [MFN]  status will  only  continue  to  reward  China for its refusal to address these issues.  To those who say that cutting off MFN ben efits to China will hurt United States economic  interests,  I ask: Are we  really hurting our selves by conditioning special trade benefits to  a country  that uses prison  labor to produce  products for  international markets, and which  has  virtually  no  respect  for United States  copyrights and patents? China has exploited  these  factors  to accumulate a massive trade  surplus with  the United States and amass  huge  foreign currency  reserves which effec tively protect it from outside pressures.  One analysis suggests  that  if  the United  States were  to demand  fair and balanced  trade with China, our economy would have  grown by as much as $25 billion in 1990 and  created an additional 400,000  jobs. Yet, de spite  the unfair  trade practices and human  rights abuses that have been documented in  China over the  last several years,  the Presi dent is only too willing to grant to China the  same trade status that we give our best trad ing partners. Not only  is unconditional MFN  status  for China a slap  in  the  face  to  the  American principle of respect for human rights,  it is a slap in the  face  to American workers  and businesses as well.  In adopting H.R. 2212, we are putting China  on notice that its MFN status is in jeopardy. At  the same time, though, we give them an op portunity to take corrective action before MFN  is revoked. The conditions outlined in this bill  place China's MFN status in its own hands. If  China makes progress on human rights, trade,  and weapons proliferation, then it will be able  to retain MFN status. If not, then MFN is auto matically revoked.  Using MFN as  leverage only works  if  the  Chinese Government knows we are serious  about taking this privilege away. Mr. Speaker,  I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2212, and put some  teeth  into our relations  with China by conditioning MFN status on real  improvements  in China's  trade policies and  abusive human rights practices.  ",1991
898,1474,12,Mr. GUARINI.," Mr. Speaker,  I have grave  reservations regarding the wisdom of imposing  conditions on  the President's  request  to ex tend most-favore~nation [MFN] status to the  People's Republic of China [PAC]. While rea sonable men and women may differ, I believe  that MFN  is not an appropriate vehicle  for  achieving our political, social and foreign pol icy objectives in China. Moreover,  I just don't  believe  that  conditionality will work  in  this  case.  In fact,  it is likely to be counter-produc tive, both in terms of improving China's inter nal situation and promoting America's self-in terest.  Every Member  of Congress  has  been  revulsed by the repression of human rights in  China, beginning with the Tiananmen Square  massacre and continuing  to  this day. The  PRC's use of prison labor is most disturbing,  and the repression in Tibet is a tragedy.  All our problems with China are not confined  to human rights. Proliferation of nuclear and  nonnuclear arms is also a major concern. The  sale of ballistic missiles to Pakistan and Syria  and nuclear technology to Algeria cannot be  overlooked.  Finally, our bilateral  trading  relationship  is  replete with difficulties. China's trade surplus  with the United States is now second only to  Japan's. China completely disregards intellectual property  rights, and market access  for  United States exports is becoming more and  more difficult.  With all  these problems,  it  is only natural  that we should think of revoking or imposing  conditions on most-favored-nation status  for  China. However,  the  issue  that we must  confront is whether such action would be pro ductive. China is sui generis, and what might  work with other countries could backfire with  China.  An historical perspective will help us assess  our options. We are not dealing with a typical  country, but the Middle Kingdom. How such a  country, steeped in thousands of years of tra dition, will respond to outside pressure, is by  no means clear.  In evaluating China's susceptibility  to eco nomic pressure, we must remember that his torically, China has resisted the allure of for eign trade, especially with the West. Efforts by  the British, French and the Americans to open  the China  trade during  the  first half of  the  nineteenth century were stoutly opposed by  Peking. Only by going to war were the West ern Powers able to open up China for trade.  The Chinese did not wiilingly accept  their  defeat in the Anglo-Chinese War of 1839-42,  which  resulted  in  trade, albeit circumscribed,  with the West. The ruling Manchu dynasty was  begrudging  in granting  concessions  to  the  Western trading powers. In part, this stemmed  from strong domestic opposition to the West ern  incursions.  Indeed, so great was the do mestic dissatisfaction with Manchus'  inability  to effectively oppose foreign incursions that a  revolt against the regime ensued on a scale  unknown  in  the West,  claiming millions of  lives.  The dynasty survived these challenges, but  embarked on a self-strengthening movement,  designed to make it possible to sever all ties  with the West. For many Chinese, this move ment did not go far enough. The Boxer Rebel lion of the late 19th century was xenophobic in  character, motivated  in part by  the goal of  modernizing the country so that China would  be strong enough to break the foreign powers'  domination of the country.  In 1911 , China overthrew the monarchy and  became a republic, but in name only. Tradi tions proved too powerful, and Western style  democracy just did not take hold. What little  support there was  for democracy came  from  Western-educated students, many of whom  had gone to school in the United States sup ported by  remission of the Boxer  Indemnity.  Following the suppression of the Boxer Rebel lion, the United States and the other powers  imposed a huge financial indemnity on China.  Some years  later, the United States remitted  the indemnity to educate Chinese students in  the United States in order to gain the goodwill  of the future leaders of China.  The Chinese Nationalists, or Kuomintang,  came  to power in 1927,  led by Chiang K'ai shek. To many Americans, Chiang, married to  a Methodist,  represented  the  accession of  Western values  in China. Nothing could be  further  from  the  truth. He was an old  fash ioned warlord, who proved incapable of over coming  the nationalistic appeal of the Com munists, and eventually was deposed.  The year 1949 brought Mao and the Com munists to power, and relations with the Unit",1991

Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate  my colleague,  the gentlewoman from  California  [Ms. PELOSI]  for her hard  work on  this  legislation.  I  think she  has done a  tremendous service to the  Congress with all this effort.  Am I my broker's keeper? Yet bet I  am. I think we all are. We all believe in  human rights. We all believe in our fel low man, and yet I hear some of my  colleagues on the floor today say in es sence, ""Let's close our eyes to what is  going on the Communist China."" I can not do  that, and I do not think any body who really thinks about it should.  There are 10 million people in Com munist gulags  in Communist China  is  a major  today, many of whom are participating  in a  slave  labor program  to export  goods to the rest of the world, includ ing the United States. It is estimated  that last year we got $100 million in  products from Communist China that  were made by slave labor in these 3,000  Communist gulags that have 10 million  people  in them. Those people stay in  those prisons until they die. About 30  percent get out. The other 70 percent  stay there.  Nuclear  proliferation  issue, I grant you that.  The economic considerations we are  talking about here  today that affect  Americans, that is important as well.  But what about the 10 million people  who are suffering in those gulags today  and are literally slaves, making prod ucts that we consume in this country?  Do we not care about them?  I say we should. For God's sake, we  should, and then we think about those  young men and women who wanted  freedom in Tiananmen Square. Have we  forgotten about them? Have we forgot ten the Statue of Liberty replica that  they erected in Tinanamen Square tell ing  the world  that  they wanted  the  things that we hold dear, freedom, de mocracy, and liberty?  And yet what happened? We watched  horrified on television as tanks came  in  and  they  literally ground  those  young patriots into dog meat, and we  stand here today saying, ""Let's close  our eyes  to  that and give  this Com munist regime, this tyrannical regime,  most-favored-nation status."" I say no.  We need to send a signal not only to  the Communist Chinese, but to the rest  of the world that we stand for human  rights, that we know there is a cost to  be paid and we are willing to pay it, be cause we believe in our fellow man. To  do less, in my opinion, is criminal.  ",1991

909,1500,12,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H.R. 2212,  the Pelosi bill, condi tioning  the extension of most-favored-nation  trading  status  for  the People's Republic of  China on genuine human rights  reforms and  arms control activities. Congress has threat ened to do  this ever since the brutal crack downs  symbolized  by  the  massacre  in  Tiananmen Square. China has repeatedly  ig nored our concerns and our warnings.  However, I must say I am concerned about  attaching too many conditions with  too many  or unrealistic aims. Our objective  is  to per suade the Chinese Government to change di rections and return to the process of economic  and political reform which was moving slowly,  but at  least moving positively, prior  to June  1989. Realistically, we cannot expect a total  transformation from Communist dictatorship to  free democracy overnight. Setting conditions  that basically  require  such a  transformation  will  not yield  the positive  results we want.  Rather, I believe they will push the hard-line  Chinese Government in the opposite direction  ruining our already strained relations. We just  don't know how far we can push China. I be lieve we  should  set  realistic goals,  require  China to meet them and move on from there.  In other words, we should attach conditions,  but reasonable and responsible ones.  I believe that the Communist Chinese Gov ernment must be held accountable  for  the  murder and continued  imprisonment of thou sands of peaceful prodemocracy supporters  whose only  crime was  to  publicly  ask  for  greater freedom and democracy. Sadly, this is  not  the  first  time  the Communist regime  in  China has used violence and bloodshed to en force  its will. Since seizing power  in 1949,  hundreds of thousands-some claim scores of  millions-of Chinese as well as countless Ti betans have been murdered  by  the Com munist Government. The overwhelmingly bru tal force used by the Chinese Army to destroy  the  prodemocracy movement  is  abhorrent.  The false charges and sham tribunals used to  convict student leaders and sentence them to  death  by  firing  squad  are outrageous, but  should not have surprised anyone. Arrests and  political harassment continue today throughout  China and Tibet. Like many of my colleagues,  I have already cosponsored and voted for res olutions that strongly denounce the brutal Chi nese Government and protest all of its repres sive measures. China cannot claim it has not  been warned.  We have not stood idly by. Immediately fol lowing  the Chinese Army's bloody attack on  the student demonstrators in Beijing, the Unit ed States, through the White House, Congress  and  the  State Department,  strongly  con demned the Chinese Government's action and  President Bush invoked a set of punitive sanc tions  in response to this cruelty. These sanc tions  include  suspension of  all military  co operation and military sales,  including com mercial military deals;  suspension of high technology transfers and sales; suspension of  any  further meetings between senior United  States officials and their Chinese counterparts;  and postponing any consideration of support ing Chinese applications for loans from  inter national lending institutions. I encouraged and  strongly support these sanctions.  In addition, the mayhem created by the Chi nese Government has resulted in the imposi tion of other informal economic sanctions. The  evacuation of  the vast majority of western  businessmen and  technical consultants has  crippled many of China's industries, especially  those  involved  in modernization and genera tion of much needed export earnings.  Events in China do affect our national secu rity and global stability. For example, China  could have, but it didn't, oppose our actions in  the United Nations and in the Persian Gulf. A  Chinese veto of any of the U.N.  resolutions  could have had tremendously negative  impli cations for Operation Desert Shield/Storm.  As a nuclear power and major arms. dealer,  I am also concerned that a negative reaction  by China to our MFN actions could result  in  China  ignoring our efforts  to halt  the arms  race in the Middle East, South Asia and else where. That could be very detrimental to our  national security interests.  While I recognize the importance of our re lations with China and hope these ties will not  be further damaged, the lack of real improve",1991
910,1513,12,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition to the gentleman's motion  to  recommit. The motion  seeks  to  weaken an already very well-balanced  bill. When  this bill was put together  with its 150 cosponsors, it was crafted  with the full participation of the Con gressional Working Group on China.  We did this bill with an eye to renew ing most-favored-nation status in 1992,  crafting  reasonable  conditions  that  could be met.  The  gentleman's motion  abdicates  the right of this body to exercise its  will on taxation  issues, which  trades  and tariffs are, abdicates that to  the  President of the United States.  I am certain, I say to the gentleman  from Texas  [Mr. ARCHER],  that  the  President of  the United States does  take  these  issues  into  consideration  when he considers renewal of most-fa vored-nation status for China. I do not  expect that the President of the United  States makes that decision in a vacu um; at least, I hope he has considered  these  issues, but  this  is  simply not  enough.  The present policy has not worked.  The  human  rights  conditions  have  worsened. The  repression  continues.  The  trade deficit grows. The nuclear  proliferation continues. The export of  prison  labor goods continues and  in creases. The present policy, as I said,  has not worked.  That  is why  I am so glad  that in  crafting this legislation, we have  the  support of so many of those who have a  really vested interest in the continu ation of most-favored-nation status for  China next year.  The Independent Federation of Chi nese Students and Scholars,  the De mocracy for China,  the Chinese Alli ance  for Democracy, Dr. Fang Lizhi,  and  the  list  goes  on  and  on  of  dissendents and those who care about  democracy  in China,  but who  very  much want most-favored-nation status  to continue. They support this condi tional approach.  What  is  important here  today, Mr.  Speaker, is to remember that when we  put this bill together it was with the  intention of getting the broadest base  of support. We made concessions in the  legislation in order to be able to have  as united a  front as possible, to send  the clearest message possible to the au thorities in Beijing that their trade re lationship with us was one we wanted  to continue, but we could not continue  unless  there was  a  change  in  their  treatment of their people, and that the  prisoners be released.  So I appeal to my colleagues to de feat  the Archer motion  to  recommit  and let us give one big vote today for  H.R.  2212. Let  the message be very  clear and let us then proceed through  the process with the best bill, with the  broadest amount of support.  I  think it is clear from  the debate  that this is legislation that the House  wants. I am very proud of the biparti san support that it has received.  ",1991
911,1513,12,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition  to  the motion  to  recommit H.R.  2212. Although  I believe  that  the substitute  amendment set forth  in  the motion  is a rea sonable one, and one that I am philosophically  inclined  to support,  I believe  it  is  imperative  that the House send a strong, united message  to  the Chinese Government  that  the status  quo  is no  longer acceptable. We must see  dramatic  improvement  in China's record on  human rights if China is going to maintain its  MFN status in the future. I will therefore vote  against the motion to recommit and for H.R.  2212, as amended by the Committee on Ways  and Means. I will however, work in conference  to improve the bill so that, hopefully, it can be  signed by the President.  ",1991
912,1513,12,Mr. DONNELLY.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong support of House Joint Resolution 263,  a  resolution  to disprove most-favored-nation  [MFN]  trade status for the People's Republic  of China.  Mr. Speaker, I am an original cosponsor of  this resolution, and I had intended to contrib ute  to  the debate on  this  important  issue.  However,  I was unavoidably detained at a  Ways and Means Committee hearing during  House consideration of this resolution.  The People's Republic of China  is a rene gade nation  and  refuses  to  recognize  the  basic human rights of its citizens. It has been  2  years  since  the  brutal  massacre  in  Tiananmen Square, and the situation in China  has remained the same.  The Chinese Government still suppresses  political opposition, restricts the press, detains  and  incarcerates  its citizens and uses pris oners for slave labor. Its brutal annexation and  occupation of the sovereign nation of Tibet is  a violation of that country's inalienable rights  of self-determination and religious freedom.  Internationally, China is considered a major  nuclear power and yet has repeatedly refused  to sign  the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  Recent evidence  indicates  that  the Chinese  Government has helped in the development of  several nuclear weapons programs  in Paki stan,  India, Algeria, Brazil, Argentina,  and  South Africa.  Far from  improving, China's treatment of its  citizens and actions  in  the world community  have deteriorated. The administration's desire  to continue its policy of constructive engage ment Y!ith  the Chinese Government  is ap peasement in its worst form.  Extending the MFN status for China is not  an economic issue, it  is a matter of principle.  We must  immediately suspend MFN  status.  To extend MFN with conditions does not go  far enough.  I am pleased  that a majority of my col leagues agree with me about the need for the  United States to send a clear and unequivocal  message to the Chinese Government that its  disregard for  the rights of  its citizens and its  responsibilities  as a member  of  the  inter national community can no  longer be  toler ated. I would also like to take this opportunity  to  commend my  colleague, Representative  GERALD SOLOMON,  for his  leadership on  this  issue.  ",1991

So, they would look at this, and they  would say, ""Well, we brought in $16,000.  That's a good deal.""

934,1539,12,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  join my colleagues in commemorating the life  of an American who, through his years of put:r  lie service, inspired so many. Hubert H. Hum phrey stood and still stands as a shining ex ample of what public life can and should be.  I am pleased to join with my colleagues in  observing  the 80th anniversary of Senator  Humphrey's birth. The public life of this great  man, spanning 33 years, made an  indelible  positive mark on the spirit of this nation.  When I think of Hubert Humphrey, I think of  a man who was an unfailingly honest politician  who did the very best he could to improve the  world. He was a man of integrity, of compas sion and of courage who fought hard for those  who are least able to fight for themselves. And  even when he lost, Hubert Humphrey kept on  fighting.  One of my favorite quotes, used in a speech  by Hubert Humphrey, epitomizes everything  for which this man stood:  It was once said that the moral  test of  Government is how that Government.treats  those who are in the dawn of life, the chil dren; those who are in the twilight of life,  the elderly; and those who are in the shad ows of  life-the sick,  the needy and  the  handicapped.  Humphrey continued,  Let America judge itself on  those stand ards, not on  the stock market alone; not  only on our gross national product, impor tant as  that is: not only on our material  wealth, but rather on those great idealistic  and spiritual values which sustain a nation  and which brought this nation into being.  Hubert Humphrey, coming out of a proud  and strong  tradition of Minnesota populism,  passed this moral test with  flying colors. His  concern and his work for the children, the el derly,  the  sick,  the  needy and  the devel opmentally disabled, made a significant dif ference in the lives of countless people across  this Nation.  As we search today as a nation for leader ship and  for solutions to our many pressing  domestic problems, we can  learn much  from  studying Hubert Humphrey's life. We can take  inspiration  from his commitment, his dedica tion, his perseverance, his true concern for the  needs of the less-fortunate and his unceasing  work in public service.  In whatever he did, he pursued excellence.  We are fortunate as a people that what Hubert  Humphrey chose to do was public service. In  reaching for the stars, he improved the lives of  many who lived in the shadows and set an ex ample for all of us to emulate.  ",1991
935,1539,12,Mr. RAMSTAD.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to ex press my  respect  for a great American and  great Minnesotan, the late Vice President Hu bert H. Humphrey.  All Minnesotans and all Americans owe Vice  President Humphrey a large debt of gratitude  for his 33 years of public service to our State  and Nation.  Most Minnesotans who are old enough  to  have known Hubert Humphrey have their fa vorite ""Humphrey story."" Mine involves a joint  recruiting effort on behalf of the University of  Minnesota football team following Humphrey's  return to the United States Senate.  I accompanied a young  17 -year-old high  school senior and his  family  from the Wash ington, DC area to Senator Humphrey's CaJr  itol office. Never will  I  forget  the  recruiting  pitch from the Senator:  Young man, the two greatest institutions  in this world are the United States Senate  and the University of Minnesota. I've been  part of both of these great institutions, and  so can you!  The young football prospect signed with the  University of Minnesota.  Hubert Humphrey's charm, wit,  humanity  and compassion are a great legacy for all of  us-Democrat or Republican,  liberal or con servative. He  truly cared about people.  It's  highly appropriate  that we honor Hubert H.  Humphrey on  this 80th anniversary of his  birth.  ",1991
936,1539,12,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Speaker, in political terms,  I was born and raised on Hubert Humphrey.  As an elementary school student  in 1960,  I  had reached an age when  I began to under stand about politics, and I was amazed that a  Senator from my own State was  running  for  the Presidency of  the United States. Four  years  later  in  junior high  I stayed up  late  watching our small screen black and white tel evision set as Hubert Humphrey was nomi nated for the Vice-Presidency of our country.  Even now I can remember how his speech en ergized the audience.  Hubert Humphrey  was  my  Presidential  choice as I attended my first DFL county con vention in 1972.  I had  the honor of meeting Hubert for  the  first time in 1976 when he and his wife Muriel  invited all of  the candidates  running  for  the  State senate  to  their  lakeside home  in Wa verly. He and Muriel took great delight in teas ing me about looking too young to be a can didate.  Later he returned to Minnesota to address  those of us who had been elected. I was sur prised that someone of his stature would take  the time  to become  involved  in a local issue  concerning whether to build a first-class sports  stadium  in Minnesota. He placed great em phasis on  the  importance of building a first class stadium, insisting that it would ""put Min nesota on the map"" and would be a sound in vestment  in Minnesota's  economic  future.  There was no need for Hubert to take a stand  on such a controversial issue, but few people  sitting in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome  today would disagree with his vision.  I continue to be proud that through the lead ership of Hubert Humphrey, millions of Ameri cans became  involved  in human  rights and  civil rights, and responded to the disabled and  the elderly.  I watched with admiration during  his last years in the U.S. Senate as he took  the lead on arms control and world hunger.  Although Hubert H. Humphrey was a leader  during some of America's most challenging  years, he never lost faith in our people or our  system of government. He was a tremendous  inspiration to me and other Minnesota Demo crats, and all of us can only hope that in some  small way we follow his example of leadership  and public service.  ",1991
937,1539,12,Mr. MINETA.," Mr. Speaker,  it is a genuine  pleasure  for me  to  join with my colleagues  here in the House in tribute to one of the fin est Americans ever to serve in the U.S. Con gress.  Hubert Humphrey was more  than  ""the  Happy Warrior,"" as he was known to his col leagues in The Other Body for his witty, tire less and determined speeches  ranging  from  promoting civil rights to protecting the elderly.  To me, Senator and Vice President Hubert  Humphrey was a great conscience of the Na tion, and a personal role model.  Mr. Speaker, the Hubert Humphrey Building  stands a short walk down Independence Ave nue  from  this Chamber. When  that building  was dedicated in 1977 as what is now home  to the Department of Health and Human Serv ices, Vice President Humphrey said, and  I  quote, ""It was once said that the moral test of  government  is how  that government  treats  those who are in the dawn of life, the children;  those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly;  and those who are in the shadows of life-the  sick, the needy and the handicapped.""  That was his philosophy of government: to  make government work, to do its job as reJr  resentatives of the people. Here in Washing ton, Hubert Humphrey fought that fight in the  1940's, 1950's, 1960's, and the 1970's.  Mr. Speaker, in the last years of public serv ice, even as he  fought a battle with cancer  that would ultimately claim his life, the spark of  his  ideals and his hope for the future of our  Nation never waned. He remained not only an  inspiration but a voice of reason and vision.  Those of us who grew up with his  ideals  can only hope  that his same spirit of public  service remains in our hearts and minds into  the next century. It is our loss that we can no  longer call upon his wisdom  to confront  the  new challenges  facing our Nation and our  world. But  I know  that  I have been all  the  more fortunate for having had the opportunity  to know and work with Hubert Humphrey, and  I know  that a grateful Nation will always re member him as one of the finest public serv ants of the people of the United States.  ",1991
938,1539,12,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank my colleagues in the Minnesota delega tion  for taking this time to pay tribute to one  of  this  country's most distinguished public  servants, Han. Hubert H. Humphrey.  On the occasion of our late colleague's 80th  birthday,  I am proud  to  join  in  this special  order to honor one Minnesota's most beloved  favorite sons and a great American.  I was privileged to call him a friend and  I  know how much public service meant to him.  He dedicated the great majority of his life to  serving the people of Minnesota as U.S. Sen ator and then as Vice President under Presi dent Lyndon Johnson.

939,1552,12,Mrs. COLLINS of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize and honor  the out standing work of 7-year-old Robert Berry of  Detroit. Little Robert took charge of a tense  and emotional situation when his mother went  into  labor at  their home. Hoping  that his  grandmother, who  lives  two  doors  away,  would assist, he called for her to come quick ly. When  the  grandmother  arrived,  she  promptly called 911  for assistance. However,  she panicked, handed  the phone  to Robert  and ran outside for air.  Robert  intently followed the directions of a  911  operator; he coached his mother and  calmed her down by  instructing her  to  take  deep breaths. This young man even retrieved  a blanket  for  the baby. The  911  operator  stayed on the line with Robert until the ambu lance arrived, about 7 or 8 minutes after a 7pound,  1-ounce  baby  girl made  her way  screaming into the world.  Young Robert  is earnest, caring, and  re sponsible. He took charge of a situation with out missing a beat. He  is a hero and a big  brother at the same time.  I'm sure his loved  ones will admire, respect, and cherish his love  for years to come.  During a  time of much concern over our  black youth, young Robert Berry reminds us  that our children are decisive, kind, helpful,  and loving.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask you and my fellow col leagues  to  join me  in saluting brave young  Robert Berry. Robert does not ask for recogni tion nor does he  look for it. He's helped his  mother in the past; when she fell  ill with epi lepsy he telephoned 911. His bravery serves  as a model for the Detroit community and for  America, a model of caring and responsibility.  CONGRATULATIONS, HEATHER  WALLING  HON.

This contest was sponsored by  the  Inde pendent Insurance Agents of America and is a  joint program of both  insurance companies  and agents' associations to promote insurance  training through a vocational education simula tion.  The  program  is  active  in  over  140  schools nationwide. All students participating  in this program had to submit an essay, and  Heather's essay was chosen as the best by a  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  committee consisting of insurance agency, as sociation, and company personnel.  Success has never been out of Heather's  reach. As a senior she was a member of the  Executive Committee  for Business Profes sionals of America and was elected secretary  of that same group at the regional level. After  graduating in June, she achieved the goal of  securing a full-time job with Nationwide Insur ance Company and feels that the Project In VEST program has prepared her for what lies  ahead in the future.  I am proud to have a person  like Heather  Walling  in my district.  I can only hope  that  other students will follow her lead and emulate  her sense of pride and dedication. I wish her  continued success in all of her future endeav ors.  THE ELECTION OF BORIS YELTSIN  TO THE PRESIDENCY OF THE RE PUBLIC OF RUSSIA  HON. JOHN J. RHODES III  OF ARIZONA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 10, 1991  ",1991
941,1552,12,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Speaker,  today, Boris  Yeltsin was formerly sworn in as President of  the Russian Republic of the Union of Soviet  Socialist Republics  [U.S.S.R.].  In  light of this  election, I am introducing a sense of the Con gress resolution congratulating both President  Boris Yeltsin and the people of the Republic of  Russia on  the  first democratic election  in a  millennium of Russian history.  Over 70  years ago, Russia was on  the  verge of a grave experiment, one that would  bring only death and destitution to the people  of that great nation.  Inaugurated by the likes  of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin, but with  other players such as Leon Trotsky, a pano rama of fear and hatred was  laid before the  nation for years to come.  With democratic elections having now taken  place in the Russian Republic, this generation long tragedy has hopefully come  to an end.  While the democratic election of Boris Yeltsin  represents the affirmation of the rights of the  individual to determine his or her future, it also  represents the triumph of the ideals of democ racy in a nation that previously had little expe rience with such an ideal.  If political democracy has emerged  in  the  Russian Republic, hopefully economic  liberty  will quickly  follow.  In his  inaugural speech,  President Yeltsin noted that one of his most  important priorities will be radical economic re form. Truly, this would represent another great  victory for the Russian people, who have the  richest of resources but  the poorest of sys tems to bring what they have to their tables.  Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's hand shake and speech congratulating the newly in augurated President of the Russian Republic  at his swearing  in ceremony  is a sign  that  Boris Yeltsin's program of reforms may  face  more cooperation in the  future than  it has  in  the past.  It also serves as a footnote  to the  extent  to which Soviet President Gorbachev  has acknowledged  the significance of Presi dent Yeltsin's election.  Clearly, all the ramifications of this election  cannot be discussed within the confines of a  July 10, 1991  legislative vehicle commemorating  the elec tion. Nevertheless, this concurrent resolution,  commemorating the election and congratulat ing all the people of Russia, serves to express  the sincere hopes of the Members of Con gress that this is but the first step in a march  toward integration into the Western World and  the brotherhood of nations  that make eco nomic liberty, political democracy, and human  rights the foundation of their government.  TEACHING AND REHABILITATING  OUR YOUTH [TROY]  HON. ILEANA ROS.LEHTINEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 10, 1991  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  I am  pleased to recognize the Teaching and Reha bilitating Our Youth Program [TROY]  for their  efforts to organize and create a system to aid  troubled youths in my district.  The TROY program was formed as a sup plement  to public  juvenile delinquency pro grams, reaching out to those youth who were  slipping through cracks in the system. Rather  than producing a study or a series of abstract  recommendations, they are working to  initiate  rapid and  fundamental change with demon strable concrete results. The TROY program  complements the efforts of the juvenile justice  system by  localizing the process of restoring  Miami's troubled youths.  On October 1, 1991, the group will  imple ment a five-part plan which consists of: One,  public awareness;  two,  residential programs;  three, non-residential programs and diversion;  four, mental health; and  five, advocacy and  mentoring. This course of action will coincide  with active support and involvement from var ious segments of  the community,  including  schools, colleges and universities, community based organizations, and the private sector.  The TROY program makes an important in vestment  in Miami's youth.  I commend  the  leadership of the TROY founders for support ing this important work. These include the pro gram's initial coordinators: Judge Tom Peter son, Jennifer Schuster, and Odalys Acosta.  Those  involved with  the HAS  include: Hon.  Janet McAiiley, Margaret  Hebson,  Roger  Cuevas, Joseph Mathos, Russ Wheately, John  Stepherson, Walter Odon, and Ellis Berger.  Those members involved with the State At torney's Office  include:  Leon  Botkin,  Kim  Daise, Steven Spencer, and Lynn Episcope.  Those affiliated with the Public Defender Of fice are: Steve Harper, Samira Ghazel, Odalys  Acosta, and Sandy Schwartz. Those involved  in  the JASS. Diversion are Shirley Almeida  and Jeanette Garcia.  In addition  those  in volved from the community include: Dr. Harry  Henshaw, Marc Schusheim, Barbara Hibson,  and Michelle Puldy-Berger. Other  founding  members not mentioned also  include: Judge  C. Edelstein, Dorothy Taylor, Paul Sweeney,  Seymour  Gelber,  Paul  Cromwell,  Judge  Robbie Barr, Steve  Leitman, Bertha Pitts,  Dagmar Peizer, Steve Applebaum, Charle  Jones, and Liz Perkins.  ",1991
942,1565,12,Mr. HUBBARD.," Mr. Speaker, I take this op portunity  to pay  tribute  to a  longtime, dear  friend of mine, Byron Presley Boyd, Sr., of Se dalia, KY, who died March 3, 1991, at Com munity Hospital in Mayfield, KY, at age 92.  For 33112 years Byron Boyd was  the effi cient, successful and  friendly postmaster at  Sedalia, KY. He  retired  from  that position  in  1968.  Byron Boyd's service to his community ex tended well beyond his work with  the U.S.  Postal Service. He was an active member of  the Sedalia Baptist Church where he served  on  the church's board of deacons. He also  was a member of the board of trustees of the  Mid-Continent Baptist Bible College, which  is  located in my hometown of Mayfield, KY.  He  is survived by his  lovely wife, Orma  Lassiter Boyd of Mayfield;  his  son, Byron  Boyd, Jr., of Cadiz, KY; a daughter, Carolyn  Herndon  of Greenville,  AL;  seven  grand children; and seven great-grandchildren.  I was very fond of and admired Byron Boyd,  Sr., and I miss him.  My wife, Carol,  joins me  in extending our  sincere sympathy to the family of Byron Boyd,  Sr.  RESTORING FUNDING FOR RURAL  ELECTRIFICATION  HON. GEORGE W. GEKAS  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 10, 1991  ",1991
943,1565,12,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  praise the continued work of the Rural Elec trification Administration. The REA has histori cally played a prominent role in assisting rural  electric cooperatives throughout Pennsylvania  in providing affordable electric services to rural  families and businesses.  I am gratified that the Appropriations Com mittee recently decided to restore funding for  REA  loans in the fiscal year 1992 Agriculture  appropriations bill. During  last year's budget  maneuvers REA loans were cut by 25 percent.  Many rural areas of my district in Pennsylva nia  rely both directly and  indirectly upon  in sured loans to the REA for reliable and com petitively priced electricity. The restoration of  the 25-percent cut  in  funding  for REA  loans  will help to alleviate an almost 2-year backlog  in loan applications.  I am pleased by such policy developments  which aid my rural constituents. However, I felt  that the fiscal year 1992 Agriculture appropria tions bill, H.R. 2698,  included  far  too many  frivolous expenditures. As our Nation struggles  to solve our present budget shortfalls Con gress must make  fiscally responsible  legisla tion its top priority. With this consideration as  my guide I voted against final passage of H.R.  2698. Though I support many of the provisions  contained within the Agriculture appropriations  bill, such as REA,  I  though  the overall bill  lacked  the degree of fiscal  responsibility our  present budget situation demands.  I look for ward to supporting a conference report for the  fiscal year 1992 Agriculture appropriations bill  that more accurately reflects the budget reali ties we now face.  H.R. 917  HON. JOSEPH M. GAYDOS  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 10, 1991  ",1991
944,1565,12,Mr. GAYDOS.," Mr. Speaker, H.R. 917,  the  Social Security Notch Adjustment Act of 1991  would end the monthly payment inequity cre ated by  the Social Security Amendments of  1977.  H.R. 917 targets relief to those retirees most  adversely affected-namely  those born be tween 1917 and 1921 who work after the age  of 61 and those born between 1919 and 1923  whose  benefits  are  lowest-the  so-called  notch babies.  Some people may  tell you  that eliminating  the payment injustice which affects the more  than 12 million notch babies would be  too  costly. Don't believe them.  ",1991
945,17,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Sen ator from Wisconsin.  HONORING JANE MCGHEE  ,1991
946,17,16,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to honor an outstanding member  of my Senate staff, a dedicated public  servant, and a dear personal friend.  Jane McGhee was well-known  to  many of the people who work here Senators and staff alike. She died on  August 23, and all of us will miss her a  great deal.  Jane's final years were not easy. She  suffered from debilitating cancer for 3  years, and her daily life was a contin ual battle with pain and dejection.  But Jane's last years gave us all a  true demonstration of her character her strength and her courage. Even  when she was staring death in the face,  her first  thoughts were always about  the needs and concerns of others. And  her dedication to the work of the U.S.  Congress remained as strong as it had  been when she was well.  None of us who knew Jane were sur prised by her perseverance. We knew  the kind of person  she was-an  in tensely loyal, smart, tough person who  was never afraid of hard work.  Jane was a perfect example of a per son taking command of her own des tiny. We  often  speak of  individuals  ""pulling  themselves up by  their own  bootstraps""-Jane  personified  this  quality.  Jane never had it easy. Jane built a  Washington career from scratch. It is a  great testimony to her intelligence and  hard work that she succeeded in mak ing herself an important presence  in  this great legislative body.  By  the  time she was 30,  Jane had  worked for Congressman Charles Wil son of California, served as D.C. office  manager of  the Metropolitan Water  District  of Southern California,  be came a  legal secretary and a  lobbyist  as well.  In 1981, I was starting my first term  as a U.S. Senator. One of my most im portant duties was the chairmanship of  the  Foreign Operations  Subcommit tee-and I needed to make sure that  my Foreign Operations staff was hard working and reliable.  I hired Jane that very first year in an  administrative capacity. I was so im pressed with her performance-and her  exceptional maturity-that  I  rapidly  promoted  her  to  professional  staff  work.  For 7 years, she was a mainstay of  the  Senate Appropriations Commit tee-a true master of the  legislative  process. She was unfailingly accurate  in performing the detailed work that is  required to finish a piece of legislation.  But Jane was not just an efficient  legislative  staffer. She was  in many  ways the heart of my staff-the person  who would reach out with genuine con cern to the poor, the handicapped, and  those suffering from health problems. I  decided in 1988  to broaden her legisla tive  responsibilities  to  include  these  human-needs issues.  It was shortly after I had promoted  her to this new legislative assistant po sition  that she was stricken by her  fatal illness. True to her character, her  chief concern remained the welfare of  others-her friends, her coworkers. and  the disadvantaged.  She kept her terrific sense of humor  to  the very end.  In fact,  the doctors  gave her only 18 months to live-but  she soldiered on for 3 whole years and  remained  a  central member  of my  Washington staff.  That is the kind of person Jane was.  I  remember when Silvio Conte came  over for her birthday party. all of us  were  concerned about  the extent  to  which her pain was hobbling her-but  she was more concerned about Silvio's  bout with cancer than her own losing  battle.  Mr. President, only in the very nar rowest sense was Jane McGhee fighting  a losing battle. She remained a terrific  person under the most painful of condi tions-giving all of us courage to face  the  less  difficult  challenges  of our  lives. None of us will forget her, or stop  cherishing her memory.  Jane McGhee was one of life's win ners-a member of the honor roll. May  she rest in peace.  Mr. President, allow me  to add a  brief note  for  the benefit of Jane's  many friends  in this Chamber: There  will be a memorial service for Jane at  St. Joseph's Catholic Church at 5 p.m.  tomorrow.  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.  ",1991

948,17,16,Mr.  PRESSLER.," Mr.  President,  I  want to make a few remarks regarding  a trip I took to the three Baltic States  during the recess. This trip had been  planned 6 months ago, long before the  exciting  events  that  have  occurred  there  took place.  I,  together with a  staff member from  the Foreign Rela tions Committee and one of my own  staff, visited Estonia, Latvia, Lithua nia, as well as Moscow, in late August.  I  am very happy  that  they have  achieved their independence, as I think  we all are. I might say that the state of  euphoria  in  those  countries  is very  high. I hope that euphoria does not de cline;  I hope  that euphoria does not  melt away.  There are some things we can do  to  help the Baltic States. I doubt that we  can come  forth with  the amount of  money that some of them hope for or  expect-and some are expecting sort of  a Marshall plan. I emphasized to them  that September  is  a  very  difficult  budgetary month in Washington, with  our budget year coming to an end on  September 30. Presently there is about  $25 million for all of the republics in  the  foreign  assistance  bill  that we  passed in the Senate. This is nothing  like a Marshall plan. However, I have  written to the President a letter urging  that  the U.S. Peace Corps be made  available to the Baltic States. They are  very much in need of technical assist ance, and the Peace Corps can provide  that help.  For example, as  they convert their  collective farms  to individual private  farms, they will need experienced fam ily farmers from  the Peace Corps, or  some  other  organization,  to  advise  them. As they go from the huge ma chines of the collective farms down to  50 horsepower tractors, as they move  from the large dairy and hog herds of  the collective farms down to 50-or 60cow herds or 100 head of swine, the con version process will be difficult. They  will need technical advice and assist ance to learn how to make economic  privatization work.  Also, they need small businessmen to  advise them. For example, they do not  have  the  tradition of small business men  keeping  accounts, working  to  make a profit, doing an annual report,  seeking investments, dealing with the  complications of having a partner, et  cetera. They will  need  experienced  small businessmen to advise  them on  how  to conduct  their businesses and  make free enterprise work, so to speak.  So there is a great role that could be  played in the Baltics by our Senior Ex ecutive Service Corps and  the Peace  Corps.  There are great expectations in the  Baltic States. People are on a high. It  was my privilege to attend a mass and  a celebration remembering those who  had died at the hands of communism.  Afterwards, I had lunch with the bish op  in Vilnius, Lithuania. The people  are hopeful. It was also my pleasure to  attend a major celebration at which  Vytautas Landsbergis, the President of  ",1991

965,30,16,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, it was with  great sadness that we learned over the  recess of the death of former Congress man Harley Staggers, Sr. This good  man from Keyser, WV, dedicated near ly half a century to public service, cul minating in a distinguished 32-year ca reer in the House of Representatives. I  was fortunate  to have served  in  the  House with Harley Staggers for 8 years,  and came to know him as a man of tre mendous  legislative  skill,  integrity,  and dedication to his constituents and  to his family. I am sure that many of  my Senate colleagues who also served  with him in the other body knew him  the same way.  Mr. President, I know all my Senate  colleagues  join me  in  sending  our  sincerest condolences to the late Con gressman's family,  and especially  to  Congressman HARLEY  STAGGERS,  JR.,  who currently serves the constituents  of  the  same district his  father  rep resented for so many .years.  THE DEATH OF GOV. RICHARD  SNELLING  ",1991
966,30,16,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, like many  Members in this body, I was a  friend  and admirer of Gov. Richard Snelling  of Vermont.  Governor Snelling was a remarkable  public servant, and his untimely death  this past August was a  tragic loss to  Vermont and to America.  During his nearly 9 years as Governor  of Vermont, Dick Snelling earned a  sterling reputation  for  integrity and  intelligence. He was one of America's  most vigorous advocates for fiscal re sponsibility and deficit reduction. He  had a no-nonsense businessman's ap proach which won the trust and respect  of the people of Vermont.  After four  terms as Governor, Dick  Snelling had every right  to continue  spending time with his wife and chil dren, and to avoid a return to the political arena. But in 1990, he saw that Ver mont's fiscal house was  in shambles,  and he felt it was his duty to do some thing about it. Vermont's voters recog nized again, as they had four times be fore,  that no one was better equipped  to deal with the situation than Dick  Snelling.  He quickly went to work, making the  tough decisions, calling them as he saw  them. And despite the fact that he pro posed and pushed through the biggest  tax  increase  in  the State's history,  polls before his death put his popu larity ratings at 65 percent.  In the final analysis, however, it is  principles, and not polls, that matter.  And Dick Snelling's principles and leg acy will live on in Vermont for many  years to come.  I know the entire Senate joins me in  extending our  sympathies  to Dick's  wife Barbara, and their four children.  I  thank the distinguished managers  of the appropriations bill  for  letting  me proceed.  LABOR,  HEALTH  AND  HUMAN  SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND  RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIA TIONS ACT, FISCAL YEAR 1992  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.  ",1991
967,30,16,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, just for  the information of Senators, the situa tion is this: We have before the Senate  the Labor, Health and Human Services,  and Education appropriations bill at  the present  time. As Senators may  know, the motion to proceed has been  agreed  to. However,  to accommodate  the wishes of Senator HELMS, we will  be  taking no action on  the bill  this  morning; only opening statements by  myself and Senator HATFIELD or others  who might want  to  come  over and  speak about the bill generally.  I understand that, sometime around  12:30, Senator HELMS will have a list of  the committee amendments  that he  wishes  to have excepted. That is the  time also at which the respective par ties hold  their caucuses. So  that  it  would appear there would be no action  on the bill until after the caucuses are  finished this afternoon. I  just wanted  to say that for the information of Sen ators.  Mr. President, at this point, I would  like to make my opening statement re garding the bill that is now before us,  some of the provisions that are in the  bill, and what this committee did dur ing  the year  to  reach  the point at  which we have arrived.  Right now, Mr. President, the bill be fore us has gone through a long process  which began with the submission of the  President's budget  on  February  4.  Since  that  time,  the  subcommittee  held 19 separate hearings to consider  the  administration's request  and  to  hear  from  approximately  150  public  witnesses.  ",1991
968,56,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The Sen ator from West Virginia, the President  pro tempore.  ",1991
969,56,16,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I  com pliment the Senator from Iowa for his  motives,  for  the objectives which he  seeks to reach, and for the issues that  have been raised by his amendment. I  think it is fine that we have this de bate at this time. I certainly find no  fault with the goals which the distin guished Senator  from  Iowa  has  in  mind.  I support those same goals. I support  those  same  programs. There  is  no  greater supporter in this body of pro grams to educate our young people. I  started out in a two-room schoolhouse,  and I had good teachers. I went to law  school here in the District of Columbia  for 10 years to get a law degree. I never  expected to practice law, but I merely  wanted to make myself a better Sen ator, a better Congressman, a better  Representative, a better man, a more  able individual.  I spent 10 years doing that. Nobody  made me do it. Nobody asked me to do  it. I was not forced to do it to keep my  seat in the House or in the Senate.  I still am trying to educate myself.  Nobody  tells me  that I have  to read  ""The Decline and Fall of the Roman  Empire"" by Gibbon, or the history of  Rome, or the history of Persia, or the  history of the Punic wars, or the his tory of the Peloponnessian wars. No body tells me that I have to read books  on Napoleon, or Alexander the Great,  or Hannibal. Nobody  tells me  that I  have to read Polybius' histories, or the  histories of Livy,  or  the  annals of  Tacitus. But I do so because I want to  improve myself. I want to further edu cate myself. I want to continue to edu cate myself. Nobody drives me  to do  that. The drive comes from within.  So I appreciate the need for educat ing our young people, making better  students out of them. The very first  thing I would suggest that be done to  make better students out of our young  people would be to throw the television  sets out,  throw  them out; encourage  our young people to read good books,  and not many good books, I would ven ture to say, have been written within  the last 50 years. I cannot say that au thoritatively, because I do not spend  much  time  reading books  that have  been written within the last 50 years.  But I would suggest  that our young  people read ""A Tale of Two Cities"" or  ""Two Yeats Before the Mast,"" or ""Rob inson Crusoe,"" for example.  Not everything can be healed or cor rected or rectified with money, but cer tainly we need to spend more money on  education. We need  to employ better  teachers. We need to provide the incen tives to teachers to stay on the job, to  stay in the profession, and to prepare  themselves so they can be good teach ers. I am not a teacher. But I have an  idea that we spend a great deal of time  training teachers how to teach, and not  training  them  enough  on what  to  teach. So much  for all of  that, Mr.  President.  I commend  the Senator from Iowa.  He is striving to do what he sees to be  best in the interest of our country. I  find no fault with him for that. He has  spoken about the investment gap, and  trying to do something about the in vestment gap. I commend him for that.  Mr. President,  the Senator who  is  presiding over the Senate at the mo ment,  the Senator from Georgia [Mr.  FOWLER], the Senator to my right here,  Mr. DOMENIC!, who has  just finished  speaking, the chairman of the Budget  Committee, Mr.  SASSER, who  spoke  earlier-all of us were at the summit.  We were  there.  I did not enjoy it. I  spent a  good many weekends,  some  Saturdays, some Sundays; long hours. I  did not enjoy it. But I had to do  it.  Somebody had to do it. So I tried to do  my part.  I spoke about the investment gap at  the summit. I made the fight there and  every  Senator whose  name  I  have  called here will attest  to  that  fact.  They made the fight,  too. They stood  with me. But they know that I made  that fight. I said to my colleagues and  to the representatives of the President  who were there, we are not only talk ing about balancing budgets but let us  take off our green eyeshades and un derstand that we are writing a 5-year  plan for the Nation, and we have an in vestment deficit. We not only have a  Federal  deficit-and  that  is  what  brought us to the summit-but we have  an investment deficit, a deficit in our  infrastructure,  in our physical  infra structure, roads, bridges, mass transit,  airports, waterways, and a deficit  in  our human  infrastructure, education,  health services, and so on. I made that  fight there where it was most difficult  to wage that fight and to hope to win.  So I say to my friend from Iowa, join  the club. I have walked those footsteps  ahead of him. I walked in that valley  at the summit. I am no Johnny-come lately to this argument about the in vestment deficit, the investment gap. I  stood up for it at the summit. What we  were able to get to help fill that invest ment gap, I will take some credit for  having waged the battle in the heat of  the day.  I had a broken sword, but I waged  that battle. The broken sword being,  we did not have enough money to go  around to do all of these things that we  would like to do. And the other part of  the broken sword was that I could not  have it all my way. We had the House  to deal with, we had the administra tion  to  deal with. But we  finally  reached an agreement.  I know there are those who say, well,  the agreement is no good. Many who  did not go  to the summit may think  that. They may say that. They pooh pooh the agreement. They criticize the  agreement. It is easy to criticize, but  not so easy to be constructive, not so  easy to put things together. It is easy  to break the eggs; it is easy to make a  swipe at the shelf and knock over the  vases,  the glasses, and  the cups, and  hear them as they shatter on the floor,  but not so easy to put the pieces to gether.  Well, Mr. President, I  take no back  seat  to anybody.  I do  not  like  the  agreement. I did. not get everything we  wanted.  I did not get everything we  need.  I would  like  to vote  for more  money  for  these programs  that  the  Senator has outlined here and very ap propriately called our attention to. I  would like to vote for his amendment,  but I am constrained because we have  an agreement. And why do we have to  have an agreement? Because we are in  one heck of a fix in this country. We  talk about giving to other countries,  giving aid to this country, that coun try, another country. We need first to  aid our own country. We need first to  aid our own people. We need first to  spend money on our own programs, our  own infrastructure, our own roads and  bridges, our own young people, our own  schools, our own health service, and on  our  own  houses. Charity  begins  at  home, but we are looking everywhere  else first to put our charitable dollar.  I am not against helping other coun tries. But  the American people  are  going to rise up and ask: ""When do we  get help? When are we going  to do  something about our schools, our high ways, our bridges, our houses? When  are we going  to do something about  them? Yet, you expect me as a  tax payer to continue to bleed and bleed  and bleed until  I become anemic  in  order that you might have  this pro gram for that part of the world, or that  program for another part of the world.  When do we count?"" the American peo ple will ask.  So, Mr. President, I cannot find fault  with the Senator for trying to get addi tional money for these programs. But  why did we go  to a summit? Why did  we have to reach an agreement? Memo ries are short. It is quite easy to forget,  in  this mad rush of  life. Every day  brings new problems.  ",1991

972,69,16,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, my  colleague from Iowa has proposed an  amendment that raises a difficult di lemma for me and many of my col leagues.  The domestic programs that receive  additional funds from this amendment  are programs I have supported in the  past, and continue to support.  However, we  need  to  look at  the  numbers. In the programs that will re ceive  additional  funds  from  this  amendment, most  have  already  re ceived significant  increases from  the  1991 fiscal year budget. Let's look at a  few of these programs for example.  The Ryan White AIDS program has  an increase of $69 million over the 1991  budget. That is a whopping 31-percent  increase over 1991. Now, my colleague  from  Iowa wants an additional $100  million for this program.  Head Start receives $250 million over  the 1991 budget in the committee's pro posal. That  is 12.8 percent over  last  year. This amendment would increase  that amount by an additional $900 mil lion.  Immunization  receives  $60 million  more than the 1991 budget, an increase  of 27.7 percent over last year's budget.  This amendment would  increase  that  amount an additional $250 million.  ",1991
973,95,16,Mr.  SARBANES.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation to  establish  a  National  Fallen  Fire fighters Foundation.  The  purposes  of  this  foundation  would be to support the National Fall en Firefighters Memorial, to help fund  the annual memorial service to honor  firefighters who have died in the line of  duty,  to assist  the families of fallen  firefighters, and  to support other ef forts around the Nation to honor these  heroes.  The National Memorial,  located on  the campus of the National Fire Acad emy in Emmitsburg, MD, was built by  the Federal Emergency Management  Agency and dedicated  in October of  1981. The monument is a bronze sculpture of a Maltese Cross, a  traditional  symbol of the fire service, on a 7-foot  pyramid of limestone. It is surrounded  by plaques listing those who have died  in service to their communities.  As my colleagues will  recall,  last  year the Congress passed a joint resolu tion I had introduced to designate this  striking monument as the official na tional memorial  to volunteer and ca reer firefighters who die in the line of  duty. That resolution was signed on  August 9, 1990, as Public Law 101-347.  The Fire Academy has always done  an outstanding job in maintaining the  memorial and coordinating the annual  service. Few public events are more  moving than this service that gathers  the families of fallen firefighters from  across the country together on the Fire  Academy grounds. Joined by represent atives of each of the national fire serv ice organizations, the families mourn  their losses while celebrating the he roic actions of their loved ones.  Mr. President, we Americans don't  pause often enough to think about the  enormous sacrifice that the fire service  makes to protect our lives and prop erty. When I joined in rededicating the  memorial last October 13, I quoted an  editorial  from  the  Carroll  County  Times that I would like to read again:  We take too many aspects of life for grant ed. Not thinking about a  service until we  need it is an easy way to think ... But how  often do we actually consider that at a mo ment's notice, our firefighters will risk their  lives for us? Until the tragedy of a  fire or  some other emergency  strikes, we hardly  consider it at all.  The foundation  that my  legislation  would establish would allow  individ uals and organizations to honor these  fallen heroes and assist their families  by making  voluntary  donations. A  major redesign of  the memorial site  will be needed  in a  couple of years  when all of the plaque spaces are filled.  The foundation could support that im portant  effort  and  the  associated  relandscaping.  Even more importantly, the founda tion would fund the annual memorial  service which cannot be paid for with  appropriated funds. The service grows  each year-more than 1,000 people are  expected this October 13  to honor the  105 firefighters who lost their lives in  the line of duty during 1990. Funding is  desperately needed to cover everything  from travel expenses for participating  musicians  to flags  to present  to  the  families of each fallen firefighter.  From time to time, a family misses  the service because of limited financial  resources or sends just one family rep resentative because of prohibitive trav el and lodging costs. While some fire  departments  are  able  to  help with  these  expenses, many  cannot.  The  foundation would help ensure that each  spouse and child who wants to attend  the service is financially able to do so.  My  bill would  also  permit  other  forms of financial assistance, such as  ",1991
974,108,16,Mr.  LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today  to pay  tribute  to  the  re cently  opened  Frances Aiello  Day  Treatment Center in Brooklyn, NY.  It is my pleasure to share with all of  my colleagues the news that there are  still individuals such as Danny, Rose,  Joe, and Gloria Aiello, and organiza tions such as  the Catholic Guardian  Society of Brooklyn and Queens [CGS],  who are dedicated  to enhancing and  improving  the  lives of  those around  them.  Mr. Danny Aiello, who has brought  all of us joy through the characters he  has portrayed in his movies, has pro vided the CGS with the means and op portuni ty  to  provide  a  second  day  treatment program for adults with de velopmental  disabilities.  The Aiello  Center is a place where the adult par ticipants,  including multiple  handi capped and nonambulatory individuals,  can learn and grow and provide fellow ship to each other.  Frances Aiello, for whom the center  is named, taught her children by exam ple. She taught them to be kind and  generous,  to persevere  through  life's  struggles, and to try their hardest to  achieve their fullest potential despite  life's difficulties. Her children, in turn,  are sharing this philosophy with others  through the center. The Aiello family's  generous commitment to their commu nity reminds me of a passage from ""I  Shall Not Pass This Way Again"":  Through this toilsome world, alas!  Once and only once I pass;  If a kindness I may show,  If a good deed I may do  To a suffering fellow man,  Let me do it while I can.  No delay, for it is plain  I shall not pass this way again.-(Author un known.)  The Catholic Guardian Society of  Brooklyn and Queens is devoted full time  to  fostering  self-esteem  in  the  adult participants. There is no greater  lesson to learn than to value one's own  self-worth. There can be  few greater  gifts  than  to  provide  a  community  where this can be achieved. We can all  be inspired by their example. I am sure  Frances Aiello would approve.   BRADLEY IS OUT FRONT ON CIVIL  RIGHTS   ",1991

976,134,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Sen ator from Colorado is recognized.  ,1991
977,134,16,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to offer an amendment that will  allow the members of this body to take  a step in meeting the priorities we set  for ourselves when we passed the fiscal  year 1992 budget resolution.  In May, the Senate passed the budget  resolution which  included  the home front budget initiative which called for  an additional $4.4 billion  for proven  cost-effective  education  and  family  health  programs  to  reestablish  our  children and our future as our coun try's top budget priori ties. With strong  bipartisan support, we set some prior i ties. We said that it is important for  the Federal Government to support the  critical programs that help kids be pre pared to learn. We said that it is im portant for the Federal Government to  support valuable, time-tested programs  in education. We made a choice. We  said that our kids deserve our support.  Mr.  President,  the Appropriations  Committee has one of  the most dif ficult  jobs  in  the Senate. Under  the  leadership of  the President pro  tem pore,  the committee must weigh  the  merits and make tough choices in fund ing many worthwhile programs. But,  Mr. President, it is also my belief is  that  the priorities  set  forth  in  the  budget  resolution-and agreed  to by  the whole Senate-should act  as  a  guide  to  the  appropriators  as  they  carry out their difficult and important  work during the remainder of the fiscal  year. But while  the Appropriations  Committee was able  to make  some  positive gains for excellent programs especially Head Start-unfortunately,  this bill falls more than $2 billion short  of the goals set in the homefront budg et initiative.  That is why I am offering an amend ment along with Senator HARKIN, and  RUDMAN  to retrieve a portion of the  funding levels set by the homefront ini tiative. This amendment  includes an  additional $310 million  for education  and child heal th, and $200 million for  the Low-Income Heating Energy As sistant Program. Our amendment fo cuses on several important programs:  It includes $152 million for chapter 1,  the formula-based program  that goes  to school districts that have children  below the poverty line. The majority of  the  funds go  toward providing addi tional services  in reading, math and  language  outside  the  classroom  for  about 30 minutes each day. These funds  will assist in meeting the educational  needs of disadvantaged children with  low achievement records.  It  includes $62 million  for  supple mental educational opportunity grants  that provide assistance to undergradu ate students in financial need. Nearly  40 universities and technical schools in  Colorado participate in  the program,  including Regis, CU, Adams State, Col orado  Mountain  College,  Western  State, and Colorado College.  It includes $20 million for the TRIO  Program which identifies qualified stu dents who are the first in their family  to attend college and prepares and sup ports  them  to  continue  their  edu cation. Colorado alone has 23 outstand ing TRIO projects serving more  than  13,000  students-students  that  could  very well just fall through the cracks if  these services were not provided.  It includes $60 million for vocational  education-$50 million for basic grants  and $10 million  for supplemental-to  provide critical  technical  training so  that our young people can be prepared  for the challenges of the workplace in a  competitive world economy. If we are  serious  about making  the  United  States more competitive in the world  economy, a focus must be placed on de veloping more fully the academic and  occupational skills necessary to work  in a technologically advanced society.  includes  $4 million  for  inter national education  to allow our stu dents to participate in comprehensive  language and international studies pro grams-skills  that are  critical  in a  global  economy.  These  programs,  which I know are working in the State  of Colorado, only help to broaden hori zons and to increase our competitive ness.  It includes $2 million for impact aid  construction grants for school districts  that are aversely impacted by the lack  of revenue as a result of Federal owner ship of property within that district.  It includes $10 million for childhood  immunizations to ensure our children  are healthy and ready  to  learn. Mr.  President,  I would  like  to add right  here  that I am flabbergasted  that in  this Nation, we  do not provide  the  most cost-effective piece of preventa tive medicine to all our children. The  cost  savings of providing  immuniza tions  is so extraordinarily clear-and  think about it, we can make sure that  kids do not get some diseases,  that  they can have fuller lives. We have sup ported research to develop these vacIt  cines, and then we do not provide the  means to ensure that all who can bene fit from that research, do benefit.  We hear it often, because we say it  often-but each of these programs is a  proven, cost-effective investment. Why  then should we not support this amend ment?  This amendment  takes  the unused  budget authority  left under  the sub committee's allocation and makes it  usable by allocating it to forward fund ed education programs. The amend ment does not require an offset from  any other program in the bill. All of  the $310 million for education and child  health programs will outlay in fiscal  year 1993. Since the subcommittee is at  its outlay ceiling and not at its budget  authority ceiling, deferring the outlays  for  this amendment to September 30,  1992, ensures that no program in the  bill will be adversely affected.  Mr. President, if we in the Senate are  to  continue  talking about  improve ment for our Nation's system of edu cation and the welfare of our children  we must go beyond promises of na tional  testing and  student vouchers  and provide  the funding necessary  to  ensure all of our students get the best  possible education.  Last year, the Nation embarked on a  decade-long  effort  to  improve  edu cation. We have set ambitious, yet at tainable goals. Achieving  them will  play a major role in reinvigorating our  economy and recapturing our position  in the world market. If we fail to have  the best educated and most  skilled  work force, our position in the world  economy will continue to decline and  our society will never be able to shed  the costs of untrained workers-who  strongly wish  to work but for whom  there are simply no jobs for which they  are qualified.  But we cannot merely demand  re sults-we must provide  the means  to  attain them.  When  the President presented  his  education strategy to the Congress and  the Nation,  I could not help but feel  that while some of his  ideas deserve  thoughtful  consideration,  something  obvious is missing.  If we were  fully  funding programs  that are proven and cost-effective, and  that meet  the needs of the students,  would not we now have a country that  was closer  to meeting the goals out lined by the administration? If every  Federal commitment were  filled and  every eligible child served, would not  we have progressed more than we have?  Certainly  there are  changes  to be  made and certainly we need to reinvig orate the system, but I say we have to  also  support  the programs we  know  work. I disagree with the President: I  say good can come from new money in  education-new money devoted to the  programs  that have  served  students  well. We  just need  to serve more of  them.  ",1991
978,147,16,Mr.  SIMON.," Mr.  President, more  than 2 years ago, after a series of hear ings on  the problem of illiteracy  in  America, I introduced a bill to launch  the first, real coordinated Federal ef fort to address the problem. On July 25,  the National Literacy Act finally be came law. I thank my colleague from  Iowa for working with me on this legis lation  in  the authorizing committee,  and  I am pleased  that, with his co operation  and  the  help  of Senator  BYRD, most of the new efforts and in creased authorizations in the literacy  bill will  be  considered  in  the  con ference on the appropriations bill.  ",1991
979,147,16,Mr. HARKIN.,"  I  commend my col league from Illinois for his leadership  on  this  issue,  and  I  thank him  for  working with me  to ensure  that we  provide  the  resources  necessary  to  reach the bill's goal of eliminating il literacy by the year 2000.  Start-up funds for the National Insti tute for Literacy, the linchpin of the  new Federal effort, are provided for in  the  national  programs  fund  of  the  Adult Education Act. In addition, the  managers  have  accepted  the  Simon  amendment to fund the new State lit eracy resource centers, a critical link  between literacy providers at the local  level and the National Institute.  The  literacy  bill  also  authorized  funding for the development of family  literacy  television  programming. As  my colleague has pointed out in  the  past, people tend to hide the fact that  they can't read or write, just as people  used to be embarrassed about their dis abilities.  Television  programming  aimed at adults and families can be one  of our most effective tools in address ing this problem.  I should also point out that, as the  Senator knows, this bill contains an in crease for  the Corporation for Public  Broadcasting. CPB has been instrumen tal in developing quality literacy pro gramming, and we hope  that it will  continue its fine record in this area.  Illiteracy costs our Nation billions of  dollars  in  lost productivity.  In  the  committee report for  the bill we are  considering  today, we urged  the Sec retary  of Labor  to  use her discre tionary funds to move forward on the  National Workforce Literacy Collabo rative  in  the National Literacy Act.  This program would assist smalland  medium-sized businesses and labor or ganizations  in  implementing  literacy  programs for individuals with low basic  skills. Now  that the literacy bill has  become  law,  the committee strength ens that recommendation, and directs  the Secretary to begin this important  effort.  Finally, Mr. President, my colleague  from Illinois has authored some signifi cant improvements and expansions to  three current Federal programs: Adult  Education, Workplace Literacy Part nerships, and Even Start-now called  Even Start Family Literacy to reflect  its new focus. These changes will en sure that we are getting the most from  our Federal dollars.  ",1991

981,147,16,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr.  President,  I  wish to draw the Senate's attention to  one provision of the manager's amend ment package; and I wish to thank my  very good friend and colleague, Senator  HARKIN, and his staff for their help in  clearing this amendment. The Senator  from  Iowa has a very, very difficult  job, with many worthy and critical de mands  on  the  limited  resources  he  must allocate, and I greatly appreciate  his willingness to work with me on this  amendment.  This amendment  is  a  simple  one,  with an  important purpose.  It would  transfer $10 million from  the Depart ment of Health and Human Services'  Office of the Inspector General to the  Department of Education for its newly  expanded prison literacy and life skills  training grant program.  This minor expansion of the Federal  Goverment's commitment  to  prison  education  was  recently  authorized  through an amendment to the National  Literacy Act. I helped craft the amend ment with my good  friends and col leagues, Senators KENNEDY and PELL,  and our colleagues in the House, Rep resentatives  GINGRICH,  KILDEE,  and  GOODLING.  Mr. President, the issue of prison lit eracy programs is a familiar one to my  colleagues. In July, we debated and ap proved a modified version of an amend ment I offered to S. 1240,  the Violent  Crime Control Act of 1991, that is near ly identical to the program authorized  under the National Literacy Act. That  amendment authorized  the Attorney  General to make grants to State and  local correctional agencies and correc tional education entities to help them  establish and operate literacy and life  skills training programs in their pris ons, jails, and detention centers.  The amendment we approved to the  National Literacy Act creates the same  authorization within  the Department  of Education. But approving and pass ing authorizing legislation does not ac complish anything if that legislation is  not funded. That is why I am advocat ing adoption of this amendment today.  If we really meant what we said ear lier this summer about getting tough  on crime and making our streets safer,  then today is the day to put our money  where our mouth  is.  I urge my col leagues to support this amendment.  As I mentioned earlier, this amend ment shifts $10 million to the Depart ment of Education from  the Depart ment of Health and Human Services'  Office of the Inspector General. I be lieve this shift makes sense: It is much  wiser, in my mind, to make more fund ing available to help the States deal ef fectively with  the problems of crime  and  illiteracy,  than  to  increase  the  Federal bureaucracy. This amendment  sends the clear message to the Amer ican people that the Senate is serious  about reducing bureaucracy,  that we  are serious about our commitment to  fighting crime, and that we are serious  about  achieving  the President's na tional education goals, which he and  the Nation's Governors established 2  years ago.  The fifth goal of the national edu cation goals states:  [E]very adult American should be literate  and possess  the knowledge and skill nec essary to compete in a global economy and  exercise  the rights and  responsibilities of  citizenship.  This goal includes individuals incar cerated in our Federal and State pris ons. And this amendment is a small but significant-step toward achieving  that goal.  I am convinced that education will  reduce  recidivism and  that  the pro grams this amendment will help fund  will ultimately benefit our national  economy and reduce the level of fear of  crime that exists in America today.  Currently, more than 620,000 individ uals are  incarcerated  in  the United  States. Most cannot read or write. In  fact,  today's inmate population  rep resents the Nation's single largest con centration of illiterate adults: A full 60  percent-372,000  individuals-are  func tionally illiterate.  ",1991

SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ""High-Perform ance Computing Act of 1991 "".  SEC 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  (a) The Congress finds the following:  (1) Advances  in computer science and  tech nology are vital to the Nation's prosperity, na tional and economic security, and scientific ad vancement.  (2)  The United States  currently  leads  the  world in the development and use of high-per ! ormance computing for national security,  in dustrial productivity, and science and engineer ing, but that lead is being challenged by foreign  competitors.  (3)  Further  research and development,  ex panded educational programs,  improved com puter  research  networks, and more  effective  technology  transfer from government to  indus try are necessary for the United States to fully  reap  the benefits of high-performance comput ing.  (4) Several Federal agencies  have ongoing  high-performance computing programs, but im proved  interagency  coordination, cooperation,  and planning could enhance the effectiveness of  these programs.  (5) A 1989 report by the Office of Science and  Technology Policy outlining a research and de velopment strategy for high-performance com puting provides a framework for a multi-agency  high-performance computing program.  (6) Such a program would provide American  researchers and educators with  the computer  and information resources they need, while dem onstrating how advanced computers, high-speed  networks, and electronic data bases can improve  the national information infrastructure for use  by all Americans.  (b) It is the purpose of Congress in this Act to  help ensure  the continued  leadership of  the  United States  in high-performance computing  and  its applications. This  requires  that  the  United States Government(1) expand Federal support for research, de velopment, and application of high-performance  computing in order to( A) establish  a  high-capacity national  search and education computer network;  (B) expand  the number of researchers, edu cators, and students with training in high-per f ormance computing and access to high-perform ance computing resources;  (C) develop an information infrastructure of  data bases, services, access mechanisms, and re search  facilities which  is  available  for  use  through such a national network;  (D)  stimulate  research  on  software  nology;  (E) promote the more rapid development and  wider distribution of computer software  tools  and applications software;  ( F) accelerate  the development of computer  systems and subsystems;  (G) provide for  the application of high-per ! ormance computing to Grand Challenges; and  (H)  invest  in basic  research and education;  and  (2) improve planning and coordination of Fed eral research and development on high-perform ance computing.  tech re SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.  As used in this Act, the term(1) ""Director"" means  the Director of the Of fice of Science and Technology Policy; and  (2) ""Council"" means the Federal Coordinating  Council  for Science, Engineering, and Tech nology chaired by  the Director of the Office of  Science and Technology Policy.

990,173,16,Mr. FORD.," Mr. President,  I would  like to join my colleagues in support of  the High-Performance Computing and  National Research and Education Net work Act of 1991. The legislation being  considered  today  is actually a  com bination of two bills. S. 343, introduced  by Senator JOHNSTON, and S. 272, intro duced by Senator GORE, were combined  to form this amendment. I cosponsored  both bills.  I know that both Senator  JOHNSTON  and  Senator  GORE  have  worked hard on this issue to produce  this compromise.  I sit with Senator GORE on the Com mittee  on Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation. He has held quite a few  hearings over there on his bill. Senator  JOHNSTON'S bill was  referred  to  the  Committee on Energy and Natural Re sources and has been before  the Sub committee on Energy Research and De velopment, which I chair. We  too have  held hearings.  This  is  an  important  issue.  The  supercomputer industry is one of the  few  technologies where  this country  still has the lead. But that lead is slip ping away. We can keep that lead with  just a little more effort by the Federal  Government.  So, I am pleased that the Commerce  Committee and the Energy Committee  have been able  to put their bills  to gether to establish such an effort. This  ",1991
991,199,16,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER., Who  yields time? The Senator from Florida.  ,1991
992,199,16,Mr. GRAHAM., Will the Senator from  Kansas yield for a question?  ,1991
993,199,16,Mrs. KASS EBA UM., I will be happy to  do so.  ,1991
994,199,16,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President,  I am  concerned about the State preemption  provision. The Senator used the term  ""applicable in the State after the date  on which a referendum or initiative has  been  held.""  Is  that  phrase  broad  enough  to  include a State constitu tional amendment which was adopted  by popular vote?  ",1991
995,199,16,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr.  President,  yes, it does. I have checked that with  those who have greater knowledge. The  language of my amendment provides  for  that protection.  I know  that has  been a question in Florida as well as in  California.  ",1991
996,199,16,Mr. GRAHAM.," The second question  is,  in  that  State  concerning  cir cumstances under which abortions may  be provided, in my State, by constitu tional amendment, we have adopted a  State right of privacy which the Su preme Court of our State has  inter preted relative to its applicability to a  parental consent statute. Would it be  the Senator's understanding that our  State constitutional provision would  be the governing provision in Florida  and gain the benefit of this overriding  Federal  law which  the Senator pro vides?  ",1991
997,199,16,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr.  President,  again, it is my understanding that the  language would allow for States' con stitutional law to prevail.  ",1991

1004,199,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Sen ator from Indiana.  ,1991
1005,199,16,Mr. COATS.," Mr. President, the Sen ator  from Kansas and  I have had a  number of discussions about this par ticular issue. There is no doubt in my  mind that she shares my concern for  the plight of a young girl who  finds  herself in a difficult situation. We have  had some difference of opinion as  to  the basis on which parents ought to be  notified. There is no doubt in my mind  that the Senator from Kansas believes  that  that  is preferable. What she  is  concerned about are exceptional si tua tions where notification of a parent  might result in some physical harm,  emotional abuse, or some other thing  that is detrimental to that child.  My only concern with this particular  amendment is that the exemption for  physical  or  emotional  threat  to  a  minor is such that, one, there may be a  lot of loopholes for someone who does  not want that minor to notify her par ents to use  that as an excuse not to  when, in fact, I  think we would both  agree that notification in almost every  instance is probably preferable.  My other concern is that notification  may be denied on the basis of someone  who  is very broadly defined,  for  in stance,  there  is an alcoholic  in  the  house, and so forth, and that is not re ported. If a  child comes  to a prof es sional and says, ""I don't want you to  tell my parents that I'm going to have  an  abortion because  I might  suffer  physical violence or because I am the  victim of incest or abuse,"" and that is  not reported  then  to  the authorities,  sure, the child may go ahead and have  the abortion, but no one  is notified  that a potentially dangerous situation  exists within  that  family or within  that family circumstance.  So the failure to report that to the  authorities so they can follow up with  counseling, help, whatever, I think is a  major problem of this amendment.  I  am concerned that in agreeing to it, we  are not dealing with a situation that  ought  to be dealt with.  I  thank  the  Senator from Oklahoma for yielding to  me.  ",1991
1006,199,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Sen ator from Oklahoma.  ,1991
1007,199,16,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, let me  just comment on Senator KASSEBAUM's  amendment.  I  plan to  support  this  amendment. It does not do as much as  what  I had hoped  to do  under my  amendment, or even under  the Coats  amendment that we voted on before.  But I happen to think it is better than  nothing.  I want to notify parents that their  children are in a difficult situation if  they happen to be pregnant. I think the  parent should be involved in that deci sion. They should be involved in trying  to help their kids.  I  think  in some circumstances  the  amendment of the Senator from Kan sas will do  that. It will not do it as  1985.  many times as my amendment would  do it, and it will not do it in certain  States, not as many States.  Again, I happen to be a supporter of  States rights, but I also think if they  are  rece1 vmg  Federal  funds  there  should be  some  strings attached  to  those  funds. We did not win on my  amendment.  I  appreciate  that;  I  re spect that.  I  compliment my  colleague  from  Kansas. I think her amendment is cer tainly better than nothing, and I hope  that the Senate will agree to it by an  overwhelming vote.  ",1991
1008,199,16,Mr. KOHL.," Mr.  President,  section  146.78 of the Wisconsin statutes was en acted as part of  the omnibus Preg nancy Prevention and Family Respon sibility Act-Act 56,  It states,  among other things,  that health care  professionals who  provide  abortions  must strongly encourage a minor  to  discuss her pregnancy  and proposed  abortion with her parents. Medical pro viders must inform the young woman  that, if she requests,  the county will  provide a social worker to accompany  her in discussing the situation with her  parent&--Wisconsin Statutes 46.24.  Is my understanding correct that due  to this existing Wisconsin legislation,  under  this proposed amendment,  the  title X grantee in Wisconsin would be  exempt from the requirements as out lined in the amendment?  ",1991
1009,199,16,Mrs. KASSEBAUM., Yes; that is cor rect.  ,1991
1010,199,16,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to clarify the effect of sub section (b) of the amendment proposed  by the Senator from Kansas.  It is my understanding that the re quirements of section (a) of the amend ment would not be applicable in any  State which has  enacted  legislation  concerning  the  conditions  or  cir cumstances under which abortions may  be provided to unemancipated minors.  A number of States, including Califor nia, have enacted  legislation  in  this  area which has been enjoined by State  or Federal  courts or otherwise not  being enforced. In the case of Calif or nia,  such State  legislation has been  held to violate provisions of the State  constitution, American Academy of Pedi atrics v. Van De Kamp, 263 Cal. Rpt. 46  (1989). Does  the Senator from Kansas  agree  that  the  requirements of sub section  (a) of  the amendment would  thus not be applicable in a State such  as California?  ",1991
1011,199,16,Mrs. KASSEBAUM., Yes.  ,1991
1012,199,16,Mr. WIRTH., The  situation  in  the  State of Colorado is the same. A State  law dealing with this issue has been en joined.  ,1991
1013,199,16,Mr. ADAMS., That is the case in the  State of Washington as well.  ,1991
1014,199,16,Mrs. KASSEBAUM., Then subsection  (a) of the amendment would not be ap plicable in Colorado or Washington or  any other similarly situated State.  ,1991
1015,199,16,Mr. CRANSTON., I thank the Senator  from Kansas for her responses.  ,1991
1016,212,16,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I would  like to ask the distinguished floor lead er a question on the Rural Health Out reach Demonstration  Program  con tained in the Labor, Health and Human  Services  appropriations bill.  I  com mend my colleague from Iowa for his  leadership  in  funding  this  important  program for the first time last year.  In its fiscal year 1991 Labor, Health  and Human Services,  and Education  appropriations  bill, Congress  funded  the Rural Health Outreach Grant Pro gram at $20 million. This year, the Sen ate  appropriations  bill  contains  $25  million for  the program. This unique  grant program requires application by  coalitions of existing providers in truly  rural, underserved areas. Certain appli cants,  however,  from  geographically  large  counties with  relatively  small  total populations and a semiurban out lying area were ineligible for the grant  competition due to their being located  in  a  metropolitan  statistical  area  [MSA].  ",1991
1017,212,16,Mr. HARKIN.," I am aware of this situ ation. It is my understanding that the  Department  of Health  and Human  Services [HHS], Office of Rural Health  Policy  is  currently  refining  their  guidelines on MSA status  to  include  these counties. The Office  of Rural  Health Policy plans to have their refor mulated guidelines prepared for the fis cal year 1992 competition for the rural  outreach program.  ",1991
1018,212,16,Mr. GRAHAM.," Counties across  the  Nation fall  into this category. Collier  County is the State of Florida's largest  county in geographical size and is lo cated in the southwest portion of the  State. Ninety percent of the county's  population  resides within  the Naples  area. The remaining 10 percent of the  county's population resides in the town  of Immokolee, an  inland,  rural, mi grant  worker  community  situated  roughly 40 miles northeast of Naples.  Nearly 30 percent of the Immokolee  population is comprised of migrant and  seasonal  laborers with special heal th  care needs. About 85 percent of  the  Immokolee households have  incomes  below 200 percent of the Federal pov erty level. At least 80 percent of these  individuals are uninsured and many  suffer agricultural  injuries which are  work related.  Collier  County's  application  was  deemed  ineligible for  the grant com petition due to its status as an MSA.  Ironically, the county's application addressed the exact health service needs  in precisely the sort of nonurban set ting for which the Rural Health Out reach Grant Program was intended.  Is it the feeling of the Senator that  Collier County would be  included  in  any new guidelines which HHS puts  forth?  ",1991
1019,212,16,Mr. HARKIN.," Yes, that is my under standing.  TRANSPLANT FUNDING  ",1991
1020,212,16,Mr. GORE.," Mr. President,  I would  like  to ask  the Senator a  question  about  the  level of funding  for organ  transplants contained in the commit tee's bill.  As the report accompanying the bill  notes,  the  $3,387,000  included  is  $1,750,000  less than the House amount  and $336,000 less than last year's sum. If  enacted, it would provide only $250,000  for the grant and contract program au thorized by section 371 of the Public  Heal th  Service Act.  This  program,  which  the Congress  just  refashioned  last year, is the heart and soul of our  ability  to  attack  the  still  growing  organ shortage.  Despite a  record 15,162  solid organ  transplants performed in 1990,  the list  of those waiting for  transplants also  increased that year to a record 22,008.  As  the Senator knows, since Iowa is  one of the Nation's leaders  in trans plant surgery, as many as a quarter to  a third of all Americans on transplant  waiting lists for hearts,  livers,  lungs,  and heart and lungs, die before a trans plantable organ  is found. This situa tion is all the more tragic because the  evidence tells us that we can still dou ble the number of donors by insuring  that all organ procurement organiza tions  [OPO's] are as effective as  the  most effective OPO's. That is what the  section 371 grant and contract program  was redesigned to do.  Can the Senator tell me whether it is  his intent, and that of the committee,  to recede to the House position which  provides $2,000,000  for  the section 371  grant and contract program?  ",1991
1021,212,16,Mr. HARKIN.," I thank the Senator for  bringing this matter to our attention. I  value his expertise in this area and ap preciate his explanation of the impor tance of the section 371 grant and con tract program in addressing the organ  shortage.  I know the Senator is also aware of  several recent studies, including one by  the Office of Inspector General, that il lustrate that many inequities still dog  the national transplant system. For ex ample in that study it was shown that  African-Americans wait almost  twice  as  long  for kidneys as white Ameri cans. How are we addressing that prob lem?  ",1991
1022,212,16,Mr. GORE.," Mr. President, that is an other example of the type of problem  that must be urgently addressed, that  will only be addressed if there is suffi cient funding in the grant and contract  program. Minority  families currently  are also far less likely to give permis sion for organ donation. We must do  more to understand why African-Amer icans wait  longer  for  kidney  trans plants, why their families are less sup portive of organ donation, and what  can do done about it.  Last year we changed the section 371  grant and contract program to expand  its focus  to include problems such as  these. Rut I'm afraid that at the level  of funding that is now in the bill before  us,  the Division of Organ Transplan tation will  lack  the  resources  nec essary to start solving these problems.  The $2,000,000 contained in  the House  bill is still less than half what we au thorized, but would in my view be ade quate to make progress on some of the  key problems still plaguing our na tional transplant system.  ",1991
1023,212,16,Mr. HARKIN.,"  I appreciate  the Sen ator's further explanation. I would say  to him that given  the importance of  this program, and the fact that with  last year's changes it appears  to be  truly on the verge of helping us solve a  number of critical  transplant related  problems, I would like to be able to in crease funding and make certain that  the added money goes to support the  section 371 grant and contract program  as revised by  the Congress  last year  with instructions to insure that more  is done  to  remove  the  inequities re vealed  in  the  inspector general's re port.  ",1991
1024,212,16,Mr. GORE., I am very pleased to hear  that. Let me say again how much I ap preciate the Senator's understanding of  this pro bl em and his efforts to assist  the thousands of Americans on trans plant waiting lists.  MULTIDISCIPLINARY CENTERS ON AGING AND  MENTAL HEALTH  ,1991
1025,212,16,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. Chairman, I am  very concerned about older Americans'  mental health needs and the fact that  many of these people are not receiving  the care they need. With the growth in  our Nation's older population  in  the  next several decades-by the year 2030,  one  in four Americans will be 60 or  more years of age-the need for mental  heal th  services  for Older Americans  will grow dramatically.  Mental health problems such as de pression and anxiety are not uncom mon among older persons. This is par ticularly common among  those who  live alone (especially widows and wid owers), the poor, and rural Americans.  Treatment of these problems can have  excellent  results,  including  improve ment of the individual's mental health,  physical heal th, and a general improve ment of his or her quality of life. Un fortunately, care is often not available,  or, when it is, it is not being used.  To effectively meet today's and  to morrow's  demand  requires  a  broadbased policy approach that takes  account of  financing and  reimburse ment, design of the delivery system,  training of providers, and education of  ",1991

CHAIRMAN: The attached report  shows the effects of Congressional action on  the budget for fiscal year 1991 and is current  through August 2,  1991. The estimates of  budget authority, outlays, and revenues are  consistent with the technical and economic  assumptions of the Budget Enforcement Act  of 1990 (Title xm of P.L. 101-508).

1027,238,16,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President, I rise  to share with my colleagues a speech  by Dr. Warren H. Stewart, Sr., pastor  of  the  First  Institutional  Baptist  Church in Phoenix. This speech was de livered at the National Organization of  Episcopalians  for Life  luncheon  on  July 17, 1991 during the 70th General  Assembly of the Episcopal Church in  Phoenix, AZ. Dr. Stewart passionately  expresses  his  views  on  the  human  rights of the unborn child and the need  to preserve life-views which I share and I strongly commend his remarks to  my colleagues.  I ask that the speech be printed in  the RECORD.  The speech follows:  ADVOCATING THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF UNBORN  CHILDREN IN THE SPIRIT OF DR. MARTIN LU THER KING, JR.  (A  Speech Delivered by Dr. Warren H.  Stewart, Sr. at the NOEL Luncheon on July  17, 1991 held during the 70th General Assem bly of the Episcopal Church in Session in  Phoenix, Arizona.)  INTRODUCTION  Today  is a  ""red-letter"" day on my cal endar. It is not every day that a Black Bap tist preacher from Coffeyville, Kansas gets  the opportunity to speak before a group of  sophisticated  Episcopalians.  Indeed,  you  have provided the opportunity for the ""High  Church"" and the ""Low Church"" to meet on  level ground for a noble cause. Thank you for  the acceptance of the recommendation  for  me  to  speak  today  from Dr. Carolyn F.  Gerster, Vice President of NOEL, crusader of  the Right to Life of the Unborn and a dear  friend of mine  in the causes of Christ and  justice.  Welcome  to Arizona, my  Episcopalian  brothers and sisters, in spite of . . . the heat  over which none of us has any control and  the infamous historical fact that our State  has had three Martin Luther King, Jr. state  holidays either rescinded, overturned by ref erendum and/or defeated at the polls. But,  rest assured,  zona will make history in November 1992 when  we become the first and only State in the  Union to approve a Martin Luther King, Jr.I  Civil Rights Day by a vote of the people.  Please know that your coming to Arizona for  your Convention has already helped us move  a step closer to attaining our goal. Thank  you for keeping your commitment to come.  through Victory Together, Ari ",1991

1029,355,16,Mr. TORRICELLI.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with  great respect and admiration  that  I address  my colleagues in the House today, for I rise to  extend my sincerest sympathies on the pass ing of Carl E. Padavano.  Carl Padavano was a dedicated, respected  man who spent his life serving the community  of Hackensack, NJ. His distinguished military  career began when he enlisted in the Marines  in 1942. He served during World War II  in the  Pacific and was awarded  the Purple Heart  when he was wounded in battle. He was later  awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his military  service.  Carl's long list of community service awards  demonstrates his commitment  to his  friends  and neighbors. He began teaching at Hacken sack High School  in 1946. He was highly in volved  in sports and served as  football  line  coach and baseball coach from 1946 to 1963.  He held various other positions within  the  Hackensack School system  including depart ment head, director of pupil activities, vice  principal of summer school, vice principal of  junior high school, principal of high school, be fore becoming superintendent of schools from  1970 to 1984.  Carl's membership  in community and pro f essional  organizations  is  long  and  distin guished. He was a man respected, and most  of all, loved by his community. His dedication  and commitment to the youth of Hackensack  was  inspirational. He was never too busy to  extend his time and talent, energy and enthu siasm to the children of Hackensack and the  community as a whole.  Kathryn Padavano, Carl's wife of 47 years,  their children, Virginia, Patricia, Kathryn, Nina,  and Carl, Jr., and  their many grandchildren,  are joined by the entire community from Hack ensack  in mourning  this great man. He will  long be  remembered as a moving  force  in  Hackensack, and he will be greatly missed.  22701  Mr. Speaker  I am proud  to  join  in paying  tribute to this exceptional man. He  is among  those outstanding  few who  truly make a dif ference in society.  UNITED WAY OF HUDSON COUNTY  TO PRESENT COMMUNITY SERV ICE AWARDS AT  56TH ANNUAL  LUNCHEON  HON. FRANK J. GUARINI  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 11, 1991  ",1991
1030,355,16,Mr. GUARINI.," Mr. Speaker, on September  17, 1991, the United Way of Hudson County  will  host  its 56th annual  campaign  kickoff  luncheon  at  the Meadowlands  Hilton  in  Secaucus, NJ.  It  is expected  that over 800  corporate,  labor and civic  leaders will attend  this great event.  The United Way of Hudson County, directed  by William E. Martin for more than 35 years,  has done outstanding work  raising  funds  for  35 human service agencies delivering needed  social and family services to the people in my  district.  Last year alone, 176,000 service calls to in dividuals and families in need were made, pro viding sharing and caring  through a unique  partnership of labor,  industry, Federal, State  and  local governments, public and private  agencies  interfacing  their  talents  and  re sources and striving to solve problems that af fect people of all ages in our communities.  Founded in 1932, the Hudson County unit,  together with  the United Way of Tri-State,  brings together 35 United Way organizations  in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut,  under the direction of its new president, Mrs.  Betty Beene, whose coordinating efforts aid  840 communities with more than 1 ,850 human  service agencies.  The September 17  luncheon will have two  functions: to honor individuals with community  service awards and to celebrate the first anni versary of the American Way Division of the  United Way of Hudson County.  William Thornton, chairman of the board of  the United Way and William E. Martin, with the  assistance of John Leon of the department of  public affairs of the Public Service Electric &  Gas Co. who heads  the 1991-92 campaign  will greet the special guests, many of whom  will have traveled long distances to attend this  event.  These guests  include  the Honorable Lalit  Mansingh, Ambassador and Chief of Mission  for the Embassy of India in Washington, DC,  Michael Cooke,  chairman  of  the board  of  Deloitte & T ouche who is this year's chairman  of the United Ways of Tri-State, Betty Beene,  president of the New York Tri-State organiza tion, and William Aramony, president of  the  United  Way  of  America  which  is  headquartered  in Alexandria, VA, and  rep resents about 2,300 United Way organizations  throughout the United States.

1031,368,16,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speaker, today  I would  like  to  recognize  the Gajaa Heen  Dancers. Since 1975, the dancers have been  performing ethnic songs and dances  in  the  State of Alaska as well as throughout the rest  of the Nation. They have received numerous  awards  for  their enthusiasm, creativity, and  dedication.  The dancers, originally known as  the Old  Sitka Dancers, are named after a river at the  Old Sitka site where the Lingits, a Native Alas kan clan, were victorious in a battle with the  Russians. The group's presentations are given  with  the purpose of expressing varying as pects of the Lingit culture so that people will  understand and appreciate the rich Lingit herit age.  The ethnicity of the dancers is as complex  as the Lingit heritage itself. They are predomi nantly Lingit, however, the group also includes  an  interesting mixture of Haida, Aleut, Chi nese,  Irish, Russian, Cherokee, and English,  just to name a few.  The dancers are a well traveled and experi enced group. Their adventures  include per formances  in the World Eskimo Indian Olym pics and  the Festival of Native Arts. They  have traveled from Alaska to Hawaii, Los An geles, Stanford University, and even Washing ton, DC.  Their work has been recognized by various  organizations as well as prominent  leaders  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  such as the Governor of Alaska. The group's  accomplishments are due  in part  to Charlie  Joseph, a Lingit Tlei~ig man-who began  to teach the children various dances because  they represent various clans. Although he died  several years ago,  the dancers still attribute  their successes to him. I feel it is time that we  recognize Mr. Joseph and  the Gajaa Heen  Dancers for their efforts to educate the world  through art.  A  TRIBUTE  TO  JANET  PAULE  REYNOLDS,  A  DEDICATED AND  TRULY OUTSTANDING WOMAN  HON. JERRY LEWIS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 11, 1991  ",1991
1032,368,16,Mr.  LEWIS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would  like to bring to your attention the  fine  work and outstanding community service of  Janet Paule Reynolds, director of alternative  programs  from San Bernardino City Unified  School District. Janet will  receive  the San  Andreas Council's annual Friends of Children  Award in September for her outstanding dedi cation to the  furtherance of children's issues.  Janet received her B.A.  from Long Beach  State College in 1965 and her M.A. from the  University of Redlands  in 1972. She began  her career as a fourth grade teacher in 1964.  After 4 years she became program manager  of personnel services. Following 4 years of  serving as coordinator of child welfare attend ance, Janet served as director of staff devel opment from 1984 to 1988. Presently she  is  the director of alternative programs.  Janet is not only a professional woman but  also an avid participant  in community activi ties. She serves as chairperson of both  the  San Bernardino County Juvenile Justice and  Delinquency Prevention Commission and  the  San Bernardino Community Against Drugs. In  addition Janet is an active board member on  the Family Service Agency Campfire Board  YWCA Nominating Committee.  In 1985 Janet received a prestigious award  from the mayor commending her for her pro fessional and community  involvement. More  recently she received recognition from the San  Bernardino County Board of Supervisors and  she received the Town and Gown, ""Women of  Achievement Award  from  the University of  Redlands. Janet also was honored by the San  Bernardino County Board of Supervisors with  a certificate of appreciation for her work. Her  other awards  include being named Business  Associate of the Year in 1985 by the Business  and Professional Women's Association, and  receiving a certificate of appreciation from Op timist International in 1989.  Not only has she been a success in the pro fessional world and  in  the community, Janet  has achieved many respectable personal ac complishments. She has embarked on several  mountain climbing expeditions including Mount  Kilimanjaro in Africa and the Himalayan Moun tains of Nepal.  In addition to climbing moun tains, she has also flown 200 miles above the  Arctic Circle.  After hearing all of this you can clearly see  what a unique and honorable woman Janet  September 11, 1991  Paule Reynolds truly is. As an extremely dedi cated director of alternative programs  in  the  San Bernardino School District she is a model  for all children to respect. I want to personally  congratulate Janet for her success and thank  her for her dedication.  THE OPENING OF THE STAMFORD  BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB BUILDING  HON. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS  OF CONNECTICUT  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 11, 1991  ",1991
1033,368,16,Mr. SHAYS.," Mr. Speaker, It is my privilege  to recognize the successful completion of the  Stamford, CT, Boys and Girls Club building.  The club has been in existence since 1925  serving the youth of Stamford. Over the years  the club has been  located  in a variety of  rented, converted, or temporary buildings, and  has faithfully fulfilled its mission for thousands  of boys and girls.  Now, for the first time since its inception, the  club has a building that was constructed  for  and dedicated  to  the cause of providing a  safe,  nurturing  environment  for Stamford's  youth.  Located adjacent  to a 1 0-acre municipal  park and within walking distance of hundreds  of units of public housing, this facility will pro vide  invaluable assistance and  support  for  Stamford's young citizens and  their  families.  Mindful of  the  future,  it  is worth noting  the  building was completed entirely with private  donations.  In  recognition of  the need  for  facilities  for  the youth of our Nation,  it is my pleasure to  bring to my colleagues' attention the Stamford  Boys and Girls Club. With its new building this  organization can continue to offer constructive  educational and recreational programs secure  in  the knowledge that the youth of Stamford  have their own permanent home.  LIBERTY  CITY  DEPARTMENT  STORE RISES LIKE A  PHOENIX  FROM THE ASHES  HON. ILEANA ROS.LEHTINEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 11, 1991  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  I am  pleased to recognize today three Liberty City  businessmen who were  recently  featured  in  the Miami Herald as opening  the  first black owned department store  in  the Miami area.  Utilizing their experience as store managers at  an Ames Department store near Liberty City  which closed last year, Charles Howze, John  Kilby and Joan Donaldson opened the Z Mart  Discount Department Store. The article, ""3 ex managers pool  resources, open store near  Liberty City"", tells their story:  Last year's closing of the Ames Depart ment Store south of Liberty City left 100 em ployees without  jobs and a  neighborhood  bereft of a large discount store.  For three black former store managers, the  loss presented an opportunity to make his tory as the owners of Dade County's only  black-owned department store.  ",1991
1034,381,16,Mr. MAVROULES.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to  take  a moment  to  pay  tribute  to  the  achievements of a remarkable man who will  soon be honored by the U.S. Postal Service.  Jan E. Matzeliger, a native of South Amer ica, came  to  the United States about 1873.  Defying  incredible odds,  this black American  revolutionized  the  shoemaking  industry. As  Dennis Karwatka, an associate professor of in dustrial education and  technology at More head State University noted in a biography of  Matzeliger,  the young man  invented a ma chine  for use  in manufacturing  shoes  that  helped  transform an  industry, build a great  corporation, and create work for thousands of  Americans.  Matzeliger  left his native Suriname at age  19, worked on a merchant ship for 2 years,  then sought employment  in Philadelphia. Al though he was a skilled machinist who had  secured an apprenticeship  in a shoemaking  shop, the depression that swept the country in  the mid-1870's had  left him without a  job.  Matzeliger chose to move to Lynn, MA, which  is  in my district and at one  time was  the  shoemaking capital of the world.  Although he was only making $9 a week  working  on  a  shoe  stitching  machine,  Matzeliger invested his hard-earned money on  several textbooks and a secondhand drafting  set. Working on his own after work, he tried to  develop a machine that would improve a part  of the shoemaking process known as lasting.  Before automation,  skilled craftsmen would  stretch and tack leather to form the shoe.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  It  took Matzeliger 6 years  to design and  build, but his revolutionary lasting machine be came so well known  that  for 40 years after  1885 nearly every shoe factory in America had  one. His machine became the backbone of the  Consolidated Hand-Method Lasting Machine  Co., which would  later become part of  the  United Shoe Machinery Corp., an employer of  thousands during its heyday in Beverly, MA.  Despite  his  incredible  achievement,  Matzeliger has  received  little  recognition. As  Karwatka noted, ""If most 19th century Amer ican  inventors are  forgotten  today-which  is  undeniable-black inventors are especially ob scure. Almost none of them were known even  in their own times.""  Although  the Lynn Historical Society has  done  a  fabulous  job  of  increasing  public  awareness of Matzeliger in the Massachusetts  area,  it  is hopeful  that  the decision by  the  Postal Service to honor him with a stamp will  make his name and achievements nationally  known.  Not only should the people of my sixth dis trict be proud of Matzeliger and his incredible  story, but all Americans should share in his tri umph over difficult odds. His story is a micro cosm of what America is all about: Those who  set a goal and work hard at  it can achieve  their dreams in this country.  SUBSTANCE ABUSE AWARENESS  WEEK IN CUDAHY, WI  HON. GERALD D. KLECZKA  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 11, 1991  ",1991
1035,381,16,Mr.  KLECZKA.," Mr.  Speaker,  substance  abuse in the United States continues to rise.  It plagues the people of our Nation without re gard to age, race, sex, or religion.  To  raise  the awareness of people. to  the  dangers of substance abuse, and  to better  equip them to deal with this problem  in con structive ways,  the Cudahy, WI, Common  Council and  the Cudahy School Board have  designated the week of September 21  through  September 27, 1991, as  ""Substance Abuse  Awareness Week.""  Business, churches, Government, parents,  schools, and students will work  together on  this worthwhile project. The events of  the  week  include an opening rally to present tro phies  to  the winners of  the kickoff walk/run  and the school-aged poster contest, continual  awareness activities  in Cudahy High School  classrooms, and a special breakfast to encour age employees and employers to identify and  help substance abusers in the workplace.  I commend  the  city of Cudahy and  the  Cudahy School Board for these worthwhile ini tiatives.

1036,394,16,Mr. GOODLING.," Madam Chairman, I  yield  2 minutes  to  a  distinguished  member of our committee.  the gen tleman from Wisconsin [Mr. GUNDER SON].  ",1991
1037,394,16,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Madam Chairman,  I am pleased to have this opportunity  to speak in favor of H.R. 2967, the Older  Americans Act Amendments of 1991. I  commend the efforts of the chairman  of the Education and Labor Commit tee, Mr. FORD, and the ranking minor ity member of the full committee, Mr.  GooDLING, and Mr. FAWELL in produc ing a bill that provides various services  that enable our Nation's seniors to live  and work independently.  The Older Americans Act is currently  celebrating its 26th anniversary. Since  its inception in 1965, the Older Ameri cans Act has  focused on  the health,  legal, and employment needs of our  senior citizens. Some of  the specific  program highlights  include:  in-home  service for frail elderly, home health  services, coordination of community based long-term care services, develop ment of elder abuse prevention pro grams, training of individuals for em ployment opportunities in private in dustry, and providing home delivered  meals to our more vulnerable seniors.  One example  illustrating the effec tiveness of the Older Americans Act is  title III of the Older Americans Act  that funds  the home-delivered meals  program.  In Wisconsin,  the nutrition  program has served as the foundation  for many seniors' programs.  In 1990,  western Wisconsin's 169 meals  sites  served over 1 million meals to seniors  in 19 counties. In the bill that is before  this Chamber,  authorization  for  the  home-delivered meals  program  has  been increased from slightly over $79  million to $120 million for fiscal year  1992.  Another  outstanding  program  au thorized under  the Older Americans  Act is the Senior Community Service  Employment Program. This program  provides subsidized, part-time employ ment to low-income seniors age 55 and  older. H.R. 2967  authorizes over $470  million  for  the  Senior Community  Service  Employment  Program.  The  program is currently being funded at  $390 million. In recent years, the pro gram has also undertaken the goal of  placing participants into unsubsidized  employment  opportunities.  In  1990,  more than 24 percent of program par ticipants were placed into unsubsidized  jobs. Under  the Senior Community  Service Employment Program, partici pants work 20 hours per week and are  employed in community service activi ties such as home health care agencies  and adult day care facilities.  Over  the past 26 years,  the Senior  Community Service Employment Pro gram has provided employment to over  10,000 individuals in Wisconsin. In my  home county of Trempealeau, seniors  employed  in  the Senior Community  Service Employment  Program  have  worked  on  various  landscaping  and  construction activities for  the Osseo Fairchild School District and for my  hometown of Pleasantville.  Another important component of the  Older Americans Act  is  the White  House Conference  on Aging.  In  the  original bill  that was passed by  the  Education and Labor Committee,  the  White House Conference on Aging was  changed  to a National Conference on  Aging. After several weeks of negotia tions, I am very pleased that one of the  amendments offered in block will be to  restore the White House Conference on  Aging. I would like to express my ap preciation to Chairman FORD and his  staff, especially Gene Sofer, Bill Good ling, Harris Fawell,  and Mary Ann  Chaffee  from  the minority staff,  for  working with me on  this  important  issue.  The White  House  Conference  on  Aging was first created by Congress in  1958. Representative John Fogarty of  Rhode  Island was  the chief sponsor.  The bill came before this body in July  1958. During  floor  debate  both Mr.  Fogarty and Mr. Bosch, of New York,  said that they envisioned a conference  as a means of bringing recommenda tions from the States together. These  recommendations would then be trans formed into a program of guidance for  government and non-government enti ties at the Federal, State, and  local  levels.  Three White House Conference on  Aging have been held since the original  legislation was  enacted. Those  con ferences have produced  recommenda tions that have played a  large role in  giving birth  to  the Older Americans  Act, improving heal th care services for  our seniors, providing employment op portunities, and developing community  service programs  that will make, as  stated in the 1961 Report of the White  House Conference on Aging, ""the gift  of added years of life a period of reward  and satisfaction."" I am confident that  the next White House Conference on  Aging, which will be held in 1993, will  continue  the spirit of  the 1961  con ference.  ",1991

1039,394,16,Mr. HUGHES.," Madam Chairman,  I  thank  the gentleman from California  for yielding time to me.  Madam Chairman, I would like to ap plaud  the gentleman  from California  [Mr. MARTINEZ]  and  the  gentleman  from Michigan [Mr. FORD] for their ef forts in bringing this vi tally important  bill to the floor today.  For over a quarter century, the Older  Americans Act  has  been  providing  older  individuals with both  the  re sources and the opportunities so that  they are better able  to help  them selves. Passage of this reauthorization  will support the efforts of the 80-year old woman in my district who delivers  meals to persons who are too frail to  prepare their own food. It will continue  the important work of a nursing home  ombudsman who takes the time to look  into the needs of a stroke victim. And  it will play a significant preventative  role  in cost effectively assisting per sons  in  their communities during a  time of rapidly increasing health care  costs.  It is for this reason that I introduced  H.R. 2393,  the Older Americans Health  Promotion and Disease Prevention Act.  This act, which has been incorporated  ",1991
1040,407,16,Mr. MILLER of California.," Madam Chairman,  I rise in support of H.R. 2967, the Older Amer icans  Act  Amendments  of  1991.  These  amendments will not only strengthen and im prove the provision of services  to America's  elderly, but will make  the Older Americans  Act, one of our best examples of a public/pri vate partnership, even better. With more than  31 million Americans over the age of 60, the  Older Americans Act will continue to play an  essential and  increasing  role  in  the  lives of  hundreds of thousands of Americans.  I wish  to commend Mr. MARTINEZ and his  subcommittee staff, and Education and Labor  staff for their hard work on  this  legislation.  I  also wish to thank them for their willingness to  work with me and with Mr. DOWNEY to include  our amendment on quality assurances for in home services to the frail elderly.  Meals on Wheels, home  repair services,  homemaker and  home-health  aid  services,  legal services to the elderly, elder abuse serv ices, and transportation services are but a few  of  the services  that are provided under  the  Older Americans Act. These  vital  services  have enabled  thousands of America's senior  citizens  to  live  independently  in  their homes  and in their communities eliminating unneces sary institutionalization.  The 1987 Older Americans Act amendments  authorized in title  Ill the provision of in-home  services  for  frail older  individuals to prevent  their premature institutionalization. These serv ices  include homemaker and home  health  aides,  visiting  and  telephone  reassurance,  chore maintenance,  in-home  respite care  for  families and adult day care as a respite serv ice for families.  Quality of care  is a critical  issue  in home  care and is a concern of both providers and  individuals receiving in-home services. All too  often we have read about elderly  individuals  who have been targets of fraudulent home re pair services, or  individuals who have had  family mementos or personal property stolen  by persons sent into their homes to help them.  Through passage  of  the  1987 Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation Act-OBRA-87, Public  Law  100-203-Congress made  significant  progress in protecting home care consumers  by strengthening Medicare conditions of par ticipation, particularly  regarding  training and  testing of homemaker health aides. Those  new standards and protections apply only to  Medicare and Medicaid certified agencies, and  not to organizations that do not receive funds  from such sources.  But there are no Federal standards or provi sions comparable  to  the 1987 OBRA provi sions to assure quality of care provided under  the Older Americans Act. Neither the enabling  laws nor the  implementing  regulations place  any supervision,  training, or  testing  require ments on  individuals who perform personal  care activities. Effective State  regulation of  paraprofessional services exist  in  less  than  half of the States.  This lack of Federal and State quality assur ance standards means that individuals provid ing the in-home services often go without ap propriate training and supervision. And when  underqualified individuals are put in the posi tion of providing personal care, there is an in creased  risk  that the quality of care will be  poor. The risk of fraud and abuse against el derly and disabled clients may also increase.  The quality assurance amendment which  Mr. DOWNEY and  I have offered will ensure  that individuals receiving in-home home health  aide services under the Older Americans Act  receive  the same  type of consumer protections  that are provided under Medicare or  Medicaid. Our amendment cross-walks where  applicable,  the  1987 OBRA Medicare and  Medicaid quality assurance  requirements  for  the provision of  in-home services  into  the  Older Americans Act.  Our amendment has two sections. The first  section requires that home health aide serv ices provided under section  341 (a)  of  the  Older Americans Act be provided by  individ uals employed by an entity that is either, first,  a home health agency that meets the Medi care requirements of the Social Security Act;  or second, is licensed under State law that re quires training, testing, and supervisions sub stantially equivalent  to  the  training,  testing,  and supervision required by Medicare, or third,  is accredited by an agency approved by the  Secretary of Health and Human Services.  The second section of our amendment re quires  that  the entities  that provide home  health aide  services promote  the  rights of  each older individual who receives such serv ices. These  rights are  identical  to  the 1987  OBRA legislation and include the right, first, to  be  fully  informed  in advance about  the  in home  services  to  be  provided,  and  any  change in the services; second, to participate  in planning and changing these services un less the individual is judicially adjudged incom petent; third, to voice grievance with respect to  such service, without discrimination or reprisal,  fourth,  to confidentiality of  records;  fifth,  to  have  the property of the  individual receiving  the service treated with respect; and sixth, to  be fully informed, orally and in writing,  in ad vance of receiving  in-home services, of their  rights and obligations under this act.  The Older Americans Act has served as an  important program in helping older individuals  to maintain their  independence and  to avoid  unnecessary  and  premature  institutionaliza tion. The addition of Federal quality assurance  standards will strengthen both the act and the  provisions of in-home services to help meet its  goals.  ",1991
1041,407,16,Mr. DOWNEY.," Madam Chairman, the legis lation we consider today, H.R. 2967, the Older  Americans Act Amendments of 1991, is of crit ical  importance to millions of our elderly rel atives,  friends,  and  neighbors. When we  speak of  the Older Americans Act, we are  really talking about countless locally organized  service programs that make the lives of older  people much better than they might otherwise  be. We are speaking of Meals on Wheels pro grams, of neighborhood  senior centers, of  legal services, of home repair and chore as sistance, of in-home health care services, of  rides to the mall, and of elder abuse preven tion programs. There are so many programs  housed under  the broad  roof of  the Older  Americans Act, that it is difficult to list them all.  But one thing is certain: All of these programs  enjoy a remarkable  track record of providing  service over the past 26 years.  As  chairman  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Human Services of the Select Committee on  Aging, I have been privileged over the past 3  years to meet many of the people who admin ister  these programs at all  levels,  from  the  U.S. Commissioner on Aging  to volunteers  who serve the meals and deliver the reassur ing words of comfort that personify the act.

Mr. Speaker, I concur in all of the re marks of my distinguished colleague,  the gentleman  from Mississippi  [Mr.  ESPY],  in his congratulations and his  laudatory comments with  respect  to  our colleague.  I would simply conclude by saying  that  I  have  al ways  cherished  the  friendship that I have with my distin guished colleague, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, Mr. GRAY,  and  I  look  forward to seeing him continue to rise  and go  forward in a bright and intel ligent fashion that he exemplified as a  Member of this body.  0 1610  ",1991

For  12  years  our  colleague  has  distin guished himself as statesman and  friend  to  many of us in this Chamber. His work on the  various committees on which he has served  and  in  the  leadership of  this  institution can  only be described as stellar.  It  is  rare, Mr.  Speaker, that a member with such a level of  dedication, affability and compassion comes  among us; Bill Gray is one, and I am sorry to  see him go.  Bill's leadership is the standard by which all  of us in the Congressional Black Caucus, and  indeed  in  the Congress,  should  strive  to  achieve.  I wish him the best as president of  the United Negro College Fund, as he contin ues his service to the future of black leader ship.  ",1991
1046,433,16,Mr. BORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to com mend and congratulate my good  friend and  colleague, Bill Gray, as he leaves Congress.  I rise, however, with mixed feelings. I know  that Bill Gray has made his decision to leave  Congress based on what is right for him and  for his  family.  I know that Bill's work for the  United Negro College Fund will  follow  in his  family's tradition of furthering educational op portunities  for black Americans. And  I know  that the fund will be better for having Bill Gray  as its president.  But  in  the midst of those good  feelings,  I  feel a sense of loss, for myself, for Philadel phia,  for  the Congress and  for  the United  States.  Since I first came to Congress in 1983, Bill  has provided me with guidance and advice.  The wisdom of a senior colleague  is a valu able commodity to a junior member, and Bill  was a font of wisdom.  He has been both a friend and a confidante,  an advisor on politics and policy, and a steady  source of support at all times.  I will miss Bill  Gray.  Bill has been  the  informal  ""dean"" of  the  Philadelphia delegation since 1981. But even  before that, he was hard at work for the city  and its people.  Bill's work  for Philadelphia has been  far reaching. He has been pastor of Bright Hope  Baptist Church  since  1972,  and  preaches  there to this day.  Bill worked to  improve living conditions  for  Philadelphia's lower income residents as head  of a nonprofit housing corporation and served  on the boards of the Philadelphia Urban Coali tion, the Health and Welfare Council of Phila delphia and  the Children's Hospital of Phila delphia. He also wrote a weekly column  for  the Philadelphia Tribune.  In 1978, Bill was elected to Congress, and  began representing the people of the Second  Congressional District of Pennsylvania. On the  Budget Committee he pressed  for  increased  funding for social programs, even  in the face  of the Reagan administration's defense build up.  Bill Gray has fought for Philadelphia's port,  transit system, and naval shipyard. He's strug gled on behalf of Philadelphia's working men  and women and  for Philadelphia's fiscal sur vival.  One  legacy  recent example of Bill Gray's  for  the people of Philadelphia  lasting  is  the  victory he won in providing a dedicated source  of State funding for mass transit in Pennsylva nia.  After over 2 years of struggle,  legislation  sponsored by Bill forced Pennsylvania to join  the  rest of  the country  in supporting  transit.  With Philadelphia relying on the largest transit  system in the State, this was a major achieve ment for the city.  To say that Bill Gray is also a major player  in Philadelphia politics  is an understatement.  His support is critical in almost any election in  Philly, and his opposition  is often  too over powering  to be countered.  I do not  think  it  would be stretching the truth  to say  that, on  his retirement from politics, Bill is the most in fluential  figure on  the Philadelphia political  scene.  Yes, Philadelphians will miss Bill Gray.  The Congress is also  losing one of its all time brightest stars. From the very beginning  of his  tenure here  in Washington, Bill Gray  was a man to be reckoned with.  He was elected president of the 1978 fresh man class, and won seats on the Budget, For eign Affairs and Steering and Policy Commit tees.  By 1985, he was chairman of the Budget  Committee, where he consistently built major ity coalitions  in  support of his committee's  budget resolutions. After 4 years in the Budget  Committee chair, Bill Gray moved on, and up,  as  he was  overwhelmingly elected  to  the  chairmanship of  the House Democratic cau cus.  Within a year, Bill had been elected majority  whip,  the office he now  leaves.  I have no  doubt, that had Bill not decided to accept the  United Negro College Fund presidency, he  would have been Speaker of the House by the  turn of the century. The U.S. Congress will  miss Bill Gray.  Finally, America is losing one of its premier  statesmen. Bill Gray has become well known  throughout  the country as a spokesman  for  Congress, the Democratic Party, Philadelphia  and black Americans. And, as  the highest  elected African-American official, Bill has been  a source of pride and a role model  for  the  black community.  We will all miss Bill Gray.  I wish him, his  wife Andrea and his three children all the best.  The United Negro College Fund's gain  is  surely our loss.  ",1991
1047,433,16,Mr. SMITH of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to pay tribute to a colleague of ours who  decided to leave the Congress: the Honorable  William H. Gray, Ill of the great State of Penn sylvania.  Bill Gray has had one of the most remark able careers  in  congressional history.  In a  mere 12 years of congressional service, Bill  rose to become first the chairman of the Budg et Committee and  finally,  the  first African American member of  the House  leadership  when he became the majority whip in 1989.  Bill Gray took over the chairmanship of the  Budget Committee  in 1985 during very dark  days for the Democrats. Ronald Reagan had  just won the largest landslide in American his tory and  the House had suffered  through 4  years of budget turmoil. Under Gray's chair manship, the House Democrats reversed the  Reagan  priorities and  reestablished Demo cratic unity. The four budget resolutions by Bill  ",1991

Mr. Speaker, our next petitioner is  also a very dynamic woman who came  to the attention of the Nation before  she entered into the Halls of this au gust body. As a member of the Califor nia Assembly, MAXINE WATERS  shook  things up  there for good. She brings  that  same  kind  of dynamism,  that  same kind of activism and that same  kind of intensity to the issues that af fect us in the Halls of Congress. As a  member of the Committee on Banking,  Finance and Urban Affairs, she has a  very strong voice in the areas of minor ity business and finance, and she cer tainly has shaken  things up here as  well.  So Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle woman from California [Ms. WATERS].  ",1991
1049,446,16,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman very much for yielding.  I would like to commend the chairman  of the Congressional Black Caucus, the  gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. ESPY],  for organizing this opportunity for us  to talk about the state of black Amer ica.  So  today members of  the Congres sional Black Caucus will present  the  Nation with our state of black Amer ica. The message you will hear in our  voices will be messages of grief, anger,  and passion as we portray the catas trophe that the African-American com munity suffers, the poverty, the home lessness, the drugs and violence, infant  mortality, plagues and afflictions, the  need for jobs, education, and hope. Our  listeners may or may not be moved by  what we say here today. However, no  one disputes the reality; but no one be lieves anything will be done.  The political gridlock makes Los An geles freeways look fluid. There is no  money. There is no hope. Conservatives  invent new ways  to push around  the  poor without a prayer of providing an  answer to their needs.  What are we saying here today? It is  beginning to sound familiar. Yes, Mr.  Bush,  there  is no  domestic  agenda.  America is indeed deteriorating.  It is not simply black America that  is in trouble. Working class whites will  be hit just as hard as blacks by President Bush's unwillingness  to extend  unemployment benefits. Poor whites  are in desperate need of health services  and educational opportunities also.  America is in  trouble. However, we  must not simply bemoan  the  tragic  state of affairs  in our country. We  must seize the opportunity to turn our  attention to America's needs.  Charity begins at home and spreads  abroad. The cold war is over. We really  should  be  celebrating.  The  Soviet  Union has surrendered. The great sac rifices we have made over the past 40  years are at an end. Our soldiers, our  resources, our new world awaits us.  We  spend over half of our military  budget, about $150 billion a year, as a  subsidy to our European allies to de fend them against the threat of a sur prise  Soviet  attack.  Some  of  us  thought that was an exorbitant subsidy  to rich allies who really could def end  themselves. Some of us  thought we  were not spending enough. It no longer  matters. The Russians are not coming.  The Communist  threat has vanished.  The so-called Evil Empire really does  not exist and there is not threat. The  mission no  longer makes  sense. We  have no choice but to plan for conver sion to a new world.  Americans will not allow  their tax  dollars to be squandered on a defense  budget it does not need. Nor will Amer icans allow their tax dollars to be used  to  support  housing,  education,  and  business opportunities for  the Soviet  Union while our communities continue  to suffer.  We really should be celebrating. We  really should celebrate today. But we  must celebrate and act. Across  the  world  democratic  movements  are  bringing down walls and opening up  hopes. This country cannot remain fro zen  in a world of change. We must  bring down the foolish budgetary walls  that prohibit transfer of resources from  military to civilian spending passed in  folly as the cold war was coming to an  end.  We must act to use the blessed oppor tunity we have been given to rebuild  our  opportunities  here. Our  oppor tunity here is clear. There has never  been  a  better  chance  for  dramatic  change in 45 years.  My friends,  it is no  longer  time  to  mourn. It is time  to move. The Con gressional Black Caucus can offer the  leadership to this Congress and to this  Nation. We are pained indeed, but we  are not hopeless. We understand that  we have power, and it is time for us to  use that power. It is time for us to say  to President Bush, to the leadership, to  the world, we will not continue  to  allow this madness with the budget to  continue. We must get in the forefront  of undoing the Budget Reconciliation  Act of 1990. We must say it is time to  use  those  dollars  from  the  defense  budget to invest in our communities,  to invest in America.  We can do that.

The world has changed dramatically  in the last 3 weeks, and for us simply  to blithely go along and spend money  as we did before without recognizing  the changed world I just do not think  makes any sense at all.  The amendment  is very general  in  nature. Let me just read the conclud ing sentences here.  It is the sense of the Senate that the Presi dent of the United States should summon  the Democratic and Republican leadership of  the Congress and reconvene the budget sum mit to discuss possible budget revisions for  fiscal year 1992-It does not say that has to happen,  though frankly I think we shouldand to revise the congressional budget proc ess for fiscal year 1993 and subsequent years,  in order to reflect new world realities and  new domestic priorities and to achieve sig nificant  reductions  in  the Federal budget  deficit.  That is it.  I am not wedded  to any  language.  But  it  seems  to me  it  is  general  enough. It is common sense. We ought  to be doing it.  I would like to have printed in the  RECORD  a  letter from  the U.S. Con ference  of Mayors  endorsing  this.  I  would like to insert into the RECORD a  letter from  the Council for a Livable  World, and to insert into the RECORD a  letter from OMB Watch,  in behalf of  this, and a statement in behalf of the  proposal by Gov. Mario Cuomo in be half of this. I ask unanimous consent  to print all of these in the RECORD at  this point.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as fallows:  THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS,  Washington, DC, September 11, 1991.  DEAR SENATOR: The Nation's cities have  experienced more than a decade of neglect  from the Federal Government; Federal funds  for key urban domestic programs have been  slashed at the very same time that cities'  tax bases have been dwindling and urban ills  such as homelessness, drugs, and violence  have been escalating.  The U.S. Conference of Mayors, represent ing mayors of cities over 30,000,  strongly  urges you to reject the constraints imposed  by  last year's budget agreement and calls  upon Congress and the administration to un dertake a  serious shift in Federal funding  priori ties from the defense budget to the do mestic needs of our Nation.  The U.S. Conference of Mayors strongly  supports  the sense-of-the-Senate resolution  which will be offered by Senator Simon as an  amendment  to  the Labor-HHS  appropria tions bill.  As President of  the U.S. Conference of  Mayors I pledge our bipartisan support  to  you in this effort. The cities need your help  now. We cannot wait any longer. Please sup port the Simon amendment.  Sincerely,  RAYMOND L. FLYNN,  President, Mayor of Boston.  COUNCIL FOR A LIV ABLE WORLD,  Washington, DC, Septembe1 11, 1991.  Hon. PAUL SIMON,  U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR SIMON: Council for a Liv able World enthusiastically endorses your  sense-of-the-Senate  amendment  to  the  Labor-Health and Human Services Appro priations bill urging new budget negotiations  to revise last year's budget summit agree ment.  The budget deal negotiated  last year  is  clearly out of date. It merely provides mod est reduction  in  real growth  in Pentagon  spending, an agreement drawn up for an en tirely different world environment than ex ists  today.  Secretary Cheney's  five-year  military budget plan was designed primarily  to cope with a continuing Soviet threat.  The failed coup last month confirmed the  demise of the Communist system in the So viet Union and the end of the military and  political competition that drove up our secu rity costs. The Philippine Senate vote to re ject the Philippines base agreement, com bined with the Mount Pinatubo eruption, has  reduced another American overseas burden.  The completion of the ST ART and Conven tional Forces in Europe agreements can lead  to still further reductions  in weapons and  personnel.  The Simon amendment is a good first step  away from a bad budget deal. We urge  its  adoption.  Yours sincerely,  JOHN ISAACS,  President.  Washington, DC, September 11, 1991.  OMB WATCH,  Hon. p AUL SIMON.  Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington,  DC.  DEAR SENATOR SIMON: On Thursday, Sep tember 12, Senator Paul Simon is expected  to  introduce  a  resolution calling  for  the  budget summit between Congress and  the  President  to  be  reconvened  in  light  of  changed circumstances. We urge you to vote  for Senator Simon's resolution. We believe  that  economic  conditions  at  home  and  events abroad call for a reassessment of the  discretionary spending limits established in  the Budget Enforcement Act [BEA) as well  as the Act's emergency spending provisions.  The continuing recession has resulted  in  unemployment remaining high. According to  the latest figures for the month of August,  unemployment remained at the July level of  6.8 percent. Yet the provisions of the BEA  have enabled the President to sign a bill to  provide emergency benefits without declar ing the emergency necessary to provide the  funds. Congress has yet to overcome this ob stacle. There  is still no foreseeable end to  the recession, with the Congressional Budget  Office warning that the possibility of a ""dou-  ble-dip"" recession cannot be ruled out. Con gress  is unable  to  respond with counter cyclical spending because of the BEA. The  States are facing historic fiscal crises with  Congress unable  to help  them since  fiscal  policy  is constrained by  the BEA. Mean while, cataclysmic events are occurring in  the Soviet Union which could finally allow  us to realize the long-promised ""peace divi dend,"" except that Congress is unable to re spond to them: its hands are ""tied"" by the  budget summit agreement.  We believe that Congress has a responsibil ity to respond  to the needs of the country  and to events around the world by reconven ing the budget summit. We believe that Con gress cannot continue to abide by an agree ment which is increasingly becoming obso lete and prevents the Nation from effectively  responding to changing times and domestic  crises. We urge you to support Senator Si mon's resolution.  Sincerely,  GARY D. BASS,  Executive Director.  STATEMENT ON SENATOR SIMON'S BUDGET  PROPOSAL, SEPTEMBERl0,1991  I commend Senator Paul Simon for calling  on President Bush to reconvene the Budget  Summit  to  renegotiate  last year's budget  agreement. It has been increasingly evident  that this agreement tied  the hands of the  Congress to address the urgent needs of the  Nation and the profound changes in Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union.  At a time when the recession has pushed 10  million Americans out of work, when 30 mil lion Americans have no health  insurance,  when 12 million children are trapped in pov erty, and when AIDS, homelessness, and sub stance abuse  threaten  the survival of our  cities, Congress has been unable to respond.  Moreover, the 1990 budget agreement com mitted  the expenditure of more  than Sl.4  trillion on defense over 5 years. Spending for  defense of this magnitude was unwarranted  in 1990 at the dawn of a new world order and  is clearly excessive today given the events in  the Soviet republics over the last few weeks.  Unless the budget agreement is changed, sav ings in the defense budget will continue to  accrue  to  the defense account-at  the ex pense of domestic needs and at the expense  of urgently needed humanitarian aid.  Now, with the collapse of the ""Evil Em pire"", it is apparent that we should not wait  until after the 1992 election-certainly not  until 1994-to reorder our priorities in rec ognition of the crisis we face at home and  the end of the major threat from abroad.  I hope others in the Congress will follow  Senator Simon's lead and call for changes to  the 1990 budget agreement. I firmly believe  that the budget process can be changed to  better reflect national priorities while  re taining the fiscal discipline that is essential  to our economic health.  In addition,  I  recommend  that Congress  take  immediate  action on  two proposals  pending in Congress. First, I wholeheartedly  support Senator Tom Harkin's amendment  to shift $3  billion  in unobligated defense  funds to health, education, and other domes tic needs. Second,  I  support  the proposal  being  advanced  by Representatives Gep hardt, Aspin, and Fazio in the House to pro vide humanitarian aid to the Soviet repub lics by shifting funds from the defense to the  international category of the budget. These  are two interim steps Congress can take as  the reconvened Budget Summit meets tone gotiate a budget that reflects the new world  realities.  ",1991

Mr.  President, we  have heard a great deal  lately about  the problems in the Middle East, par ticularly with respect to the proposals  for loan guarantees to the State of Is rael.  I  find myself in the position of  having  to say, quite candidly,  to  the  administration:  I  fail  to understand  what you are doing and why you are  doing it.  It seems to me that our foreign pol icy should be one which rewards our  friends, which works with our friends,  and punishes  the enemies of freedom  and democracy.  We have forgotten the lessons of his tory. I remember coming to this Sen ate  floor  and  being  excoriated  by  Democrats, Republicans, and  the ad ministration alike, because I said, ""no  more loan guarantees to Saddam Hus sein, the 'Butcher of Baghdad'."" ""What  do you mean cutting off loans and loan  guarantees to him?"" One would have  thought  I was attacking Mother Te resa. Incredible.  Between 1983  and 1990,  the United  States made agricultural loan guaran tees  to  the ""Butcher of Baghdad"" of  some $5 billion. As a matter of fact, he  still owes us $1.9 billion. Who knows if  we will ever get paid.  Take a  look at  the history of  the  State of Israel. It has never defaulted  on  its  loans or any  loan guarantee.  Never. Now, what about  this $10 bil lion?  I have many constituents who  write and say, ""we should be  taking  care of our own. Why are we giving for eign aid? Why are we giving $10 billion  to Israel?"" We are not giving $10 billion  to Israel. That  is absolutely not the  case.  In fact what we would guarantee, in  the event the State of Israel fails  to  pay back  its loans-and let me reit erate, she has never defaulted on any  loan-$10  billion which would  come  from the private sector. And what are  these guarantees for? They will meet  the humanitarian needs of housing, of  shelter, of infrastructure, for 1 million  immigrants that are coming into the  State of Israel.  The United States led the fight for  Soviet Jews who sought return to Zion.  We have  the moral  responsibility  to  provide them that opportunity by un derwriting aid  for  the most humani tarian of purposes.  A short time ago, we gave billions of  dollars  in  loan  guarantees  to  the  Butcher of Baghdad. Was he rehabili tating people, providing housing, pro viding shelter? No. He was gassing the  Kurds, gassing the Iranians, and build ing his military fortress.  Who  invaded Kuwait? It wasn't Is rael. She was withstanding incredible  physical and psychological torment. I  was there when the Scud missiles were  coming into Israel and the people were  saying ""What will we do? What will we  do?"" We asked and urged Israel to act  with restraint. That she did. Is this her  reward?  Mr. President, the $10 billion is not  going to cost the taxpayers of the Unit ed States one penny. This must be un derstood. Fully one-third, if not more,  of the $10 billion over the next 5 years  will be spent in the United States, pro ducing  60,000  or more  jobs, which  means  there will be a  significant re turn to our economy. It will not cost  the  taxpayers anything.  In  fact,  the  taxpayers of this country are going to  benefit. People are going to get work.  The private sector is going to finance  these loans, not the U.S. taxpayer.  We are asking that the United States  stand up and say yes, we are part of the  humanitarian effort  to make  it pos sible for a million people to come into  a small country like Israel and to pro vide them with the basics, with shelter,  with infrastructure, with job opportu nities.  It will create  jobs here. And  that is the right thing to do:  reward  our friends and punish our enemies.  This may seem too simplistic, but I  suggest to you that we have had a for eign policy that all too often has done  the opposite-rewarding our enemies  with promises of what we will do for  them, including giving them loan guar antees only  to  see  them attack us,  clearly flying in the face of what de mocracy and moral values  can  and  should be about.  That makes no sense. What this will  do is set back the peace process. Who  wins with this approach?  The PLO? The hard-line, militant  Arabs who now say  that  the United  States relationship with Israel, is less  than what it has been;  less  than  the  total commitment of support for a pre cious ally with  the voices of democ racy. If the peace process is ready to go  ahead, let it go ahead. Let the issues,  the complex issues that may exist, be  debated and negotiated at the bargain ing table.  I do not believe that holding Israel  hostage as it relates to this $10 billion  is right, morally or politically. It is un conscionable. It is not the noble course  that this Nation should be seeking or  undertaking. It is not a course where  we are standing up for what is morally  correct. If anything, we put ourselves  in the place of a blackmailer for  the  wrong purposes.  I hope  that we will reevaluate  this  position. I hope that the Congress of  the United States, working  together  with the administration, will fashion a  course  that says we  stand with our  friends, and we stand for democracy.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",1991

1063,498,16,Mr. WOFFORD.," Mr. President, I have  just read the dispatch telling that the  President has  threatened  to veto ac tion by  the Congress of  the United  States for a loan guarantee to Israel. I  rise to say that I think this policy of  linking the loan guarantee to the peace  process-delaying this  loan guarantee  because of the peace process-is unwise  and is wrong.  Now is the time, after we have just  shown with such dedication in the Per sian Gulf why it is important to act for  peace in the Middle East on behalf of  an  independent Arab State,  to stand  firm in our support of the one true de mocracy in the region.  We who have had such a stake in get ting Soviet Jews and Ethiopian Jews  free to go to Israel should take this ac tion now. I was once in Ethiopia, with  the Peace Corps, working with  the  Ethiopian Jews. And I've worked in the  Soviet Union as president of the Inter national League  for Human Rights,  with  the  Soviet  dissidents,  seeking  freedom for Soviet Jews. Knowing what  America has done  to press  for  that  freedom, it seems to me that this is no  time for delay in showing our commit ment to assisting not by a loan but by  a guarantee for an ally whose record of  paying loans to this date has been per fect.  Therefore,  I  strongly dissent  from  the President of the United States, who  has threatened to veto an action which  the conscience of the world calls for us  to take.  ",1991

1067,511,16,Mr. LAUTENBERG.,  I would appre ciate that.  ,1991
1068,511,16,Mr. HARKIN.," I want to be very sup portive. Quite frankly, I do believe our  whole foreign aid program needs to be  looked  at,  revamped,  and  many  changes need to be made. We have to  start looking at what we can do in this  country  to help our own people. But  the matter of Soviet Jews is one area  in which we have a deep moral obliga tion.  I have thought about this.  What we have been telling the Soviet  Jews for years,  they have been on a  ship, held prisoner on a ship in which  they have been repressed, suppressed,  tortured, imprisoned, and then we told  them to jump off the ship. We are sit ting down there with all the life boats.  Well, the Soviet Jews have jumped off  the ship and now we are pulling the life  boats away and saying: ""Now you have  to swim for it.""  Is that what kind of country we are?  I do not believe so. I do not think that  is what the American people meant to  do when we said that we were going to  help Soviet  emigres,  that we were  going to help the Soviet Jews if they  wanted to get out of the Soviet Union.  No, we said we were going to support  them.  Now  the Bush administration says,  ""We are going  to pull  the  life boats  away from you. Swim out on your own  out in the middle of the ocean.'' I do  not think that is the right course for a  powerful,  big,  and generous country  like the United States of America.  Second, I do not think it is right to  hold hostage  these emigres who have  had to endure so much suffering in the  Soviet Union, who had to fight  their  way out, and who had to find their way  to Israel after so much difficulty. We  said we would not take more here in  the United States, forcing all to go to  Israel. And now we are saying we are  not going to help them resettle. I do  not understand that.  We are holding the Soviet Jews hos tage to the power plays that are going  on with our new friend, Hafiz Assad of  Syria. Reminds me  of another  old  friend, Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hus sein was Bush's old friend. Now Hafiz  Assad is the new friend of this adminis tration and  the Soviet  emigres  are  being held as hostages  to  these big  power plays. Again, I do not think that  is a  right and proper course  for  the  United States of America. So I associ ate myself with comments of Senator  LAUTENBERG. He is right on the mark.  However else one may feel about for eign aid-and  I  strongly believe we  have to revamp it and look at how we  can start helping our own people at  home-this  is one area in which our  country has made a commitment in the  past and we ought  to stick by  that  commitment.  I thank the Senator.  ",1991

1071,511,16,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," I would like to  add  to a  comment  that  the Senator  from Iowa made. The fact is, as we ex amine our foreign policy we ought to  remember who  our  friends  are. We  ought to remember that when we say  to Israel there is a precondition to hu manitarian aid, what we are doing is  helping  Israel's  opponents  become  more intransigent.  We are not saying to the hostile Arab  countries ""Stop the embargo. Take a  U.S. passport and treat it as a docu ment, with  the  respect  that  it de serves."" This says that you are a U.S.  citizen and you can go anyplace you  want, except in Saudi Arabia and Ku wait and a couple of countries there,  where they will not take it if you vis ited Israel in the process.  What we are doing is aiding the rigid ity and intransigence of the Arab posi tion. We are saying Israel has to agree  to preconditions, and not Arab coun tries. It is a mistake in terms of for",1991
1072,524,16,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to clarify with the manager  of the bill the intent regarding use of  employment service national activities  funds for contracts with non-State en tities  for  test development  research.  The Labor Department has undertaken  a research program intended to address  a number of important issues surrounding the use of the general aptitude test  battery. These issues were raised in a  National Academy of Sciences study  and elsewhere. These efforts should be  continued and, where  feasible, State  agencies should be utilized. However,  where  expertise  is  not  available  through the States the Department has  flexibility  to  procure  services  else where.  ",1991

1075,524,16,Mr. BENTSEN., I would be delighted  to discuss this issue with my colleague  from Kentucky.  ,1991
1076,524,16,Mr. FORD.," Does the chairman share  my  concerns  that  these  regulations  may have a devastating impact on our  States and their ability to fund Medic aid services for our neediest families?  BENTSEN.  As  the  Senator  knows,  these regulations were just is sued today, and the committee has not  had time to fully assess their impact  on the States. However, it is clear that  many States believe that these regula tions will  require  either  significant  changes or elimination of their Medic aid voluntary contribution or provider paid  tax programs. The doubt arises  from the ambiguity of the regulatory  language-which you alluded to-and I  believe that the Department of Health  and Human Services owes  it to  the  States  and Congress  to  clarify  the  meaning of the regulations. I intend to  obtain such clarification from the De partment.  For some States,  including Texas,  the impact of these regulations could  be significant. The Committee on Fi nance has already held one hearing on  this issue, and I encourage the States  to advise us of the impact of these reg ulations on their programs a soon as  possible. I can assure the Senator that  my staff and I will be closely reviewing  these regulations and the comments of  the States to ensure that congressional  intent is followed.  However, I am concerned that OMB  will score a cost for an extension of the  current moratorium, which would lead  to a sequester of many equally vital  programs. I do not believe we can risk  such a sequester at this point. But I  can assure the Senator that we will be  listening to the States in the coming  weeks to assess the full impact of these  regulations on their programs and will  take whatever action is appropriate to  resolve this issue.  ",1991
1077,524,16,Mr.  FORD.,"  I  appreciate  the  com ments of my good friend and distinIn  guished colleague, the chairman of the  Finance Committee, and look forward  to working with him to address  this  issue before  the end of the year.  light of the chairman's comments,  I  will not be offering this amendment at  this time.  The Congressional Budget Office ad vises me that no costs would be scored  for  this amendment. However, under  the Budget Enforcement Act enacted  last year, OMB has the final say on the  cost estimate for  this amendment.  I  recognize  the concerns of some  that  OMB will score a cost, which would  trigger a  sequester in domestic pro grams, and I clearly would not want to  be responsible for that. But the fact is,  if HCF A is arguing that these regula tions merely  implement current  law  and go no further, then extending the  moratorium through the end of this fis cal year should have no cost impact.  On the other hand, if these regulations  do go farther than Congress intended,  as I suspect, OMB will certainly be able  to come up with a cost.  Mr. President, we need to send a sig nal to HCFA, today, that Congress in tends  to deal with  these regulations  and we will reserve  time for our au thorizing committee to do so before the  interim rules become effective on Jan uary 1. We need to send a signal, today,  to our States, that they will not have  to convene their legislatures between  now and the end of the year in order to  avoid busting their budgets next Janu ary in the middle of their fiscal year.  And we need to send a signal, today to  the poor  families who  depend upon  these programs to pay for much needed  Medicaid benefits, that we will work to  ensure that they have access to basic  heal th care.  While I believe that my amendment  would have sent such a signal, there is  simply not enough time to achieve that  result. But HCFA and OMB should not  take my decision to mean that I either  sanction these regulations or will sit  by and let them be implemented, there by robbing the poorest families in Ken tucky of basic health care. I am serv ing notice to HCF A, and OMB,  that I  will fight  to allow my State to con tinue to find innovative ways to take  care of our people.  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous  consent that an article by Gov. Wallace  Williamson of Kentucky be printed in  the RECORD following my statement.  Mr. President, I had intended to offer  an amendment to this bill which would  have extended through the end of this  fiscal year the moratorium enacted in  OBRA 90 on final regulations by the  Department  of Health  and Human  Services on State Medicaid matching  payments through voluntary contribu tions and provider-paid taxes.

1079,550,16,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to  introduce  legislation  that  would designate Fort Totten, a former  military post and Indian school near  Devils Lake, ND, as a national historic  site. I am pleased that my colleague,  Senator BURDICK, has cosponsored this  bill.  The legislation is similar to a bill we  introduced last year, S. 2802. The Sen ate Energy  and Natural Resources  Committee held hearings on that bill  in October 1990, and the full Senate ap proved the bill that month.  Fort Totten State Historic Site on  the shores of Devils Lake stands as a  monument to the relationship between  the United States Government and the  American Indians. From the policy of  pacification practiced during the mid nineteenth century, to the attempt to  assimilate  Indians  into  the society's  mainstream, to the mid-twentieth cen tury effort to terminate reservations,  Fort Totten reflected the Federal re sponses to the ""Indian question.""  The Park Service testified last year  that there are no uni ts of the National  Park System  like Fort Totten  that  represent the attempts by the Federal  Government  to  assimilate  Native  Americans into our culture. The site is  unique and nationally significant, and  deserves the support of my colleagues.  Fort Totten was founded as a mili tary installation in 1867 and closed as a  reservation community school in 1959.  It is one of the best preserved military  posts surviving from the Indian wars in  the trans-Mississippi west. Fort Totten  played a significant role in American  Indian history, first as an Indian agen cy for Indians coming to the area and  then, from 1890 through 1960, as an In dian industrial school.  To the Army during the nineteenth  century, the Devils Lake area appeared  as an oasis. As a result of the constant  water supply of Devils Lake, the region  had rich vegetation, wild game, and  fish. Because it was remote from the  civilized centers of nineteenth century  America, however, the Devils Lake re gion drew few white explorers  in its  early history. The Indian that sought  the game and shelter of  the Devils  Lake region generally belonged to the  great Sioux or Dakota nation, a  tribe  that  traced  its relations with white  settlers back into the seventeenth cen tury.  The initial spark for military activ ity was struck with the Great Sioux  Uprising of 1862 in Minnesota. The up rising was the culmination of genera tions  of white  harassment,  broken  treaties, and the noticeable absence of  the military due  to  the drain of the  Civil War. Gen. Harry Hastings Sibley  was sent in to quash the rebellion, and  after Congress abrogated all existing  treaties  early  in  1863, many Sioux  bands migrated to areas of refuge and  security and so the forest and waters of  the Devils Lake area became a haven.  The War Department found that kill ing of whites and depredations to prop erty posed a major threat to the ex panding agricultural frontier and thus  demanded a positive and forceful reac tion. By the spring of 1867, the majority of hostile attacks had been limited  to main  travel routes, mail carriers,  and  inter-fort communication routes.  Nevertheless, the sporadic harassment  of the growing and vital lines of com munication and travel became an in creasing  concern  for  the military.  What had been mostly incident-reprisal  warfare between the whites and the In dians became a constant Sioux guer rilla war on early trade, supply, and  travel routes.  In the summer of 1867, 323 soldiers of  the 31st Infantry under the command  of Capt. Samuel A. Wainwright built  Fort Totten about 900  feet  from  the  shore of Devils Lake. From 1867 to 1880,  the post served as an important link to  a  chain of posts  that  included forts  throughout the Dakotas and Montana.  The last hurrah of real military action  for  the  fort came  in 1865 when  the  northern border regions became inse cure as a result of the Riel Rebellion in  Canada.  When  Secretary  of War Redfield  Proctor submitted his Annual Report  of 1890-1891, he recommended that the  fort be closed due to relative calm in  the region. The final military unit at  Fort Totten, ten men under the direc tion of the last post commander, Maj.  S.S. Conrad,  left  the post  for Fort  Abraham Lincoln near Mandan, ND on  December 21, 1890. On the same day all  post buildings were turned over to the  superintendent of the Indian School at  Devils Lake, and the Devils Lake Sioux  opened their first school session at the  abandoned post on January 19, 1891.  Fort Totten's original function had  been  the protection of the  routes of  travel and communication that grew  through its jurisdiction. The men who  struggled with the harsh earlier life of  the prairies went about  their duties  protecting  the  first mail and  travel  routes and escorting the varied map ping,  survey, and  telegraph and rail  crews. In turn, this growth provided an  umbrella of protection for new comm u ni ties. The garrison was a market for  the new  farms, a  store for manufac tured foods for the area's population,  and a source of new settlers.  The military years of the fort, how ever, were only a part of the colorful  history of the site. The military stage  represented only 23 of the 92 years of  operation. The Dawes Act of 1887 at tempted to make Indians self-sufficient  citizens rather than wards of the U.S.  Government and emphasized the need  for a system of industrial schools to be  developed to speed up the process of as similation. Fort Totten became one of  those schools, and its subsequent his tory is a microcosm of the successes  and failures of the Federal relationship  with the American Indian.  Fort Totten remains significant,  in  part, for its magnificent physical sur vival. It is also significant as a result  of the soldiers who lived and survived  there and  the Indians who struggled  ",1991
1080,563,16,Mr. FOGLIETIA.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like  to  insert  in  today's CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  an article written by my niece Thea Foglietta  Silverstein which recently appeared in the Ari zona Business Gazette.  In her article, she  thoughtfully explores the  issues of Al DS and  HIV in the health care community.  HIV DILEMMA IN HEALTH CARE WORKPLACE  (By Thea Foglietta Silverstein)  Recent media attention generated by re ports of a Florida dentist with AIDS  (ac quired  immune deficiency syndrome), who  apparently infected some of his patients, has  led to a call for the mandatory testing of  health care workers. Similarly, some in the  health care industry advocate routine HIV  tests of patients to protect health care work ers from contracting AIDS in the workplace.  Employers should recognize that AIDS is  generally  considered  a  covered  handicap  under federal and most state handicap laws.  The  Federal Rehabilitation Act  of 1973,  which prohibits employment discrimination  against otherwise qualified persons on  the  basis of handicap, is applicable to all recipi ents of federal funds,  including health care  providers who receive Medicare and Medicaid  funds. Under this act, employers are required  to make ""reasonable accommodations""  to  ""otherwise qualified"" handicapped employ ees or job applicants, unless the employer  can show that the accommodation would im pose  ""undue hardship""  on  the  employer.  Reasonable accommodation of an employee  with AIDS may include a change in job du ties, work schedules or department assign ment. With respect to both physicians and  heal th care employees,  the ability of  the  heal th care facility to act on test results is  limited.  A person who tests positive for AIDS prob ably cannot be terminated for that reason,  without bringing  into play  federal  and/or  state handicap discrimination laws. In addi tion, the release of information, suggesting  that the person is perceived as being at risk  for AIDS, may trigger publicity and generate  litigation.  Often, a health care facility will be un aware that a physician has AIDS or has been  infected with the HIV virus. Physicians who  are aware of  their HIV  infection have a  strong disincentive to disclose that to the  hospital or health care facility because of  the possibility of adverse action against the  physician and because of the potentially dev astating impact on the physician's practice  once the condition is disclosed.  The American Medical Association issued  a  statement  in January  in which  it rec ommended  that HIV-infected  physicians  should  either  abstain  from  performing  invasive procedures which pose  identifiable  risks of transmission or disclose their HIV posi tive status prior to performing a proce dure, and proceed only if there is informed  consent by the patient.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Last month the AMA rejected a resolution  proposing mandatory testing of doctors but  endorsed voluntary testing of doctors at high  risk. It also passed a resolution supporting  HIV testing of physicians and other health  care workers  ""in appropriate  situations.""  The AMA resolved to study specific issues re lated to such testing.  In keeping with the AMA's January rec ommendations, health care facilities or med ical staffs may choose  to adopt a policy  under which physicians are responsible  to  disclose  to their patients any physical im pairment, including HIV infection, that may  adversely affect patient care. The facility or  its medical staff also may consider the pol icy of requiring disclosure by physicians of  HIV or AIDS infection to the facility or staff  itself.  Once a health care facility discovers that a  physician has AIDS or is HIV positive, the  facility must decide on a course of action.  Discrimination against the physician could  trigger claims under the Rehabilitation Act  of 1973 and may threaten a facility's tax ex empt status. Policies for dealing with HIV infected physicians should be  implemented  only after consultation with legal counsel  and input from the medical staff. Once im plemented, physicians should be made aware  of the policies and should be provided copies.  Before taking any action concerning a phy sician with AIDS  or HIV  infection,  the  heal th care facility should be certain of the  physician's AIDS diagnosis or aero-positive  status. All information should be kept strict ly confidential. While failure to disclose the  condition to patients may be a source of po tential  liability exposure  if a patient be comes infected by the doctor, disclosure may  be prohibited by state or federal  law, and  subject the facility to a claim by the physi cian.  Moreover,  rather than revoking a physi cian's privileges because he or she has be come infected with the AIDS virus, which  could lead to a handicap discrimination suit,  the facility should attempt to work out an  accommodation with the physician to rede fine the physician's scope of practice, or per haps require the physician to comply with  specific safety precautions.  Each case must be evaluated individually,  based, among other things, on the individual  physician's condition and type of practice.  The  facility  also  should consult with  its  legal counsel as well as the medical staff, be fore attempting to impose requirements of  restrictions on a physician who is infected  with the AIDS virus.  By  its  recently adopted  resolution,  the  AMA  supports HIV  testing of physicians,  other health care workers and patients, con sistent with testing for other infectious and  communicable diseases. Neither the Centers  for Disease Control nor the American Hos pital  Association  recommends  routine  screening of health care employees or pa tients. Both recommend obtaining consent  for testing. In addition to consent, the CDC  recommends that knowledge of test results  be limited to those directly involved in care  of infected patients or as required by law.  The American Nurses Association also re jects compulsory testing of nurses and pa tients but supports voluntary  testing and  disclosure by infected nurses. There is also a  question of whether HIV testing may create  a false sense of security, and may in fact in crease the potential for transmission of com municable diseases,  including HIV  trans mission, from unidentified patients.  It appears that the current weight of au thority does not support mandatory testing.  22909  Rather, the implementation and strict com pliance with Occupational Safety and Health  Administration  and  CDC  standards  and  guidelines for workplace safeguards against  transmission of blood-borne diseases,  cou pled with continuing education of health  care workers on  the  issue of HIV  trans mission, may be the most effective way to  combat the risk of transmission of AIDS be tween patients and health care providers.  HONORING  STANCE  PROGRAM  GRADUATES OF  SUBABUSE  TREATMENT  HON. GARY L ACKERMAN  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 12, 1991  ",1991
1081,563,16,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to call  the attention of the House of Representatives  to the accomplishments of 133 heros.  These are not men and women who are re turning to their lives after winning a battle on  foreign soil  to protect our  liberty,  these are  people who are  first  finding  their  lives, after  facing possibly an even greater enemy and  certainly as dangerous a threat to our society.  I am talking about the men and women of  Samaritan Village, a substance-abuse  treat ment program headquartered in my district.  On August 29, a group of these brave fight ers graduated  from  treatment and  returned  proudly back to society. They have left Samar itan Village after months, and in some cases,  years, of counseling,  intense vocational train ing and extensive restructuring of their values  and aspirations.  They  leave, not dependent and  lost, but  independent, self-confident, and on the road to  fulfillment and happiness. Through their hard  work and intense desire no only to change the  course of their lives, but also to influence oth ers to avoid the same pitfalls, they have en riched their lives and changed the course of  their neighbors' lives as well.  I have been privileged to watch a neighbor hood counseling center grow to be the third  largest  residential  therapeutic community  in  the Nation. Under the dynamic leadership of  Richard Pruss, the president of Samaritan Vil lage, along with Elizabeth Barton, the execu tive vice president, Tino Hernandez, the vice  president for clinical services, Dr. Peter Pinto,  and  the other clinical and support staff,  the  residents of Samaritan Village  receive  treat ment  for  their addiction not based on  their  ability to pay, but based on their desire to heal  themselves.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of my colleagues  in  the House  join me  in congratulating  the  graduates of Samaritan Village, especially as  we celebrate ""Treatment Works"" month  this  September. Congratulations and keep up the  good work!  ",1991
1082,576,16,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker, we  are making very significant progress towards  reforming the archaic, costly, and wasteful al location of the water in the State of California.  In  recent weeks,  leading newspapers  in  southern and northern California have joined  in endorsing legislation by Senator BILL BRAD LEY and mysett that would allow for the redis tribution of some of the water currently under  long-term contracts in order to address severe  fish and wildlife  impacts,  to provide supple mental supplies  for urban areas, and  to  re duce public subsidies.  We have met with business leaders, farnr  ers, and water officials and won unprece dented support for our reforms, which include  an end to the Department of Interior's mind less determination to renew all 40-year water  contracts as they expire for an additional 40  years at current volumes.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Recommitting water in the 1990's as it was  allocated  in  the 1940's, when California had  less than a third of its current population,  is  bad  resource management, bad economics,  and bad for the environment. Water is the key  to  economic growth  and  to  environmental  quality. Agriculture  is a crucial part of our  State's economy, but a relatively small part.  To continue to allocate agriculture 85 percent  of all our water, while some farmers are using  subsidized water  to grow surplus and sub sidized crops, is simply no longer acceptable.  A modest savings, achievable through reason able conservation, improved cropping patterns,  realistic pricing, and retirement of low quality,  contaminated lands can easily produce all the  water urban areas require for the foreseeable  future, and at a significant cost saving to tax payers.  As a  result of  the drought, many  in our  State are rethinking their traditional views on  water allocations. The San Diego Water Au thority, whose agricultural customers pay $400  an acre-foot~ompared to less than one-tenth  that price  in  some Central Valley project served areas-is actively supporting our ef forts, as are developers, municipal officials,  and others in southern California.  The House has already passed  important  drought relief and water reform legislation. We  are very hopeful, based on  the public conr  ments of Chairman Bennett Johnston in San  Francisco last week, that the Senate will soon  act on its bills so that we can enact this long awaited, and  increasingly consensus  legisla tion, without further delay.  This week, the Bay Area Economic Forum,  a coalition of business,  labor, academic, and  local leaders, issued an impressive new report  that  further  strengthens  our  case.  ""Using  Water: A Market-Based Approach  to Califor nia's Water Crisis"" demonstrates that the eco nomic future of our State is dependent on the  development of a modern, growth-oriented,  environmentally sound water policy.  Here is a portion of the executive summary  of this important new report:  USING WATER BETTER  WHY CALIFORNIA NEEDS A WATER MARKET  Experts in water policy often assert that  water allocation is complicated. That is not  true. The truth is that water allocation has  been made complicated by water policy. It is  not the nature of water that makes alloca tion difficult,  it is  the nature of policies  adopted over the years.  In fact, water is one of the simplest com modities known  to man. It literally falls  from  the sky, while ground water comes  from wells. Water arrives in the form most  desired-it does not have to be reprocessed  for use except to remove impurities picked  up in the transportation system.  The complications arise because of an un willingness to treat water the way we treat  most other products. While policy makers  often intervene in the distribution of other  resources-with taxes, restrictions, and regu lations-markets still are relied upon to de termine final allocations within those con straints.  With water, however, policy makers have  not permitted decentralized users to deter mine final allocations, but have instead de cided  to control distribution of water di rectly. And  in doing so,  policy has been  forced to explicitly consider the millions of  decisions about water use-decisions  that  September 12, 1991  would be made more flexibly, automatically,  and at lower cost by individuals in a decen tralized market.  Water is a resource that can be squandered  or used wisely. The difference between these  outcomes is determined by how well the allo cation process works. A look at the current  administrative allocation system  leads  to  one clear conclusion: centralized planners do  not have sufficient knowledge to make wise  choices about how to best allocate water.  In contrast, a decentralized market system  allows actual users to decide how much to  use,  balancing  the  value  of  those  uses  against the value of potential uses by others.  By taking into account these individual-spe cific needs, values, and uses, a market leads  to better allocations. For, while water is a  simple commodity, it has a pervasive and  complicated role in human activities and in dustry, and wise decisions about water re quire the detailed assessment and mutual ad justment possible only at  the  individual  level.  IMPORTANCE TO THE BAY AREA  Reforming the water allocation system is  important to all regions in the state, and the  Bay Area is no exception. In fact, water sup ply problems are threatening to become a  major constraint to the region's growth.  The region's important semiconductor and  computer industries are  threatened. Along  with most other businesses in the area, they  need dependable  sources of high quality  water to maintain their production, yet re cent water policies have undermined reliabil ity, availab111ty, and quality.  A report presented last year to the Bay Vi sion 2020 Commission indicates that eight of  the nine Bay Area counties will meet or ex ceed their water supply capacities by 2010.  Only Sonoma County has a supply sufncient  to support growth beyond that year.  The Retch Hetchy system is  the largest  single water source for the Bay Area, serving  2.6 million people. Nearly all of the existing  capacity of the system is committed to cur rent users. While San Francisco has  the  right  to draw additional water  from  the  Tuolumne River, it lacks the conveyance ca pacity to deliver this water to its customers.  The Contra Costa and Santa Clara Valley  Water Districts together serve almost two  million people. Both draw much of their sup ply from the Delta region. Even in normal  years, water quality is a problem because of  high concentrations of dissolved salts.  The East Bay Municipal Utility District  serves more than one million customers. It  has abundant rights to water from both the  Mokelumne  and American Rivers, but  it  lacks  sufficient  storage  capacity  for  the  former and conveyance facilities for the lat ter.  Exports of water both upstream and from  within the Delta average more than 50% of  total  freshwater  flows.  These  diversions  threaten wildlife, fisheries, and the efforts  by the public and private sectors to reduce  pollution of the Bay and Delta.  Water is a paradox in the Bay Area. It de fines the region, provides much of the phys ical beauty of the area, and is a major reason  the economy has developed and blossomed. It  also is largely taken for granted by the re gion's economic interests. Business has been  complacent,  allowing  the Bay Area's  water districts to deliver water to the area's  nine counties in an uncoordinated fashion.  Further, when water resources have been  threatened,  economic  interests have been  quiet. When the Bay became polluted in the  1960s, and swimming was not allowed in San  Francisco's Aquatic Park, it was environfrl  ",1991
1083,589,16,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, for  the past 40 years, America has been en tertained and  informed by  the ener getic,  thoughtful, and humorous Paul  Harvey. His famous morning blend of  news, humor, and political satire  is  now heard by 22 million people nation wide and  is  radio's longest  running  show. He is respected and admired by  members of government, the broadcast ing industry, and the media; but more  importantly, he is respected and loved  by his audience.  Mr. Harvey has a great ability to dis cover stories which are unique, touch ing, ironic, and at times almost unbe lievable.  He  skillfully  incorporates  these tidbits into his broadcast along  with the important daily events of the  world.  It  is  the combination of his  down home manner and the carefully  crafted content of his show which ap peals so greatly  to Middle America.  Many Members of this body would love  to have Mr. Harvey's gift of commu nication.  Recently, Insight on the News maga zine published an article about Mr.  Harvey which I found most enjoyable. I  ask unanimous consent that a copy of  the article be included in the RECORD  immediately following my remarks.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From Insight, Aug. 5, 1991)  PROFILE, PAUL HARVEY: STAND BY  FOR    THIS QUIRKY NEWSMAN  Summary: For 40 years, homey broadcaster  Paul Harvey has treated middle America to  a picnic of humor, news and political scold ing. He can throw a punch, plug a product,  rattle about world events,  romanticize a  real-life tale-floating with total ease. Har vey, 72, is an unstoppable hobbiest. And, by  the way, he tends to bristle at the conserv ative label.  (By Mark Lawrence Ragan)  It's several hours before dawn on a typical  weekday morning,  and  a  limousine  has  pulled up to 333 N. Michigan Ave.  in Chi cago's Loop. A  balding,  72-year-old man  emerges  from  the car and heads  into  the  building,  taking  the elevator  to a  sound proof radio booth and newsroom perched on  the 16th floor. For the next few hours, he  sifts carefully through the stories that have  come in during the night, searching for the  gems in the never-ending flood of everyday  news, until the engineer gives the signal and  he's on the air.  ""Hello, Americans!"" booms  the  familiar  voice over millions of  radios around  the  country. ""This is Paul Harvey ... Stand by  for ... News.""  The inflated pauses and the staccato deliv ery are the hallmarks of radio's longest-run ning ritual,  the quirky mixture of humor,  irony and journalism known as ""Paul Har vey News and Comment.""  Every morning for 40 years, Harvey has  brought  his  distinctive,  provocative  and  down-home views on issues of the day to an  attentive audience that has grown to 22 mil lion people.  On  this particular morning, for example,  he  runs  through a  quick wrapup of Big  News-soldiers injured by a fire in Iraq, ne gotiations on U.S. air bases  in  the Phil ippines-before  reporting  that nudists  in  Lakeland, Fla., are upset that outsiders are  sneaking a peek  through a hole  in  their  fence. ""Police,"" Harvey says drily, ""promise  to look into it.""  With a contract rumored to be worth more  than $5 mi111on, Harvey is sitting on top of  the  radio world. Of  the  top  five network  radio programs  in  the  country,  three-a  morning broadcast, another at midday and a  feature program called ""The Rest of  the  Story""-are his.  His new book, a collection of homey, off beat stories read on his radio broadcast ti tled For What It's Worth,  is a best-seller.  And Harvey continues  to draw $30,000  for  speeches  to  industry  groups. Even Rush  Limbaugh, radio's sensationally popular talk  show host, can't touch him.  He is widely admired in the industry, even  by those who may not share his conservative  political views. Says Larry King,  the well known national talk show host: ""Someone  once said to me, 'I don't agree with Paul  Harvey, but I'd hire him tomorrow.' He is an  opinionated, engrossingly captivating radio  performer. He's a performer of the news.""  Or, as Les Acree, operations manager of  WIVK  in Knoxville, Tenn., put it: ""Some times he's like a Baptist preacher, and some times it's like someone whispering in your  ear.''  Harvey in person is nearly indistinguish able from Harvey on  the radio: a Norman  Rockwe111sh figure who spins folksy stories  depicting the wit and homespun wisdom of  ordinary Americans. His office is filled with  the memorabilia of everyday America:  the  keys to Sidney, Neb., and Anniston, Ala., and  countless other  towns; a plaque  from  the  Order of the Eagles; a replica of the Statue  of Liberty;  and  numerous  citations  and  awards from Rotary and Kiwanis clubs.  The radio announcer is nothing, if not op timistic. When asked if he'll ever retire, Har vey grins. ""I'm committed to ABC into the  next century.'' Then he talks about his fa vorite tie. It's the one that shows two miners  dancing with joy over discovering gold.  ""I think of myself as getting up every  morning and panning for gold,"" he says. ""I  can't wait to get down to the Teletype ma chines and the fax messages and go through  those thousands of words looking for some  dust, and maybe, here and there, a real nug get.""  But Harvey  is more  than an avuncular  chronicler of middle America. During his  Saturday morning broadcasts, he continues  to deliver acid-tongued jeremiads against big  government,  muddleheaded  bureaucrats  and-a favorite-the ballooning federal defi cit. And though he is viewed as a staunch  conservative,  the commentaries frequently  belie the label.  Few people remember that it was Harvey  who went on the air in May 1970 to denounce  the Vietnam War.  (""Mr. President,  I  love  you-but you're wrong,"" he said.) It was Har vey who, after some gentle prodding by his  wife,  embraced  the Equal Rights Amend ment. And it was Harvey who  lashed  the  Bush administration for becoming too cozy  with Saddam Hussein in the days leading up  to the Persian Gulf war and for agreeing to  raise taxes.  ""His about-face on taxes, when Americans  learned they could no longer trust his lips,  was such a grotesque blunder that the presi dent needs something he can claim as a sig nificant victory,"" Harvey told his listeners  soon after the war erupted.  Not  surprisingly, Harvey  bristles when  people refer to him as a conservative. ""I used  to think I was unabashedly conservative,"" he  says. ""But then one morning I woke up and  found myself in bed with [former Arkansas  Sen.] B111 Fulbright. Here Fulbright had been  the ultimate liberal, and yet we agreed on  Vietnam.  ""Labels keep  changing  Paul Harvey does not.""  His occasional tilt toward liberal stands- he is also pro-choice-has alienated friends  and fans who have at times viewed him as a  turncoat conservative.  ""When  I made my Vietnam broadcast,  some of my dear,  old American Legion  friends  thought I had deserted  them,"" he  says.  ""They were  for America,  right or  wrong. But I don't think our enlightened  generation subscribes to that philosophy. I  think we want our country to be right.""  Paul Harvey Aurandt was born Sept. 4,  1918,  in Tulsa, Okla.-""only 12 years after  Oklahoma had been  Indian  territory,"" he  says. (He dropped the last name after moving  to Chicago during World War II at the advice  of his producer, who feared that the ethnic  name would turn off some listeners.) His fa ther, whom he describes as an ""old Okla homa days lawman,"" was k1lled in the line of  duty on Christmas Eve when Harvey was 3.  His mother rented out apartments  in  the  family home to support Harvey and his older  sister.  ""We were poor, but we didn't know it,"" he  recalls.  ""We didn't have Lyndon  Johnson  telling us where the breakoff point was.""  Harvey got his start in radio when, at age  14, he persuaded a station manager at KVOO  in Tulsa to hire him to do spot announce ments, play the guitar, read the news off the  their meanings.

1084,602,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER.,"  Is  the  Senator finished with the pending com mittee amendment?  Mr. WffiTH. Mr.  President,  this  amendment addresses a  longstanding  prllblem  regarding  oil  shale mining  claims located prior to 1920. Both the  Congress  and  the  courts have  long  grappled with this problem. The House  of Representatives has passed legisla tion to resolve the issue several times  in the past few years, and in January  1990 the Senate Committee on Energy  and Natural Resources unanimously re ported a bill which addressed the prob lem in a  somewhat different manner  than the House.  Today I am offering an amendment  to preserve the status quo so that the  authorizing committees may finally re solve this issue, and both are very close  to doing so.  There  are  approximately  1,600  unpatented oil shale mining claims lo cated on approximately 240,000 acres in  Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming . . These  claims were located prior to 1920 pursu ant to the general mining laws of the  United States.  The Senate has debated and will de vote more time to debating the merits  of the patenting provisions of the min ing law of 1872, under which claimants  who  locate valuable mineral deposits  on Federal lands can apply for and re ceive a patent to the Federal land and  minerals. Today I would like to focus  only on oil shale mining claims.  These oil shale mining claims are dif ferent than other claims in a variety of  ways.  In 1920, Congress enacted  the  Mineral Leasing Act, which provided  for the leasing of oil shale, but grand fathered  existing  valid  claims  that  were thereafter maintained in compli ance with applicable  law. All of the  claims that we are now dealing with  are over 70 years old, creating great  difficulties in providing whether or not  they were  valid  then,  and how we  should  treat  them  today-much  less  what has happened in the 70-year inter vening period of time.  In determining whether a claim has  been maintained  in compliance with  the  law,  the courts have  treated oil  shale mining claims differently  than  other mining claims. The courts have  also established a definition of what  makes an oil shale claim valuable that  is far different from  that applied  to  other claims under  the mining  law  today.  In 1987, we passed a moratorium on  processing oil shale claims on the In te rior appropriations bill,  to give  the  Congress time to legislate a solution to  this controversy, and find a fair way to  protect  the public  interest  in  these  lands. That moratorium expired, but  even so the Department of the Interior  held off processing further applications  for patenting oil shale.  However, they have once again begun  to process pending oil shale patent ap plications.  If action  is not  taken,  240,000 acres of Federal  land may be  sold for $2.50 an acre. If these claims  were made for silver or gold by a miner  under the mining laws as we apply it to  these minerals today,  they would not  be valid. Even under the special rules  and  legal rulings which apply  to oil  shale,  the  status of many of  these  claims is highly controversial.  This amendment provides  for a  6month moratorium on both the accept ance and processing of oil shale mining  claim patent applications, and on the  issuance  of patent  applications  for  which  the  first half final certificate  has not been received. My colleagues  will ask why we should do  this now,  when a legislative solution has eluded  the Congress for the past 5 years? The  answer is, the situation has, I believe,  materially changed and the Congress  can and will soon come up with a legis lative solution.  Last year,  the Senate Energy Com mittee unanimously  reported  legisla tion on  the disposition of  these oil  shale claims, and just a few weeks ago,  my colleague from Colorado, Congress man BEN NIGHTHORSE  CAMPBELL,  in  whose district  the vast majority of  these claims lie, introduced legislation  virtually identical to that reported by  the Energy Committee unanimously  last year.  For the first time, it looks to me as  if the Senate and  the House are far  closer on this issue than they have ever  been before, and that we can now move  forward to reach an agreement and put  it before  the President for his signa ture.  I  strongly urge  the Senate  to  adopt this moratorium and allow the  authorizing committees finally  to re solve this issue in a way that ensures  the best possible protection of the pub lic interest.  I might add, Mr. President, that this  issue became highly controversial  in  the mid-1980's when some 83,000 acres of  oil shale land was patented for the fee  of $2.50 an acre. The people receiving  the patent  turned  right around and  sold that land for well over $30 million,  thereby gaining overnight a $30 million  windfall. But more  important,  that  land went, and nobody believes that it  is going to be used for oil shale.  As  the  situation has changed,  oil  shale as a valuable resource for energy  has just disappeared off the screen. We  are not talking about oil shale any more, and clearly what is going on in a  lot of the areas related  to oil shale  lands are a number of things: Specula tion for gravel, other surface rights, a  whole variety of activities unrelated to  oil shale and unrelated to the purpose  of the original mining law.  Another thing that has happened is  that a vast amount, in this situation  nearly 100,000 acres of prime hunting  territory  became  private  and was,  therefore,  fenced off. This had been  some of the most valuable mule deer  hunting area in the State of Colorado  that suddenly disappeared from public  access, something that we do not want  to have happen here.  Another note, Mr. President, in an swer to questions that were raised ear lier about  this amendment,  is  that  what we have done with this is comply  with the order of Judge Finesilver to  make sure that the mining claims le gitimately held by Marathon are recog nized, and  they would be under  this  amendment. That is why the language  very clearly makes the distinction be tween those who have and have not re ceived  first half final certificate  for  patent. That  takes care of  the one  group that everybody agrees has very  legitimate claims. Those will go. We  will deal  in this legislation with the  other very murky and controversial  claims to the oil shale.  I  have  discussed  this  amendment  with my colleague from Colorado, Sen ator BROWN.  I note that almost all of  the oil shale claims are in the State of  Colorado. I had originally drafted this  moratorium for a year's period of time.  Senator  BROWN  suggested  that we  make  it a  6-month period of  time,  which I have done in this amendment.  None of these funds will be made avail able before April 1, 1992. That is the 6month moratorium.  I think that makes sense, and we can  certainly deal with that both in the  Energy Committee in the Senate, doing  what we did last year, and in the House  of Representatives, and have this legis lation passed.  So I hope this moratorium provides  also a  little greater leverage to BLM  and the Department of the Interior, as  they are attempting to deal with that  and it makes it clear there is a distinc tion between the legitimate Marathon  claims, and there could be as much as  240,000 more acres that could be gone  from the taxpayer ownership, from cit izen ownership, at a modest $2.50 an  acre for lands that really do not have  any value that anybody suggests as an  energy resource.  So I hope  that we can accept  this  amendment. It is a  constructive ap proach, and leads us right into the leg islative solution which will be forth coming, I believe, this fall.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  LIEBERMAN). Without  objection,  the  committee amendment, which is pend ing, will be set aside so that the Sen ator may proceed with his amendment.  Mr. WffiTH.  I  thank the President  and yield the floor.  ",1991

1086,615,16,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. President,  in  the  overall debate on this amendment of  our colleague from Arkansas,  instead  of dealing with and discussing  in a  , broader way the issue of the law itself,  and what my colleague is attempting  to do with his amendment to establish  a moratorium on patents, let me go to  some of the issues that my colleague  has addressed as they relate to what he  suggests is a gross, and unacceptable,  giving of Federal property at some  $2.50 an acre.  One of the things that has been so  profound  in our Nation  for over 200  years is the concept of private owner ship, and that at one time most of this  land was held by the Government. Dur ing certain periods it was given out,  granted out, acquired by private inter ests  for  the  purpose  of generating  wealth.  I thought it was unique that Presi dent Gorbachev was returning from the  Crimea to meet with representatives of  the Republics of the Soviet Union for  the purpose of signing a treaty of the  unions, or a union treaty. And to my  colleague from Arkansas, one of the  clauses in that treaty was to return to  the Republics greater control over the  development, and  the utilization, of  their natural resources.  the history of the mining  law,  there have been some 3 million acres in  which we have granted private rights  In  for the purpose of development; 3 mil lion acres nationwide, all 50 States. In  the State of Arkansas,  the Federal  Government has given  to  that State  approximately 11,936,834 acres, not for  $2.50 an acre, not for $1.50 an acre, but  for nada, nothing, Mr. President.  The  Senator  from Arkansas  reir  resents a State in which the Federal  Government turned over to that State  and private  interests over 11 million  acres of land. Why? To strengthen the  position of the State; to promote the  economy,  to  create  and  generate  human  enterprise.  Private  property  ownership is the basis, and the founda tion, of this country's great wealth. It  always has been and it always will be.  How do we fund the schools of Arkan sas? We fund them from 933,000 acres of  land that the Federal Government gave  to the State of Arkansas for not one  penny. There are some 196,000 other  acres  for  schools.  Those  railroads,  those private interest railroads, those  profit making railroads, were given 2.5  million acres of land in the State of Ar kansas.  I  think  the point  I am  trying  to  make, if it is not now obvious, is the  fact that you can make all of the accu sations you want, but there is another  side to the story. And the other side to  the story is that this Nation has had a  history  of  seeking  to  develop  its  wealth, and generate wealth,  through  the utilization of its public  land re sources. What we are talking about is  the method by which  it  is  accom plished, Mr. President, and how we  seek to continue to do that. It is fun damentally important.  Let us look at the mechanism of the  law itself. We are not changing the 1872  mining law. We are simply saying to  the employees of the Bureau of Land  Management  that  if someone  comes  into a field office, out in the State of  Idaho or Nevada, and they have an air  plication for patent,  that State and  Federal employees cannot take the air  plication. The law is still there. I can  still insist that they do it because the  law says I can go to patent on a claim  if I can prove certain things exist.  Why does our colleague not go before  the authorizing committee and change  the law instead of tying the hands of  the employees of the BLM who, by law,  are required to administer this law? I  will tell you why, because he has tried  and that committee has said no. On  more than one occasion they have said  no, in large part because, thank good ness,  this Congress still believes that  our public lands ought to be allowed to  be utilized when valid for the purposes  of the generation of this kind of na tional wealth.

There are several good reasons  for opposing  this amendment, and  I  would like to briefly discuss those rea sons.  First and most important, the use of  the appropriations process to make a  substantive change in the mining law  of 1872 is objectionable. The appropria tions process is an improper vehicle to  amend the mining law piecemeal. The  public policy implications of such ac tion needs to be evaluated in the larger  context of comprehensive mining law  reform. In both the House and Senate,  authorizing committees with jurisdic tion over the mining law are holding  hearings on mining law reform legisla tion. The issue of patents and whether  the patent process should be modified  is an integral part of these delibera tions  and  should not be  preempted  through the appropriations process. My  esteemed colleague from Arkansas  is  attempting  to  engineer an  end  run  around  the  authorizing  committees  whose  responsibility and current ac tions are addressing this exact issue. In  fact, they are assessing his own bill.  The right to a patent is one of the  most important aspects of a miner's se curity of tenure under the mining law.  After a mineral discovery is made, and  the Government has determined that  sufficient mineralization is present to  justify development of a mine, a patent  is  issued  that  transfers ownership of  the mineralized claims to the miner.  The patent establishes fee ownership.  This ownership is particularly critical  for large-scale mining operations that  may face a great variety of operating  conditions over a period of as long as  100 years. Economic cycles, temporary  closures, and changing  land-use pat terns all result in significant risks to a  mine's existence unless real land own ership exists.  Without  the  ownership  protection  provided by a patent, miners through out  the West will have difficulty  in  bringing a mineral discovery into de velopment. Banks will be reluctant to  finance mines, and miners will hesitate  to expend the large amounts of money  needed  for exploration. As  a  simple  analogy, would a bank loan a person  money on his or her home if he or she  was merely a renter?  Some have argued that our existing  mining law enables companies to con trol vast amounts of land in the Amer ican West. However, the issuing of pat ents under the mining law has in no  way been a  land grab situation that  needs the drastic remedy of a morato rium. The facts speak for themselves:  Since 1781, over 700 million acres of  Federal public lands have been trans ferred  to private ownership for agri culture,  railroads,  mining,  State  grants, timber, stone, and desert lands.  Of that 700 million acres, only 3 million  ",1991

1103,693,16,Mrs. BYRON.," Madam Speaker, let me  first  thank  the gentleman from Ala bama for his work on  this and con gratulate him for  the motion  to  in struct the conferees. It is an issue that  I think is extremely important in these  seven personnel issues included in the  Defense authorization bill  for  fiscal  year 1992. As you know,  in the emer gency legislation last year, we put in  some proposals, and I think to include  those in the proposals for 1992 is impor tant. We worked  long and hard  last  year to come up with a bill and were  unable to get some of this legislation  in because of the scoring problems that  we had which have now been resolved.  The gentleman from Alabama is ab solutely correct, these initiatives cor rect shortcomings in personnel policy  which became apparent during Oper ation Desert Shield and Storm. The  brilliant success of our Armed Forces  during Desert Storm is a direct result  of the resources we invested in recruit ing and retaining the highest quality  fighting force in our Nation's history.  Make no mistake, our stunning victory  in the Persian Gulf belongs to the men  and women who serve our Nation in the  Armed Forces. They were the dedicated  professionals, both active duty and cit izen soldier, who  left  their  families,  homes, communities and, in the case of  reservists, jobs and businesses so that  our Nation could prevail.  We did not achieve this capable and  responsive  force without being  sen sitive to the needs of the people that  make  it work. The  provisions  ref erenced by  the gentleman from Ala bama, and all the other personnel is sues included in the bill, are examples  of our continuing effort to understand  the needs of the members of the Armed  Forces and provide workable, cost ef fective solutions that will ensure we  continue  to attract the best and the  brightest. Given  the  uncertain  and  often dangerous world we live in, how  could we do anything less?  The gentleman from Alabama has fo cused on some of our most important  Persian Gulf war lessons learned from  the  DOD  personnel  policymakers.  While the call-up of Reserve forces was  an unqualified success, we did need to  fine tune procedures and enhance bene fits during  the war  to  recognize  the  special sacrifices of our reservists and  protect  them from unfair  treatment,  and we now need  to make  those ad vancements permanent. As  the gen tleman  from Alabama has  indicated  we: First, opened the opportunity for  reservists to retire in the grade that  they fairly earned during their Desert  Storm service; second, ensured that re serve  heal th providers  received  the  same pay as their active duty cohorts  with whom they served; third, author ized unmarried  reservists  to  receive  housing  allowances  to  support  the  home that they left behind; and fourth,  provided  a  transitional  health  care  plan to ensure that reservists and their  families were protected as  they  re turned to civilian life.  During  the  early  days  of Desert  Shield, it became obvious that aspects  of our pay system needed  to be up dated. The gentleman  from Alabama  has  highlighted  two  important  in creases in compensation that proved to  be critical to morale during the war the increases in imminent danger pay  and family separation allowance. We  need to make both those increases per manent so that we are prepared for the  next contingency. The final issue is re peal of a provision of law that could  prevent both imminent danger pay and  family  separation  allowance  from  being paid in a future Operation Desert  Storm.  Madam Speaker,  I again commend  the gentleman from Alabama for offer ing  the motion  to  instruct  the con ferees.  ",1991
1104,693,16,Mr. DICKINSON.," Madam Speaker, I  would  like to thank the very distin guished gentlewoman  from Maryland  for her remarks. She is chairman of the  Subcommittee on Military Personnel  and Compensation of the Armed Serv ices Committee.  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the very distinguished gentleman from  Virginia  [Mr. BATEMAN],  the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Mili tary Personnel and Compensation of  the Armed Services Committee.  ",1991
1105,693,16,Mr. BATEMAN.," Madam Speaker,  I  thank  the  distinguished  gentleman  from Alabama  for yielding me  this  time, and rise in support of the motion  to instruct conferees sponsored by the  gentleman from Alabama.  As ranking minority member of the  Subcommittee on Military Personnel  and Compensation,  I  fully  supported  these provisions when they were tem porarily enacted in the Desert Storm  supplemental authorization. Now that  we have the opportunity to implement  the  lessons  learned from our Desert  Storm experience, I fully endorse the  effort to make these personnel provi sions permanent law.  A simple glance at the specific provi sions proposed by the gentleman from  Alabama  [Mr. DICKINSON]  illustrates  the wisdom of supporting the motion.  Taken in total, the motion presents a  package of measures that would benefit  active,  guard and  reserve  personnel  who would be involved in future con tingencies. These benefits include:  First, modest increases in imminent  danger pay and family separation pay.  Second,  transitional health benefits  for reservists and others.  Third, special pay for medical, den tal, and other specialists in  the Re serves so that when recalled to active  duty, they can earn what their active  duty counterparts earn.  Fourth, a basic allowance for quar ters so that reservists without depend ents are not forced to sell their homes  solely because they were activated dur ing a contingency.  Fifth, a repeal of prohibitions on the  payment of hostile fire pay and family  separation pay during wartime; and  Sixth, permitting  involuntarily  re called retirees to serve on active duty  in the same rank they held upon retire ment.  I am sure that my colleagues in the  House will agree that these are reason able provisions in the existing House passed version of the fiscal year 1992-93  Defense Authorization Act. They are  already budgeted for in the framework  of a reduced defense budget. Further more, they recognize the special hard ships endured by military personnel particularly those in the Reserve com ponents and involuntarily recalled re tirees-When they are forced by unex pected national emergencies  to  leave  civilian life and serve  in a potential  war zone.  I ask Members to support the motion  by the gentleman from Alabama.  ",1991
1106,693,16,Mr. FRANK.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself 3 minutes.  I want to express my admiration for  the work done by the Subcommittee on  Military Personnel and Compensation,  and as I said previously, my support for  the instructions contained in the mo tion of the gentleman from Alabama.  We are not debating whether or not  those ought to be in the instructions.  We are debating then only one ques tion, whether in addition to that we  should add an instruction which first,  ",1991
1107,706,16,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Please  make me part of that.  I was  lucky  enough to have President Bush appoint  me to be leader of the Presidential del egation to the 50th anniversary of the  Battle of Britain and to the air show  last year, and most people do not know  the great role we played because Presi dent Roosevelt was doing a lot of this  sub  rosa,  the great  role we  played  along with the Commonwealth nation,  then Canada, in training all of these  young British aviators who went and  faced Adolf Hitler  and  his Fascist  hordes alone during the early years of  the war. So I do know  the role that  Oklahoma played and also some bases  around the country, like Thunderbird  Field in California, training Flying Ti gers to go over to fight as civilians and  then the war caught up with them and  only a handful fought before Pearl Har bor, but that 50th anniversary, I invite  the gentleman to be with me at Pearl  Harbor coming up December 7. We will  try to put together a Codel, and I sure  accept the invitation to be there with  the gentleman.  ",1991
1108,706,16,Mr. INHOFE.," That would be great.  We had,  in  the 40th anniversary,  I  was  there at that time, we had  this  group. There  is no greater bunch of  guys than those guys that fought from  Great Britain, and they all looked so  young considering how old they must  have been. Maybe  they drafted  them  into that at 12 years old.  The gentleman talks about the Bat tle of Britain Museum. Every time I go  to London, this same group that I met  10 years ago, we meet and we go out to  the museum out there and see the old  hoppers and everything that we enjoy  so much looking at now. In areas, espe cially in my district, simulators, flight  simulators, not just the big companies  like Aviation Resources,  Inc.,  and  Burtek and Flight Safety, but we have  seven more, Aero Weld, AMI, mll,  Rediffusion  Simulation,  and  Safety  Training Systems, Inc. Virtually all of  the simulators used throughout Amer ica in defense and in civilian aviation  are manufactured right in Tulsa, OK.  The second reason I wanted to go was  because  as many of  the pilots are  aware, we have a problem in congested  air space. I have a bill; in fact, I was  not the one who thought of this change  in air space. It was a guy that was  from, I believe the district of the gen tleman from California. ms name was  Barry Shiff. Barry Shiff is a TWA pilot  who  told me back  in 1986, he  said,  ""Why won't Congress look at our cor ridor system for getting into TCA's and  ARSIS for VFR pilots?"" We went into  it. We have experimented  in several  areas.  When I  left for my trip around the  world, I did not have one coauthor on  that bill. Two days after I got back, in cluding those who are in the Chamber  today, I had 136 coauthors. So as a re sult of that, I think that did give some  credibility in order to get some things  passed in the House of Representatives  concerning air space.  We had a number of sponsors on this  trip, as we always have to have. Mobil  was the sponsor that bought the gaso line and also  their A V-1 engine oil.  This is 100 percent synthetic oil. It was  so good that we, by accident, had to  break in a new engine, a right engine,  on  that oil. That  is something nor mally you do not consider doing on  synthetic oil. To this day, it does not  use a drop. Another one was A vemco,  writing the insurance.    I do have to single out, when one is  trying to fly around the world, we had  one of  the gentlemen with us,  Joe  Cunningham, who was a navigator in  World War  II on B-17's. So we had  ground  reference charts  in case our  system went down. But we had, from  Trimble Navigation, a global position ing system that was redundant. We had  one with a back up that was Omega and  one with a backup that was loran. And  the satellites never came down. The  system never failed.  We went entirely around  the world  and knew within 50 meters where we  were all the time. That was the system  that is shown in these two items here  on  this panel,  the 421  that we  flew  around the world.  I hasten to mention one other name,  too. ms name is Dr. Millard Harmon  from Delmar, NY. Dr. Harmon has  flown  his Bonanza  into  the Soviet  Union, into places mostly in the area  of Moscow and Leningrad. He was a big  help to us on this tip.  So if I might, I would like to take  just a few minutes and take us around  the world,  the way we went. Then I  want to return to three places for the  three lessons that I learned, or remind ers. I did not need to learn those les sons, because I knew them before I left.  We were going  to make  this cir cumnavigation  from Tulsa, OK,  to  Tulsa. Then we decided, since there is  an airport  in Oklahoma named after  Wiley Post, we would also make  it  from Wiley Post to Wiley Post.  As it turned out, since I had to jump  in the plane and come back to Wash ington, we also had one from Washing ton National to Washington National.  We  took off  from Washington Na tional after coming up here from Okla homa. We had to vote for 3 days, and I  did not want to leave until after that.  That coincided with the day that Wiley  Post was leaving on his trip around the  world 60 years ago.  So we  took off from National Air port, and I have to say, and it is kind  of an indictment on our system,  the  only runway delay that we had of any  length of time at all was at Washing ton National Airport.  In fact, we had  to  take off  to go  around  the world without our  IFR  clearance, and we had to pick that up  right before getting into Moncton and  crossing into Canada.  ",1991
1109,706,16,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Let me  ask the gentleman one question. A lot  of world attention,  I mean amazing  world attention went to Dick Rutan,  the younger brother, and Jeana Yeager  in  their nonstop  flight  around  the  world, because  they were going for a  record. And they flew a little south of  your route, but they took off at Ed wards and landed at Edwards. So they  did not have a chance to learn some of  the lessons that you did or have them  reinforced. And between the  two, ex cept for going in the history books and  saying I flew around the world nonstop,  what was  it called,  the Condor? The  It  is  hanging  in  the  Voyager.  ",1991
1110,719,16,Mr. WELLSTONE.," We  should  tap  into the ideas and creativity and com mitment of those people working in the  State level on health care reform. In  the history of our country States have  often served with distinction as  the  leaders and the laboratories for reform.  And so, Mr. President, it is in this  spirit that I have developed an amend ment to the leadership health care legislation. My proposed amendment en courages  individual States  to set up  single-payer systems on a  statewide  basis as model demonstration projects.  The amendment specifies minimum re quirements that States must meet to  qualify  for  Federal  financial  incen tives. But the States will be given max imum flexibility  to design  their own  single payer systems.  Under this amendment, a public au thority  in  each  participating State  would administer the single-payer plan  or a public employee or a public au thority  would  designate  an  intermediary agent to administer the  plan.  For States  that  qualify,  the  amendment  encourages  the develop ment of a  single-payer system with  some grant money. It provides States  that implement  the single-payer sys tem  with  Federal  waivers  for  AmeriCare, for Medicare, for Medicaid,  for ERISA-in other words, States that  move forward with their single-payer  systems will receive the same amount  of Federal money. There is also a pro vision for matching Federal grants for  the 10 demonstration States that im plement single-payer plans.  Mr. President,  I must acknowledge  and thank all the people, particularly  in my home State of Minnesota, who  have given so generously of their time  and who have helped me to develop the  policy  that  is embodied  in this pro posed amendment.  I also want to pay tribute to Rep resentative MARKEY. His work  in the  House of Representatives is essentially  on what we built this amendment. His  bill is called the State Health Reform  Opportunity Act.  It was  introduced  earlier in the House of Representatives  by my friend from Massachusetts, and  I  thank him for his work. This pro posed amendment is built upon his leg islation.  I would encourage my colleagues to  help improve and refine this proposed  amendment. I think it is going to hap pen in the discussion and in the debate.  I would urge my colleagues to give a  lot of thought of this general concept  of State-enabling  legislation so  that  States can move  forward with  their  own proposals if we have gridlock in  Washington.  But I would conclude, Mr. President,  by saying in as strong a way as I can,  in  the  last analysis we must under stand that this is a national crisis and  it certainly requires a national solu tion. In no way, shape, or form should  we put the burden on the States. I am  talking about enabling legislation that  allows States  to move  forward with  their own proposals, backed by some  Federal waivers  and  incentives,  be cause I think that may be the way we  move our country forward.  As I said earlier, this is a national  crisis.  Too many people  in  this country  have no health  insurance,  too many  people in this country have too little  health insurance, and too many busi nesses in our country cannot afford to  cover their employees with health in surance. Virtually no one in this coun try, no one in this country, including  everybody in the gallery today, is im mune from the crisis that could affect  them if there is a catastrophic illness  and expense in their own families. Too  many individuals and too many busi nesses and the vast majority of people  in our country are affected by our fail ure to move forward with serious na tional health care reform.  Roosevelt  talked about  it in 1935.  That was over a half a century a.go. But  I will  tell you something, Mr. Presi dent. There is no question in my mind  that we could do much better, much  better in a country which spends more  on health care than any other country  in the world and in a country which  has the best medical services and the  best research in the world, the tragedy  being that it is not for all the citizens  who live in our country. It is time for  a fundamental change to address a fun damental problem. There really is no  other choice but to enact major health  care  reform  in  the United States of  America. This time of crisis requires  no less.  Mr. President, I will finish by speak ing in a very personal way to you, be cause you are someone, from the time  I first came to the Senate, with whom  I have had a chance to speak in il-very  informal and personal way. I want to  do well for people in the State, and I  think the way you do well for people is  to try to understand what people are  really thinking about, what they really  care about, and you try to enact good  public policy  that will  improve  the  lives of people. You try to enact public  policy that will make a real difference.  I am convinced  that  the honor of  speaking in this Chamber, the honor of  being in the Senate----every single day I  think about the honor of it-is to be  here to do well for people. I did not say,  Mr. President, that it would be easy.  You have so much experience and you  know how difficult it is to pass major  legislation. I am just starting out in  the Senate. But what I want to say in  this Chamber today is that I think this  is an important idea. I think this pro posed  amendment  is  an  important  amendment.  I really look forward to being a part  of the discussion and the debate start ing in my own committee, the Labor  and Human Resources Committee, and  the debate and discussion we will have  on the floor.  This is what it is all about. This is  why you put so much sweat and tears  to a campaign to get elected, so you  can come to Washington and develop  legislation, and you work with your  colleagues. So you never give up; you  keep on pushing and you keep on push ing until you pass legislation that you  ",1991
1111,732,16,Mr. CONRAD., I am pleased to yield  to the Senator.  ,1991
1112,732,16,Mr. JEFFORDS.," I am concerned with  the  issues he raised, and that is the  reason we reduced ours, because there  was  evidence  that  the  rate  of  the  Synar,  the one in the bill before us,  would hurt farmers.  We have exempted grasslands. Look ing at the census of 1983, with respect  to North Dakota, it lists 18,548 produc ers at that time, but only 100 would be  affected by this bill.  Is that accurate? This is what our  evidence is, that only 100 of your farm ers out of the whole State would be af fected by my amendment. I appreciate  knowing the answer to that.  ",1991
1113,732,16,Mr. CONRAD.,"  I will be glad to do  that. The Senator is right if the Sen ator accepts the notion that this would  only apply to the BLM lands and would  not be soon  translated over  into  the  national grasslands.  Let me just say right now, national  grasslands are paying about double the  AUM rate that the BLM land is paying.  I think it is clear what would happen.  This  situation  of  differential  rates  would not last very long; one rate on  one  type of public lands and another  rate on other public lands is not sus tainable. Even if the current legisla tion  directly  affected  the  national  grasslands, it would not be large num bers of people because we only have 630  lessors, including on the grasslands.  Let me say I do not care if only one  rancher is affected. If you could spend  ",1991
1114,745,16,Mr. REID.," Mr. President,  I would  first like to express my admiration and  respect to my friend,  the junior Sen ator from the State of Vermont, for the  way  in which he has presented  this  amendment.  I do not agree with the amendment. I  strongly oppose the amendment. But I  do believe the Senator from Vermont,  knowing him the way I do, thinks his  position  is right.  I hope  in  this day  that we  have been able  to educate  those Members of the Senate, including  my friend from Vermont, how people  do not understand the Western part of  the United States, how,  in  fact,  it  would have been better had this legis lation been presented to the authoriz ing committee where hearings could  have been held, where evidence could  have been taken, and that the matter  could have reached the floor, if in fact  it would  have  reached  the  floor,  through the ordinary authorizing proc ess. This is not the appropriate place to  deal with a matter of this magnitude.  For those Members present who may  not understand  the grazing  fee  formula, let me, Mr. President, provide a  few brief facts to shed additional light  on  this complex matter. As we have  been told by people who have appeared  here  before,  PRIA,  or  the  Public  Rangelands  Improvement  Act,  was  passed in 1978, and is based on a set of  three  things: One,  the price of beef;  two, the cost of production; and three,  the lease rate index, which is the dif ference between the cost of grazing on  public and private lands. These issues  have more to do with policy than ap propriations, and  therefore  it should  not be on this Interior appropriations  bill . .  It has been argued that grazing fees  on public  lands constitute a  subsidy.  Conveniently, this argument generally  falls well short of a thorough examina tion of factors  that go  into grazing  livestock on public lands.  Mr. President, I should like to take a  short time this afternoon to talk about  some things that have been raised dur ing  the debate and  things  that have  been raised only indirectly during this  debate. These are what we can call key  talking points about grazing fees.  For example, Mr. President, over the  past 4 years the grazing fee has been  increased by almost 50 percent-to be  exact, 46 percent. The grazing fee for mula has changed because it was set up  to change. But the formula does pro vide, under the bases that I just indi cated,  stability  and  predictability.  That  is what  this  important part of  American industry, that is, the cattle  industry, needs, stability and predict ability. That is why in 1978 the formula  was developed.  It  is  true  that private  rangeland  rents are typically higher than public  rangeland grazing  fees. We  acknowl edge that. But we have not discussed  here today in any detail the fact that  private leases are self-sufficient units,  where  the  owner  typically provides  fencing,  water  improvements,  and  roads.  On  public  lands, by contrast, Mr.  President, almost nothing is provided.  Instead,  the public  leaseholder must  bear most of  these  costs,  including  larger management costs, higher death  loss and poor animal performance due  to the inherently wider open range en vironment.  Finally, ranchers leasing public lands  also bear the increased costs of com plying with today's range management  guidelines-and we will  talk  about  some of those, but they are significant.  Public land livestock grazing makes  a  significant  contribution  to  rural  economies in the West. Mr. President,  consider 88 percent of the cattle pro duced in Idaho, 64 percent in Wyoming,  and 63 percent in Arizona depend  in  part on public grazing  lands.  In Ne vada, my State, 87 percent of the land  is owned by the Federal Government.  We  cannot  lease private  lands. It is  owned by the Federal Government-87  percent of it.  For this reason, the Director of the  Bureau of Land Management maintains  that significant  increases  in grazing  fees would result  in devastating  im pacts on Western States where  the  ranching areas have historically  low  base values.  Even if no livestock grazing were per mitted,  the Bureau of Land Manage ment and  the Forest Service would  still bear the cost of basic legislative  requirements such as monitoring, anal ysis, and management. In fact, if the  practice of grazing lands ended tomor row, the Bureau of Land Management  estimates that its range management  program budget would increase by as  much as 50 percent.  I think it is of note, Mr. President,  that in 1990 the Bureau of Land Man agement  grazing  fee  receipts were  about $19 million, roughly two-thirds  of the BLM's $29 million budget. Those  moneys would  have  to  come  from  someplace.  I  think  it is also  interesting  that  there are many, many scholars who  talk about the ranges of this Nation  being in the best condition they have  been in during this century.  I have a magazine article here that  we distributed, Mr. President,  to all  the Senators. We did that last year. It  is interesting that in this magazine we  supplied to  the entire Senate-Range  magazine, spring of 1991, on page 12  there is a picture from the State of Ne vada. In fact, it is a picture within a  picture. It shows some rangelands with  grass  that is knee high. But on  the  inset in this photograph, we have a pic ture taken in 1919 that shows devasta tion. It shows mud holes, it shows the  exact same  feature of land, without  thick  foliage  on  it;  the other dev astated because of overgrazing. This is  how the rangelands have improved.  There  is also  a  picture  from  the  Santa Rosas,  also  in Nevada,  that  shows a hillside that is denuded, that  has  been  overgrazed  especially  by  sheep, and it shows there being nothing  in this land. Whereas, in 1991, it shows  beautiful, thick rangeland.  There are many other such examples  that show the change of the rangelands  based  upon  proper  management.  Rangelands  have  not gotten worse.  They have gotten better.  It is like mowing a lawn or pruning.  Controlled  grazing  promotes  plant  vigor and diversity, aerates soil and  scatters seeds. Grazing itself, plus the  brush clearing, and grazing operations  also help prevent fires.  That, Mr. President, is fact, not fic tion.  We know that by bringing on water  and salt for  livestock, and the other  improvements  that  ranchers make,  that the rancher invites a host of other  animals, including, in fact, many pred ators.  On public lands, the cost of predation  and disease are cyclically higher than  ",1991

1123,758,16,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, it is  obvious we are trying to accommodate  several people with conflicting inter ests and conflicting schedules. So let  me make a suggestion to all of the Sen ators here, that in order to permit the  full debate that Senators want on the  grazing amendment, the Senators from  New Mexico and Wyoming indicated a  number of Senators still want to speak  on  it,  that we  set  that debate  for  Wednesday during which time we are  not going to have any rollcall votes be cause of the religious holiday. There  could be the 4 hours that the Senator  wanted or perhaps even more, and then  have the vote on that set for first thing  on Thursday morning. Tomorrow we  could take up Transportation and be  able to spend the full day at it.  We now had 1 full day of debate on  the grazing amendment. This would  permit another full day of debate on  the grazing amendment and would ac commodate  the schedules of all con cerned and give everybody  the  time  they want to debate this.  Several Senators have already spo ken, and if the Senator indicates they  want 4 or 5 hours we can do  that on  Wednesday, the one exception being we  have to accommodate Senator METZEN BAUM  to permit him to speak in the  morning because he will not be here on  Wednesday, and he was not able  to  make it today. That way we could take  care of all of the time and all of the  Senators without slowing up the busi ness of the Senate.  ",1991
1124,758,16,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, will  majority leader yield?  ",1991
1125,758,16,Mr. MITCHELL., I yield to the distin guished chairman.  ,1991
1126,758,16,Mr. BYRD.," That is agreeable to me. I  would like to have the understanding,  however,  between ourselves and  the  two leaders that on Wednesday if other  amendments to the Interior bill were  the  available to be called up that we could  call them up, debate them, and perhaps  set them over to Thursday. There is a  rollcall vote added. I simply want an  understanding  that we  not  confine  Wednesday to the grazing fee amend ment.  ",1991
1127,758,16,Mr. MITCHELL., That was not my in tention. My intention is to set aside a  period of time for the grazing amend ment and also permit other business to  occur. If we are fortunate we might be  able to conclude action on the entire  measure by votes on Thursday morn ing.  ,1991
1128,758,16,Mr. NICKLES.," If the majority leader  will yield a moment, I think there is an  interest on this side to try to conclude  debate tomorrow. And I think the Sen ator's  original  proposal  has  great  merit. And he was talking about hav ing a vote no later than 4 o'clock to morrow. I  think that is in this Sen ator's interest and in the interest of  the  chairman of  the Appropriations  Committee. We would like to see this  issue resolved and we could do a lot of  other  things.  I  think we could work  that out.  I have a  list of 3 hours of requests,  but I also know many colleagues on  this list who were asking for 30 or 20  minutes we could probably get down to  5 or 10 and still have that vote. If we  can have 2 hours tomorrow, we should  be able to finish this amendment and  not waste all Wednesday on it.  Mr. DOMENIC!.  I  agree.  I  believe  Tuesday is better than Wednesday with  the vote on Thursday.  We have another problem with that.  We have to check with someone on the  Wednesday and Thursday scenario.  I  think an hour each on each side, start ing at 2 and finishing at 4, would be  sufficient on our side. As we have been  talking, and as the distinguished chair man of the committee said, a motion  to table is in order any time, and if we  lose  the motion  to  table we do not  know where the bill is going. It may be  a  long discussion, and it may be over  with, and you may be in conference.  We want  to be helpful. Some of us  have  to go  to  conference with  the  chairman. We do not want this amend ment  tagging along. We want  to go  there without it. We want to do our  best. I believe if you propose 2 hours  equally divided starting at 2,  the vote  on it, or about it, to occur thereafter,  I  think you would have no objection  from what I can tell here on this side.

It is my  intention to vote for the tabling mo tion at the moment. That is my inten tion. I think you are going to win. So  certainly  I  I hope I am incorrect in sensing that  the Transportation bill  is being held  hostage because of this amendment.  If we do not get Transportation fin ished tomorrow, it will not get finished  until Thursday and we do not get this  bill-I say ""this bill""-we do not get  Interior finished Thursday anyhow, no  matter which bill.

1134,758,16,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," It would be at a  fairly  substantial personal  inconven ience  if we  had any votes after 3  o'clock tomorrow.  This has been a  long debate. Appar ently, it is going to continue  tomor row. Why would it not be possible to  have  the debate cutoff tomorrow and  have the vote taken at a time certain  Thursday morning with no further de bate?  The Transportation bill is ready, has  been ready, to come up tonight if we  can get a  time certain for the debate  on the Transportation bill. I would be  pleased  to enter into  that kind of a  time agreement and, let us say, have  that start at 9:15, 9:30, and end at 2, if  that would be acceptable to the leader ship, and have a vote at that time.  I do not know of any controversial  amendments. It is possible there would  be and we would have to take them up  in the order as they arise. But it would  be a terrible personal inconvenience for  me on this particular holiday to have  any vote later than 3 o'clock. I have to  get up to New Jersey. I hope my col leagues would  understand  that  and  would cooperate.  But the Transportation bill, if we can  get a  time certain, start the debate  later on the grazing bill, and have that  vote carry over until the next time the  Senate assembles Thursday morning.

1140,771,16,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, last month  the Department of Labor released its  report on the glass ceiling confirming  what many of us have suspected all  along-the existence of invisible, artifi cial barriers blocking women and mi norities  from advancing up  the cor porate ladder to management and exec utive level positions.  I have carefully reviewed this report  and consider it an important and his toric  first step  in building a much needed and long-overdue record on this  issue. I congratulate the Secretary of  Labor-and for that matter her prede cessor-on this report and look forward  to working with her on this issue down  the road.  EQUAL ACCESS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY  For  this Senator,  the  issue  boils  down  to  ensuring  equal  access and  equal opportunity. These principles are  fundamental  to  the establishment of  this great Nation and the cornerstone  of what other nations and other people  consider unique to the United States-= namely, the possibility for everyone to  go as far as their talents and hard work  will take them.  But as  this  report  indicates,  the  American dream may not be as easy for  some to pursue as for others. Indeed,  while women and minorities make up  over half the workforce, studies indi cate that they hold less than 5 percent  of senior management positions in big  corporation&-representing only  a  2percent increase since 1979.  While  there  is no  right or correct  number, and my opposition to any no tion of quotas could not be stronger,  you do not have to be a brain surgeon  to deduce that something is wrong out  there.

1141,784,16,Mr. ADAMS.," Mr. President, today I  rise  to speak once again on behalf of  the Congressional Call  to Conscience  Vigil for Soviet Jews. It is truly unfor tunate  that we must mark another  year with these statements to call at tention  to  the continued difficulties  faced by Soviet Jews who wish to emi grate.  Since 1978, Members of the House and  Senate have spoken out to remind our  colleagues and our constituents of the  thousands of Soviet Jews waiting  to  leave the Soviet Union. In the last year  over 200,000 Jews have emigrated from  the Soviet Union, and while the rate is  increasing, there are still hundreds of  thousands of Jews waiting to get out.  Hundreds of families, for one reason or  another, are still listed as refuseniks  and we must work to draw attention to  their cases and encourage a more liber alized emigration policy.  In spite of the unprecedented events  of the past month in the Soviet Union,  we must not forget that thousands of  refuseniks are still unable to emigrate  freely, anti-Semitism  is on  the  rise,  and  the  future of  the Soviet Union  raises serious questions about future  emigration policies. Over the last few  weeks  the nationalist movements of  the Ukrainian, Moldavian, and Central  Asian Republics have spawned a rash of  anti-Semitic incidents. Unfortunately,  it does not  look  like  these develop ments will reverse  themselves in the  near future.  I would like to bring to the attention  of my  colleagues  the  case  of Alla  Iosifovna Makavoz of Kharkov in the  Ukraine. Mrs. Makavoz is the mother  of Seattle resident David Makavoz and  the grandmother to he and his wife Ma rina's two small children. David and  Marina Makavoz were allowed to emi grate to the United States in 1989 and  Mrs. Makavoz has not seen her children  or her grandchildren  in more  than a  year and a half. Mrs. Makavoz is suffer ing from breast cancer. After complica tions with her first cancer operation,  Mrs. Makavoz  is desperate  to be  re united with her family  in the United  States and  to  receive  the advanced  treatment she needs as a result of com plications related to the poor care she  received with her first cancer operation  in  the Soviet Union. Mrs. Makavoz  needs to receive a Soviet exit visa and  expedited  entrance  into  the United  States immediately, so  that she may  receive  this much needed  treatment.  On July 3, 1991,  she received refugee  status. To date, Mrs. Makavoz has still  not been allowed to emigrate, despite  her desperate circumstances.  Though thousands have been able to  leave the Soviet Union, hundreds more  remain on the refusenik list and thou sands more are not even allowed  to  apply for emigration because of their  ",1991
1142,797,16,Mr. DREIER of California.," Mr. Speaker, the  benefits  of  IRA  participation  are  currently  skewed heavily  toward working mates, and  away  from women who work either  in  the  home or in lower paying jobs. Spouses should  have the same individual retirement rights as  those working outside the home. That's why  today,  I am  introducing the Spousal Savings  Act. This legislation will address this inequity  by  granting  nonworking  spouses  the  full  $2,000 deduction for IRA contributions.  Current  I RA  rules are  inequitable  in  three  ways. First, the extra $250 allowed a worker  with  a  nonearner  spouse  is  inadequate.  Homemakers should not have to rely on their  spouse to set up and contribute to an IRA on  their behalf. Rather, they should be able to set  up and contribute to an I RA in their own right.  Second,  the spousal restrictions effectively  ignore the full worth of work done in the home.  The fact that individuals who perform this work  are overwhelmingly  female adds  to  the  im pression that society undervalues work done  primarily by women.

Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk in  recent months about  the need  to make our  Tax Code fair toward families. I support these  efforts, and hope my colleagues will not ignore  the discrimination  that exists against single earner couples with  respect  to  I RA contribu tions. The Spousal Savings Act will  bring  about equity with little loss of revenue.

E. 1HOMAS COLEMAN  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 16, 1991  Mr: COLEMAN of Missouri. Mr. Speaker,  here we are-on September 16. The signifi cance of this date is that it effectively leaves  7 days for Congress to act and reauthorize the  surface  transportation programs before  they  expire on September 30. To date, the Demo crat leadership has failed to bring a bill to the  floor on which members could act. President  Bush stood before Congress  in March and  challenged both bodies to act on the transpor tation bill within 100 days. We have seen 100  days come and go with no highway bill. The  administration has submitted their proposal for  consideration. The Senate has acted. Where  is the House highway bill?  As majority leadership haggles over political  points, they are causing us to lose the oppor tunity to act responsibly. Now that the commit tee has produced a bill, it should be up to the  Members  to vote on  these difficult  issues,  such as the gas tax-instead we lose precious  time as these decisions are made for us be hind closed doors.  It causes one  to wonder  about the motive for these delays. Is it to en hance national transportation policy to benefit  constituents? It would seem not.  As a result of failing  to get this bill  to  the  floor in a timely fashion, roads will not be built.  In my district in Missouri, construction will be  halted on important projects. For example,  in  St. Joseph, bids for a project on a major artery  through  the city-Frederick Boulevar~were  to be  let  in November. This  is a $3 million  project.  In Maryville, the  request for bids  for  the  first phase of a  long-awaited project-a  bypass on Highway 71-was scheduled  for  October. This is an $8 million project. On one  of  the most  important north-south  links  in  northwest Missouri-Highway 65--bids were  to be  let in October to replace a bridge over  railroad tracks in Livingston County. This is a  $3 million project.  These projects will not go forward if the sur face transportation programs are permitted to  expire. The Nation's  infrastructure  is vital  to  the economic development of these commu nities. Businesses depend on  the  infrastruc ture to get their wares to market. Emerging in dustries are attracted  to communities based  on the ease with which they can access their  23143  markets, and depend on this infrastructure for  their economic viability.  I should think that as  people and businesses are struggling during  these difficult economic times, getting this bill  to the floor would be the greatest priority for  Congress. Then why does the majority leader ship hold up action on this bill?  We are on the verge of making tremendous  strides in transportation policy, which will  im pact the future of our country. I want to see us  go forward, not remain static, and certainly not  bring the programs to a dead stop. I urge the  leadership  to  bring  reauthorization  of  the  transportation programs to the floor, and allow  us to vote. Let's get this show on the ""road.""  C.M. BATES, JR., OF KENTUCKY  HON. WIUJAMH. NATCHER  OF KENTUCKY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 16, 1991  ",1991
1143,797,16,Mr. NATCHER.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  take this opportunity to pay tribute to the late  C.M. Bates, Jr., who served as an employee  of the House of Representatives beginning in  1942 and extending until the late 1970's. Dur ing this period, he served for 5 years as build ing superintendent, and he served with dignity  and honor. A building superintendent, as we  all know,  is the position involving maintaining  facilities in the three House of Representatives  office buildings. He was always ready to be of  assistance to all of the Members, and during  his tenure as an employee of the House, he  established many friendships. He was an ex emplary figure and made every effort to see  that our buildings were in excellent order and  convenient for all of the Members.  Mr. Bates was born in Dry Creek, KY, and  he moved to the Washington area and began  working for the House in the year 1942.  While a resident of the metropolitan area,  he lived in Falls Church, VA, and later on lived  in Greenville, NC, Ocean City, MD, and New  Carlisle, OH. He was married  to Sylvia S.  Bates and  is survived by his mother, Anna  Bates of New Carlisle, OH; two sons, Richard  S. Bates of Mclean, VA, Robert Bates of  Ocean City, MD; and two grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, the reason why the House of  Representatives operates in an orderly, excel lent manner is because we have people like  C.M. Bates, Jr., who work with us  to make  sure that this condition exists. He was a man  dedicated  to his assignment and one who  loved and respected the House of Represent atives of the U.S. Congress.  I salute his many accomplishments and am  grateful for the contributions that he made to  our House of Representatives.  I extend my  sympathy to all of the members of his family.

1145,823,16,Mr. HOUGHTON.," Mr. Chairman,  Ralph  Waldo Emerson once said something  to  the  effect that consistency is the mark of a small  mind. Hobgoblin, I think, is the word he used.  Well, I plead guilty. Because, despite the fact  that I stand solidly behind a single-minded ap proach to deficit reduction (this whole sloppy,  borrow-from-tomorrow technique is going to do  us  in),  in  this particular case  I support  the  stretching out of benefits for the unemployed.  Will there be more pressure on the budget?  Sure. Will  there be  ""freeloaders""  trying  to  abuse the system? Sure. But put into perspec tive,  there are people out  there who need  help-the present unemployment  insurance  system  is not working. And  if  there  is one  thing central government should do,  it  is  to  step  into  the breach periodically and help  those who, through no fault of their own, can not help themselves.  Although I vote today for a change on the  extension  in  the  unemployment  insurance  laws, tomorrow I plan to resume course and to  fight, to cut, to reduce, to save so that we will  avoid being swept over the Niagara Falls of  deficit financing.  ",1991
1146,823,16,Mr. GUARINI.," Mr. Chairman,  port of H.R. 3040.  As chairman of the Budget Committee task  force on urgent fiscal  issues,  I recently held  hearings on  the plight of  the unemployed.  Workers who have lost their jobs and run out  of benefits  related  their own experiences.  I  wish  I could capture on  this  floor today  the  same heartfelt anguish that these people ex pressed to me.  Unemployment  is a frightening  thought  for  someone who supports a  family.  It  is even  more frightening to run out of benefits without  finding a new job.  And I'll tell you what else is frightening: The  growing number of unemployed workers,  the  growing number of workers exhausting  their  benefits without  finding new  jobs, and  the  growing number of workers not receiving any  unemployment benefits at all.  With  a national  unemployment  rate  proaching 7 percent, we now have over 8112  million people out of work. My district in New  Jersey has been particularly hard hit, with an  unemployment rate of over 10 percent.  Many more people are not even counted  among  the unemployed. This  includes  those  no longer actively looking for work and those  who have accepted part-time work as a poor  substitute  for suitable  full-time work. These  people could actually double the official unem ployment rate.  I rise in sup ap Over 250,000 people each month are run ning out of benefits without finding new jobs.  How can we callously tell  these people that  the Government doesn't care and can't pro vide additional benefits until they get back on  their feet? We're talking about honest, respon sible citizens who want to work but cannot find  work because of the recession.  What's more, only 37 percent of unem ployed workers actually receive benefits when  they  lose  their  jobs.  In past  recessions, as  much as 65 percent of the total unemployed  received benefits. There  is something des perately wrong with a system  that protects  only one-third of all  temporarily unemployed  workers.  Yet  the Bush  administration  insists  that  there is nothing wrong and refuses to declare  an emergency to provide additional benefits to  these  desperate American workers.  If  the  President can declare an emergency  for the  Kurds in Iraq and for Bangladesh, how can he  turn his back on his own people?  Since the President won't declare an emer gency,  I rise  in support of H.R. 3040, which  automatically declares an emergency. There is  no need to raise taxes to pay for the additional  benefits because there is already an $8 billion  surplus  in  the extended benefits  trust  fund.  How can we deny additional benefits to people  when there is money sitting in a trust fund col lected specifically for this purpose?  I also support Chairman ROSTENKOWSKl's  amendment  to H.R. 3040, which gives  the  President the option of accepting  the emer gency declaration or of raising the Federal un employment tax just slightly to cover the ex pected costs of the additional benefits.  If the  President wants to raise taxes instead of de claring an emergency, let him do so.  Mr. Chairman, providing additional unem ployment benefits is not a handout. It is an in vestment in  the American worker and  in the  American economy. By preserving  the pur chasing power of unemployed workers, we are  really lessening the severity of the recession.  We help everyone in the Nation at the same  time that we restore the worker's dignity.  ",1991
1147,823,16,Mr. MURPHY.," Mr. Chairman, today I rise in  support of extension of unemployment insur ance benefits for the victims of our current re cession. Like many pressing issues, this crisis  situation has been papered over by a Presi dent who governs by  the old maxim ""out of  sight out of mind."" Mr. Bush's ""domestic agen da"" has been repeatedly run over by the con stantly moving wheels of Air Force One, as it  taxis the President once more to destinations  far from the realities of day to day American  life.  Although many experts  suggest  that our  economic downturn is over, the rising unem ployment rate  is proof that a turnaround has  not yet arrived. It is a disgrace that 8. 7 million  American workers now find  themselves with out jobs.  In June, the unemployment rate rose to 7  percent.  It has  increased by 1. 7 percentage  points since  the  recession began  last July.  Most troubling, however, is that almost 1.2 mil lion American workers have been without work  for more than 26 weeks and are no longer eli gible for unemployment benefits. Another 1 .4  million workers have been unemployed  for  more than 15 weeks but less than 26 weeks.  Many of these additional workers will soon join  the ranks of those losing unemployment insur ance benefits, even  if the economy starts to  recover. While many of these workers would  like to jet off to other parts of the world like the  President until  the bad  times subside,  the  cold, hard fact is that for the unemployed their  greatest concern now is feeding families and  paying bills.  In every economic downturn over  the 50  years, Washington has stepped  in and ex tended unemployment benefits beyond the ini tial 26 weeks for the majority of the long-term  unemployed. At a time when almost 1.2 million  workers have been unemployed for more than  26 weeks,  the Unemployment Benefits Pro gram currently provides assistance  to  fewer  than 100,000 workers. This situation itself, is a  case study in misapplied priorities. While we  should exercise fiscal restraint with regard to  many big Federal spending programs, hesi tation  in  providing  benefits  to many des perately unemployed people has created a  surplus in the program of nearly $7 billion.  This mockery should not be allowed to con tinue. I urge the President to act now to work  with the Congress to enact legislation expand ing eligibility for extended unemployment ben efits assistance. Both the money and the need  exist now, and I ask that you act promptly for  the good of those hardest hit by the recession.  ",1991
1148,823,16,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise today  in  support of H.R. 3040, the Unemployment In surance Reform Act which would  provide  much-needed extended unemployment bene fits.  Here we are yet again to deal with the issue  on extended unemployment benefits that we  thought we had already resolved, because the  President refused to join with Congress to re lieve  the severe  financial problems of thou sands of American workers who are out of  jobs and unable to find another in the tough  economic circumstances  that persist  today.  This time, however, the passage of H.R. 3040  will designate the expenditures  in  the bill as  an  ""emergency"" and  remove any misunder standing that may have persisted.  It  is offensive  to American workers  that  President Bush would fail to provide this lim ited protection for them when he has declared  budget emergencies  to provide aid  to  the  Kurds and the people of Bangladesh and Tur key.  Last August, the workers in our Nation were  left to deal with an extended benefits system  which is inadequate for their needs which, un fortunately, only continue  to grow; 350,000  jobless Americans ran out of benefits in July  and only 5 percent of those were eligible for  extended benefits. This despite the  fact that  the Federal Government now has more than  $8 billion in the extended unemployment ben efits trust fund.  President Bush has stated that the reces sion is nearly over. Well I am sure that this is  less than reassuring for the 8.5 million people  out of work  in  this country. Families cannot  survive on such reassurances even from the  President. American workers need  less rhet oric and more  concrete  action  today, Mr.  Chairman, not tomorrow.  ",1991

1152,849,16,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  today to speak in support of H.R. 1414,  the passive  loBB correction bill. I am  one of over 300 cosponsors of this im portant  legislation.  If H.R.  1414  is  passed it would permit real estate pro feBBionals  to operate under  the same  tax rules imposed on other professional  entrepreneurs, thereby allowing those  who spend at least one half of their  business  time on activity related  to  real estate to deduct losses generated  by a real estate project in which they  actively participate.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1414 would increase  the supply of affordable rental housing,  opening up opportunities for middle class Americans to attain decent hous ing. This bill would also keep real es tate values constant and help shore up  the Nation's financially troubled banks  and savings and loan associations.  The passive loss rules did not origi nate  from  the House of Representatives. However it is our responsibility  to correct  this inequity so  that our  economy can begin a new growth pe riod-and that will beneftt all Ameri cans.  UTAH SEEKS RELIEF FROM  WASTE DISPOSAL PROBLEMS  ",1991
1153,849,16,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gen tleman from Utah [Mr. OWENS] is rec ognized for 5 minutes.  ",1991
1154,849,16,Mr. OWENS of Utah.," Mr. Speaker, I  am increasingly concerned about the  problem of interstate waste  inciner ation and disposal operations. The situ ation in Utah is a  textbook illustra tion. Certain States are being singled  out to bear the waste disposal burdens  created by others. I absolutely object  to  this brand of exploitation. States  such as Utah are literally left holding  the bag-bags which are filled with mu nicipal  or  toxic  refuse-for  other  States which, instead of recycling and  otherwise dealing with their own waste  problems, send them out of State, and  out of mind, for disposal.  Utah is threatened by a proliferation  of waste incinerators with an overall  capacity far beyond  the State's own  needs. A total of 19 facilities, including  hazardous waste  incinerators,  nerve  gas and munitions incinerators, medi cal waste  incinerators, cement kilns,  and a garbage incinerator, have either  received permits or have submitted ap plications  to burn various  types of  wastes in Utah all of them in beautiful  unspoiled Utah.  For  instance,  two hazardous waste  incinerators have received permits to  operate in Tooele County. One of these  is already under construction. Their  combined  capacity  is approximately  180,000 tons per year, an absolute guar antee that they will accept hazardous  wastes  from out-of-State. A medical  waste incinerator is under construction  in Salt Lake County, while two more  have either applied for or received per mits, one in central Utah and the other  in Ogden. Two more commercial facili ties have applied for permits to burn  waste tires as fuel.  The Army currently operates four in cinerators in Tooele County for the de struction of chemical weapons, with a  group of five more under construction  and an additional one on the drawing  board. These facilities are supposedly  going to close following  the destruc tion of the 42 percent of the Nation's  chemical weapons which are stockpiled  in Utah. But,  there are already con cerns that the capital investment in volved will encourage the Army to con tinue to run the incinerators for other  Federal wastes  shipped  from out of  State. Will be prepared to fight that  one.  But, incinerators represent only part  of our growing interstate waste story.  A commercial hazardous waste landfill  in Tooele County disposes of hazardous  wastes and PCB's. A second commer cial landfill in the same county is li censed  to handle naturally occurring  radioactive materials, the only such fa cility  licensed  in  the entire United  States. It also has a cell for mixed haz ardous  and  low-level  radioactive  wastes.  We  are  also  confronting  the  unpalatable prospect that Utah will be  forced  to accept municipal garbage  from other States or even Canad.a. A  large commercial landfill of 2,400 acres  is planned in east Carbon County. The  owners have  received  the necessary  permits to dispose of municipal and in dustrial wastes, including foreign gar bage. It is widely perceived, in part be cause of the landfill 's size and rail ac cess, that it could become yet another  magnet for out-of-State wastes.  lncreaaingtly, Utahans are calling for  changes in Federal law to give us con trol over what now appears to be a  mushrooming  trend  toward  out-of State wastes.  I've introduced legisla tion, H.R.  816  and H.R.  2671, which  would provide the needed authority. I  firmly believe that it's the only fair  way to go. I urge my colleagues to sup port that progressive, fair approach to  waste disposal.  LISTENING TO HOOSIERS  ",1991

But these  same people  are very worried, Mr.  Speaker,  and  in  Indiana  they have  come to open meetings to ask tough  and important questions.  Hoosiers  are worried  about  jobs.

Mr. Speaker, they asked me why we  need to be spending $7.1 billion each  year defending Japan and  the Asian  basin and $17. 7 billion each year de fending Western Europe when the old  Warsaw Pact no  longer is a military  threat, and when here at home our own  borders are not  secure  from  illegal  aliens and drug smugglers.

As  the  chairman knows, the Kansas City, MO,  Area Transit Authority in conjunction  with  Johnson County, KS,  have an  acute need to replace a large number of  buses that are well beyond their useful  life. Because of an incredible demand  for discretionary bus funds in this fis cal year, a section 3 application sub mitted by the Area Transit Authority  [ATA] could not be approved by UMT A.  Since this decision was made very re cently by UMT A, I was unable to bring  this matter to the committee's atten tion at an earlier point in time. The  conference committee will meet soon  a.fter  the Senate completes consider ation of H.R. 2942. It is my hope that if  the conferees highlight bus projects  that are of particular importance  to  the  committee,  that  the  chairman  would consider  including  this project  in that category.  ",1991
1185,901,16,Mr. LAUTENBERG.,"  I am aware of  the problem the Senator from Missouri  has described and I commend him for  bringing it to the committee's atten tion. As the Senator has noted, the de ma.nd for discretionary bus funding was  particularly strong in fiscal year 1991,  and as a  result, a number of worthy  projects did not receive funding.  It  is my understanding  that  this  project is important to the Kansas City  Area Transit Authority's efforts  to  provide accessible service for the elder2942,  ly and  the handicapped and  to meet  Clean Air Act goals. I want to assure  the Senator that I will be happy to  work with him during the conference  and in the coming year to try to ensure  funding for this important project.  Mr. D'AMATO.  I  concur with  the  chairman's comments and assure my  colleague from Missouri that I will also  do all I can to help ensure funding for  this critical project.  ",1991
1186,901,16,Mr. BOND., I greatly appreciate the  assurances of  the chairman and  the  ranking member and thank them for  their help on this and the other vital  Missouri  transit projects  included  in  the DOT appropriations bill for fiscal  year 1992.  ,1991
1187,901,16,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, the Sen ate Budget Committee has examined  H.R.  the Transportation appro priations bill as reported from commit tee, and has determined that the bill is  under its 602(b) budget authority allo cation by $131 million and over  its  602(b) outlay allocation by Sl million.  It is my understanding that the dis tinguished manager of the bill, Senator  LAUTENBERG, will offer an amendment  to bring the bill under its 602(b) outlay  allocation. I compliment Senator LAU TENBERG and the distinguished ranking  member of  the Transportation Sub committee, Senator D'AMATO, for all of  their hard work.  Mr. President,  I have a  table pre pared by the Budget Committee which  shows the official scoring of the Trans portation appropriations bill and I ask  unanimous consent that it be printed  in the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection, the table  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE SCORING OF H.R.  2942  TRANSPORTATION SUBCOMMITTEE-SPENDING TOTALS  [Senate reported in billions of dollars]  Bill summary  Budaet  authority  Outlays  H.R. 2942:  New BA and outlays  ............................................ .

1200,914,16,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, will  the Senator yield for a question?  ",1991
1201,914,16,Mr. BREAUX., I will be happy to yield  to the Senator from Florida.  ,1991
1202,914,16,Mr. GRAHAM.," I appreciate the com ments the Senator has made, and also  commend him for the leadership he has  provided in the committee to bring for ward a bill that would give us an op portunity to address this in the form of  a  total repeal with a substitution of  revenue.  Could my colleague again state what  is the legislative position of the pro posal for the outright repeal?  ",1991
1203,914,16,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. President, I would  say to the Senator from Florida, the  Senate Commerce Committee has had  a hearing-Senator LAUTENBERG and I  chaired  it-when we  addressed  this  question to the Coast Guard.  Following  that hearing,  the Com merce Committee, in a full committee  markup,  reported  legislation which  calls for and provides for  the repeal,  the outright repeal of the so-called rec reational user fee.  The only caveat was that we all rec ognize that before we can come to the  floor with that committee-passed bill,  we have to have an offset in the pack age to bring it to the Senate floor.  I can say to my colleagues, we are  now working on the offset. It is in the  maritime area. We do not have the rev enue estimates, but we are confident  that when they are produced, they will  show a dollar-for-dollar offset, which  will allow us to come to the floor and  do away with the tax in its entirety.  ",1991
1204,914,16,Mr. GRAHAM., Does the Senator have  a general estimate of when he thinks  this might be available to the Senate?  ,1991
1205,914,16,Mr. BREAUX.," I would respond to the  Senator -by saying we expect it to be  available by late September, which is  this month, or certainly in the month  of October we would have the estimates  which would allow us to come to the  floor with the outright repeal.  ",1991
1206,914,16,Mr. GRAHAM.," If I were to defer to  the Senator's suggestion today, would  it be his sense that if, by mid-October,  we had not been able  to meet  that  schedule, that it would be appropriate  to look for an opportunity to reintro duce the concept of this amendment, to  establish a  trust fund  for  these rec reational boaters' fees?  ",1991
1207,914,16,Mr. BREAUX.," I would respond favor ably and in the affirmative to the Sen ator. I think we both share the same  goal. We both recognize this is a sham  tax. My colleague certainly cleared up  this aspect of it. We would like to get  rid of it completely.  If we are not able to have an offset,  there is no question the next best thing  would be to say at least spend it for the  benefit of the people who are paying  the tax.  I would be supportive of that. I think  the better course of action would be to  have an outright repeal. If we can pro vide  the offset,  that can be accom plished. If that cannot be done in a rea sonable  timeframe  that  I have out lined, I think it would be entirely ap propriate, and I would be supportive of  the Senator's effort to redirect the fee.  ",1991
1208,914,16,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, is the  Senator  from Louisiana prepared  to  surrender the floor?  ",1991
1209,914,16,Mr. BREAUX., I yield the floor.  ,1991
1210,914,16,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I am  very  encouraged  by  the  comments  made by the Senator from Louisiana.  The time schedule he has laid out is a  challenging one, to have a measure of  this significance ready for full Senate  consideration within the next 30 days.  But I applaud him for his work that  has made that possible.  In the context of that, and with the  clear understanding  that should  this  option of outright repeal not be accom plished within approximately a 30-day  period that it would be my intention to  look  for  another  opportunity  to  present the concept of a separate trust  fund  for  these  recreational boaters'  fees, with that understanding, I ask to  withdraw the amendment and hope we  will soon be in a position to pass the  outright repeal as introduced by  the  Senator from Louisiana.  ",1991
1211,914,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Sen ator retains the right to withdraw his  amendment. ~e amendment is with drawn.  The amendment (No. 1152) was with drawn.  ,1991
1212,914,16,Mr. GRAHAM., I thank the Chair.  ,1991
1213,914,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The mi nor! ty leader is recognized.  ,1991
1214,914,16,Mr. LAUTENBERG., The amendment  of the Senator is the pending business.  AMENDMENT NO. 1151  ,1991
1215,914,16,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, the amend ment is the pending business. I would  like to take a minute to respond to the  allegation made by the previous speak ers in opposition to the amendment I  have offered  for myself and Senator  KASSEBAUM, which would in effect re peal the so-called Wright amendment.  First, it is alleged that this amend ment would be the death knell for re gional airports.  I would ask my col leagues from Texas why no other re gional airport in the country has need ed similar protection? Why are  there  no restrictions on Houston Hobby  to  protect Houston Intercontinental? Why  no restrictions on Midway to protect  Chicago O'Hare? Why no  restrictions  on John Wayne Airport to protect Los  Angeles International?  The reason is that Dallas-Fort Worth  had a strong proponent-former Speak er Jim Wright. The Wright amendment  is a distortion, a complete deviation  from the norm.  Those  opposing  the  amendment  raised the possibility of major airlines  flooding Love Field. I agree, and that is  exactly why I raised the possibility of  a compromise. Opponents refuse to ad dress the compromise, it would make  the restrictions on Love Field-a rel atively small facility close  to down town Dallas-similar  to  the  restric tions  on National-a  small  facility  near downtown Washington, as every one here knows.  Opponents  raised  the  issue of  the  study currently underway at the De partment of Transportation. Senior of ficials at DOT who are working on the  study have  told my office  that  the  compromise would solve  the environ mental noise problem, would not lead  to major airlines flooding Love Field,  protect regional carriers in the area,  and assist the vast majority of the pub lic currently being hurt by the Wright  amendment.  Therefore, it is my intention-it will  be in a minute-to seek permission to  withdraw  the  amendment with  the  promise that, following release of this  report which is expected in the next 2  or 3 weeks,  this amendment or  the  compromise amendment will be offered  to  the  supplemental  appropriations  bill. This will allow all of my col leagues to read the report, learn of the  negative  impact  the Wright amend ment  is  having  on  air  passengers  throughout the country, and decide to  end this Government-imposed monop oly which exists at only one airport in  the entire country.  And, during that period, I would ask  my colleagues, when flying home,  to  ask  the business travelers you meet,  the tourists you meet, who fly to Dal las, whether they would like to land in  downtown Dallas or way out of town,  half way to Fort Worth.  They can land at National and not  Dulles or Baltimore International, why  can they not land at Dallas Love Field?  I think that is a question we have to  resolve.  ",1991
1216,966,16,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I want  to take this opportunity to commend  the Transportation Subcommittee for  its outstanding leadership on the criti cal  transportation  issues  facing  us  today. The appropriations bill before  us, containing nearly $35 billion in new  budget  and  contract  authority,  re sponds comprehensively and effectively  to our Nation's transportation  infra structure needs.  I particularly want to thank Senator  LAUTENBERG for his strong support this  year, as well as last year, for the con tinued development of high speed rail  passenger rail service between Boston  and New York.  Amtrak service between New York  and Washington has been one of the  major transportation success stories of  the past 10 years. Due in large part to  Federal  investment  in  the  right-of way,  in signals, and in related infra structure, New York-Washington Am trak service has become a viable com petitor  to air and highway  service,  helping to ease congestion and pollu tion in the region, and saving energy  resources.  I commend the leadership of the Sen ator  from New  Jersey, who has  in cluded  $193.8 million  in  this year's  Transportation appropriations bill  to  make high-speed rail service a reality  for those traveling between New York  and Boston, and $14. 7 million for cap ital needs on the northern end of the  Northeast corridor. With these funds,  New England is able to look forward to  the same type of fast and efficient Am trak service currently enjoyed by pas sengers between New York and Wash ington. Reducing the travel time along  the New York-Boston route to under  three hours will make a major con tribution to the operating efficiency of  our transportation system. It will help  to move more passengers by Amtrak  instead of by less energy-efficient and  highly  congested highways  and air ports.  The committee has included $2.7 mil lion in the Northeast corridor improve ment project account for the Route 128  Amtrak  station  in Massachusetts.  These funds are needed for Amtrak to  meet its share of the costs of lengthen ing the platform to accommodate full length trains, and to make the plat form and station accessible to the dis abled. In addition, the committee has  endorsed language calling for the com pletion of design and engineering work  on  the Canton Viaduct in Massachusetts, which carries the Northeast cor ridor mainline  over  the  Neponset  River. This 156-year-old bridge  is  in  need to urgent repair to allow safe pas sage of high-speed Amtrak trains and  MBTA commuter trains, and we  look  forward to receiving construction cost  estimates for this project next spring.  The bill also includes $500,000 for a  feasib111ty study of maglev/high-speed  rail transportation along a New York  City-Albany-Boston  route. The  com mittee has earmarked this amount out  of a  $5 million  fund  for  studies of  maglev/high-speed  rail  routes  across  the country. These funds will help keep  the United States in the forefront of  research and development on these new  technologies, which hold great promise  for improved transit and a cleaner en vironment. It is my expectation that  the New York City-Albany-Boston fea sib111ty study will involve a review of  the benefits of intermediate stops in  western Massachusetts,  such  as  at  Springfield, Pittsfield, and Worcester.  In addition, the committee has rec ommended $511 million for grants to  Amtrak to cover operating and capital  needs.  I strongly support  this appro priation, in order to enable Amtrak to  acquire  the  additional equipment  it  needs and to improve its operating self sufficiency.  The bill also includes $10 mi111on in  first year funding for the South Boston  Piers Transitway, an  important new  project in the city. This underground  bus tunnel will provide a link between  downtown Boston, Logan Airport, and  the rapidly growing South Boston piers  area, which includes the new Federal  Courthouse and the World Trade Cen ter. This critical public  transit link  will mean significant improvements in  air quality and reductions  in  traffic  congestion in an area currently lacking  ready access to bus, subway, and com muter  rail  systems.  Although  the  amount provided for this project is less  than was recommended in the House passed  b111,  I  am  hopeful  that an  amount closer to the House level may  be achievable  in conference  if addi tional resources become available.  Also in the transit area, the commit tee has provided  the  full authorized  level of $160 million for the Interstate  Transfer Grants-Transit Program,  in cluding $11.7 million for Massachusetts.  This amount will close out Massachu setts' balance under this program, and  the  funds will make possible much needed modifications  to ensure  that  MBTA  stations and equipment meet  accessib111ty  requirements under  the  Americans With Disab111ties Act.  In addition, I support the commit tee's appropriation of $3.7 billion for  the  overall  transit  category, which  wm, among other important goals, sus tain the current $802 million level for  transit operating assistance  that the  administration sought to cut.

1217,979,16,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I know the  members on the other side have been  named earlier and we had one vacancy  that was not filled.  I have now made  that determination, and also made the  determination who would serve as vice  chairman or,  as  I  believe, properly,  maybe cochairman of that committee.  I have designated Senator SMITH from  New Hampshire. I am also very pleased  that Senator MCCAIN has a.greed to be a  member of the committee, as has Sen ator BROWN, Senator GRASSLEY, Sen ator KASSEBAUM, and Senator HELMS.  This is a  important issue, and I hope  the select committee can now organize  and proceed with its work.

1219,979,16,Mr. WELLSTONE.," Mr.  President,  Plato once said that ""what is honored  in a country will be cultivated there.""  Today I honor a distinguished Min nesotan  and World War  I  veteran,  Henry Boeck, who died on September 5,  1991, at the age of 96. The son of Ger man  immigrant homesteaders, Boeck  volunteered at age 17  for service  in  World War I.  After  being  seriously wounded  in  Verdun, France, he married and settled  in Westbrook, MN. His  four children  and their spouses went on to serve with  distinction in World War II, Korea, and  Vietnam.  In life, Henry Boeck brought honor  to himself, his  family,  the State of  Minnesota, and  the country he  loved  and served. In his passing,  let us re member this honor that he cultivated.  As  the  Senator  representing  the  State of Minnesota, I salute him.  SENATOR PRYOR'S EXPERIENCE  AND ADVICE  ",1991
1220,979,16,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, one of  the wonderful  things about being a  Senator  is  the opportunity  to make  friends with your colleagues.  I have  been privileged to know some of the  truly great men and women who have  served and are serving in this body; one  of these is DAVID PRYOR. It is a joy to  welcome him back to the Senate. I can  only hope that he will vote with me  more often.  I want to call the Senators' atten tion, if they have not already seen it,  Senator PRYOR's startling and poign ant first-person account of his heart  attack, treatment, and recovery that  appeared in the August 1991 issue of Arkansas Time. This is an article that  should not be missed.  First, it gives us a new appreciation  for the life-saving sk111s of our medical  personnel and investments in medical  research and technology. The response  of the emergency medical services dur ing the early desperate moments de serves special note. Modern cardiology,  in the middle of the night at George  Washington University, worked mir acles unheard of even a decade ago. It  is almost a fantasy to read of dilating  coronary arteries from inside the ves sel in the midst of the acute heart at tack while DA vm watched it happen on  a television screen.  Second, he gave us some very sound  advice-advice  from a man who has  been there. He made it clear that his  recovery is a dynamic process, with no  end point. His recovery steps should be  our preventive health steps. It is clear  that the majority of heart disease is  acquired through our habits, not inher ited through our genes. All of us can  minimize our risk for heart disease by  lifestyle adjustments. The  two most  important  factors under our control  are smoking cessation and weight con trol. Heart attack victims overwhelm ingly are men who are overweight, who  smoke, who do not exercise, and who  consume diets high  in  fat  calories.  Risks of heart attack can be reduced  four-fold by attention to healthy life styles. We need  to eat lower on  the  food chain. DAVID PRYOR's nutritionist  said he did not have  to give up red  meat; he could have a steak twice a  year. We must allot time for exercise.  Just walking 40 minutes a day can  make a difference. Exercise is not only  useful for conditioning and weight con trol, but is an effective stress manage ment method.  Finally, DAVID wrote  to each of us  with a perspective only a  few people  have. The lessons Senator PRYOR wants  us to learn are clear. He cautioned us  to watch our pace and our stress; to  smell the flowers along the way; to be  a part of our own families, not mere  onlookers; and to remember the fragil ity of our lives and the value of our  friends.  I,  for one, appreciate  this message  and the sincerity with which it was de livered. As  the Congress  returns  to  work from the August recess, it would  be well for us all to remember this ad vice. And,  in doing  so,  let's all be  grateful for  the return of our friend  DAVID PRYOR.  THE  RETIREMENT OF  LT.  GEN.  HARRY E.  SOYSTER, DIRECTOR,  DEFENSE  INTELLIGENCE AGEN CY  ",1991
1221,979,16,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, as chair man of the Senate Select Committee  on Inte111gence, I have developed great  respect for Lt. Gen. Harry E. Soyster,  the Director  of  the Defense  Intelligence Agency, who retires in October  after more  than 34 years of distin guished service to the U.S. Army.  General Soyster has the reputation  of always being  fair and consistent,  which has earned him the respect and  loyalty of those who work for him. I  am sure this unique capability plays no  small role in his success.  During Operations Desert Shield and  Desert Storm, the Defense Intelligence  Agency under his  leadership contrib uted significantly to the successful co ordination of the national Intelligence  Community effort  in support of  the  forces deployed in the Persian Gulf.  Throughout his 3 years at the De fense  Intelligence  Agency,  General  Soyster concentrated on enhancing the  quality of inte111gence his Agency sup plied to national policymakers, defense  officials,  and U.S.  operational  com manders worldwide. In fact, a key ele ment in his recent reorganization of  the Agency was  the strengthening of  elements providing direct, daily, intel ligence support to the Joint Chief of  Staff.  By virtue of his Agency's work  in  arms  control  monitoring,  counternarcotics,  counterterrorism,  and  the monitoring of weapons pro liferation  and  technology  transfer,  General Soyster has had a decidedly  positive influence over national policy making. His tenure has been character ized by inte111gence reporting that is  timely, objective, and lucid.  I especially appreciate the help Gen eral Soyster has given to our commit tee during his time of service. He has  been candid and direct with the com mittee. He has taken the initiative to  make sure that we had the best pos sible information available to us. His  nonbureaucratic approach has been es pecially admired by our committee.  I am glad to have this opportunity to  pay tribute to  this outstanding mili tary officer who has worked so hard to  bring distinction and  recognition  to  the Defense  Inte111gence Agency. His  achievements are noteworthy and  I  offer my most sincere best wishes for  his future success.  COMMEMORATING MR.  EDSON G.  CASE, A MEMBER OF THE DE FENSE  NUCLEAR  FACILITIES  SAFETY BOARD  ",1991
1222,979,16,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President,  it  saddens me to announce to the Senate,  the death on Saturday, September 14,  1991, of Edson G. Case, who was con firmed last year as a member of the De fense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.  Mr. Case was a 34-year veteran of Fed eral service, and can rightly be called  the father of nuclear reactor safety in  the Federal Government. When  the  Senate voted in the lOOth Congress to  establish a  safety board with broad  powers over the safe operation of the  Nation's critical nuclear weapon facili",1991
1223,992,16,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce a sense-of-the-Sen ate resolution calling for repeal of the  so-called luxury tax on boats. This tax  is anything but a luxury for the 19,000  middle-class workers who will  lose  their jobs this year because of this tax.  After just 9 months, the boat excise  tax is a disaster.  In addition to putting thousands of  middle-class workers in the unemploy ment lines;  It is forcing plant closures;  It is aiding our foreign competitors  by destroying one of America's finest  manufacturing industries; and  It  is costing  the Government  far  more in lost tax revenue and collection  costs than it will raise.  This tax must go now. Every month  Congress  delays more workers  lose  their jobs.  Due  to  the  economic  slowdown,  100,000 workers in the marine industry  lost their jobs in 1989 and 1990. Ignoring  this, Congress imposed a 10 percent ex cise tax which has been the last straw  for many boat builders and retailers  and has brought the additional loss of  19,000 jobs.  Wisconsin is hit hard by this tax, 2  years ago over 18,000 people  in  the  State were employed in the marine in dustry, today that number is down to  15,000. Communities like Oconto, and  Pulaski are hurt by the ripple effect  from  this  tax. As boat builders  lose  their  jobs, other businesses  in  town  begin to suffer.  The most ironic aspect of this tax is  that the Federal Government is losing  millions of dollars from this tax. A re port put out last month by the minor ity staff of the Joint Economic Com mittee shows a minimum net loss to  the Federal Government of $15.2 mil lion in 1991.  Using an extremely conservative job  loss number, the Government will lose  $8 million in income tax receipts, $8.1  million in lost payroll tax receipts, and  $2.1 million in Federal unemployment  payments. This compares with an ini tial estimate of only $3 million in reve nue from the tax.  On  top of all  the suffering and job  loss, we have a  tax that doesn't even  raise money for the Government.  This morning I chaired a hearing be fore the Small Business Committee to  examine  the  impact of  this  small businesses. Witnesses from both  the manufacturing and retailing sec tors testified to the job loss and devas tation that this tax is bringing to the  marine industry.  Particularly compelling was the tes timony of Chet Markley, president of  Local S 88 of the International Union  of Shipbuilding Workers of America.  Mr. Markley is one of the thousands of  workers who has lost his job because of  this  tax. He stated clearly  that  the  members of his union are the victims  of this tax, not the wealthy.  I call upon all my colleagues to join  me in repealing this devastating tax.  This is one critical way we can help  thousands of workers across America  keep their jobs in the midst of this re cession. Each week we fail to act more  workers will  join  the unemployment  lines.  tax on  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED  DEPARTMENT  OF  TRANSPORTATION  AND  RELATED  AGEN CIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, FIS CAL YEAR 1992  LAUTENBERG AMENDMENT NOS.  1144 AND 1145  Mr.  LAUTENBERG  proposed  two  amendments  to  the  bill  (H.R.  2942)  making appropriations for the Depart ment of Transportation and  related  agencies for the fiscal year ending Sep tember 30, 1992, and for other purposes,  as follows:  AMENDMENT No. 1144  On page 85, line 13 strike ""data"" and insert  ""date"".

There, children will explore  the economic,  environmental,  scientific and social  implica tions of Space Sciences and discoveries for  the 21st-century citizen.  The  theme  of Space Sciences  encom passes both oceanography and aerospace.  Children will investigate theme topics through  classroom and field experiences. Topics that  will be explored include topography, weather,  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ecology, geography, career awareness, ma rine biology, navigation, aerodynamics, history  of aerospace, and colonization and exploration  of space.  Classroom instruction will be conducted by  both subject area specialists and classroom  teachers. Instruction will employ the most up to-date  technology  including computer,  laser  disc programs, video microscopy, and other  sophisticated pieces of equipment. Special in struction, which  is conducted by two trained  teacher specialist, will be enriched in the regu lar classroom by the homeroom teachers. The  theme of Space Sciences will be interwoven  throughout the basic curriculum areas.  The children at Public School 184 have  begun this exciting study as a result of being  a theme school. Some of the educational ex periences already enjoyed by the students at  the school  include  trips  to:  the New York  Aquarium, John F. Kennedy Airport, the Hay den Planetarium, Long  Island Science Mu seum, Vanderbilt Mansion and Planetarium,  Alley Pond Environmental Center, Hall  of  Science, South Street Seaport,  the  Intrepid,  and a scheduled three-hour sail on the Voy age-a two-masted schooner. In addition, the  children have participated in Star Lab and in  workshops aboard the Intrepid.

THE NEEDS OF THE UNEMPLOYED  REPRESENT A TRUE EMERGENCY  HON. WIWAM J. COYNE  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 17, 1991  ",1991
1225,1005,16,Mr. COYNE.," Mr. Speaker,  the  time has  come to send a clear message to the adminis tration: The House of Representatives refuses  to  ignore  the needs of working men and  women who have exhausted their unemploy ment benefits.  I believe  that American working men and  women have a right to ex µect  help from their  Government when they lose their job through  no fault of their own. They have a right to ex pect that Congress will act to repair the faults  in  the current unemployment compensation  system. These faults have allowed millions of  out of work Americans  to  fall  through  the  23351  cracks when they exhaust their unemployment  benefits.  Recently,  the Congress acted  to address  the  true emergency encountered by Ameri cans who face a loss of unemployment bene fits and hard choices on how to feed their chil dren and pay their rent or mortgages. Unfortu nately, the bill passed was flawed because it  allowed President Bush to sign an unemploy ment compensation bill with one hand, but  take back the promised relief with another.  When  Congress  passed  unemployment  compensation  reform,  the  President  was  asked to interrupt his August vacation and de clare that the needs of over 8.5 million unem ployed Americans  represented  a  domestic  emergency which warranted new spending.  Regrettably, the President refused to release  the funds needed to assist the over 2 million  unemployed Americans who have exhausted  their benefits.  On three separate occasions, the adminis tration and Congress have recognized emer gencies overseas that justified new spending.  If we can respond to the plight of the Kurds  and disasters in Bangladesh, how can we pos sibly ignore the suffering of our own citizens  who have exhausted their unemployment ben efits? How can  the administration claim  that  the needs of the unemployed represent less of  an emergency than the needs of those in dis tant lands?  The House now has an opportunity to cor rect  the  flaws  in  the earlier unemployment  compensation  reform bill. This new bill de clares  that an economic emergency exists  which warrants the release of funds for exten sion of expired unemployment benefits. If the  President signs this bill, as I hope he will, the  release of funds will be automatic.  Still, the procedure will mean that the $6.5  billion in desperately needed additional unem ployment compensation funds will be financed  through Federal borrowing. It does not have to  happen this way. The House can accept the  amendment  offered  by Ways  and Means  Committee  Chairman  DAN  ROSTENKOWSKI.  This amendment would adjust the unemploy ment tax rate paid by an employer on an em ployee's wages  to provide  the needed addi tional funds if the President does not declare  a budget emergency.  Mr.  ROSTENKOWSKl'S  amendment  would  lower the unemployment tax rate paid by an  employer on a worker's wages from the cur rent 0.8 percent to 0.2 percent by 1996, while  extending the taxable wage base from the cur rent $7 ,000 to a level equivalent to the Social  Security wage base, projected to be $58,000  by 1993.  In addition,  this amendment would  decouple the connection between Federal and  State unemployment tax rates, so that there  would be no increase in State unemployment  taxes.  I support the pay-as-you-go principle. The  Rostenkowski amendment provides the admin istration with the means to pay for extension  of unemployment benefits. Still, I am not will ing to sacrifice the basic needs of American  families because of an inability of elected offi cials to reconcile their differences over budget  priorities. My first priority is to serve the work ing men and women of our country who must  provide for their families regardless of the de bate taking place in Washington. If the House  ",1991
1226,1018,16,Mr. GUARINI.," Mr. Speaker, I would like you  and my distinguished colleagues to join me in  saluting  Anthony  Iacono,  mayor  of  Weehawken and a fine public servant.  Mayor  Iacono  retired at the end of 1990  after serving for a total of 14 years as mayor  time he built a  of Weehawken. During  this  solid reputation as a skilled administrator, a  strong manager and a leader of the people.  Mayor lacono's dedication and talents have  been recognized through a number of honors  and appointments  to statewide and national  commissions while he served as mayor. This  Saturday  evening,  the  residents  of  Weehawken and many  from around Hudson  County, my congressional district, will gather  to pay tribute to Mayor Stanley Iacono and his  achievements.  Iacono for.  The people of Weehawken have much to  thank Mayor  In  the 1960's and  1970's, he served on the town's board of edu cation from 1963 to 1969 and from 1976 to  1979-and was elected mayor from 1969 to  1974.  During his tenure, he dealt with many chaJ..  lenges as the character of Weehawken and all  of Hudson County changed. BhJe-collar and  manufacturing jobs, the mainstay of much of  the area, were declining. Longtime residents  were moving out and new residents with dif ferent needs were moving in.  Throughout  these changes, Mayor  Iacono  kept a steady hand on the helm and worked  to prepare Weehawken for the future.  After a 6-year hiatus from the mayor's of fice, Stanley was returned to office by the peo ple of Weehawken. And it was at this  time,  that Mayor Iacono faced one of the toughest  challenges during his career as a public serv ant.  In 1982, Mayor Iacono took over a town on  the brink of disaster. The  town had been  rocked by scandal. The town's finances were  in such poor shape that bankruptcy seemed to  be a very real possibility. The people's con fidence  in  their  local government had been  badly shaken.  But Mayor Iacono managed to tum the town  around. He created a credible, honest govern ment for the people of Weehawken. A suc cessful businessman who has been president  of Arrow Iron Works since 1960, Mayor Iacono  used his business acumen to bring the town  back to prosperity.  By the end of the decade, Weehawken was  a new town, thanks to Stanley  Iacono. Gov ernment was running smoothly. A plan to de velop the town's waterfront, which is home to  breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline,  had been worked out to suit the needs of resi dents and incoming businesses.  At the end of the mayor's fifth term in office,  Weehawken had become one of the most de sirable places to live in Hudson County. Taxes  were stable, residents were offered excellent  municipal services and in Stanley Iacono, the  town had a leader it could trust.  Only a true public servant, such as Stanley  Iacono, could have ensured a bright future for  Weehawken.  Mayor lacono's dedication to public service  also extended beyond the borders of his town.  He has served on  the state department of  community affairs  local  finance board  from  1975 to 1980 and was reappointed in 1989. In  1972, President Nixon appointed him  White House Commission on Aging.  And in Weehawken, Stanley was more than  just mayor. He served on  the Weehawken  Charter Commission in 1981 and is the past  exalted  ruler of the Weehawken Benevolent  Protective Order of the Elks.  Even though Mayor Iacono has now retired  from  public  life,  his  legacy will  continue.  Weehawken's current mayor, Richard Turner,  worked closely with Mayor Iacono throughout  his time in office. And Stanley's son Anthony  is now the town's township manager.  All the residents of Weehawken and espe cially Stanley's wife, Anna Marie, and his chil dren, Guy, Antoinette and Anthony, should be  proud of Stanley Iacono. He has served faith fully as mayor and serves as an ex81J1>1e to  public servants everywhere.  Mr. Speaker,  I hope you and my distin guished colleagues will join with me in saluting  good  friend and a  Iacono.  fine man, Stanley  to the  my  TWINS FIND SUCCESS IN OPENING  ""TISKETS AND TASKETS""  HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 17, 1991  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  I am  pleased to recognize today two of my constitu ents, Ms. Connie Dahms and Ms. Joanna  Sguros, who  recently were  featured  in  the  Miami Herald for their successful Coral Gables  gift shop, Tiskets and Taskets. The article  ""Friendly service is twins' secret to success,""  tells the story of how two twins gave up the  corporate life to open a successful small busi ness:  FRIENDLY SERVICE IS Tw!NS' SECRET TO  SUCCESS  Twins Connie Dahms and Joanna Sguroa,  owners of Tiskets 'N Taskets Inc., a gift shop  in Coral Gables, aren't identical  in  their  ways of running a business. That, they say,  is the secret of their success.  Combining the financial savvy of Sguros  and the buying savvy of Dahms makes the  business appealing to their clientele,  they  said.  ""We live together and work together and  we may have heated arguments, but we  make up in five minutes and compromise  when it comes to the business,"" Dahms said.  ""My  partner  is  someone  I  can  trust.  There's no one I'd have gone into busineu  with except her. We think differently but we  agree on what needs to be done to get the  business ahead,"" Sguros said.  The store, at 241 Miracle Mile, offers a wide  variety of items: baskets, baby bibs, stuffed  animals, key chains, books,  toiletry items  and art note cards. Twenty percent of' the  items, such as the country wood plaques and  ceramic pieces, are made by local artisans.  ""You can come in and get a gift for anyone  on your list,"" Dahms said.  ""I just love it,"" said Louise Camperty, a  Gables resident shopping in the store. ""I like  the children's items, the candies, everything.  I'd like to just buy up the store.""  The sisters opened their first store in May  1989 at 2351 Salzedo St. They moved to their  present location on Miracle Mile in March  and tripled their business. More than 400 cus tomers drop in weekly.  ""When we  first started the busine88, we  didn't have the management experience. We  thought we had better start small so we  opened the store on Salzedo. It was a learn ing process, but we made our mistakes on a  small basis,"" Dahms said.  The Coconut Grove  residents  said  they  wanted to open a gift shop because there are  many high-end stores and they saw a need  for items suited for those on a tight budget.  The most popular items are the Seagull pew ter line and dried noral arrangements.  Most items in the store cost S15 to $25. The  most expensive is a pewter brush and mirror  set for $195.  Before getting into the business, Sguros  managed a  laboratory at Coral Reef' Hos pital,  since  renamed  Deering Hospital.  Dahms worked for Eastern Airlines, planning  and scheduling at a reservation center. Both  quit their jobs in December 1987 and spent a  year traveling.    ""Neither of us wanted to go back to cor porate life, especially after a year of travel ing to places like Alaska. We always talked  about opening a gift shop, so we did  it,""  Dahms said.  ",1991
1227,1031,16,Mr.  EWING.," Mr.  Speaker, U.S. District  Judge Gerhard Gesell announced yesterday  that he was dismissing  the case against Lt.  Col. Oliver North.  I say  this action  is  long  overdue.  After spending nearly 5 years and $35 mil lion  in  taxpayer money  to pursue  this case,  Independent Prosecutor Walsh has concluded  that ""the Government is not likely ..  ..  .. to sus tain a successful outcome"" in this case.  Oliver North has been completely exoner ated in  this case, and the taxpayers are  the  only true losers. For far too long, the Office of  the Special Prosecutor has justified dragging  out this case and  increasing the cost to the  taxpayers.  It is clear that the time has come  to put an end to this operation, which employs  over 35 attorneys and support staff, before the  taxpayers pay more.  The  time has come  to  immediately shut  down the Office of the Special Prosecutor and  put an end to this issue, once and for all.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  time, I have come to know a man whose drive  and determination  is  like none other  I have  ever come across. Bill posesses a sense that  all of us wished we had. A sense that enables  him to see many avenues of opportunity and  permits  him  to mold  different  views  and  ideologies  together  in order  to create a  fin ished product that we can all stand by. This  sense gives him the ability to eventually come  out on top and succeed.  . It is obvious in the time that Bill was here,  that many of his views and  ideas rubbed off  on all of us. With his leadership at the majority  whip position, Bill was able to rekindle the fire  of who and what the Democrats are and what  we stand for.  I can remember in the height of the Reagan  years, when the American economy was reel ing from the Reagan revolution, I watched Bill  mold four consecutive budget agreements that  effectively ended the Reagan stranglehold on  middle class America. The amazing story be hind this is that in those 4 years, a combined  total of only 77 Democrats voted against the  agreements. Less than 20 Democrats a year.  Considering  the diversity of  the Democratic  party, that in itself is an astounding achieve ment.  The success of Bill Gray does not come  from  luck,  it comes  from a harmonious com bination of personality, vision, and intelligence.  With his abilities, Bill has proven that he can  take a view, an idea, or a fragmented thought  and create something concrete and beneficial.  Something that will help people succeed and  society to grow.  I am not only speaking  for myself when  I  say Bill  is a true  leader of  the people. Ask  around the halls of Congress and  the Mem bers will tell you what a fair, hard-working, and  engaging leader he is. Although the House of  Representatives will be  losing a great leader  and potential speaker, the United Negro Col lege Fund will be gaining a man who will tire lessly strive to assist black Americans.  Bill Gray will not  leave  this body as a  beleagured politician, resting on the laurels of  where he has been and what he has done.  This man will exit this body with his head held  high and his eyes wide open; he will leave as  a champion looking for new obstacles to over come, other mountains  to  climb, and new  campaigns to wage.  In  closing,  I would  like  to  extend my  sincerest congratulations and gratitude to Bill  and also wish him the best of luck with the en deavors he must yet face.  TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN BILL  GRAY  HON. JOSEPH M GAYDOS  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 17, 1991  ",1991
1228,1031,16,Mr. GAYDOS.," Mr. Speaker, esteemed col leagues,  I am here today to pay tribute to a  man who has not only done a great service for  the Second District of Pennsylvania, but who  has also dedicated his time and effort pursu ing avenues to create a better and fair society  in America.  I have been  lucky enough  to serve with  Congressman Bill Gray since 1978.  In  this  ESTABLISH  17-MEMBER  COMMIS SION TO DISMANTLE THE GLASS  CEILING  FOR  THE  ADVANCE MENT OF WOMEN AND MINORI TIES  HON. SUSAN MOLINARI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 17, 1991  ",1991
1229,1031,16,Ms. MOLINARI.," Mr. Speaker, today,  I have  introduced a bill  to establish a 17-member  Commission  to study  further why  the glass  ceiling-the invisible barrier keeping qualified  minorities and women  from moving up  into  23377  management jobs~xits. The Commission will  make  recommendations with  respect  to poli cies for business to promote opportunities for  the advancement of women and minorities  and lead to the removal of artificial barriers to  such advancement. In addition, this legislation  establishes  the National Award  for Diversity  and Excellence  in American Executive Man agement. This award will be presented annu ally to a business which has made substantial  efforts to break down the glass ceiling.  The Department of Labor's recent glass ceil ing report confirms what many of us have sus pected all along-that women and minorities  have not been advancing up  the corporate  ladder as quickly as white males. This report  is an important first step in understanding and  removing the barriers toward women and mi norities. However, it is just a first step toward  a pervasive problem  that has existed  in our  society for far too long. The legislation I am in troducing today will establish a high-level gov ernment commission charged with building on  the work of, and expanding the record of, the  Department of Labor's efforts. It is important to  note that the report completed by the Depart ment of Labor was a modest pilot study, ex amining only nine Fortune 500 companies. To day's legislation will enable the high-powered  Commission to compile hard facts on a mul titude of businesses, versus sampling of cor porate America.  During  the past 25 years, shifting demo graphics, coupled with a more global business  environment has changed the composition of  the work force. Significant among these is the  increased importance of women and minorities  to  the  competitive  status of  the American  economy.  If we are to ensure a level playing  field-that women and minorities have the oi:r  portunities  guaranteed  under  the  law-we  must have statistical data and recommenda tions to break down the glass ceiling.  Mr. Speaker, I believe the proposed legisla tion measure will help ensure accountability in  equal employment opportunities  for women  and minorities.  It will also provide significant  incentives to those companies which have un dertaken particularly creative and effective ini tiatives to assure equal opportunity for all.  TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM J.

Over the past 2 months,  I've had the oppor tunity to reflect upon the life and career of a  remarkable individual whose legacy is one of  giving and caring.  Since 1986, I had the pleasure of working  with Bill on a number of issues that were be fore  the House Banking Committee.

1232,1044,16,Mr. RICH.," Mr. Speaker, I decline to yield  because there is still hope for America and  there  is still hope for  this Congress  if we  refuse to appropriate any more money. Then  when we come back here next year, let us  put more taxes on the American people, be cause that is what you will have to do ulti mately. Tax the American people more so  they will send back to Congress men who  will not spend money  like you have been  spending it during this session of Congress.  [Applause.)  They tell me that we are going to employ  on this monument Mr. Borglum and his crew  of assistants. Now,  I  like Mr. Borglum.  I  think he is a very fine man, and no doubt he  is one of the finest sculptors in this land, or  in the world.  I question whether the $200,000 that is to be  spent for this particular purpose at this par ticular time will do as much good for  the  people  of South Dakota  as  though  this  money were spent  to help  the  farmers of  Sou th Dakota,  instead of in a manner  in  which they are trying to help them now with  the processing taxes, for you must remember  that the people back home are getting tired  of the processing taxes. Now, when you go to  the people of America and ask them to pay  taxes in some other manner to pay these 60  men for building these great faces of Wash ington,  Jefferson,  and Roosevelt  on  that  mountainside, faces which are going to be as  high as the Capitol Dome, then I think the  taxpayers will say to you, and they will say  to me that their tax bill is higher than the  Capitol Dome. Taxes are now too high, but  to save the Nation you must either increase  taxes or cut down expenses. What course will  you take?  Mr. McFARLENE. Gutzon Borglum is a chis eler, is he not?

1234,1044,16,Mr. LUNDEEN.," Mr. Speaker, the administra tion deserves credit for continuing the great  Rushmore  Black  Hills  Project.  Gutzon  Borglum  is a sculptor whose genius is un questioned and whose  fame  is world-wide.  This art project was originated under the Re publican President, Coolidge, and carried on  by the administration of President Hoover,  and all  the Democratic administration  is  seeking to do now is to finish what the Re publicans began.

We come here and  ask your vote for this bill with the approval  of all the agencies that have anything to do  with it, and this bill, I may say, comes here  also with  the approval of the President of  the United States. The other day the Presi dent wrote this letter:  ""In our conversation the other day regard ing the Mount Rushmore National memorial,  your description of the progress of work on  the memorial and of its inspirational value  to our people in the years to come convinces  me of the need for legislation to authorize an  additional appropriation of $200,000  for  the  completion of this project.""  Mr. Speaker, that letter was written to the  senior Senator from my State, Hon.

1237,1044,16,Mr. WERNER., I yield to the gentleman from  Virginia.  ,1991
1238,1044,16,Mr. WOODRUM.," I hope the gentleman's reso lution will pass. I should like to make this  observation,  if the gentleman will permit:  This project was started, as the gentleman  knows,  under  a  previous  administration.  There are no politics in it at all. It is a great  American project. It always has happened  that these projects have taken more money  than we started out to spend. If we appro priate more money to finish this, we are sim ply doing what we have always had to do and  what we know we always will have to do in  the future. It takes more money than was  thought necessary at the beginning. I think  the resolution is meritorious, and I hope it  will pass.  [Here the gavel fell.)  ",1991
1239,1044,16,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," The question is  on the motion of the gentleman from South  Dakota [Mr. WERNER)  to suspend the rules  and pass the bill.  The question was taken; and on a division  (demanded by Mr. TABER)  there were-ayes  119, noes 41.  So,  (two-thirds  having  voted  in  favor  thereof)  the rules were suspended, and the  bill was passed.  A motion  to reconsider was  table.  A similar House bill was laid on the table.  laid on  the  $200,000  MOUNT RUSHMORE  (By Gilbert File)  Before  introducing  the Rushmore  bill,  Norbeck  sought  clearance  at  the White  House. Without the support of the President  and the director of the budget, there was lit tle hope of getting the $200,000. ""I saw the  big Chief this morning,""he wrote on June 28,  ""and his attitude is entirely satisfactory.""  After conferring with his budget director,  Roosevelt wrote Norbeck, ""In our conversa tion  the other day  regarding  the Mount  Rushmore National Memorial, your descrip tion of the program of work ... and of its  inspirational value to our people in the years  to come convinces me of the need for legisla tion to authorize an additional appropriation  of  for  the  completion  of  this  project.""  In order to allay Democratic opposition,  Bulow and Norbeck  jointly  introduced  the  Senate bill, and Representative Werner han dled it in the House. As had been true in the  past, Norbeck quieted opposition in the Sen ate by personal conferences, but House mem bers were  less easily calmed. The repeated  calls on  the  federal  treasury  to bail out  Mount Rushmore were arousing  increased  antagonism. The House Committee on  the  Library reported the bill favorably but only  with the understanding that the commission  finish the memorial with the $200,000, ""as the  Committee feels that further appropriation  at some future date ... would be entirely  out of order.""  When Werner's bill came up for passage, he  stated the situation frankly. ""The question  of appropriating additional funds,"" he said,  ""simply resolves itself into whether we are  going to leave this memorial unfinished or  whether we are going to complete it."" Rep resentative Tabor, well known for his inter est in economy, thought Congress should pay  more attention to protecting the treasury.  He thought South Dakota should be satisfied  with what had been accomplished. A memo rial with the likenesses of Washington and  Jefferson, he argued, ""would make a very  good park all by  itself."" Any community  having  such  a monument,  he  continued,  ""should not ask for $200,000 more.""  T.L. Moritz of Pennsylvania staunchly in sisted that it was unwise to spend more on  Mount Rushmore during depression  times.  ""You cannot eat art,"" he complained. ""We  are not interested in art .. . . Right now we  should  concentrate  on  the necessities of  life."" Representative Robert F. Rich, com monly known as ""Where-is-the-money-com ing-from"" Rich,  thought it would be better  to appropriate funds for South Dakota farm ers.  Congressmen White and Roy 0. Woodruff,  the  latter a personal  friend of Borglum's,  struck telling blows for the measure. White  said  the country should utilize Borglum's  ""matchless genius"" while it was available.  Woodruff explained that Congress had appro priated about  ten billion dollars ""for God  knows what,"" and that $200,000 more was of  little  importance. He  received hearty ap plause when he concluded: ""In view of the ri diculous purpose for which billions are being  spent . . . and in view of the worthy purpose  for which this $200,000 is proposed, I hope the  House  will  overwhelmingly  approve  the  bill.""  On June 15 the bill was slated for passage  in  the House without opposition or objec tion, but Keller could not obtain recognition.  ""There was not a chance in a million to get  the  legislation.""  he  informed  Norbeck.  Meanwhile, Congressman Theodore Werner,  Rapid City Democrat who  had  replaced  Williamson the previous year, was working  vigorously. Werner knew that the bill could  be brought up and passed only with support  of the House leaders. Thus he laid the matter  before Speaker Rainey and other influential  members. Keller's  jealousy hampered any  close working relationship between himself  and Werner.  Norbeck, who was watching the situation  closely, finally called on Congresswomen Isa bella Greenway of Arizona. She and Borglum  were close friends, and he had carved a stat ue of her husband. When Keller gave up,  Norbeck sent a page to Mrs. Greenway with  the message, ""The chairman can not get the  bill up. I think you can."" Werner and Mrs.  Greenway  then  prevailed  upon  Speaker  Rainey to consider the measure. It passed so  quickly that there was hardly time to object.  There were no speeches, no explanations. All  of  that had been  taken  care  of earlier.  ""Without Werner,"" Norbeck wrote,  ""we  could not have gotten the legislation.""  DOLE-DOMENICI-ROTH UNEMPLOY MENT INSURANCE ALTERNATIVE  ",1991

1248,1057,16,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President,  the  amendment I am offering adds $3.108  million  to  the Park Service's fiscal  year 1992 construction budget to pro ceed with phase II of construction for  the Red Hills Visitor Center  for  the  west unit of  the Saguaro National  Monument. For the information of my  colleagues, $3. 74 million was  included  in the fiscal year 1991 bill for phase I of  this project.  The Park Service, in their capability  statement, indicated that $4.574 million  could be used in fiscal year 1992. This  level of funding would complete both  the construction of the Red Hills Visi tor Center, and enable the Park Serv ice to renovate the current visitor cen ter into an administrative center. How ever,  recognizing  the constraints  the  committee  is  operating  under  this  year, the Park Service has indicated to  me that the renovation of the existing  visitor center could be deferred until  next year.  I  support  this approach.  Consequently,  only $3.108 million  is  needed to proceed with the construc tion of the Red Hills Visitor Center.  I ask that this amendment be agreed  to. By doing so, we will enable  the  Park Service  to continue with  this  worthy project that we supported last  year. This will allow us to not forsake  our initial investment of construction  funds in the fiscal year 1991 bill.  ",1991
1249,1057,16,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I appre ciate  the  Senator's  request  for  $3,108,000 to keep the Red Hills Visitor  Center at Saguaro National Monument  49-059  0-95 Vol. 137 (Pt. 16> 34  on  its construction schedule without  delay. Unfortunately,  the committee  does  not  presently  have  the  full  $3,108,000 remaining available under its  602(b) allocation for budget authority.  Consequently, Mr.  President,  the  managers are able to accept an amend ment which adds only $2, 700,000 for the  visitor center at this time. I hope that  amount is acceptable  to  the Senator  from Arizona.  ",1991
1250,1057,16,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President, I ap preciate the constraints the managers  are under, and I am confident that $2.7  million is adequate to keep this project  moving forward.

1262,1057,16,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, while the  Congress was in recess in August, the  world has changed once again. The peo ple of the Soviet Union have repudiated  the Communist Party and the Baltic  Republics are now free.  Several years ago, I began speaking  of the dawn of a new era. As the Con gress  returns  this September,  it ap pears that the morning light of free dom has ushered in a new day for a bet ter world. I am most hopeful that the  failed coup in Moscow represented the  last gasp of state communism in the  Soviet Union.  The images of August were a  testa ment to the power of liberty, freedom,  and democracy. Who could not have  been inspired by the courage and brav ery of Boris Yeltsin as he mounted a  tank to denounce the military coup or  by Mikhail  Gorbachev,  who  stood  steadfast against  the demands of the  coup plotters and broke with his party  to forge a new union?  In the days following the end of the  coup, another revolution ensued, one  which will mark a  turning point  in  world history. Democracy in the Soviet  Union has been tempered and tested by  the coup. The democracy movement  has emerged strong, but not yet invin cible.  It is shortsighted to assume that all  problems have now been  solved and  that democracy  is firmly in place in  Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union,  and will now automatically be success fully sustained by an American-style  free enterprise system.  Following  a  visit  to  the  Soviet  Union, last spring, I observed that co operation  between  Gorbachev  and  Yeltsin held the most promise for the  Soviet  future. That cooperation has  been making history  in August and  September.  The coup also provided  the United  States with a glimpse into the catas trophe which could lie ahead if reform  efforts in the Soviet Union fail. Gorba chev  and Yeltsin  are now  together  walking a  tightrope. Below them lies  the fire of a union violently breaking  apart along the lines of Yugoslavia and  the ice of a resurgence of the reaction ary cold war forces.  It is  in  the American  interest  to  steady that tightrope and to guide the  Soviet people across it into the land of  peace and a degree of prosperity. The  same could be said about Eastern Eu rope.  Mr. President, I have been somewhat  surprised at the President's ""can't do""  attitude with regard to the U.S. role  and stake in this continuing drama. I  had hoped to see more Yankee ingenu ity from the President in the wake of  the victory over totalitarian rule.  While I agree that the United States  cannot afford to open its checkbook to  the  Soviet Union,  there  are many  things both substantive and symbolic  which the United States can do to in spire, encourage, and reward reform in  the Soviet Union. As important, there  are several  initiatives which can be  taken  immediately  to encourage  re",1991
1263,1070,16,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to trumpet the pride of the 50th  State upon the recent crowning of Miss  America, Carolyn Suzanne Sapp,  the  first Hawaii resident ever to achieve  this honor.  There would seem to be little that  could surpass t~.e immeasurable grati fication we all share with Carolyn at  what is an historic accomplishment in  Hawaii's annals. That  is, unless one  also puts  this within  the context of  Carolyn Sapp's personal odyssey to the  throne-an inspirational  journey that  culminated in her receiving the highest  tribute of its kind in the country but  whose initial step was taken when she  decided to pursue the first of her three  previous tries for the Miss Hawaii title.  Without question, this is a unique in dividual, an exemplary young woman  whose character and determination set  a standard for us all.  She gathers strength from the love of  her extended family. From them, she  learned the vital importance of com munication,  education,  and  respon sibility for each other.  She has devoted years to the study  and  appreciation  of  voice,  piano,  drama, and dance. Through that, she  has seen how the universal language of  art and culture can bring about beau tiful communion among all peoples.  She has come to call Hawaii home. In  doing so, she has taken all that has al ways been so obviously special within  herself and let it be nurtured by the  spirit of Aloha.  Though Carolyn developed a cold the  night  before  the  pageant, her  con fidence never faltered. ""The warmth of  the people overwhelmed me and kept  me warm,"" she said. She was superb.  Though Carolyn was deluged by a  flood of emotions as she started her in augural walk, her heart never  lost  focus.  ""He'aha'a,"" she  thought. It is  Hawaiian for ""humble.""  Mr. President, Hawaii by no means  relinquishes  claim, but  I  suppose  I  should change my opening remark to  say that I  ''trumpet the pride of all  America"" at the crowning of Carolyn  Suzanne Sapp. She has always been,  and will always be, someone of whom  the  entire Nation  should  be  truly  proud.

Is there  objection  to  the  request of the gen tleman from Illinois?  There was no objection.  [Mr. WIL Such a system could save huge amounts of  administrative expense.  We have soaring health care costs be cause-as the GAO and the New Eng land Journal of Medicine have docu mented-we waste between $67 and $132  billion a  year pushing paper  rather  than treating patients. Mr. White con cluded  that a  single-payer system  is  not politically practical because  the  entire private health care insurance in dustry would be virtually abolished.  But the simple truth is-our country  can no longer afford to waste $100 bil lion a year. Military base closings were  politically  unpopular-but  everyone  agrees  that we can no  longer afford  oversized defense budgets.  Assistance was given to relocate and  retrain affected  individuals, and our  Nation's economic  future  is brighter  than it would have been without the  closings.  Overhauling the health care system  by  ultimately  providing  national  heal th insurance will not only ration alize health care delivery but will fi nance what  is unimaginable  today maternal and child care for all mothers  and young children, long term and care  for seniors and comprehensive and cat astrophic health insurance for every one.  Currently, we spend roughly 12 per cent of our GNP on health care com pared, to an average of less than 8 per cent for other industrialized nations.  The United States  ranks  first  in  health care spending per capita, yet  24th among  industrialized nations  in  preventing infant mortality and 18th in  life expectancy.  In short, there are enough people now  employed in the health sector to pro vide access to quality health care for  all Americans. Our goal must be  to  eliminate the wasteful practices of the  l,500 insurance companies in this Na tion and capitalize on the savings.

1268,1083,16,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker, our Na tion's health care system, at a cost of  over $600 billion per year, excludes 37  million Americans, is wasteful, cost in effective, and a drain on the Nation's  human and capital resources.  As Joe White of the Brookings Insti tution wrote in the Washington Post:  The simplest answer is a national health  insurance system similar to Canada's.

1318,1109,16,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr.  President,  the  amendment  that  I  am  offering  would provide a 10-percent reduction in  funding  for  the National Endowment  for the Arts. The purpose of my amend ment is quite simple. It is to draw at tention to the fact that many Ameri cans have  legitimate concerns about  the way in which their tax dollars are  being used with respect to arts funding.  Last year Congress enacted a number  of procedural reforms with the view to ward urging  the  reforms  to  increase  the sensitivity of the agency to  tax payer concerns without defining con tent restrictions. I have felt that these  changes sent a strong message, and I  worked on behalf of their enactment.  Unfortunately I have been disappointed  with the results and have come to the  conclusion that we must send a strong er message and that is the point of this  amendment.  I do not regard myself, Mr. President,  as uncaring about  this  issue.  I  care  deeply about the arts community. I be lieve  it is an  important part of our  statements of what we are about as a  nation. We  have always  lent strong  support to the arts and in all of their  diversity there are many options one  could choose in trying to address the  concerns that have been expressed from  both Congress and the public.  Obviously, one could look at content  restrictions, and a number of such re strictions have been presented in this  body in the past. I do not believe this  course is advisable and would, in fact,  urge  the rejection of any amendment  offered along these lines.  Writing  content  restrictions  into  statute ultimately requires excluding  classes of subject matter irrespective  of the context in which they were pre sented.  It would also be possible  to devise  procedural reforms in addition to those  enacted last year with an aim toward  further prodding the NEA  to exercise  common sense and good  judgment in  distributing funds.  I believe, however,  that  there  is plenty of authority al ready on the books to do what is nec essary. The goal  is  to see  that it is  used.  Some have argued that the Federal  Government simply should not be  in volved at all in funding the arts and  that it is a luxury we cannot afford at  a time when we are unable to do all we  would like to in areas of pressing need.  I have rejected  this option because I  recognize  that  the National Endow ment for the Arts has played an impor tant role in supporting artistic excel lence,  and  in making  it  available  across the country. Throughout history  governments have supported  the arts  for their value in enriching culture and  human experience.  An NEA grant provides recognition  at the national level of excellence and  exceptional  quality. There  is great  value in that, but that value has been  tarnished by a series of grant awards  which do not  represent  the best of  which American art has to offer, nor do  they bring an appreciation of art to a  broad audience.  There is a great deal of excellent art  in the United States, and a great deal  of excellent art supported by the Na tional Endowment for the Arts. At the  same  time with  respect  to  the NEA  there seems to be an atmosphere that  anything presented as art deserves pub lic support.  An editorial which appeared in the  Wichita Eagle last year, Wichita, KS,  put it this way:  The fact is that absolutely no one is trying  to deny artists the freedom to create. The  arts community seems  to  think  that  the  First Amendment means artists can do any thing they want and the taxpayers should fi nance it.  This point was underscored in yester day's Washington Post which carried  an article  regarding a  suit brought  against the NEA by four performance  artists whose proposals for NEA fund ing were rejected last year. Contrary to  the  impression which  some  seem  to  hold, Federal arts funding is not an en titlement.  Like all Members of this body, I re ceive a steady stream of mail about the  NEA.  Although much  of  this  cor respondence comes in the form of com puter generated postcards, much of it  is also from ordinary citizens who sim ply cannot understand why  the  taxes  they work hard to pay should be used  in the manner that they are. They are  expressing a broader frustration  that  those of us  in Washington have  lost  touch with the reality of the world in  which Americans live and work.  That is really the basis for my con cern, Mr. President. I think there are  things that the NEA can do  that can  enhance  the effectiveness and the ac countability of the agency. I think the  board of the National Endowment for  the Arts needs  to engage  itself in a  much more active manner in the op tions that are presented by the peer re view panel, for instance.  So it will be my hope that these will  be considerations that should be and  would be considered. Every recipient of  Federal  tax dollars holds the respon sibility to be accountable to the public  which foots the bill. It does not make  any difference whether this is in agri",1991
1319,1161,16,Mr.  FOWLER.," Mr.  President,  the  House has provided $248 million for the  DOE State and Local Assistance Pro gram,  slightly above  the  fiscal year  1991 appropriation of $246 million. The  Senate Appropriations Committee only  provided $220 million. This appropria tion  includes  the State Energy Con servation Program [SECP], the Schools  and Hospitals Program [ICP],  the En ergy Extension Service [EES], and, by  far the largest activity, the low-income  home weatherization program.  State and local resources, petroleum  overcharge  funds,  and private sector  monies are combined with these Fed eral funds to improve energy efficiency  for all sectors of the population. Unfor tunately,  fewer  funds  are becoming  available  at  the  local  level  for  weatherizing housing units  and  the  low-income energy assistance funds are  expected to further decrease this com ing year. The elderly, the poor, and the  disadvantaged, many of whom are al ready living on the fringes of society,  are particularly hard hit by this slow down in energy conservation funding.  I hope that in the very near future,  we will be able to offer practical and  more economical energy alternatives.  Right now, our best bet in reducing en ergy costs and using our energy  re sources most efficiently,  is conserva tion, energy efficiency. That  is ulti mately what these weatherization pro grams are about. This investment in  conservation and efficiency will help  our country at  the same  time  it  is  helping that elderly couple in Sparta.  GA.  It is only weatherizing more houses,  by assisting more schools and hospitals  in improving energy efficiency, by of fering energy education to more teach ers  and  students,  by  helping more  farmers realize their energy saving po tential, that we, in the most cost-effec tive manner, can continue  to aggres sively address  the energy concerns of  Georgia and the Nation.  Last. year alone, almost 4,000 house holds  representing  9,000  Georgians,  were served by the Weatherization As sistance Program. Twenty-nine schools  and hospitals received matching grants  to  improve energy efficiency in their  facility operations. These are all long  term investments toward ensuring en ergy and economic stability.  In Georgia,  these energy programs  are  very  successful  at  serving  the  State's citizens. This past year,  the  Dry Hydrant Assistance Program won  a national award from the Council of  State Governments for its innovative  approach  to  saving energy, property  and lives in rural Georgia. The No-Till age Assistance Program is a finalist in  the prestigious Ford Foundation/Har vard University State and Local Gov ernment Innovations Awards Program.  The program is being recognized for its  contribution, through the promotion of  energy savings,  to the survival of the  family farm in Georgia. Sound energy  information and  technical assistance  continues to be made available to the  State's over 6 million citizens.  All of this is possible only by, at the  very least, maintaining DOE's current  funding. With renewed concern for a  national  energy  strategy,  it  only  makes sense to continue level funding  for these proven energy programs that  serve all economic sectors of the coun try.  SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION  ",1991
1320,1161,16,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, I rise  in my capacity as a member of the  Board of Regents of the Smithsonian  Institution,  appointed  in  accordance  with  the provisions of 20 U.S.C.  42.  That statute embodies the act of Au gust 10, 1846, in which the Congress del egated to the Board of Regents the ob ligations assumed  in 1836 when Con gress accepted the Smithson trust and  agreed  to establish an  institution at  Washington for the increase and diffu sion of knowledge among men.  While I am well aware of the con straints under which the Committee on  Appropriations labored as it fashioned  the pending measure,  I also am con cerned by the reductions it made in the  budget of  the Smithsonian and dis tressed by the character aspersions the  committee report casts of the Smi thso nian management.  Successive  generations  of Regents  have created and sustained the extraor dinary institution that extends along  the Mall from the foot of this hill to  the far corners of the earth, collecting  and interpreting objects and specimens  of science and culture to remind us and  our heirs of the multiplicity of our ori gins,  the roads we have travelled and  the paths  that might  lie ahead. The  Board of Regents today oversees an in stitution  that,  in  fulfilling  Mr.  Smithson's ancient  dream,  employs  some 6,000 people in occupational cat egories  ranging  from  accountant  to  zoologist and utilizes funds from a va riety of sources that total nearly half a  billion dollars.  The Board also faces the challenges  of managing  that  institution  in an  economy devoid of dynamism at a time  when, more  than ever, demographics  and democracy demand even greater  determination to share knowledge and  ideas with diverse and dispersed audi ences.  In meeting those demands  the  Regents do not contemplate sponsor ship of a flurry of expensive new pro grams. They have chosen,  instead, a  more deliberate course of strengthen ing core institutional activities by as suring that they are well-staffed and  operating with essential support in ap propriate  facilities:  the ordered base  that sets one free.  To provide  that assurance  the Re gents put in place more than 2 years  ago a process for identifying needs, set ting priorities,  and allocating budg etary resources to address needs con sistent with those priorities. The Insti tution's justification of its funding re quest to Congress is now accompanied  by a thankfully readable planning doc ument, ""Choosing the Future"" which  outlines the thinking and the priori ties  that shaped  the budget, and offers a  planning horizon-well beyond the next  Congress or the next election-to sug gest needs  and  direction  ahead.  In  these documents and in statements by  the Regents, by the Institution's able  Secretary, Bob Adams, and by his tal ented staff,  it is unmistakably clear  that those of us who have policy and  management  responsibilities  for  the  Smithsonian place the highest priority  on what we probably  too elaborately  call stewardship of  the public  trust.  Put more simply, we mean to take care  of and strengthen what we have.  Doing so will require the addition of  staff, the purchase of computer equip ment, the replacement of outmoded ex hibits,  the construction of advanced  telescopes, and the renovation of the  buildings in which these people and ac tivities are housed. Doing so, too, will  require the most careful deployment of  the limited resources available to the  Institution through the Federal budget  and appropriations process, the alloca tion of its trust funds, and the generos ity of those in the private sector who  support Smithsonian activities.  This program of reinvestment in the  infrastructure of the Institution, which  is now  in place,  is the only prudent  means for protecting its long-term via bility  and  improving  its ability  to  serve larger audiences. To  implement  the draconian cuts proposed by  the  committee will put that program on a  much slower track and erode the Insti tution's basic capacity for public serv ice.  At this point I do not seek to change  the committee's allocations. However,  in the conference on the differences be tween those of this and the other body  I urge  the distinguished chairman to  protect the Institution from the appli cation of the across-the-board reduc tion; provide funding for its water and  sewer payment; and restore funding to  permit  the backlog of  infrastructure  requirements to be reduced.  ",1991
1321,1174,16,Mr. WELLSTONE.," Mr. President,  I  would like to engage the distinguished  floor manager in a brief colloquy re garding funding to upgrade the water  system to areas within the Red Lake  Indian Reservation in Minnesota.  This project would upgrade the water  system which currently serves the Red  Lake Indian Reservation. The tribe has  already  begun work  on  a  related  project under a grant from  the Eco nomic  Development  Administration  which will connect the water systems  of Redby and Red Lake with a source of  clean water. The  funding  I have  re quested will allow 370 homes along the  new water transmission line to be con nected to the water system, completing  this project. Unfortunately,  the EDA  grant will not fund system hook-ups  from the transmission line to the exist ing households.  Improvements  in  the water system  are critical to improving public health  on  the  reservation. The  homes  which would be connected with these  funds currently use well water which  exceeds maximum EPA-approved sec ondary levels of iron, manganese and  hydrogen  sulfide. Among  the health  problems related to water quality is a  very high local dysentery rate, which  places residents at a much greater risk  than the U.S. population at large for  this disease.  Is the chairman willing to earmark  $536,000 from the $60 million currently  contained in the Indian health facility  account  for  fiscal year 1992  for  this  project to upgrade the quality of the  water system serving  the Red Lake  Reservation?  ",1991
1322,1174,16,Mr. BYRD.,"  I  thank my colleague  from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE,  for his continued vigorous support for  this project. First, let me say I appre ciate his acknowledgment of the severe  funding constraints under which  the  committee was working this year.  I agree that the circumstances con cerning  the Red Lake water project,  particularly  those  regarding  water  quality improvement to mitigate any  health concerns, require special consid eration. For that reason,  I will ear mark $536,000 from the fiscal year 1992  Indian health facilities account for this  project.  ",1991
1323,1174,16,Mr. WELLSTONE.," I thank the chair man for his commitment to earmark  funding for this project. I am grateful  for his continued support, and know he  will vigorously defend this earmark in  the conference committee.  NEW JERSEY COASTAL HERITAGE TRAIL  ",1991
1324,1174,16,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  today to request that the Senate agree  to provide a small amount of money  out of available funds for the New Jer sey Coastal Heritage Trail, an interpre tative project now underway by  the  National Park Service.  The Coastal Heritage Trail has been  under  study  by  the National Park  Service for  the past 3 years and has  consistently  been  supported  by  the  Congress. The study is now complete  and has been reviewed recently by the  National Park Service Director. The  Park Service has agreed to an aggres sive proposal which could ultimately  produce four or five  thematic trails- for example, maritime history, coastal  ecology,  recreation-and a north and  south anchor for the trail.  I want to emphasize that this is a  low-cost preservation effort with a cost  to date of roughly $600,000. The  trail  literally encompasses a whole New Jer sey coastline with all its diversity. It is  not a Federal acquisition or strong arm approach to preservation. On the  contrary, it encourages local pride and  local control.  The Park Service is ready to go, but  it cannot proceed without direction  from Congress. I ask that $300,000 be  earmarked to the New Jersey Coastal  Heritage Trail from the sums already  appropriated  to  the National Park  Service  for  rivers  and  trails. This  money will allow development and im plementation of the New Jersey Coast al Heritage Trail. This additional fund ing will mean the difference between  another study on the shelf and a trail  that we all can travel to understand  better the history, the value, and the  issues facing our coastal areas.  ",1991
1325,1174,16,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I have re viewed the Senator from New Jersey's  request and have no objection. The  New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail rep resents an effort to achieve ambitious  goals with modest means. We surely do  not need another dead-end study, espe cially when the Park Service is ready  and able to convert its words into ac tion.  ",1991
1326,1174,16,Mr. BRADLEY.,"  I  thank  the Appro priations chairman  for his consider ation and his assistance.  AMENDMENTS Nos. 1178, 1179, 1180, 1181, and  1182  ",1991

MAINE ATLANTIC SEA-RUN SALMON COMMISSION  ",1991
1331,1174,16,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President,  this  amendment would provide $100,000  in  Federal matching  funds  under  the  Anadromous Fish Conservation Act for  the operation of  the Maine Atlantic  Sea-Run Salmon Commission.  A number of Maine's rivers support  this Nation's last remaining, self-sus taining  runs  of Atlantic  salmon.  Maine's Atlantic  Sea-Run  Salmon  Commission,  an  independent  State  agency, has played a critical role in the  restoration and protection efforts that  assure continued survival and, we all  hope, enhancement of the State's salm on  resources. Unfortunately, Maine's  current fiscal crisis and the failure of  the President's budget to request Fed eral  funding  under  the Anadromous  Fish Conservation Act could result in  drastic reductions in the Commission's  budget and thereby curtail severely the  State's salmon restoration program.  Atlantic salmon are a vital part of  Maine's heritage and are important to  its tourist industry. Even a short-term  loss of funding will jeopardize the con siderable  investment  that has  been  made to restore this resource.  The loss of Federal funding threatens  to nullify  the benefits of countless  hours of labor on the part of dedicated  volunteers who have assisted in salmon  restoration  projects.  Maine's  wild  salmon are a natural  resource  that,  once lost, could not be replaced.  I would  like  to  thank  the distin guished  chairman of  the Appropria tions Committee, therefore, for his co operation in restoring $100,000 in fund ing for the continued operation of the  Commission. It is a matter of great im portance to the State of Maine's Atlan tic salmon resources.  ",1991

1335,1213,16,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr.  President,  I  learned  this morning  that Dr. Elez  Biberaj, Director of the Albanian Serv ice of Voice of America, was seriously  injured yesterday when his automobile  was forced off the road by an unidenti fied vehicle just north of the Albanian  capital of Tirana. The car reportedly  flipped, and Dr. Biberaj's wife, Kadire,  and two other passengers were hurt as  well but not as badly. Fortunately,  thanks  to concerned friends and col leagues at the Department of State and  the Voice  of America,  the Biberajs  were flown by a United States military  aircraft  to WiP-sbaden, Germany, and  both are now recovering.  I was very concerned when I heard  this news.  I know Elez Biberaj very  well. He  traveled with a delegation I  led to Albania in March of this year as  cochairman of the Helsinki Commis sion. He served as interpreter for the  delegation as well as for Commission  staff members who remained behind to  observe Albania's first multiparty elec tions since  in  the 1920's. During  the  course of the visit, Elez's popularity  among Albanian  citizens was  testa ment to the effectiveness of the work  of the Albanian Service of VOA which  he heads. Later, Elez Biberaj  inter preted for witnesses at a Commission  hearing on democratic developments in  Albania.  In addition to being concerned over  the health of Elez and Kadire Biberaj, I  am deeply disturbed about news  re ports which indicate that some believe  the incident in Albania may have been  intentional, planned by  the Albanian  secret police in light of Dr. Biberaj's  work at VOA. These are just reports,  but the incident was highly suspicious.  Albania has only recently freed itself  from  the  harsh Communist  system  which left that country the most iso lated and repressed in Eastern Europe.  As steps were taken toward democratic  development,  the United States and  other  concerned  countries welcomed  Albania into the CSCE process, which  committed  the Albanian Government  to respect human rights and the rule of  law. This would  include taking away  the pervasive powers the brutal secret  police in Albania held to date. In light  of its CSCE commitments, I urge the  Albanian Government  to  investigate  immediately and fully the incident, to  make public all of the facts of the case,  and  to bring to  justice those respon sible  in  the event  that  this was  a  planned attack on Dr. Biberaj.  Meanwhile,  I would  like  to express  my deepest hope that Elez and Kadire  Biberaj have a  speedy  recovery, and  that we have  them safely back here  with us in the very near future.   HONORING HENRY TAUB  ",1991
1336,1213,16,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President, I  rise  today  to record recognition of a  much deserved tribute to a dear friend  and former business colleague of mine,  Henry Taub. He will be honored on Sep tember 21, 1991, by the Jewish Commu nity Center on  the Palisades for his  outstanding contributions to the devel opment of that important community  facility.  Henry was a leader in the effort more  than 10 years ago to build the center  and was the first president of the Jew ish Community Center on  the Pali sades. Henry applied his considerable  talents toward assuring that the JCC  would move into a site able to provide  more services to the expanded Jewish  community. He worked energetically  to make the facility a reality. His skill  also assured that the transition to the  new, expanded modern center was ac complished.  Henry Taub brought his unique busi ness experience to the development of  a generation of leaders at the JCC. An  ingredient essential for its future. Dur ing his tenure, membership increased,  and programs grew to meet the needs  of a growing and diverse Jewish com munity. Henry should be proud of his  distinguished record with the center.  One of his greatest assets is the spirit  in which he undertakes new projects.  He  is a  true humanitarian and has a  long given generously of his time, his  resources and his energy  to assisting  the  Jewish  community  here  and  abroad. He has served in a  leadership  role in many organizations, including  the chairmanship of the United Israel  Appeal, an officer of the United Jewish  Appeal, member of the International  Board of the Jewish Agency for Israel,  president of the American Jewish Joint  Distribution Corrunittee, and currently  chairman of the International Board of  Technion University.  When a massive number of Soviet  Jews fled to Israel, Henry jumped into  a key role in assuring that the Passage  to Freedom campaign that assured So viet  Jewish  resettlement would  suc ceed. It is rare to find an individual so  committed  to good causes and  to be  able to serve them so capably.  Henry's participation  in charitable,  educational, cultural and business or ganizations has not been limited to the  Jewish  community. He  has worked  tirelessly on behalf of hemophiliacs as  a  board member of  the Hemophilia  Foundation, and has worked to bring  an end to hunger as part of the Inter faith Hunger Appeal. He also sits on  the board of the Shakespeare Festival/  Public Theatre and on  the board of  trustees of New York University, his  alma mater.  Mr. President, Henry Taub has been  my close  friend, confidante, and col league  for years. He  is admired and  loved by his family and friends because  he has such high personal standards  which set an example for all of us to  follow. Henry's contributions deserve  the recognition he will receive at the  JCC dinner. He has inspired many, my self included, by selfless devotion  to  the good of others and I want all  to  know how fortunate we are  to have  Henry Taub provide a role model for fu",1991
1337,1239,16,Mr. MACK.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today,  September  20,  1991,  to  com memorate  ""National  POW/MIA Rec ognition Day"" and call attention to the  plight of the  thousands of Americans  who remain unaccounted for through out  the world.  I am proud  to be an  original cosponsor of the Senate Reso lution to establish a ""National Former  POW/MIA  Recognition Day,"" which  passed in the Senate on September 16.  It horrifies me to think that Amer ican  soldiers might  still  be  held  against their will in lands abroad. A re cent issue of Newsweek indicates that  as many as 2,300 United States military  personnel might still be held in Viet nam, Laos, and Cambodia. More  than  8,000 Korean war veterans remain unac counted for. And, shockingly, there are  approximately 79,000 MIA's from World  War II.  These figures alone make a strong ar gument for  the need for Congress  to  take  swift, decisive action-not  just  provide lipservice on this issue! Couple  these figures with the anguish, heart ache, and uncertainty of the families  and friends of POW's and MIA's and the  need becomes even more compelling.  I am pleased to be an original cospon sor of Senate Resolution 82, which will,  for  the first  time, establish a  select  committee which will be charged spe cifically with POW/MIA affairs. This  committee will provide the vehicle to  review and assess the methodology and  operations of the POW/MIA Division of  the Defense  Intelligence Agency  to  thoroughly  investigate  live-sighting  reports.  I will  request  that  this committee  immediately investigate  the stunning  recent photographs which have  sur faced which provide new evidence that  Capt. Donald Carr  is  still  alive  in  Southeast Asia. In today's Washington  Post, an article indicates that Penta gon officials believe this photograph is  not more  than  18 months  old. My  thoughts  today  are with  his  step mother, Marie Barzen, who  lives  in  Fort Myers, FL. I will insist that every  avenue be exhausted in this effort. Mr.  President,  I  ask unanimous consent  that an article from the September 20,  1991, Washington Post appear  imme diately following my remarks.  I have also cosponsored legislation to  require  that all POW's receive out patient care at VA health care centers  regardless of disability  rating.  I  co sponsored an amendment to the DOD  authorization bill to require that infor mation relating to the fate of POW's  and MIA's be released to families.  This is why I am an original cospon sor of Senate Resolution 82, which will  establish a select committee on POW/  MIA affairs. On August 2, the U.S. Sen ate unanimously passed this essential  legislation.  I want  to  thank Walter  ""Radar"" O'Reily of the National For get-Me-Not Association and the many  other Floridians who wrote or called  Senator DOLE  to  recommend my ap pointment to this select committee.  I would again urge my colleagues to  find the answers to the many questions  plaguing  the  families of POW's and  MIA's. The simple fact is that Ameri cans  deserve  nothing  less  than  the  truth.  [From the Washington Post, Sept. 20, 1991]  PENTAGON INQUIRY TO Focus ON 1 PHOTO OF  POSSIBLE MIA  The Pentagon said yesterday most of the  pictures purported  to show  live U.S. MIA  from the Vietnam War are fakes, but at least  one-in color and in focus-is being taken se riously.  It appears to show Army Capt. Donald G.  Carr, who has been missing for 20 years since  the plane in which he was riding as an ob server was shot down over Laos. Carr,  the  pilot and the plane were never found.  ""This is going to be right at the top of our  investigative  list,"" said Carl W. Ford Jr.,  acting assistant defense secretary for inter national security affairs.  The picture shows a smiling man whose re semblance to Carr, accounting for aging, is  readily apparent.  ""Of all of  the photographs we have  ceived, it is quite striking,"" said Ford.  Pentagon officials believe that the picture  is no more than 18 months old.  Because  the  governments  of Vietnam,  Cambodia and Laos have increased coopera tion on POW/MIA cases,  the Pentagon has  created a new high-level position to coordi nate search efforts.  Department spokesman Pete Williams said  the post of deputy assistant secretary of de fense for prisoner of war-missing in action  affairs had not been filled, but said the new  office would ""take advantage of ... broader  access  to official  records,  eyewitness  ac counts, crash and burial sites and other in formation. * * *""  re CALL TO CONSCIENCE  ",1991
1338,1239,16,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President, it is  no  secret that  the Soviet Union has  persecuted Jews. Over  the centuries,  Russia has been one of the hotbeds of  anti-Semitism. During  the  reigns of  Ivan  the Terrible, Alexander III, and  Nicholas II, persecution of Jews was  rampant.  With that background, perhaps it is  not surprising that during the Soviet  Communist  era,  laws  forbade  Jews  from living outside towns and large vil lages. Professions were even chosen for  Jews. Pogroms, or unofficial mob vio lence against  Jews, were often con doned by the police. This anti-Semitic  atmosphere emboldened Soviet Jews to  emigrate and was a key impetus for the  construction of a Jewish state in Pal estine. According to a 1991 book on So viet history by professors David Mac kenzie and Michael Curran, Soviet per secution of Jews is directly ""connected  with Israel's emergence as a State and  the desire of Soviet Jews to emigrate  there. * * *""  In this century, the situation of Jews  did not improve much. Seventy years  under  the tyranny of communism, 70  years without political  or  religious  rights, and 70 years of imprisonment in  a backward and failing socialist system  resulted in more Jewish suffering.  The  recent Communist collapse  in  the Soviet Union has transformed the  reformation of immigration laws from  an option to a necessity. Whatever the  motive, part of the reforms initiated by  President Gorbachev  included unoffi cial recognition of the right  to emi grate. More than 1 million Soviet Jews  are expected to leave the Soviet Union.  In 1990 alone, 15,447 Soviet Jews each  month migrated to Israel. This was a  vast  increase  over  the  1988  preliberalization  figure  of  181  per  month.  Unfortunately, the relaxation of So viet  immigration  rules  is  far  from  being complete. The new immigration  law passed by the Supreme Soviet in  May, won't be  fully phased  in until  1993. Even then, many potential prob lems exist with this law.  The law draws a distinction between  travel passports and exit passports, fa voring the former of the  two. People  who represent State and social groups  are  favored  over  individual  persons.  The law also permits emigration denial  on the basis of nonfulfillment of com pulsory military service. People can  still be denied the opportunity to emi grate if parents or an ex-spouse do not  sign an affidavit releasing them from  financial obligations. Finally, the new  emigration  law  contains  provisions  that could  imprison prospective emi grants indefinitely in the Soviet Union.  If a person is judged to have had access  to State secrets,  their travel may be  delayed up to 5 years, and then pro longed further as the government sees  fit. The arbitrary nature of State se crets makes this a useful tool for the  denial of emigration.  Let me share with you a real world  example of the latter form of denial.  Lev Zinovfeich Minkin,  currently 71  years of age, is an engineer who left his  ",1991
1339,1278,16,Mr. DECONCINI.," I am pleased to join  today with Senators HATCH and KEN NEDY  in  introducing  the  Employer  Sanctions Repeal Act of 1991.  I have  been a  longstanding opponent of the  employer sanctions provisions of  the  Immigration Reform and Control Act  of 1986 [!RCA] for two fundamental rea sons: First, employer  sanctions pro mote discrimination; and second,  the  enforcement of our immigration laws  is  the  responsibility of  the Federal  Government and not the business com munity of this Nation.  Over a year ago, on March 29, 1990,  the General Accounting Office  [GAO]  issued a  report confirming my con cerns-the employer sanctions provi sions of IRCA have resulted in wide spread discrimination in the American  job market. The GAO study found that  at least 19 percent of the Nation's em ployers adopted discriminatory prac tices of some kind as a  result of em ployer sanctions. The numbers are even  higher in areas densely populated by  minorities. GAO  performed  a  hiring  audit with pairs of applicants matched  closely on  job qualifications, one of  foreign extraction with a  noticeable  accent; the other an Anglo with no ac cent. The audit showed that the appli cant of foreign origin was three times  more  likely  to encounter unfavorable  treatment than the Anglo. The Anglo  applicants received 52 percent more job  offers  than  the minority applicants.  The studies show that employer sanc tions have exacerbated discrimination  in the job market.  Employer sanctions have also created  hardships for the business community.  The expense  to  the business commu nity of complying with  the  law has  been estimated to cost many millions  of dollars. Employer sanctions are par ticularly burdensome  for small busi nesses which are forced  to determine  eligibility  from  the  17  different  ap proved verification documents. Busi nesses should not be asked to scruti nize these documents which are easily  counterfeited. As I have asserted from  the  beginning,  businesses  are  not  equipped to act as the enforcer of our  immigration laws.  Mr. President, the issue before us is  how best  to  end Government  sanc tioned,  de  facto  discrimination. Re pealing employer sanctions is the only  sure way of solving this problem that  we have created. The onus of reducing  illegal  immigration should be placed  squarely upon the shoulders of law en forcement where it belongs.  Employer sanctions also prevent the  Border Patrol from performing its pri mary responsibility of monitoring our  borders. On March 28, 1991, the GAO is sued a  report in response to my con cerns about the Border Patrol's ability  to carry out its duties along the south west border. According to the GAO, the  Border Patrol's added responsibilities  since the passage of IRCA in 1986,  in cluding checking on employer hiring  practices, has resulted in an 11-percent  decline in the amount of time spent on  border enforcement activities. I ques tion the need for more time spent on  nonborder  activities which  has  in creased from 29 percent of total hours  in fiscal year 1986 to 40 percent in fiscal  year 1991. Furthermore, a January 1991  GAO  report on  immigration manage ment concluded that the overlap of re sponsibilities between  the Border patrol and the investigations division of  the  Immigration  and Naturalization  Service [INS] has caused confusion and  resulted  in an  inconsistent  enforce ment  of  employer  sanctions  that  threatens the future success of the pro gram.  The  legislation we are  introducing  today takes some positive, rather than  negative, steps toward controlling the  flow of aliens who enter this country  illegally. For example,  this bill  in creases  the number of Border Patrol  agents and provides the Border Patrol  with adequate equipment and support  services. It also provides Border Patrol  personnel with inservice training to fa miliarize them with the rights and cul tural backgrounds of aliens and citi zens  in order to safeguard their con stitutional  and  civil  rights.  These  needed resources, along with eliminat ing the time-consuming burden of in vestigating  employers, will  enhance  the Border Patrol's efforts to reduce il legal immigration.  Other provisions  in  this  legislation  that provide our Government with the  necessary  tools  to effectively enforce  our immigration laws include: Increas ing the number of positions in the INS  antismuggling program; increasing the  number of full-time positions  in  the  Labor Department's Wage and Hour Di vision to investigate violations of our  wage and hour laws in areas of high  concentration of undocumented aliens;  increasing the number of United States  attorneys  to prosecute  persons who  bring into the United States or harbor  illegal  aliens  for  profit;  increasing  criminal penalties for persons who are  found in violation of this law; and en couraging  the Attorney General and  the Secretary of State to initiate dis cussions with Mexico and Canada to es tablish programs  to prevent and  to  prosecute  the  smuggling of undocu mented aliens into the United States.  We can also take a positive step in  reducing illegal immigration by going  forward with a Free Trade Agreement  with Mexico. An improvement in the  economic situation in Mexico will re duce the incentive for illegal immigra tion  to America.  I have  traveled  to  Mexico and have met with President  Salinas regarding Mexico's trade with  the United States. I am hopeful  that  our two countries can proceed toward  an agreement  that will enable both  countries to prosper. By assisting Mex ico in its desire  to  improve its econ omy, we can reduce the incentive many  aliens have to illegally enter our coun try.  Employer sanctions are not a viable  alternative  to our immigration prob lems. There is no justification for en couraging  job-related  discrimination  against people simply because they ap pear  to be of foreign extraction. We  must correct this mistake.   ",1991

1341,1291,16,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, on Sep tember 12, I cochaired a Small Business  Committee hearing to examine propos als to expand and simplify small busi ness pensions. The  committee heard  testimony  from  Senator BOB  PACK WOOD, who has  sponsored  the prime  proposal, and from Secretary of Labor  Lynn Martin who outlined the adminis tration's power initiative.  I am a cosponsor of the prime legisla tion and I am encouraged by the ad ministration's proposal. Both  efforts  recognize the need for expansion of af fordable  and  simplified pensions  for  small business. One of the witnesses at  the hearing was Mr. Thomas Custis of  Brookfield, WI. He is a pension consult ant  and  actuary with  the  firm  of  Milliman & Robertson. I found his tes timony extremely helpful and  I ask  that it be included in the RECORD.  The testimony follows:  TESTIMONY OF THOMAS K. CUSTIS, F.S.A.  Good morning Mr. Chairman, Senator Kas ten, and other members of the Committee. I  very much appreciate the opportunity totes tify before you today on the topic of pension  simplification  and  extended  pension  cov erage for small businesses. I applaud your  committee  for  addressing  this  important  issue; I believe it is crucial to the long-term  economic security of America's workforce.  As a pension actuary for Milliman & Rob ertson,  I work with employers of various  sizes and have first-hand knowledge of the  problems of small businesses in providing re tirement benefits to their employees. I have  observed the steep decline in the interest of  small employers in establishing and main taining  retirement plans,  especially plans  which provide adequate retirement income  coverage to employees.  Earlier  this year Milliman & Robertson  sponsored a research project which included  a survey of 100 small and medium-sized com pany chief executive officers. This survey  disclosed a very high  level of frustration  with retirement plan complexities. Findings  of the survey include:  CEO's were nearly unanimous in the view  that pension  laws and regulations are  too  complex.  A majority  think that  the pension  laws  and regulations discourage employers from  sponsoring and maintaining qualified plans.  A substantial majority of CEO's support a  moratorium on legislative change.  These findings were strongest among those  CEO's representing the smallest of the com panies included in the survey. These findings  suggest that CEO's would like simpler pen sion laws and regulations. Perhaps more im portantly, they would appreciate a rethink ing of basic pension policies. They strongly  endorse  the concept of a National Retire ment Income Policy which would provide a  consistent framework for future legislation,  thereby avoiding the problem of ever-chang ing laws, prompted by the competing goals of  labor concerns and tax equity. As an appen dix to my remarks, I have included an execu tive summary of the findings of this survey.  There has been much commentary relating  to why small employers do not have pension  plans. Documentation abounds that current  laws and regulations are  too complex and  qualified pension plans are too expensive to  administer to maintain in a small company.  It is also important for  the Committee to  consider what incentives are sufficient for  those employers who do maintain qualified  retirement programs.  COMMENTS ON SPECIFIC PROPOSALS  I believe that the legislative proposals be fore the committee are generally good, but I  am afraid that they fall well short of accom plishing the goals which have been set for  them. The Pryor-Bentsen Bill makes several  positive and significant changes in the area  of administrative simplification. However, I  do not believe any of the changes will be suf ficient  to encourage a  small business em ployer to start a new plan.  Further changes in the simplification area  that are needed to assist the small employer  would include consideration of:  (1) Elimination of  the  top heavy  rules  under Internal Revenue Code Section 416.  With the changes adopted in the Tax Reform  Act of 1986,  these provisions do  little more  than add a significant administrative com plexity.  (2) Elimination of or modification of the  application of the alternative full  funding  limit relating to current liability.  ",1991

1344,1369,16,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  today  re introducing H.R. 2456 of the 101st Congress.  Portions of this  legislation were endorsed by  the President  in his  ""National Drug Control  Strategy"" and were almost adopted in the last  Congress, but died at the last minute in con ference. I believe the bill is worth pursuing and  hope  it can make  it  through  the  legislative  process in the 1 02d Congress.  Basically, the bill sets up a system to make  sure that people seeking to fight their addic tion problem are referred to the right type of  treatment,  that more treatment programs are  available, and that we determine which types  of treatment do  in  fact work and are worth  paying for. The bill is described in detail in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of May 23,  1989,  page E1827, and September 6, 1989, page  H5382.  The administration seems to be losing inter est in the antidrug effort, but while drug use  may be down, it is still a devastating problem,  particularly in our inner-cities. And we still do  not know very much about how to ensure the  successful rehabilitation of addicts. Hundreds  of thousands of addicts go without treatment.  But we pay fortunes for the often unsuccessful  treatment of thousands of others-people who  go through antiaddiction programs only to re lapse into addiction. Indeed, some of the pro grams seem designed to conveniently use the  exact amount of time covered by a person's or  company's health  insurance-rather  than  to  meet a true clinical need.  If enacted,  the bill will ensure that we de velop a system to pay the appropriate amount  for the most successful treatments possible and thus help reduce the recidivism rate and  crime rate on our Nation's streets.

1345,12,24,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, in October  1976,  the Toxic Substance Control Act  [TSCA] was enacted. It was  to have  been a powerful tool in restricting and  controlling harmful chemicals from en tering the marketplace and the envi ronment. The concepts behind the leg islation were  sound.  The  Environ mental Protection Agency [EPA] was  required to establish an inventory of  all chemical substances being manufac tured or processed; manufacturers were  to  report  to EPA before  introducing  new chemicals, and EPA was given the  authority to require testing of chemi cals, and  to restrict, control or pro hibit their use or distribution. EPA's  Office of Toxic Substances was to have  served as  the primary gatekeeper for  keeping toxic chemicals in check.  Fifteen years after the enactment of  TSCA, however,  few  toxic chemicals  have been controlled or prevented from  entering the environment and a recent  court ruling has made it clear that the  act is so  inherently flawed  that it is  unlikely that many chemicals will be  regulated in the future. On October 18,  1991, the fifth Circuit Court of Appeals  overturned EPA's regulation  to ban  most remaining uses of asbestos under  the authorities of section 6 of TSCA.  This was a landmark decision for sev eral reasons.  Asbestos has long been known as a  lethal substance to human health. Per haps more evidence exists on the harm ful effects of exposure to asbestos than  any other substance  in  the environ ment. Unfortunately, much of that evi dence is empirical. The shipyard work ers of the 1940's were left with a sad  legacy of lung cancer, and other dis eases for their heroic efforts to equip  the armed services during World War  II. Today, the Government is spending  hundreds of millions of dollars to abate  asbestos materials  in  the Nation's  schools since early exposure to asbes tos may manifest in disease 20  to 30  years after the exposure occurs.  After a decade of work, EPA finally  promulgated a rule in 1989 to bring the  use of asbestos in brake linings, floor  tile, and construction materials to a  halt. Soon thereafter, the asbestos in dustry filed suit to block implementa tion of the ban. In issuing an opinion,  the fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in no  way attempted  to  refute  the danger  that asbestos pose to human health. It  found, however, that EPA had failed to  meet the strict dictates of TSCA and  that  the Agency's rulemaking meth odology was flawed.  Mr. President, if EPA can't stop the  use of asbestos under TSCA, it most as suredly won't be successful in restrict ing the use of lead or any other very  toxic materials. Under the present cir cumstances, the agency can't be fault ed if it does not even attempt further  regulation of chemicals through TSCA.  Congress, bears a good share of the bur den for this turn of events. Since, en actment, we've essentially abdicated  responsibility for TSCA despite abun dant evidence that the statute wasn't  working very well. Rather than trying  to reform the law, we have legislated  around it.  The  only  significant  changes  to  TSCA in its 15-year history have been  chemical specific provisions addressing  the problems of radon exposure and as bestos abatement in schools. For the  most part, we're managing  toxics by  establishing maximum levels for their  presence  in the air, water, and land,  and by curtailing certain disposal prac tices. This is a  remedial, very expen sive, and backward approach to a prob lem  that should be handled  through  prevention.  We've been hearing for a  long time  that problems with TSCA reside with  its implementation, not with the act  itself. The fifth Circuit Court of Ap peals decision proves otherwise. We can  no longer ignore the need for signifi cant changes to TSCA. And that proc ess is going to require a lot of time and  effort.  As chairman of the Toxic Substances,  Environmental  Oversight,  Research  and Development Subcommittee, it is  my intent to start the legislative proc ess moving with hearings early next  year.

1346,25,24,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr.  President,  I  think we face a very serious problem in  the Medicaid Program. It is a problem  which we can take a big step today to ward solving. I hope we do solve this  today, and solve it really once and for  all.  Mr. President, not all of our col leagues have been as close to this prob lem as have members of the Committee  on Finance. We have held in that com mittee  two hearings on  this subject,  and we just had one earlier this week.  For the benefit of my colleagues, I  would like to take a moment to outline  what that problem is. As my colleagues  know,  the cost of the Medicaid Pro gram is shared by Federal and State  governments. The Federal Government  contributes to the State, for use in its  Medicaid Program, a percentage of the  State government  revenue  the State  chooses  to allocate  to  the program.  The amount that the Federal Govern ment contributes varies with the per  capita income of the State. In other  words, under the current rules of the  program,  the poorer States get more  from the Federal Government than the  richer States.  The assumption is that the taxpayers  in the richer States can afford to as sume more of the costs of providing  health care for the poor than can the  taxpayers of the poorer States.  The problem that we are addressing  today, Mr. President, is that a  large  number of States have devised creative  ways and methods to draw down addi tional Federal matching money  for  their State Medicaid Program without  even  investing additional new State  funds raised by broad-based taxes.  In fact, Mr. President, some of the  States have found ways of getting more  Federal money for their Medicaid Pro grams without  investing  any  new  money at all in the program. Some of  these methods seem  to me  to be of  questionable validity.  What can you say about any State  that permits a  foundation apparently  created especially for  the purpose  to  borrow from a financial institution, in vest the borrowed money in the Medic aid Program, then use it to draw down  the Federal match at not less than 50  cents on the dollar, and then repay the  financial institution for the money al ready borrowed?  Let us call such arrangements what  the  inspector general of the Depart ment of HHS called them, and that in spector general said they are a ''scam.''  The general method used was pretty  well described by Dr. Wilensky, She is  the Administrator, as you know, of  HCF A. This was made in testimony be fore the Committee on Finance earlier  this week. I am following her descrip tion here very closely.  States borrow money from providers,  and  those providers usually are  the  hospitals from which the money is di vided,  through donation or  tax pro grams. This money is then used as the  States'  share  of Medicaid,  and  is  matched by Federal money at  least  dollar for dollar.  In some States, as Dr. Wilensky de scribes this, the States reimburse pro viders for the donations or taxes that  they have paid by increasing Medicaid  payments to them. The States then use  Federal matching funds to pay provid ers for Medicaid services.  Dr. Wilensky made it clear in her tes timony that it is at least theoretically  possible in these arrangements for the  Federal Government to pay 100 percent  of a State's Medicaid Program.  This is not just a problem of a  few  States. This started out as probably a  very  innocent proposition out  there  with a few States just a  little over a  year ago, I believe, maybe a little over  a couple years ago. But there has been  a  tremendous growth in this practice.  So we are not talking about a minor  problem here.  These methods  have  spread  very  quickly among the States, and so has  the money  that  the Federal Govern ment has been  spending as  a  con sequence of these new approaches.  According  to Dr. Wilensky's testi mony, in 1986 only one State was using  such methods. So I stand corrected in  the sense that I said it was only a little  short while ago. But let us say 5 years  ago, only one State. By the middle of  this year 38 States were using dona tions and tax programs.  In October 1990, the inspector general  reported that $497 million in matching  funds for donations and provider taxes  were requested by nine States. In May  1991, 18 States will request $2.5 billion.  By July 1991, 30 States had requested  $3.8 billion in matching funds.  The Health Care Financing Adminis tration  is currently estimating  that  States will request at least $5.5 billion  to match these donations and these tax  programs in fiscal year 1992.  So, I hope what is a fact here, a fact  that I just described, is readily seen as  being no small matter. This is a  tre mendous consequence of this program.  And the consequences are going to be  greater if we do not solve this problem  soon.  First, these arrangements are creat ing inequities among the States. States  which do not engage in these methods  like my own State of Iowa will not be  getting  their fair share of aggregate  Federal contributions to the program.  My  leading  newspaper,  the  Des  Moines Register, in an editorial enti tled ""Iowa's Honest, and Loses,"" said  this:  Thirty-seven States are cheating the Fed eral Treasury out of health-care money,  aided and abetted by the U.S. Congress. Iowa  is not one of the 37-and its honesty is cost ing its residents millions upon millions of  dollars.  That is the end of the quote from the  Des Moines Register.  So I want to stress the same point  that the Register is making, Mr. Presi dent, because I know that we are going  to hear lots of talk today about hurt ing poor moms, and babies, from the  advocates of continuing these funding  mechanisms, some of which have been  described by the inspector general as a  scam.  Nobody wants to hurt the poor, but  in a very important sense that is not  the issue here. The issue is because we  have already decided to  take care of  people who qualify for Medicaid, who is  going  to pay for helping people who  qualify? The  issue  is whether  the  States that engage in those funding ar rangements are going to make the tax payers of other States pay for things  they do not want to ask their own tax payers to pay for.  So why should the State of Iowa deal  straightforwardly with its budget prob lems? We have laid off 1,200 State em ployees. We have absorbed 31h percent  across-the-board budget cuts, cutting  deeply into other valuable State pro grams to try to solve our budget prob lems the very best way we know how  without any help outside of our borders  while other States are in the process of  thinking up scams to take money from  the Federal Treasury, kind of a ripoff  fashion, and thus solve or at least re duce their own budget deficits.  ",1991
1347,38,24,Mr. DODD., That is right.  ,1991
1348,38,24,Mr. DURENBERGER.," They used  a  definition  of  disproportionate  share  hospital which is in the proposed HCF A  regulations.  It is not  in  this agree ment, unfortunately, because we could  not get an agreement on it, but it was  in  the  proposed HCF A  regulations.  They took that definition of dispropor tionate share and amended and put in  an application  to amend  their State  plan, but they did  it, unfortunately,  after September 30.    So here was a situation in which a  State tried to follow  the  law as  the  Federal Government was  laying  it  down,  tried to play by the rules, but  they got their application in after the  deadline, which was incorporated both  into the moratorium by the chairman  of the Finance Committee and by the  agreement.  So I am pleased with the work the  two Senators from Connecticut have  done.  I am particularly pleased that  when we are going to talk about the  scams and  schemes of  some  people  around here  that the one State that  had the greatest pressure on it of all,  Connecticut, has  tried  to  follow  the  law as it relates  to  the appropriate  partnership between  the Federal and  State Government in providing for the  needs of low-income Americans.  I  thank my colleagues for his com ments and I  thank him  for bringing  this matter to our attention and I am  very pleased we could work it out.  ",1991
1349,38,24,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  thank  the Senator from Minnesota for those  comments and his characterization of  the State. It has been a difficult time  for us, fiscally, with a significant defi cit and a real struggle occurring as to  how to deal with that deficit.  Despite the reputation of the State of  Connecticut of being one of the most  affluent States of  the country-and  that  is  true on a per capita income  basis-it comes as a  shock  to many  people that Hartford, New Haven, and  Bridgeport rank in the top 10 of the  poorest cities with populations over  100,000 in the United States. So amidst  great affluence there was also poverty  in a  small State. This provision will  make  a  great deal  of difference  to  those people we are trying to serve who  fall into that category.  I should have added as well that since  1980, our health care expenditures have  increased by 150 percent in the State of  Connecticut.  It is  a  staggering  in crease. I  think that is well above the  national average. The national average  has also been rather high, but this, I  think, is substantially higher.  Mr. President, again my compliments  and  thanks  to Senator BENTSEN,  the  chairman of the committee, as well as  Senator DURENBERGER. They have pro vided the people of my State with a  great deal of assistance and relief by  their willingness to accept this change  of date provision which could make a  difference for people.

1372,51,24,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, I am  going to support the agreement so ar duously negotiated between  the Gov ernors' Association  and  the Health  Care Financing Administration.  As  I understand  it,  the Governors  firmly support  the agreement. And  I  have kept in close touch with my own  Governor's office and my State's Med icaid Program throughout this debate.  I have to say that I think it is unfor tunate that the cutoff date for com mencement of the provider tax funding  mechanisms which would be accepted  for Federal matching funds had to be  moved forward to last week in order to  gain the adherence of several States to  the  agreement being negotiated be tween  the Governors and  the Health  Care Financing Administration.  However this is scored by the Office  of Management and Budget for Budget  act purposes,  the need to get support  for  this agreement  from States who  started  these funding mechanisms at  the last minute, so to speak, is going  to cost the Federal taxpayer more.  Nevertheless, at least this agreement  enables us to impose some constraints  .703  1.000  1.064  1.064  1.064  1.064  .688  .688  .688  .688  .688  .762  .762  .531  .504  .504  .762  .762  .762  .504  .504  .504  :;~:  :;~:  :;~:  :;~:  :~~:  . 504  .656  _504  on  the  future  spending  that would  occur  under  these  funding  arrange ments.  I also believe that it is unfortunate  that we must change the basic nature  of the Medicaid Program under these  circumstances. I agree with other Sen ators who have said that the way we  should  transform  the Medicaid Pro gram, if that is what we want to do, is  to fully debate it through the legisla tive process.  :m two, if we pass this legislation, we have  Instead, over a period of a week or  accepted the principle that the States,  if they so choose, can impose taxes on  heal th care providers as a way of fund ing the Medicaid Program. I am not  :m idea, Mr. President .  particularly  comfortable  with  this  :m ment will impose some regularity and  Nevertheless,  this Governors' agree standards on these unorthodox funding  mechanisms, and is, in my view clearly  preferable  to a moratorium, however  short we would like its ending date to  be.  I have several problems with proceed ing with a moratorium, even if it is a  relatively short one  like  that which  was reported from  the Committee on  Finance over my opposition.  To begin with, I do not believe that  we will end up with a moratorium end ing April 1. I do not doubt for a minute  that the chairman of the Finance Com mittee will work hard to achieve such  a concluding date for a moratorium.  What I do doubt is the willingness of  the other body to go along. Their mor atorium legislation has an ending date  of September 30.  I have heard  that  some of the Members of the other body,  who will be on any conference commit tee, do not want to see these funding  arrangements  ended.  Furthermore,  there are even members of the Finance  Committee who would  like  to see a  later date  for  the conclusion of the  moratorium.  Thus, we could easily end up with a  concluding date for the moratorium in  June or even later. By that time, we  will be in the Presidential and Congres sional election campaigns and it will  become more and more difficult to get  the  issue  resolved. We will  then be  tempted to postpone the issue until the  next Congress. This certainly seems to  me to be a likely an outcome as any.  Second,  this moratorium  is  two sided-the  regulations would not be  able  to go  forward,  and  all States  would be  frozen more or  less where  they are, even the ones which are not  using these methods. States like Iowa,  which do not engage in these methods,  will continue to be treated differently  than the other States.  If I am right in assuming that we will  end up with a  longterm moratorium,  States like Iowa will be completely fro zen out of using methods which we  have legitimated for other States.  Although I have serious reservations  about such funding methods, I cannot  .762  .762  .762  .762  .762  .762  .641  dif countenance  different  rules  for  ferent States. That just is not fair.  In summary, Mr. President, we need  to get some control over this problem,  and the only way we can hope  to do  that is to support the Governor's agree ment. States now using these methods  have some protection. States such as  Iowa, which do not use these methods  would at least be able to participate in  the program on the same terms as the  other States, if they so choose.  MEDICARE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION  PROGRAM  ",1991
1373,51,24,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President, I would  like to engage the distinguished chair man of the Finance Committee on a  topic of some importance to the States  of Wyoming and Missouri.  Earlier today I had planned to offer  an amendment to the Medicaid legisla tion; however, rather than hold up such  an important measure with an amend ment that we did not have an oppor tunity  to  clear with  the House,  I  agreed to withdraw the language and  offer it instead as a freestanding bill.  As  the chairman knows, Mr. Presi dent,  there are hospital  facilities  in  Wyoming and Missouri that were unin tentionally  left out of  the Medicare  Graduate Medical Education Program  when Congress enacted changes to that  statute in 1986. They were left out be cause the statutory language did not  anticipate  the  circumstances  that  these facilities found themselves in at  the time, of that they find themselves  in now. As a result, without a technical  change to the statutory wording, these  hospitals cannot get back in.  This is a critical issue to Wyoming,  which has just over 500 active physi cians  to  serve  99,000  square miles.  Though its complement of residents is  modest, Wyoming's sole Medical Resi dency Program is a significant source  of physician supply in the State.  Prior  to  1988, Wyoming's Medical  Residency Program was housed in, fi nanced and administered by the State  University. In 1988,  the residency pro gram spun off from the university to  the  hospital-probably  appropriate- since we do not have a medical school  at the university. The hospital now has  full operational, financial and adminis trative responsibility for the program.  However,  the hospital does not now,  nor has it ever, received a dime in Med icare  direct  graduate medical  edu cation reimbursement.  As  the chairman knows, Mr. Presi dent,  the Medicare Direct GME Pro gram was established  to compensate  hospitals for approved graduate medi cal education costs  in proportion  to  their Medicare patient  load. That  is  fair policy.  Unfortunately, the Medicare statute  denies Wyoming its fair share of these  critical funds. The statute bases hos pital GME reimbursement on 1984 cost  reports. Since the Wyoming facility did  not incur any costs until it assumed  ",1991
1374,77,24,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President,  I  thank my  friend  from New Mexico.  Steve's fingerprints are all over this,  and his name is in it. The record should  surely show that if we have responded  to the need for Indian roads, it is at the  insistent behest and persuasive advo cacy of the very distinguished Senator  from New Mexico.  We are all in his debt. I would like to  acknowledge that.  Mr. DOMENIC!. Mr. President, let me  start by  thanking  the distinguished  Senate members  of  the  conference  committee, who have toiled diligently  to complete their work on this bill.  If we want to talk about jobs for this  country, Mr. President, this conference  report will provide significant employ ment opportunities for  the people of  this country.  Its passage is imperative before we  adjourn for  the year, and I commend  the conferees for coming to agreement,  despite the significant differences that  existed between the Senate-passed and  Housed-passed bills.  I will try to be brief in my comments  because I know  that there are many  Members who wish to speak.  Because of the strong interest in this  bill by  residents of New Mexico,  I  began my review of the highway and  transit programs 10 months ago. I was  fortunate enough to gather the experts  in my State  together  to serve on a  Task Force  to advise me on pending  legislation and issues of greatest con cern to my State.  As a result of their advice, I pursued  a number of initiatives on the Senate  floor.  One initiative on which I devoted a  significant amount of time was to pro vide more funding for  the Indian res ervation roads program.  Mr. President, if you wish to see a  system of substandard roads,  I would  encourage you to visit some of the In dian reservations of this country. The  Indian people  live  in  isolated areas,  and that isolation has been magnified  because of the difficulty of movement.  Their road system has been rated by  the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the  results are an embarrassment. Only 11  percent of the paved roads and none of  the unpaved roads were rated as good.  Conversely,  53 percent of  the paved  roads and a staggering 90 percent of the  unpaved roads were rated as poor!  But this bill finally corrects this in equity.  As I understand what is contained in  this bill, we are able to tell the Indian  people of this country that we will pro vide, over the next 6 years, $1.1 billion.  Averaged out over 6 years, that means  we will be providing, out of the High way Trust Fund, $190 million a year to  finally begin the process of upgrading  this system of roads. Mr. President,  this action is long-overdue.  In addition,  the Conferees accepted  several provisions in the House bill to  improve key aspects of Indian reserva tion roads. First of all, there is a one  percent set-aside for bridges located on  Indian reservations roads.  As well, because about one half of  rural roads on Indian lands are not part  of the Indian Reservation Roads sys tem, this bill makes it clear that these  reservation roads are eligible for fund ing under  the State Rural Mobility  System.  Finally,  provisions  have  been  in cluded to provide highway training, In dian  preference  for  projects  con structed near reservations, transfer of  road funds to tribally-controlled post secondary vocational education  insti tutions, and the use of up to two per cent of funds available for Indian res ervations roads for planning activities.  I would also like to take this oppor tunity  to  thank  several of my col leagues on the Select Committee on In dian Affairs, who helped secure  these  provisions--Senators  INOUYE, McCAIN,  DECONCINI,  MURKOWSKI,  DASCHLE,  CONRAD, and SIMON.

1375,77,24,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I am  proud to join my colleague from New  York, Mr. MOYNIHAN, and many other  Senators in supporting the 1991 Surface  Transportation Act.  Thirty years ago, we were spending  approximately 2.3 percent of our GNP  on capital  investments  in  infrastruc ture. We were building the roads and  bridges and airports that were both a  backbone of America's postwar growth,  and an engine of that growth.  Spending on infrastructure peaked in  1980. Since then,  the Federal Govern ment has taken a shortsighted and nar row-minded view of Federal spending,  treating it as a burden to be shifted  onto the state rather than an invest ment in the future. As a result of this  neglect, we enter the 21st century with  an infrastructure that is decaying be fore our eyes. Our roads and bridges are  crumbling. According  to  the Depart ment of Transportation, the poor con dition of our highways meant an addi tional  722 million hours  of vehicle  delay in 1985, delays that waste gas, re duce productivity and lower our stand ard of living.

1398,155,24,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I listened  carefully  to  the words of the distin guished Senator from New Jersey, Mr.  LAUTENBERG,  and I congratulate him  on his assessment of where we find our selves at this moment. There is not one  of the observations of the Senator from  New Jersey that is not important for  us to consider.  As we are here late at night, on a  night when the Congress is pressing to  complete its business, I must comment  on the amount of unfinished business  that faces us, not just as a Congress  but as a country.  Yesterday, I heard the distinguished  Senator from South Carolina, Mr. HOL LINGS,  open  the morning business of  the Senate with the discussion about  the state of this country with respect  to our national debt. I must say that as  I listened to him, I was struck. I have  mouthed the words. I, too, have talked  about it. I think we all have. But what  the Senator from South Carolina ably  pointed out is the degree to which we  are currently stealing, literally steal ing, from the future.  As the Senator from Texas, Senator  GRAMM, pointed out the other day in  making an argument against legislat ing  additional  unemployment  insur ance  benefits,  the  trust  fund  from  which we were trying to pay those ben efits does not have  the money. While  charts might be held up on the Senate  floor and Senators might address the  notion that the trust fund is there and  American citizens have paid into the  trust fund with an expectation that it  will provide the benefits it is intended  to provide, the fact is the money is not  there. The Federal Government has  borrowed it to cover part of the na tional debt.  The same thing, sadly, is true with  respect to Social Security. People are  currently paying into the Social Secu rity  trust  fund with an expectation  that when  they retire  they and  this  generation will have paid enough into  the  trust fund  to cover  their retire ment benefits. But  the  reality, Mr.  President, is that this administration  and this Congress, this administration  by proposal and this Congress by commission or assent, are permitting those  trust funds to be depleted in order to  pay for current expenses.  So 10, 15, 20 years from now when a  new generation retires with the expect ancy of receiving Social Security, we  are going to discover we have borrowed  billions of dollars from the trust fund.  As a result of permitting the President  of the United States to carry on the ex traordinary charade of pretending  to  the American people that you can have  everything but it does not cost any thing, that you can continue to spend  and pursue the most extraordinary pe riod of Keynesian stimulus in the his tory of this Nation while denying it is  spending because it is borrowed, we are  going to have a head-on collision with  reality, Mr. President. It is going  to  stun everybody in this Nation.  In fact, that is precisely what we are  witnessing in our economy today. Peo ple are  scared. There  is a  crisis of  consumer confidence that grows out of  the  feeling  that  the  job will not be  there, the paycheck will not be there,  the house might not be there, the edu cation may not be there for my kids- a  sense  that what we  have  always  called the American dream is about to  collide with reality.  In the next few hours, Mr. President,  we are going to be asked to OK the as sumption of extraordinary amounts of  additional debt. At some point we must  confront reality.  Mr. President, as the father of 2 chil dren and as someone who tries hard to  measure what we do here against the  standard of what will be helpful to fu ture generations, as I think most of my  colleagues do,  I believe honesty with  ourselves requires us  to admit  there  really is a gap between  the rhetoric  and the reality. In the final analysis,  there are two Americas. There is the  American  ideal  that politicians  talk  about and pay  tribute  to, and  then  there is the America that we really are  and are becoming.  It  is  that  latter  America that is very troubling to me.  The reality is that on almost every  level at which there is substantive con frontation, there is a gap between what  is said and done  in Washington and  what people see and feel out in the rest  of the country, whether it is in crime  fighting or in housing, or whether it is  in AIDS research or education.  All of this looms menacingly in these  final moments, as the Congress is de parting. The  fact  is, Mr. President,  that  the voodoo  economics  that we  heard about in the early 1980's has been  augmented  in recent days by voodoo  arithmetic. We have seen $4 billion of  loans that suddently became $10 billion  of bailouts, that became $30 billion of  deficits and debt through inflation and  interest payments and systematic in competence.  Mr. President, for the first  time in  the history of  the United States of  America we are about to pay more in  ",1991
1399,194,24,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President,  today I  am introducing a bill to amend the Job  Training Partnership Act  [JTP A]  to  strengthen employment and  training  assistance programs and  to  improve  the targeting of services to economi cally disadvantaged adults and youth. I  want to thank my good friends and col leagues, Senators KENNEDY and THuR MOND, for cosponsoring this bill and for  their help in drafting its provisions. I  also want to express my appreciation  to Chairman FORD, of the House Edu cation and Labor Committee, and Rep resentatives PERKINS, GooDLING,  and  GUNDERSON who were instrumental in  passing  similar  amendments  in  the  House  of  Representatives.  Those  amendments, embodied  in H.R.  3033,  passed the House of Representatives on  October 9, 1991, by a vote of 420 to 6.  We are introducing this bill because  our Nation  today  is  facing  the one  enemy no peacetime economy has de feated-unemployment. Achieving full  employment is the next logical step for  a humane society and a society that in tends to squarely confront the issue of  global competitiveness and productiv ity. We cannot be competitive or pro ductive when millions of Americans  are out of work. We must meet  the  challenge to put America back to work  for a simple reason. As I have said in  the past, we have two options-we can  pay people  to work, or we  can pay  them for doing nothing. Obviously, it  makes a lot more sense to pay them to  work.  America's economy  is  facing  two  human resource trend lines-the supply  of unskilled,  and  often  uneducated,  labor is going up and the demand for  unskilled  labor  is declining. As we  move toward the 21st century, we know  that employment in professional tech nical and managerial jobs will increase  substantially relative to operative and  laborer positions. We know this is the  trend, yet our work force  is woefully  unprepared  to meet  this  challenge.  JTP A  is  our primary Federal  Job  Training Program, and we must do  what we can to structure the program  to meet the needs of our society.  The way JTPA  is currently struc tured, it will not be able to meet the  goal  of providing  a  productive  and  skilled work force by the year 2000. A  program that enrolls 37 percent of its  participants  in  short-term  training  programs, and a majority of the rest of  enrollees are in on-the-job training and  job-service programs, will not be able  to  significantly  improve  the  skilled  labor shortage. Furthermore, the pro gram will not succeed in training the  hard-to-serve if there are no incentives  to  serve  those participants most  in  need of training and to provide them  more comprehensive training services.  JTPA's predecessor, the Comprehen sive Employment  and Training Act  [CETAJ was plagued with  low place ment rates and high costs per place ment. In addition, CETA has weak pri vate sector  involvement  in planning  the local training activity. JTPA was  designe~ to correct the concerns with  CETA by providing greater decision making power at the State and local  level and increasing the role of the pri vate sector.  JTP A has accomplished the goals of  increased participation in the private  sector,  higher  placement  rates  and  lower costs per placement. Yet we con tinue to hear complaints about JTP A.  Indeed,  overemphasis  on  achieving  some of the goals of the program has  led to failure in other areas. For exam ple,  increased placement  rates have  been achieved,  in part, by  focusing  training efforts on those who are easi est to place. Thus, to a certain extent,  the effort to improve placement num bers resulted  in a  failure  to provide  training services to those most in need.  In addition, while we sought to reduce  the cost per placement, we have re duced the costs to levels so low that  participants  are  often not  provided  with adequate training. The costs are  well below what is needed to provide  training in most  trade and  technical  programs, and the training periods are  increasingly shorter. Average training  periods  are  currently  less  than  12  weeks, while under CETA  it was 20  weeks.  These amendments are designed  to  address the criticisms of JTPA, while  preserving the successful aspects of the  program. The focus of the amendments  is on targeting services to those most  in need, and on improving the quality  of services to those most in need, and  on  improving the quality of services  provided to participants. The bill con tains important programmatic changes  that will improve services and address  perception problems that have led to  decreases in funding. We have provided  for separate adult and youth programs,  with targeting for those with multiple  barriers, and out-of-school youth. We  have retained the summer youth pro gram that has provided much needed  employment  for  impoverished young  people.  In addition,  the bill provides  for  individual needs assessment and  counseling  for  each participant, and  ",1991
1400,220,24,Mr. NUNN.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today  to reintroduce  legislation first  offered in the lOlst Congress to author ize demonstration programs aimed at  establishing a system of youth appren ticeships in  the United States. I am  joined by Senators BREAUX and PRYOR  as original cosponsors, and  I under stand that Congressman DA VE MCCUR DY is planning to introduce companion  legislation in the House of Representa tives.  We  listened  closely  to  comments  from a wide variety of sources on last  year's  legislation,  and  have  incor porated  several  constructive  sugges tions. For example, we have included  language ensuring that demonstration  programs authorized under this legisla tion do not conflict with existing pri vate-sector apprenticeship opportuni ties, especially in the building trades.  We have also fine-tuned the transition  from academic courses to sk111s train ing for prospective apprentices, based  on  the practical  experience of pro grams both in this country and in Eu rope.  Overall, however,  this  is  the same  legislation as last year's with the same  basic rationale: Building a partnership  between secondary and postsecondary  schools  and  employers,  to  provide  noncolleage bound youth real access to  the jobs of the future by giving them  the real-life sk111s they need to perform  them.  I believe the case for a special effort  in sk111s training in America is ma.de  every day by statistics that show we  are not keeping up with the demands of  our  ever-changing workplaces.  The  General Accounting Office  estimates  that approximately 9 million of the Na tion's 33 m111ion youth aged 16  to 24  wm not have the needed sk111s to meet  employer requirements for entry-level  positions.  Our task will not get any easier in  the future, when even more skills will  be necessary in our workplaces. A task  force of the Center for Strategic Inter national Studies found  that the per centage of our  jobs  considered  un skilled is steadily shrinking, from 60  percent in 1960, to 35 percent in 1990, to  an estimated 15 percent in  the year  2000. If we do not begin to catch up in  sk111s training right now, we may find  ourselves and our economy hopelessly  off target in the very near future.  Through a well-designed,  local  job  apprenticeship  program,  supervised  work  experience during high  school  could promote desirable work habits  and workwise knowledge  and  skills.  This approach was inspired by the im pressive success of youth apprentice ship programs in Western Europe, espe cially Germany, England, Sweden, and  Japan, and by the belief that their suc cess substantially contributes  to  the  relative strength of our European and  Japanese  friends  in  competing  for  international markets. I do not, how ever, suggest that we imitate or redu plicate any other country's program.  Instead, we should adapt the principle  of  comprehensive work-based,  com petency-tested  skills  learning  pro grams  to our own culture, economy,  and educational system, through a se",1991
1401,233,24,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, there is a  concern I have, and I suspect it is one  probably shared by many of those who  are watching C-SP AN,  or watching  these proceedings, and that is the prob lem of cable television.  My home  in Vermont is blessed by  the fact that it is so far out in  the  country, and the houses are about a  mile or so apart and you do not have  cable television. In fact, we practically  have no television. I think we get !112  channels; one sort of comes  in, and  other comes in not too bad in the pic ture, but poor in the content.  I constantly run into people who tell  me about the problems with cable tele vision. It was not until I decided, in the  home that I use during the week here  in the Washington area, to put in cable  television that I found out why people  complain so about cable. In the rural  independent part of the country that I  am from, maybe it is just as well they  do not have this type of TV. It would  probably spark a revolution of people  marching on cable headquarters.  So, Mr. President,  I  rise  today  to  speak about Cable TV, an issue which  has the American people fed up, out of  patience and ready for action. They are  tired of rising prices and dismal serv ice, tired of being charged for channels  they never ordered,  converter boxes  they do not want and remote control  units they are forced to rent, tired of  being a captive audience for cable oper ators and tired of too little action from  Congress and the President.  THE CABLE MONOPOLY  Meanwhile, politicians, bureaucrats,  and lobbyists here in Washington show  an amazing ability to stay behind the  curve. Last March, a panel of leading  industry  lights  argued at  a  Senate  hearing that cable is not a monopoly  because  people  have  other  alter natives-such as watching over-the-air  stations, or home videos or driving off  to a ball game, instead of watching it  in their living room. This makes about  as much sense as saying that old Ma  Bell was not a monopoly because peo ple could write  letters or send  tele grams. Settling for a handful of over the air stations or renting a movie is  no substitute for the 30, 50, or 80 chan nels available on cable.  Meanwhile,  our  Federal watchdog  agency, the FCC, after lengthy bureau cratic review, concluded in July that  cable operators face effective competi tion if there are six over-the-air sta tions in their area. This decision was  apparently considered a great advance  over the old rule which said that three  over-the-air  channels  amounted  to  meaningful competition.  All I can say about that is: Guys, you  just do not get it. The bureaucrats and  experts in Washington can debate the  antitrust  laws until  the  cows  come  home and try to convince each other  that cable is not a monopoly, but the  American  people  know  better. Any  consumer from Burlington, VT, to San  Francisco can tell you that if you want  to get a full slate of programming, you  will probably have  to deal with  the  local cable company. If that is not a  monopoly, I do not know what is.  Moreover,  cable  is an unregulated  monopoly. In 1984, Congress stepped in  and freed cable from much regulation.  In fact, basic cable rates were supposed  to be regulated wherever cable faced no  effective competition. But when  the  FCC waved its wand and declared-con trary  to simple common sense-that  virtually all cable operators did face  competition, the operators were off to  the races.  From November 1986  to April 1991,  basic rates shot up by 56 percent. In a  similar period in my own State of Ver mont, prices rose 48 percent. And those  are  just averages. We have all heard  the horror stories about truly astro nomical  increases-of 130 percent  in  Newark; 186 percent in Jefferson City,  MO; and 222 percent in one Connecticut  town because of the monopoly. Mean while, the unprotected victims of this  price-gouging have no recourse.  As cable revenues soared, the indus try  took aggressive steps  to consoli date its position, buying up program mers and preventing potential com petitors like satellite or wireless cable  from gaining access to key program ming. When, for example, cable opera tors deny competitors access to prime  attractions like TNT, with its NBA and  NFL broadcasts, what they are doing is  making the world safe for monopoly.  And unsafe for consumers. As long as  companies face real competition, cus tomers are well served. But if the cus tomer is captive, business' natural im pulse to maximize profits means rising  prices and declining service. That is  why anyone who thinks that cable or  any other monopoly can effectively po lice itself is dreaming.  Of course, in a sense, cable has be come a victim of its own success. The  programming that cable and its newer  competitors like satellite and wireless  deliver has increasingly become a fix ture  in American households. If you  want to see news around the clock on  CNN; if you want to see public affairs  programming on C-SP AN; if you want  to see first-run movies or a full menu  of college and professional sports, you  cannot rely on your old antenna. The  days when people were satisfied with a  handful of broadcast stations are over.  But the more that people come to rely  on cable programming, the more that  cable's monopoly status becomes intol erable.  THE COMPREHENSIVE CABLE BILL-S. 12  A number of my colleagues, including  Senators  HOLLINGS,  INOUYE,  GoRE,  METZENBAUM,  LIEBERMAN,  and DAN FORTH have been wrestling with  the  cable issue for a long time and I com mend their efforts in doing that. In es sence, S. 12 establishes a  temporary  regulatory scheme while encouraging  the growth of a competitive environ ment that will allow regulation to be  phased out.  On  the  regulatory  front, S. 12  re quires that cable rates be reasonable  and establishes standards for adequate  service.  On the competitive front, S. 12 bars  any programmer that owns or is owned  by a cable operator from unreasonably  refusing to deal with competitors like  ",1991
1402,259,24,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  to introduce  legislation that offers a  new way of thinking about how to ex pand our economy so that no one is left  out. Our Government's approach  to ward poor families has, so far, had only  one dimension-increasing short-term  income, spending, and consumption.  We  continue  to be  surprised when  even  aggressive  income-maintenance  efforts fail to reduce the level of pov erty in America significantly. Yet the  fact is that families cannot spend or  consume  their way out of poverty.  Joining the economic mainstream re quires savings, assets, and investment.  Individual development accounts will  give some of the poorest Americans a  chance to build assets so that they can  take the next step on the ladder of self sufficiency: A first home, a college edu cation, or a secure retirement.  Our current welfare system not only  does nothing to help people develop as sets for the future, it actively penalizes  those who try. On the other hand, the  Federal Government spends more than  $100 billion a year  to help better-off  families  accumulate  savings and as sets, especially through the deduction  for home-mortgage  interest and  tax  benefits  for  retirement savings. Now  we are considering restoring enhanced  deductibility for individual retirement  accounts  for  first-time home buyers,  higher education and retirement. Most  of these policies have helped to relieve  financial pressures for families and in dividuals who already possess signifi cant assets-at most, 40 percent of the  population.  It's time  to ask why we  don't offer the same incentives and op portunities to those who don't already  have $2,000 or more set aside. Individ ual development accounts would mir ror expanded individual retirement ac counts  for  those who don't already  have the savings.  The  bill  I  am  introducing  today  would  authorize  $100 million  for  a  broad-based demonstration of the mer its of individual development accounts.  Established community organizations  would use  the Federal demonstration  grant funds, along with State and pri vate contributions,  to subsidize  indi vidual development accounts so  that  those who are making an effort to save  are able  to save about $2,000 a year.  Anyone in a household with an income  below 200 percent of the Federal pov erty line and a net worth below' $20,000  would be eligible for an IDA subsidy.  The very poorest, those with income of  50 percent of the poverty level or less,  would be eligible for a 9-to-1 match up  to $1,800. In other words, if the poorest  poor could save $200 in their IDA,  the  participating  organization  would  match it with $1,800 for a total invest ment of $2,000. At the top end, people  with incomes between 116 and 200 per cent of the poverty level would be eli gible for a 1-to-5 match. They would  have to save $1,650 from their dispos able income in order to receive a $350  subsidy that would bring the total to  $2,000.  Personal  contributions  to an  IDA  would be tax deductible up to $2,000 a  year. Funds withdrawn for one of the  three  legitimate purposes-first-home  purchase, higher education, and retire ment--would not be  included  in  the  gross income of the IDA holder. With drawals for any other purpose would  trigger severe tax penal ties and require  forfeiture of all deposit subsidies.  The  legislation  I  am  introducing  today  should be  the beginning of a  transformation in our thinking about  welfare and economic opportunity in  America. Instead of just helping people  survive day-to-day, we can help people  build a strong, secure future for them selves and their children. Curing pov erty by building assets is a broad strat egy  that goes beyond IDA's. My col league from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY,  has introduced legislation that would  change the AFDC system so that poor  people could build a small investment  in a microenterprise-a business with  five or fewer employees-and become  economically  self-sufficient without  penalty.  I am proud  to  join Senator  GRASSLEY in cosponsoring this overdue  initiative.  Microenterprises, individual develop ment accounts, and other initiatives to  help poor people  invest  rather  than  consume, are the best way to end pov erty, rather than just alleviate its con sequences.  Assets  and  investments  make people stakeholders in our soci ety, and our society is strongest when  everyone has a stake in it.  I ask unanimous consent that a short  technical description of individual de velopment  accounts  and  the  dem onstration program be included in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the descrip tion was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTS  li Definitions. An  Individual Development  Account (IDA) is an optional, earnings-bear ing, tax, benefitted account in the name of  one person.

Amounts in an IDA can be withdrawn  without penalty only for the following des ignated purposes: (1) first-home purchase; (2)  post-secondary education (college/long-term  training); and;  (3)  retirement.

1403,285,24,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, as  chairman of the Committee on Veter ans' Affairs, I am pleased to introduce  today S. 2106, a bill to grant a Federal  charter to the Fleet Reserve Associa tion [FRA]. Joining with me as origi nal cosponsors are  the distinguished  ranking Republican member  of  the  committee, Arlen Specter, and Senator  SLADE GORTON.  The FRA  is  a  nonprofit, national  service  organization  devoted  to  the  welfare of active duty servicemembers  of the sea services and veterans of that  service, and their dependents and sur vivors. Officially chartered  in Penn sylvania  in 1924,  its membership has  grown  to  include 152,000 active duty,  Reserve, and retired enlisted members  of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast  Guard and 323 chapters nationwide.  The FRA' s primary purpose is to rep resent and further the viewpoint of its  members  on matters  pertaining  to  military personnel issues. The associa tion also works closely with the De partment of  the Navy and  the head quarters of the Marine Corps and the  Coast Guard in order to provide mem bers and their families with direct as sistance on individual career problems.  In addition, the FRA assists its mem bers, and their dependents and survi vors with personal problems, especially  those related to military pay and sur vivor benefits, and with matters before  the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Mr.  President,  through  legislative  seminars  and  two  national  publica tions, the FRA keeps its members in formed  about  congressional  activity  relevant to the members' concerns. It  is vitally important in order  to pro mote citizen involvement in the legis lative  process,  that  our  service members and veterans, and their survi vors and dependents, learn about con gressional action  that affects  them,  and  that  they have an organization  like the FRA that will represent their  views before Congress. Such represen tation ensures that Congress is well ad vised of the concerns of the men and  women who serve this Nation.  During my tenure as chairman of the  committee, it has been my privilege to  work with the Fleet Reserve Associa tion on both legislative and oversight  matters. Military personnel and veter ans throughout our great country have  benefited enormously from the FRA's  diligent  and  effective  advocacy  on  their behalf.  Mr.  President,  I  believe  that  the  granting of a Federal charter is an ap propriate form of recognition for this  group and should help promote its val uable ongoing work.  I urge my col leagues' unanimous  support  of  this  measure.  I note that on April 24, 1991, the dis tinguished chairman of the House Vet erans'  Affairs  Committee,  G.  V.  ""SONNY"" MONTGOMERY, and the rank ing Republican member, BOB STUMP,  introduced H. R. 2070, a substantively  identical bill to grant the FRA a Fed eral charter. I look forward to working  with Chairman MONTGOMERY and Mr.  STUMP to secure passage of this legisla tion.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 2106  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECION 1.

I have spoken on  the  floor regarding the situation in Zaire  before now, and I remain gravely con cerned. I feel that it is important that  we in the Senate take urgent action on  the very serious crisis Zaire is now fac ing. President Mobutu is still clinging  to power,  and has  in  fact used his  power  to choose still another prime  minister, rather than seeking the input  of  the main opposition coalition on  this important decision. Proposals to  arrange for a transl ti on to free and fair  elections appear blocked. This resolu tion will express the Senate's desire to  see  a  transitional  government  in stalled, a government which will begin  to address the dire economic situation  and to respect human rights in Zaire.  It will send a message to Africa that  America supports efforts to ensure de mocracy and peace for all Africans.

CON. RES. 81  Whereas visionary art is the art produced  by self-taught individuals who are driven by  their own internal impulses to create;  Whereas the visionary artist's product is a  striking personal  statement possessing  a  powerful and often spiritual quality;  Whereas prominent among the creators of  visionary art are the mentally 111,  the dis abled, and the elderly;  Whereas there are many museums of vi sionary art located throughout Europe such  as  the Art Brut Museum  located  in Lau sanne, Switzerland;  Whereas the American Visionary Art Mu seum is the first museum in North America  to be wholly dedicated to assembling a com prehensive national collection of American  visionary art;  Whereas the collection at the American Vi sionary Art Museum  includes  film,  lit erature, and research on all fields related to  visionary art;  Whereas the American Visionary Art Mu seum's mission is to increase public aware ness of uncommon art produced by individ uals  in  response  to  extraordinary  cir cumstances;  Whereas the American Visionary Art Mu seum seeks to remove the stigma associated  with disability by illuminating the power of  humans to triumph over adversity through  creativity;  Whereas the national policy of deinstitu tionalization has resulted in the closure of  many facilities and the destruction of vision ary artwork;  Whereas the American Visionary Art Mu seum has the support of certain offices of the  National  Institute of Mental Health  and  other government agencies  in  its goal  to  function as a national repository for works  produced by formerly institutionalized indi viduals; and  Whereas it is the best interest of the na tional welfare and all American citizens to  preserve visionary art and to celebrate this  unique art form: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved by  the Senate  (the House of Rep resentatives concurring), That it is the sense  of the Congress that(1) visionary art should be designated as a  rare and valuable national treasure to which  we devote our attention, support, and re sources to make certain that it is collected,  preserved, and understood; and  (2) the American Visionary Art Museum is  the  proper national  repository  and  edu cational center for visionary art.

1406,376,24,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. President,  it is with pride  that I  rise  today in  honor of Minnesotan John Berkey, de signer of  the 1991 Christmas  stamp.  Millions of Christmas greetings will be  received  in homes across  the Nation  during  this holiday  season  and  at tached to those cards and letters will  be  John's contemporary  designs  of  Santa in a variety of Christmas scenes.  This year's Christmas series marks a  continuation of a successful career for  John Berkey.  In addition  to holiday  stamps, John has been commissioned  by the U.S. Postal Service to design  the 1983 Christmas stamp as well as the  recently  issued Hubert H. Humphrey  postage stamp. A resident of Excelsior,  MN,  since 1941,  John's artwork has  been seen by millions of Americans in  films as well as his sketches and paint ings. Anyone picking up the upcoming  book ""Painted Space"" will easily rec ognize John's work.  Mr. President, again I salute John  Berkey on being chosen as the designer  of  the 1991 Christmas  stamp,  and  I  thank him for allowing us to share in  the gift of his marvelous talents.

1407,376,24,Mr.  SIMON.," Mr. President,  crimes  are not committed in some vacuum. I  do not suggest that criminals should  not be punished for their actions, nor  should we say that society is always to  blame and, therefore, we have to treat  those who commit crimes with great  leniency.  But just as we have been told that  unemployment is a major cause of al cohol and drug abuse, social conditions  create other crimes.  Recently,  I  read an article of one  prison inmate written by Bill Smith of  the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  It is a moving story, and it is a re minder that we have to pay attention  to our social problems if we are to sig nificantly reduce the crime problem.  I ask that the article be printed in  the RECORD at this point.  The article follows:  [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Nov. 19,  1991]  LIFE STORY: BURDENS, DREAMS MINGLE FOR  INMATE, 20  (By Bill Smith)  Sometimes, on these cold November a~er­ noons, Richard Perry says, he will sit and  read to his friend inside the stark third-floor  walls of City Hall.  ""You got to start off with the easy books,""  said Perry, who is jailed on a murder charge.  ""I've been reading him a book called 'Lady  Bug' from the library. It's a  little cartoon  book about kids and animals. I try to teach  him the words.  ""We'll watch a  little TV, or play some  spades or some checkers. Some of us play  chess; Donald doesn't play chess.""  On November 19, Donald Earl McCarthy  will turn 21.  He can't read.  He can't write.  He doesn't know the name of the president  of the United States.  He never has held a steady job.  Nov. 19 will mark his 94th straight day as  a prisoner of the city of St. Louis-the 94th  day  since  police discovered him and his  younger brother hiding atop a walk-in cooler  inside Flayer's Tavern. It was 4 a.m. on a  warm August morning, and he had $14 stuffed  in his pockets-all in quarters, dimes and  nickels.  ""I ain't going to lie about it,"" he said in an  interview. ""We went in there to get some  money.""  In nine days, Donald McCarthy legally will  be a man.  He doesn't have a drivers license.  He is deaf in one ear and hearing impaired  in the other.  His speech is crude, slurred and difficult to  understand.  If he could travel anywhere in the world,  he said, ""I think I'd go to a bingo game.  ""Do you think,"" he asked a reporter, ""that  I could get out for my birthday? I'd like to  go to see a movie-maybe the one about that  little dude who got in all that trouble at  Christmas. I saw a thing for that one in the  newspaper.""  He spent part of last summer living in a  storage shed in Lawrence Cooley's junkyard  in the Cote Brillante neighborhood, eating  White Castle hamburgers when he could get  some money and earning a  few dollars by  helping Cooley and the boys load old tires  onto trucks.  He's a good little worker, but I can't be re sponsible for him,"" Cooley said. ""You got to  watch him so he don't hurt himself.  ""He'll call from jail almost every day, ask ing me, ""if he get out can he have a job.""  His mother and his stepfather say  they  can't scrape together $250  to pay his bond.  They don't even have enough  to pay  this  month's rent, said John Alsup, McCarthy's  stepfather.  ",1991
1408,402,24,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. President, I would  like to call to the attention of the Sen ate the upcoming retirement of Bruce  Seaton, chairman of the board of direc tors  and  chief  executive  officer  of  American President Companies, Ltd.  Bruce is known by many members of  the Senate, particularly those of us in volved in the maritime and intermodal  transportation  communities. He  be came the president and chief operating  officer of American President Lines in  1977, and led  the company  through a  number of periods of growth to become  the state-of-the-art intermodal trans portation company it is today.  Bruce Seaton has been a visionary  and an innovator within the maritime  and transportation communities. Well  ahead of many of his peers, he recog nized  that  shippers would  be  best  served  by  transportation  companies  which blended the advantage inherent  in each mode of  transportation and  linked  those modes  together  through  sophisticated information networks.  Bruce's contributions have strength ened the U.S. maritime industry, vir tually created America's leading dou ble stack rail network, enhanced  the  competitiveness of U.S. goods overseas  and  upgraded  out  national  defense  transportation system.  Mr. President, in 1989 Bruce Seaton  was named an Admiral of the Ocean  Seas [AOTOS], considered by many to  be the most prestigious industry award  in the U.S. maritime community. By  this, and many other measures, Bruce  Seaton has made tremendous contribu tions  to  the  transportation  industry  and his country.  We wish Bruce Seaton well as he re tires  from his current position, and  look forward to his continued involve ment as our Nation wrestles with the  challenges of the 1990's.   WAR ON DRUGS IS FAR FROM  OVER  ",1991
1409,402,24,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President,  for  some time now,  the Bush administra tion has been claiming great progress  in the Nation's ongoing war on drugs.  This past week, two items caught my  attention which would suggest that the  progress may not be as great as the ad ministration would like us to believe.  First, the Washington Post on Sun day, November 17, 1991,  reported that  for  the first time in over a year, co caine-related visits  to hospital emer gency rooms were on  the rise. Since  1989,  the number  of  cocaine-related  emergencies had been decreasing slow ly, however, according to a study to be  released within the next 2 weeks by the  drug abuse warning network and  the  National  Institute  on Drug Abuse,  there was an alarming increase during  the first 3 months of 1991. These figures  seem to indicate that hard core cocaine  use in the United States is again on the  rise and remains a serious threat to the  public health. It is incumbent on the  President and the Director of the Office  of National Drug Control Policy, Gov ernor Martinez, to look closely at the  results of this study before trying to  convince Congress next year that their  efforts to eradicate this country's drug  problem are succeeding.  The second  item which caused me  enormous  concern  occurred  on  the  international front. The Los Angeles  Times on November 20, 1991, carried a  story which comes at a critical point in  the United States' relations with Mex ico on counternarcotics activities. It  appears that on November 7, 1991, dur ing an inspection of a private aircraft  suspected of carrying illegal drugs into  Mexico,  on  a  remote  airstrip near  Veracruz, Mexico, a  team of Mexican Federal law enforcement agents, work ing as part of a special response team  cooperating with United States drug  agents, were ambushed and murdered  by Mexican Army troops.  According  to  the Times article,  a  group of Mexican-Federal law enforce ment agents were dispatched to an air strip where the suspect aircraft found  to be carrying 800 pounds of cocaine,  was brought down, only to be met by a  hailstorm of gunfire and Mexican Army  soldiers. Seven Mexican drug agents  were killed. Two were shot in the back  at close range and one was shot point  blank in the mouth.  Mr. President, the Mexican Army ini tially depicted the attack as a  tragic  mistake.  I  find  this hard  to believe,  particularly since  the operation took  place during a 2-hour period, through out which a great deal of information  concerning the operation was commu nicated  to  the Mexican Army com mander. From the information in the  article, it is absurd to believe that the  troops responsible for the slaying could  not have known  that  the men  they  were aiming fire at were their own Fed eral drug agents. The aircraft  from  which the drug agents departed carried  the  insigna of  the Federal Attorney  General's office.  Mr. President, I am outraged by this  deplorable and inhumane act of crimi nal wrongdoing. It just demonstrates  to what lengths those involved in drug  trafficking will go  to continue  their  criminal activities. The article stated  that President Salinas has directed the  Mexican National Human Rights Com mission to investigate the incident. I  hope President Salinas is serious about  this  investigation. Those  responsible  for this vicious and heinous crime must  be vigorously pursued, brought to jus tice, and prosecuted to the fullest ex tent of the law.  This  incident not only offends my  senses, but it may as well have very se rious consequences for continued Unit ed States cooperation with Mexico on  drug enforcement. Since President Sa linas took office, United States-Mexico  ",1991

Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the gentleman  for  yielding the time and thank the sub committee  chairman  and  commend  him and the ranking minority mem bers for this very forceful and appro priate resolution. I rise in strong sup port of the resolution.  Mr.  Speaker,  freedom  is winning  around the world, but it has not yet  won. This is chilling evidence of the  fact that there are places in the world  where when a man or woman speaks  his or her mind or takes an act of poli t i cal conscience, the penalty can still be  severe. I commend the committee for  pointing this out, and I would suggest  that the only way that the momentum  of freedom  that we have seen in the  last few years can be reversed is if good  people of good faith like the members  of this committee fail to act and fail to  tell Vietnam,  in  this case,  that  the  world is watching this trial.  So I  thank and commend the mem bers of the committee.  ",1991

1418,441,24,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I  move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H.

RES. 292  Resolved, That it is the sense of the House  of Representatives that any legislation enacted with respect to amortization of good will and certain other intangibles for Federal  income tax purposes should contain a provi sion permitting taxpayers to elect in a con sistent manner the provisions of such legis lation with respect to transactions after the  date on which H.R. 3035 of the One Hundred  Second Congress was introduced and before  the otherwise prescribed effective date of  such legislation.

1422,441,24,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself  such  time  as  I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  support of  House Resolution 292,  expressing  the  sense of the House with respect to the  effective date of legislation to simplify  the tax treatment of intangible assets.  As  reported by  the Committee on  Ways and Means,  this  sense of  the  House  resolution would promote eco nomic stability by ensuring that nor mal business transactions are not held  up while tax simplification legislation  works its way through the legislative  process.  Last July,  I  introduced H.R.  3035,  which would eliminate much of  the  controversy over the tax treatment of  intangible assets by providing a uni form, predictable set of rules for amor tizing these assets. This bill was one of  a series of bills that I introduced this  year relating to tax simplification.  The Committee on Ways and Means  has held 2 days of hearings on H.R. 3035  and the issue of the tax treatment of  intangibles. While some problems re main to be worked out, I have been en couraged by the public response to the  bill, which has been overwhelmingly  favorable.  I am also gratified by  the  Treasury Department's position in sup port of the bill.  As  introduced, H.R. 3035 would be come effective on  the date of enact ment of the bill. Concern has recently  been  expressed  that business  trans actions are being held up because of  uncertainty as to when this legislation  might be enacted.  House Resolution 292 would alleviate  these concerns by stating the sense of  the House that in the event that intan gible  legislation is enacted into law,  taxpayers should be allowed to elect to  apply the legislation to all acquisitions  of intangible assets taking place after  ",1991
1423,493,24,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Speaker, I strongly support  the technical amendments  to the 1990 farm  bill.  I applaud the efforts of Chairman DE LA  GARZA, Congressman THOMAS COLEMAN, rank ing minority member, and our counterparts on  the Senate Aguriculture Committee  for  their  hard work on this legislation.  Included in this  package are several provisions of great impor tance to farmers in Minnesota, and throughout  the nation.  The amendments will restore the price sup port loan program for high-moisture corn es tablished in the 1985 Food Security Act. This  program is especially important for dairy farm ers for com used on the farm for feed or sold  as silage. This loan program has kept many of  our family dairy farmers in Minnesota in busi ness by providing short-term operating  loan  funds.  The  legislation also makes clarifications of  the planting requirements  for cover crops on  acreage set aside for ~nserving uses. This is  an important provision for plantings to reduce  erosion and provide wildlife habitat on farms  that are enrolled in commodity acreage reduc tion programs. The bill will allow producers to  plant and maintain perennial grasses as cover  crops  rather  than planting a new crop each  year.  Finally,  the bill gives producers additional  flexibility to plant alternative crops on acreage  enrolled in the acreage reduction programs. A  major  focus of  the 1990  farm bill was  in creased planting flexibility for farmers to allow  them  to respond more easily and quickly to  rapidly changing market forces and  reduced  federal  agricultural  price  supports.  This  amendment will allow the planting of certain  minor-use,  industrial, and experimental crops  on  such acreage,  thus giving our  farmers  more  viable options  in  their cropping pro grams.

1429,519,24,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr. Chairman, I  would like to have the Members of the  House  consider  that,  if  they  think  there is no cost in H.R. 2929, when they  come to pay for their parks and recre ation on the east coast,  think about  where  the money  is going  to come  from. It is all going to California.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank  the gentleman from Guam [Mr. BLAZ].  Not many people know General BLAZ.  He, as a boy, came from Guam, and  looked at the 9th Marine Regiment and  said, ""I think I can do  that."" Well,  General BLAZ grew up to lead the 9th  Marine Regiment  and  is very note worthy in his attempts in what he is  trying to do.  However, Mr. Chairman, I would like  to point out some shortfalls. I rise in  support of the amendment of the gen tleman from Guam [Mr. BLAZ], but op posed to H.R. 2929.  The  amendment of  the gentleman  from Guam [Mr. BLAZ] does a lot of dif ferent things. One of the points in the  whip notice is it says 30 years for re newals. It is actually 15 years, as com bined,  as  I  understand  it, with Mr.  VENTO'S. One of  the  things with  the  gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. VENTO]  is the El Centro ranges that go out in  1994. Those are the ranges where I, as a  pilot,  Jonathan  Livingston  Seagull  trained on Inky Barley Pitty Baggage  Rakey's Litter. That is where we drop  our practice bombs, and I know that  they can request a  renewal, but then  they have to support and requisition an  environmental-impact statement, and  the Navy has to give a report of decon tamination.

1432,519,24,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, I would  just point out that this is because they  had not made a  formal request under  the Engel Act. We have no  illusions  about anything, and these are standard  procedures under the Engel Act, as is  the 15 years.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman  from California [Mr. CUNNINGHAM]  for  yielding.  ",1991
1433,519,24,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr. Chairman, 15  years is not my point. It is that they  phased out in 1994, and that this train ing is critical. This is where our young  pilots  train from  the  training squad rons, and without that we are lost. If  my colleagues want  to cut the mili tary,  they want  them well equipped,  well trained, well, there needs more in  this amendment. We also need buffer  zones around.  ",1991

Mr. Chairman, I have been assured by  the Department of Defense  that by  1994, that is adequate time for them to  get the request in for a continuation of  the use of those areas.  Let me say to my colleague, the gen tleman  from Guam  [Mr. BLAZ] who  serves  on  both  the Committee  on  Armed Services and the Committee on  Interior and Insular Affairs with me,  and also to the gentleman from Min nesota [Mr. VENTO],  chairman of the  Subcommittee on National Parks and  Public Lands, that I want to thank him  for putting the language of a bill that  I had passed by this body in 1987. Once  again DOD was here  in November  to  testify in a hearing that we had, and  the testimony was that they stated at  the  time with a modification of the  gentleman's amendment it met all of  their concerns and, therefore, they are  in favor of the amendment as drafted.  As my colleagues know, we spent a  great deal of time on Friday discussing  this amendment. My colleagues from  California, Top Gun CUNNINGHAM, and I  had  a  discussion,  but  I  think  this  amendment answers the questions that  DOD was concerned about.  ",1991

1445,519,24,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Chair man, I appreciate the gentleman from  Guam [Mr. BLAZ] yielding this time to  me.  Mr. Chairman,  the amendment pre sented by  the gentleman from Guam  and the gentleman from Minnesota is  very helpful  to some of the concerns  that we have about the military mis sion that is so critical to this country's  role in the world. The National Train ing Center for the Army and the Ma rine Corps base at Twentynine Palms  were very fundamental to the kind of  training that caused us to be so suc cessful  in our venture  in  the Middle  East. I know that the gentleman pre senting this amendment and  the De partment of Defense feel very strongly  that this amendment does not solve all  of the problems involved.  I have a letter dated November 21 of  this year to the chairman of the Com mittee on Armed Services that says:  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: We oppose the Cali fornia Desert Protection Act, 2929, and sup port the California Public Lands Wilderness  Act, R.R. 3066. Adoption of amendments to  R.R. 2929 expected to be offered by Congress man VENTO and Congressman BLAZ would ad dress defense concerns relating to military  overflight, the National Training Center and  land withdrawals, but R.R. 2929 still would  not address the following needs.  They list three critical needs which  have been previously addressed in the  RECORD.  Can we  carry  forward  the  training mission that is so vital to the  future of our national defense H.R. 2929  is in effect?  The answer to that according to the  Secretary of Defense is no.  So, Mr. Chairman, while I rise in sup port of  the amendment of  the gen tleman from Guam [Mr. BLAZ],  let us  state clearly for  the  record  that we  have not met the challenge of meeting  the  tremendous potential of this re gion. Our ability  to defend ourselves  and to move forward in our support of  freedom throughout the world, depends  on resolving these issues.  D 1730  ",1991

1448,545,24,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman for yielding time  to me, and I rise in strong support of  this rule and of the measure.  I want to join in congratulating the  gentlewoman  from  California  [Ms.  PELOSI] as well as the gentleman from  New York [Mr. SOLOMON], along with  the many others who have been work ing on this legislation for a long time  now.  I would like to join in the remarks  that  the gentleman  from New York  made about President Bush and Sec retary of State Baker with regard to  this issue. Recently I had the occasion  to hear Jim Baker explain what had  happened  in China.  I  think  some  progress is being made, but I  think and he probably would not agree with  this-that by passing  this  resolution  we will help them, not hurt them, and  get the Chinese to do the right thing.

1450,545,24,Mr. RAVENEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of the legislation, and I  want to associate myself with the re marks previously made by the gentle woman  from California  [Ms.  PELOSI]  and the gentleman from New York [Mr.  SOLOMON].  I was over there during the summer  with a group that was sponsored by the  Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong.  Quite frankly, I had never been to the  Far East, and we were just absolutely  amazed by what we encountered when  we went over  there. Senator Brown  49--059  0-96 Vol. 137 (Pt. 24) 18  headed the delegation, and there were  about a  dozen Members of Congress  who went with us.  We  found  that  the Chinese people  were well-fed and well-clothed, but if  they professed  themselves politically,  they were grabbed up off the street or  wherever they happened to be and they  were summarily thrown into jail. They  disappeared and, I imagine, in some in stances worse.  The estimates over  there are  that  there are approximately 10 million peo ple working in prisons in China., and  they manufacture  every  conceivable  thing under  the  sun. Most of  those  manufactured  items  are  shipped  to  Hong Kong. The  labels are changed,  and then they are sold throughout the  world. A great many of those prison made  items are  sold  in  the United  States.  In my State of South Carolina we are  losing approximately 5,000 textile jobs  a year, so it affects us directly.  We were denied permission to visit  the dissidents who were in prison over  there, one in particular, a young man  by the name of Wang Juntao. Every where we went, we requested permis sion to see the leaders, and finally we  got to the First Secretary of the Com munist party in China, and he said, no,  he could not make arrangements for us  to meet Wang Juntao, who was being  held under very severe conditions.  So I asked the man, I said, ""Let me  tell you something, man. You are the  head knocker here  in China.  If you  can't make arrangements  for us  to  meet Mr. Wang Juntao, who  in  the  world can?""  Well, he sloughed  that answer off,  but subsequently, through some efforts  of some good Caucasians who were over  there, we were able to meet with his  wife, Mrs. Ho. You probably read just  the other day when Mrs. Ho  tried to  meet with some of Secretary Baker's  delegation, she was arrested and held  overnight. This is a charming young  lady. She confirmed what we had been  told about the conditions under which  these young folks were held.  At one of the meetings we had with  the Chinese officials, one of them ap proached me on a  lesser level, I  feel  sure, and he said, ""What do you think  we ought to do?""  I said, ""We need a sign. We need an  expression of good will back  in  the  United States, in the Congress, before  we  vote on most-favored-nation sta tus.""  He said, ""What would you suggest?""  I  said,  ""Why don't you  let  these  young kids go? You've got less than a  hundred of them now still in jail from  the Tianamen Square situation. Why  don't you just let them go and let them  come  to  the United States? We will  take them as political refugees. They  will all continue their education at col leges and universities around our coun try, and probably in 10 or 15 years they  will all be Chinese millionaires. That is  the kind of thing you need to do as an  expression of good will.""  Of course, we  have heard nothing  from  them. They are  just as intran sigent now as they were back then. I  thought surely when Mr. Baker went to  China as a representative of the Presi dent, he would have more success than  our delegation and Ms. PELOSI'S delega tion had. But absolutely not. They  have absolutely stonewalled the situa tion.  What they cannot understand is why  we associate trade with human rights.  They just cannot understand this. We  told  them repeatedly all of this. We  said that in our country the two are in separable, and the American people do  not want  to do business with people  who treat folks like they are treating  them  So I think the legislation provided by  this rule is apropos and very much on  time. I hope that all the Members will  vote for the rule by a substantial mar gin.  ",1991

1452,545,24,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I, too, rise jn strong support of the rule  and the legislation, the conference re port  granting  most-favored-nation  trade status for China.  I would like to commend the gentle woman from California [Ms. PELOSI] for  the continuing good work she has done  on this issue, as well as the gentleman  from New York  [Mr.  SOLOMON],  the  gentleman  from  New  York  [Mr.  GREEN],  the gentleman from Washing ton [Mr. MILLER],  the gentleman from  Georgia [Mr. JONES], and many, many  others  for  the  fine work  they have  done.  I consider this bill to be a continuing  step in our efforts to make the current  leadership in communist China under stand  that  the American people will  not  forget  what  happened  at  Tiananmen Square,  that we are sin cerely dedicated to keeping hope alive  that one day freedom will be allowed to  flourish in that land. This is another  bill that would do that.  I would point out that last week sev eral of my colleagues and I introduced  another piece of legislation that will  allow those Chinese students and adult  nonstudents who are  in this country  and  were  in  this  country  when  Tiananmen Square occurred to stay in  this country permanently should they  choose to do so,  if the President has  not certified that conditions exist so  that they would be allowed to return  peacefully to China.  We all know that Secretary of State  Jim Baker recently returned to China.  He went there with high hopes, and un fortunately  those  hopes were  frus trated.  ",1991

1455,558,24,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding time  tome.  Mr. Speaker,  I have heard that the  Chinese are proud. The Asian-American  is proud. He has helped to build this  country. The  families have  stressed  education in the home, and they teach  that if you work hard, you can make it  in this country.  These are the same Asian-Americans  who have asked us  to support condi tional  renewal of MFN. We need  to  send a strong message. We support a  norm of  international behavior  that  the Chinese will not adhere to. This is  a message  that life,  liberty, and  the  pursuit of happiness is part of our new  world order.  0 2100  Yes, if they call if face, if they call it  arrogance and  they spurn  the United  States' offer, so be it. There are many  countries that want our trade.  Hal Lindsey  in  ""The Lake Great  Planet Earth"" gives us an inside look  at future China. Support conditional  renewal of MFN for a safer world, for a  better world, and thank the gentleman  from Illinois [Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI] and  the gentlewoman from California [Ms.  PELOSI] for this legislation.

1457,558,24,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in support of the conference report  on H.R. 2212, most-favored-nations sta tus for China.  Mr. Speaker,  I will not repeat all  that has been so eloquently stated by  my  colleagues  about  human  rights  abuses in China, slave labor, near genocide in Tibet and arms sales to terror ist nations.  I  do want  to add  to  the  charges  against  the  brutal Communist  dic tator15 of China one that is seldom men tioned-probably  even  little  known.  That is the cruel actions it has taken  against the Mongolian people of Inner  Mongolia.  The Mongolian people of what used  to be called Inner Mongolia, just to the  south of the Mongolian Republic have  been  deliberately  subjected  to  ex tremely cruel  treatment, and because  of the sending of thousands of ethnic  Chinese to the area, are now a minor ity in their own land.  Mr. Speaker, in August, as the Chair man of the National Republican Insti tute, I  led a delegation to the Mongo lian Republic,  the second country in  the world to become Communist,  the  first Communist country  in Asia  to  throw out a Communist government,  to see if we could be of assistance in  the move toward democracy.  While we were  there, we met dis sidents who had escaped from impris onment in Inner Mongolia and fled to  Mongolia. Their crime? To say  that  they would like to have democracy as  well.  Mr. Speaker, I want to join in com mending Ms. PELOSI, who certainly has  been the leader in this fight.  ",1991
1458,558,24,Mr. SCHULZE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in sup port of the conference report to H.R. 2212.  As I and many of my colleagues have noted  during this and last year's debate on whether  to extend most-favored-nation trading status to  China,  that country's emigration and human  rights policies clearly have worsened since the  brutal massacre at Tiananmen Square. Fur ther, China is steadily adding to its nearly $15  billion  trade surplus with  the United States  through the use of cheap prison labor.  No mystery are they, the worsening condi tions within China have been confirmed by  several organizations: Amnesty  International,  ASIA's Watch,  the Library of Congress and,  even our very own Department of State.  Given that China's emigration policy is not  in compliance with title 4 of the Trade Act of  197 4, I have argued strenuously that this Na tion  is not  legally entitled  to  the preferential  tariff rates accorded under the MFN program.  For this reason, I and some very committed  colleagues-including Messrs. SOLOMON, MAR KEY and ROSE-have led a 2-year effort to ter minate China's MFN status. In fact, in 1980, I  was  just as vehement  in my opposition  to  President Carter's recommendation that China  be granted MFN treatment in the first place.  Regrettably, over the past decade, the State  Department has argued  just as strenuously  that a policy of appeasement-as opposed to  the more heavy-handed approach preferred by  most  of us-is  the way  to  yield  positive  change  in China. This policy  failed  in  the  1980's, and  it will  continue  to  fail  in  the  1990's. Chinese  leaders neither  respect nor  respond to the carrot approach.  Indeed, they  arrogantly chew up the carrots and spit them  in the faces of those who naively offer them.  It is time to wield a stick!  I regret being in the position in which I find  myself today. Whether I vote for or against the  legislation before us, China still receives most favored-nation status-and that truly disgusts  me!  However,  I commend  the gentlelady  from  California, Ms. PELOSI,  for her tireless efforts  in bringing this conference report to the floor.  At this stage, H.R. 2212 represents the strong est message we can sent to the Chinese lead ers, and it and its author deserve our strong  support.  ",1991
1459,558,24,Mr. LANCASTER.," I speak today in full sup port of the conference report on H.R. 2212,  which would allow  the President  to  renew  MFN  for China only  if the Chinese Govern ment does three things: Releases imprisoned  pro-democracy demonstrators held  in China  and Tibet; stops selling missiles  to Syria or  Iran; and makes ""significant progress"" in  im proving human rights, stemming nuclear pro liferation, and practicing equitable trade policy.  Each of those provisions is completely de fensible  in  its own right.  In combination they  represent a package worthy of strong biparti san support.  The Chinese Government battles words with  tanks. The Chinese Government denies  its  citizens the most basic of human rights. The  Chinese Government abides by its own rules  as it contributes to nuclear proliferation while  most civilized countries work to stem such ac tivity.  The Chinese Government  enjoys  a  growing multibillion-dollar  trade surplus with  the United States as it denies entry of United  States products into its own markets. And the  Chinese Government  remains confident  that  the United States will continue to extend MFN  to China  irrespective of  its  ignoble practices  and policies.  It is time for the United States Congress to  speak with a loud and unified voice in telling  the Chinese Government they are very much  mistaken. We will not reward  their shameful  ways with preferential trade treatment. We will  instead pass  into law this conference report.  We will send the signal that we will do busi ness with China on our terms, not on  terms  dictated by  the Chinese Government-espe cially when those terms work to the disadvan tage of American interests.  The conference  report  is clear,  it makes  sense, and it is simply the right thing to do. I  urge my colleagues to support the conference  report.  ",1991

Mr. Speaker, we are tired of the new China  syndrome, where Chinese leaders promise to  change, yet China continues to supply nuclear  technology to pariah states and sophisticated  missiles  to  terrorist countries. And while  the  blood of the Tianenmen Square massacre is  still fresh, America rewarded China with a high  level visit from Secretary Baker.  I do not doubt the President's commitment  to human rights, fair trade, and restrictions on  the proliferation of nuclear and missile  tech nology. By passing this conference report with  a two-thirds majority, we will help the Presi dent press these important principles with the  ",1991
1461,571,24,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of  the resolution and  commend  the author, Mr. PENNY  as  well as Chairman F ASCELL, Congress men BROOMFIELD, HAMILTON, GILMAN,  and BEREUTER for  their leadership in  bringing this legislation to the House  floor.  Mr. Speaker, this resolution appro priately commends the President and  the U.N. for seeking to address the hu manitarian crisis in Iraq through the  relevant Security Council resolutions.  The resolution calls for the President  and the U.N.  to explore alternatives,  consistent with U.N. Resolutions 706  and 712, to bring much needed relief to  hundreds of thousands of starving and  sick people including children. But the  resolution rightly places the blame for  this tragedy squarely on the shoulders  of Saddam Hussein.  Mr. Speaker,  in  the  last year,  the  Subcommittee on Human Rights and  International Orgranizations, which I  chair, and the Europe and the Middle  gressman HAMILTON,  East Subcommittee, chaired by Con conducted  joint  hearings on the U .N. role in the gulf.  Based on  the  testimony at  these  hearings,  it is clear that Saddam is  cynically manipulating the food supply  to starve vulnerable populations cen ters while at the same time ensuring  that his political cronies and military  leaders are well fed. There are cases in  which Saddam has either blocked or di verted U.N. food shipments destined for  the suffering people of Iraq.  Saddam is starving the Iraqi people  so  as  to generate anti-Americanism  which he hopes will bolster his tenuous  political position and he is starving his  people to build a case for breaking the  strict U .N.  sanctions arrayed against  his regime.  The current sanctions permit U.N. administered humanitarian relief oper ations and the U.N. Security Council  has adopted a resolution approving the  sale of $1.6 billion of Bagdad's oil of  which the bulk of the proceeds would  be used  for humanitarian assistance  under strict U .N. supervision.  Saddam has rejected these arrange ments because it prevents him from  purchasing goods and technologies to  rebuild his warmaking capacity.  The world  community  has  justly  maintained the sanctions against Sad dam but it must be equally resolute in  not allowing Saddam  to starve hun dreds of thousands of innocent people.  This resolution calls for a more as sertive effort, under U.N. auspices, to  remedy this ongoing tragedy. Our com mitment to human rights and justice  calls for no less and I urge the adoption  of the resolution.  ",1991

Let me emphasize this money is not  going to the Soviet Union, this money  is going to United States personnel to  help dismantle weapons that threaten  the United States. These independent  countries do not want these weapons to  go back to Russia.  The Ukraine, for instance, has a cou ple of thousand nuclear missiles and  warheads  they want  to keep  in  the  Ukraine. They are asking us  to help  them dismantle those weapons and in  the end this will save us substantial  amounts of money.  Our O&M budget is $80 billion. Now,  there is nobody who protects this budg et more  than  I  do.  I  have  offered  amendment after amendment over the  years  to  increase O&M. But I  think  this is a good expenditure of mG.ney,  not to the Soviet Union but to help the  independent countries around the SoMr.  to  the gen Speaker,  viet Union to reduce the threat to this  country.  I  think it is a wise expend! ture of  funds in the long run which will allow  the President to provide technical as sistance  if he decides  that  it  is  a  threat. Listening to Director Gates and  Secretary Cheney, they believe, as I be lieve,  that there is a possibility of a  real  threat  in  the  next  couple  of  months and we need to have U.S. per sonnel helping  them dismantle  these  weapons systems to reduce the threat  to the United States.

We  want to cut defense, but you say you  want a  smaller force, well equipped,  well  trained,  just like the desert act,  where  they are  taking away some of  the training that we have now through  the environmentalists.

1470,597,24,Mr. SOLOMON.,"  I  thank  the  gen tleman for yielding this time to me.  Ladies  and  gentlemen,  I was not  going to speak on this appropriations  bill. I was going to wait until we take  up the next bill, which is  the imple mentation  legislation  for  the  CFE  Treaty. We really have the cart before  the horse here because we are debating  a supplemental appropriations bill con cerning a bill we are going to take up  in the next few minutes, which is the  authorizing bill. And as  I  read  the  amendments concerning the provision  of aid  to  the Soviet Union  that are  going to be adopted in the bill that we  will be taking up in a few minutes, the  language  says,  ''The program under  this section  shall be  limited  to co operation among  the United States,  the Soviet Union and its republics."" It  goes on  to  say  in  this amendment,  ""Such cooperation may also  involve  the funding of critical short-term re quirements related to weapons destruc tion.""  I am just having a very difficult time  trying to figure out why we are taking  money for this purpose out of the de fense budget. If we are going to use this  money for American troops and Amer ican vehicles, and those troops and ve hicles are going to cross through Po land,  Czechoslovakia,  and Hungary  [Mr.  into  the Ukraine or  into Russia or  wherever  they are going, why do we  have to take the money out of the de fense budget? There are  funds  right  now to go in there and dismantle the  nuclear weapons and bring  them out  back through Poland, Czechoslovakia,  and Hungary and into our NATO coun tries.  So I just do not understand that pro vision. We really should have debated  it, the bill itself, the authorizing bill,  before we got into this supplemental.  Lastly, without  taking  too much  time, when we had an emergency situa tion called Desert Storm, we all put  our heads together and, over a period  of time, we worked out a cumulative  fund whereby Japan and Germany and  all of the NATO countries pitched in  and helped because Desert Storm was  to their mutual benefit.  I heard my good friend, JOHN MUR THA, mention that it is in the best in terests of the United States that we  support this new provision and that we  do  it now;  it is an emergency. Any thing could happen.  Well, I think that same kind of emer gency that we had in Desert Storm and  that same kind of mutual benefit ap plies  to  this.  I  see my  friend,  PAT  SCHROEDER, sitting over there. She and  I  have worked  for years on burden  sharing, trying to get our NATO allies  to carry their fair share of the burden.  There needs to be a fair share of the  burden  in  this Soviet aid provision.  Why should we be committing $700 mil lion? I give my good friends, JOHN MUR THA and JOE MCDADE, credit for saving  us $200 million because  they reduced  the Senate's authorization down to $500  million, and that is great. But, that is  still a  lot of money we are  talking  about in this bill.  As my colleagues know, if this Soviet  aid package had been subject to regular  order and  the Committee on Foreign  Affairs had been working on it, and the  Committee  on Armed  Services  had  been working on it, and the same thing  was happening over in the Senate, we  would not be taking this up in the mid dle of the night right now.  The  gentleman  from Florida  FASCELL] came up to the Committee on  Rules a  few minutes ago,  and  said,  ""Since  receiving  this  legislation last  night, we have worked hard."" The gen tleman from Wisconsin [Mr. ASPIN] and  the gentleman from Florida [Mr. FAS CELL] have worked hard. But, as my  colleagues know, we are rushing into  this thing.  Until hearings are held, until there is  a demonstrated need, we should not be  passing this aid package tonight. The  emergency is not here tonight. We are  voting on something about which we do  not have any idea of what it is. The  phrase I just read which says that we  are going to cooperate with the Sovi ets.

1475,636,24,Mr. AUCOIN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of  the  conference  report  on H.R.  2950, the surface transportation authorization  bill.  I very much appreciate  the hard work of  Chairman BOB ROE of the Public Works Com mittee, Chairman NORM MINETA of the Surface  Transportation Subcommittee, our colleagues  on  the conference committee, and  the staff  who have worked so hard on  this historic  measure.  I am  very pleased  that  the  conference  agreement includes a provision of the House  bill  that authorizes $515 million  in section 3  transit funds  for Portland's Westside  light rail  project.  The highly successful MAX light rail °  system serves the eastern part of the  Portland region.  It carries half a million riders per  month; costs 30 percent less per pas senger to operate than buses; and has  influenced more than $1 billion in de velopment along its route.  The Westside  project will  extend  MAX from downtown into the western  suburbs, providing similar benefits to  Washington County, with the final ter minus in Hillsboro.  Westside  is Oregon's highest  trans portation priority because we want to  solve  the problems of congestion and  air pollution in Portland.  We want  to boost our economy by  creating  job-years of employ 17,000  ment. We want to protect the environ ment, save energy, and provide a sound  basis for our future growth. MAX and  other local success stories are the key  to  achieving  national  goals  for  a  healthy economy,  clean air,  energy  conservation, and an efficient transpor tation network.  I applaud the conference committee  for its foresight in accepting the House  bill's Westside  language. While many  other  provisions  of  the  conference  agreement are worthy of mention,  I  would  like  to specifically  thank  the  conferees  for authorizing a National  Scenic Byway Program. The Oregon  State Department of Transportation  has worked long and hard to develop  this program.  We have an outstanding scenic byway  candidate in the tristate Pacific Coast  route, U.S. 101. It can be a model for  the success of this program and a valu able support for our coastal areas. H.R.  2950 goes far toward meeting the chal lenges of the post-interstate era. With  $151  billion  in highway and  transit  funding,  comprehensive planning  re quirements, and many innovative pro grams, this conference agreement pro vides the basis for an integrated trans portation network that strengthens the  economy, cleans up the air, saves en ergy,  reduces gridlock, and provides  mobility for all citizens.

1477,636,24,Mr. POSHARD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of the conference  re port.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of  the Public  Works and Transportation Committee, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 2950 and encourage  my colleagues to offer their support.  This  is a highly valuable investment in the  future of our Nation. Over the 6-year period  covered by this bill, we will invest $151 billion  in highways, bridges, and mass  transit sys tems across this country.  In southern Illinois that means a study of the  feasibility of a tollway linking my area and St.  Louis. This project has tremendous local SUJT  port and is a crucial element of continuing ef forts to improve the economy of our area.  It means millions of dollars  to  improve  Route 13, the primary East-West artery which  connects communities in southern Illinois and  holds tremendous commercial promise.  It means  reconstruction of Feather Trail  Road, something essential  to  the completion  of the $800 million Olmsted Locks and Dam  project.  It  improves conditions on Route 1  in  two  rural counties  in my district, provides funding  for a bridge  in  the community of Du Quoin,  and near the community of Sauget it connects  a major highway with a developing business  park and airport.  Mr. Speaker, just from a review of the eco nomic  implications  for my district, one can  easily determine this is a bill that is good for  America. We are investing in the concrete and  steel that allow the people of this country to  work for a living. And at a time of economic  hardship, this bill pumps money into the con struction sector and creates millions of new  jobs, while providing  the economic base  for  sustained economic development in the Mure.  I thank all of  the members of the Public  Works  and Transportation Committee who  helped produce  this  final product, especially  Chairman ROE and Chairman MINETA, with  whom I have had the distinct pleasure of serv ing as a new member of the committee.  This is the kind of work people send us here  to accomplish. This is certainly one of the high  points of this or any other legislative session,  and  I look forward to the continued progress  for America made possible by  this excellent  legislation.  ",1991

We still are really  not fully satisfied.  If we add the trust fund money that  will be spent to the money that Florida  will add in and get back, we think it  reduces it. But there is an overriding  concern beyond that alone. The discre tionary money which the gentlewoman  from Ohio just talked about that Flor ida will get, which will create jobs and  the rest of that.  People  in Florida,  like everywhere  else in this country, are mobile. People  in Florida expect when they drive to  other States that there will be a better  infrastructure in those States as well.  They want the bridges and the roads  and the tunnels and the highways to be  good  in other States, as  they drive.  They have paid  their  tax dollars  in.  They want  to see other roads where  they are participants, where they are  users,  to be safe and  in satisfactory  condition, not only for their residents  but for us as well.  This will create jobs. In Florida the  unemployment rate is over 8 percent.  We need this as well.  We wm come back and try to get par ity on the formula eventually, but in  the mean while America needs  this  bill. And so does Florida.  Mr. Speaker,  the merits of this bill will be  told for years to come through the  improved  infrastructure it will provide. More importantly,  thousands of people will participate in  imple menting the provisions of the law, and that is  I  I  Mr.  I urge my colleagues' support.  ",1991

The multiplier effect of the moneys  ranging from 2 to 10 times as the dol lars bounce around will move all of our  States in a progress direction. It will  help gear us all up for the 21st century.  I strongly urge its passage.  ",1991

Mr.  Speaker,  thank the chairman for yielding time  to me, and it is a pleasure to rise at  this early hour and express my strong  support for the work of the chairman  and  the  gentleman  from California  [Chairman MINETA]  and  the  ranking  minority members.  I strongly urge my colleagues to sup port this legislation, which in my view  is one of the great highlights of this  session.  There has been a  lot of talk about  economic  growth  packages, but my  friends,  this  is  the economic growth  package that this Congress is going to  pass, $151 billion over a 6-year period  that will create 2 million jobs, accord ing to the White House 4 million jobs,  that is good news for all Americans.  In addition to that, the correction in  this  legislation  as  it affects  donor  States  is  also good news  for many  donor States who in the past have con tributed a  lot more  to  the highway  trust fund than they got back. So that  is another very  important change  in  the highway bill as far as I am con cerned.  The last point I would make, that I  think is very important, is that for the  first time we are giving the States the  flexibility  they  need  to most  effi ciently utilize the money that this leg islation will provide them.  I urge strong support for this legisla tion, and I commend all the Members  who have worked to move this legisla tion through the process.  ",1991

As Congress  rushes to complete action on unfinished legis lation before we adjourn, I remain gravely con cerned  that  the people of Florida and other  donor States are being taken for a ride by the  Transportation conference report without seri ous consideration of its consequences. Florida  has historically been badly shortchanged by  the funding formula,  leaving us to export mil lions  of dollars  in  jobs and  transportation  project to other States.  The conference report, brought to the floor  sight-unseen and  in  the middle of the night,  does nothing to improve Florida's situation and  that of other donor States. Legislators were  asked to take at face value committee assur ances that the new bill would treat our States  fairly, but in  light of Florida's past treatment,  and the fact that Florida transportation will re ceive no more than 83 cents for every $1  the  Florida  taxpayer pays  into the highway trust  fund,  I could not support the bill. These deci sions are simply too important to be railroaded  ",1991
1501,805,24,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, let me  say before I move the previous question  that it was not necessary for me to get  a report from the DA's and so forth and  so on. I have tried a number of cases in  my career as an attorney. I prosecuted  and I also defended many cases, capital  cases and all other cases.  I have followed this bill very closely.  We all know the matter of the death  penalty does not really amount to a  great deal,  because we  are  talking  about a very small part of the criminal  case  jurisdiction in  this country; al though it is  important,  it is not as  major as many of our speakers would  make it out.  Mr. Speaker, this is a strong crime  bill, and if for no other reason, I rec ommend as a trial attorney this legis lation, based on the habeas corpus pro visions alone. This is the strongest re form that we have had of habeas corpus  in modern times.  What  it  is going  to mean  to  the  American people  is  these people who  run us all up a wall and we wonder  why, what is going on in the legal sys tem, when we see people 10 years after  a  conviction has been rendered  in a  lower court before the final execution  of that conviction is brought about 10  years later.

1506,870,24,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Speaker,  myself 21/4 minutes.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to close  with a few words of friendly advice for  my fellow Texan down on Pennsylvania  Avenue. My advice is simple: Mr. Presi dent,  you don't need  another civil  rights bill fiasco right now. You don't  need to be proclaiming your belief in a  principle at one moment and then to be  shown trying to undermine that prin ciple that next moment. That only pro duces embarrassment-not just for the  President but for our system of Gov ernment.  This President has expended tremen dous energy over the past 3 years pro claiming how tough he want to be on  crime. He has a chance  to put those  words into action by working with us  here in the Congress to enact this bill.  If the President really wants a crime  bill,  instead of  just  talking  about  crime, he can pick up the phone and  ask his troops here and  in the other  body  to get with  the program. And  then, he can pick up his pen and sign  this  tough  and  comprehensive  anticrime measure.  If the President fails to do this, the  burden is on him to tell the American  people why he is against putting cops  back on  the beat, why he's against  steering youthful offenders away from  a life of crime, why he is against the  death penalty  for drug kingpins who  kill, for torturers, rapists, and terror ists who kill. The President has quite  enough to explain these days. He may  yield  I  not wish to explain why voting against  a crime-fighting bill will somehow be  in the best  interest of the American  people. I urge the Members to support  this conference report.  D 0830  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",1991
1507,870,24,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield such  time as he may consume  to the gen tleman from New York [Mr. WALSH].  ",1991
1508,870,24,Mr. WALSH.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in  opposition to this bill.  ",1991
1509,870,24,Mr. MCMILLEN of Maryland.," Mr. Sepaker,  no question exists that the rampage of crime  continues  in  this country and  that we must  seek ways in which to stem this violence. The  House Judiciary Committee has spoken wisely  on a number of  improvements  to  the U.S.  Criminal Code, and  I support  the  legislation  we consider today. However,  in our zeal  to  fight crime in the streets of America we must  not  lose sight of  the  fact  that any changes  made to the United States Code must be done  with full respect for the U.S. Constitution.  My votes on H.R. 3371, the Omnibus Crime  Control Act of 1991, have reflected my belief  in the essential integrity of the Constitution.  I  believe that its directives are unassailable and  that  this body should not  radically alter  its  direction.  I opposed the Mccollum amendment which  would expand  the exclusionary  rule  to allow  the admissibility of evidence  into a criminal  proceeding which  is obtained  illegally. The  committee  legislation  allows  certain  ""good  faith"" exceptions when evidence  is obtained  by a law enforcement officer with a warrant.  The McCollum amendment extends the admis sibility of such evidence to instances where no  warrant is involved. I find this an abridgement  of the rights of unfair search and seizure, as  guaranteed under  the  fourth amendment of  the U.S. Bill of Rights.  My votes on habeas corpus  reform  further  demonstrated  my  belief  in  fundamental  consitutional  rights. A strong case  is made  that the extreme workload which inundates our  Federal court system demands action. We  need to take steps to curb excessive and un necessary  petitions and  appeals;  however,  that does not mean we need to sacrifice the  writ of habeas corpus  for reasons of expedi ency. The committee  legislation included sig nificant  reforms without destroying  the  fun damental right for a Federal review of a State  court decision. For these reasons,  I opposed  the Hyde amendments on habeas corpus.  A particularly difficult vote  for me was  to  support  the Volkmer amendment on  semi automatic firearms. While I strongly agree with  the need to address the issue of urban crime  and spreading violence, I felt that in our efforts  to break this downward cycle of violence, we  must be careful to not inadvertently ignore the  rights of law abiding citizens who seek to own  guns for legitimate reasons.  All of my gun control votes have been con sistent in one regard; they are based on the  premise that we must make  it as difficult as  possible for criminals and the deranged to ob tain  illegal and dangerous firearms, while at  the same time being respectful of the right of  the responsible citizen to have unfettered access to a firearm. Unfortunately, the ban pro posed in the original legislation was imprecise  in its construction; it denied legitimate uses of  certain guns, and it would unfairly and nega tively impact domestic manufacturers.  If we  really want  to address  the  issue of  criminal use of semiautomatic weapons and to  limit violence, we should not try to simply ban  certain categories of  rifles, but,  rather,  look  into other alternatives as cooling-off or waiting  periods between the sale of a firearm and its  transfer. This is a way in which we need not  infringe upon  legitimate gun owners'  rights,  while achieving  the aim of controlling crime.  Previously, I have supported a waiting period  for handguns, and see potential in extending  this to other areas. The effectiveness of this  approach has been demonstrated by various  States, including my home State of Maryland.  The Congress cannot ignore the plague of  violence  rippling  through our society. Men,  women, and children of all ages and of all  races face the streets in fear of their own lives  and  property. This  legislation we  consider  today  is a positive step  to addressing  the  problem of crime in America. By giving law en forcement officers and prosecuting attorneys  more tools to catch and convict criminals, we  are taking steps toward ridding our society of  crime and returning the streets to the people.  ",1991
1510,870,24,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of  the  conference  report on H.R.  3371, the crime bill. I want to commend Chair man BROOKS  for his  leadership  in bringing  back to  the House floor a conference report  which  fundamentally  addresses  the many  complex and controversial  issues which di vided the two Houses.  I am particularly pleased that all of the reve nue measures in the Senate amendment have  been deleted  from  the conference  report.  It  has been our consistent position that, in order  to preserve  the constitutional prerogatives of  the House of Representatives,  that  revenue  measures added by the Senate to a nonrev enue bill are not acceptable.  There is one such Senate provision, how ever,  that  I believe deserves  further study.  Section 4917 of the Senate amendment would  authorize up  to $30 million of unobligated  funds to be transferred out of the Customs for feiture fund to the Department of Health and  Human Services  to be expended  for drug  treatment for individuals under criminal justice  supervision.  I strongly believe that there  is a  great need to increase funding for drug treat ment programs, and I have committed to hold ing a public hearing on this matter in the Com mittee on Ways and Means early next year to  explore the merits of funding such programs  out of the Customs forfeiture fund.  Mr. Speaker, this is an important matter and  I want to assure my colleagues that it will re ceive  the serious attention of the Committee  on Ways and Means.  ",1991
1511,870,24,Mr. KOPETSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of the conference report. Before I con tinue,  I want to commend Chairman BROOKS  for his diligent efforts and those of the Judici ary Committee staff in putting this conference  report together in such a short period of time.  I also want to  recognize  the efforts of Con gressman CHUCK SCHUMER and Congressman  DON EDWARDS for their efforts in this process.  This  is my first crime bill as a Member of  this body. I've heard a great deal of talk from  ",1991
1512,922,24,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in  strong support of the conference report  on H.R. 3768,  the banking reform bill.  As I do that, I want to compliment the  distinguished chairman of the Commit tee on Banking, Finance and Urban Af fairs who has worked so diligently, and  so hard and so long. Without his per sistent efforts we would not be here  today. He encouraged us  to work on  this bill through the day yesterday, for  almost  24  straight  hours,  until  5  o'clock this morning; and we came up  with a very good bill in my judgment.  Although  the path has been arduous,  the compromise before us encompasses  pretty much  the parameters of  the  House passed bill.  No one was completely satisfied with  the product that we came out with, but  clearly  this  is  the most  important  issue that we have before the First Ses sion of the 102nd Congress. Other im portant issues are not included: inter state banking, banking and commerce,  modification of Glass-Steagall are still  unanswered and will have to be revis ited early next year. However the bill  before us is a good compromise given  where we started from when we went  into  our  conference  yesterday with  Members of the other body.  First and foremost the bill provides  the funding to recapitalize the bank in surance fund, and again I repeat again  and again that this is not a  taxpayer  bailout. There  is no  taxpayer money  authorized in this bill. This is a  loan  which will be repaid by the banking in dustry  through  an  increase  in pre miums. This money will be used solely  to protect depositors. Not one cent will  be used to pay off any shareholders or  any directors.  Mr. Speaker, we must  recapitalize  the bank insurance fund  to show de positors  that  the government stands  behind the promise to protect their de posits. We must show  the American  people that their money is protected by  the full faith and credit of the United  States Government. It would be  irre sponsible not to provide the FDIC with  this crucial funding, as I have stated,  before we adjourn.  Besides funding, Mr. Speaker, the bill  does incorporate a number of very im portant reforms. It calls for annual ex aminations and independent audits. It  implements  a  tripwire  system  of  prompt early  intervention  to handle  troubled institutions before  they fail,  and  to minimize  taxpayer  losses. To  further minimize  the  taxpayer liabil ity, the bill limits brokered deposits to  only those banks with the highest cap ital levels.  Furthermore,  it  establishes  risk based premiums. Risk-based premiums  will  reward well-capitalized and pru dently managed  institutions. Such a  system will restore equity to the sys tem and encourage high capital levels.  Although  this  legislation  is not as  comprehensive as some would like, it  does make a number of important re forms. It is essentially the House bill  which we passed by an overwhelming  margin here last week. The capitaliza tion, again I  repeat,  is must legisla tion, and  I,  therefore, urge my col leagues to approve the conference re port on this crucial bill.  I would  just add one other caveat,  and that is that we did add to the bill  a prov1s1on which was not before the  Committee on Banking, Finance and  Urban Affairs legislation, and that has  to do with the so-called Lamp F deci sion. What it does  is it extends  the  statute of  limitations  for  securities  and fraud cases. It is regarded as very  important, and the distinguished chair man of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce has signed off on that, ac cording to the distinguished chairman  of the House Committee on Banking,  Finance and Urban Affairs,  the gen tleman from Texas [Mr. GoNZALEZ]. We  have a good package and I urge an aye  vote.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1991
1513,922,24,Mr. GONZALEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I ask  unanimous consent that I may be per mitted  to assign  the balance of  the  time to the various Members seeking  recognition.  ",1991
1514,922,24,The SPEAKER pro tempore., Is there  objection  to  the  request of the gen tleman from Texas?  There was no objection.  ,1991
1515,922,24,Mr. GONZALEZ.," Mr. Speaker, essen tially what we have, as the gentleman  from Ohio [Mr. WYLIE] stated, is what  we were under  the mandate, because  the  bill  overwhelmingly  passed  the  House,  to stick to the House version  that passed with a vote of 344 to 64, and  we did that. Essentially what we have  here is more than just what has been  referred to as a narrow bill. This is an  achievement, and I just merely want to  thank my colleagues on the Committee  on Banking, Finance, and Urban Af fairs.  [Mr.  three  D 1050  We  have walked  the  plank  times and, with this, four times.  Also,  I wanted  to compliment and  thank, express my profound gratitude  to  the  gentleman  from Ohio  WYLIE]  and  people  like  the gentle woman  from New  Jersey  [Mrs. Rou KEMA] and the members of the minor ity as well as to our conferees from the  State side who I think performed won derfully.  We settled down 24 hours ago at 9:30  and kept going until 5:00 this morning  when  the conference  rose. So  I  just  merely wanted to express my profound  gratitude. I am very proud of the Com mittee on Banking, Finance and Urban  Affairs and of our colleague and of the  House Members as a whole.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report to the  House that we have completed a successful  House-Senate conference on the banking leg islation. We have produced an excellent bill  that will move us a giant step forward  in re storing confidence  in our Nation's  financial  system.  S. 543, the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor poration Improvement Act of 1991, meets the  priority of refinancing the bank insurance fund  by providing an immediate line of credit of $30  billion at the Treasury Department. This en sures that depositors at the Nation's 12,300  banks will have protection for their funds.  ",1991
1516,935,24,Mr. WEBER.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in  opposition  to  the  rule. As has been  stated quite well  by  the  preceding  speakers,  the  issue han-ging over this  Congress is indeed the economy. And  this is the best of a bunch of poor vehi cles available to us, admittedly at the  11th hour, to do something about it.  I oppose the rule because it does not  afford us the opportunity to do some thing about the economy. Mr. Speaker,  the economy needs help now. I am not  going to talk about the details of the  proposal. Other speakers are going to  talk about that.  I would like to focus for a minute on  something  that I  think Members on  both sides of the aisle could agree on if  we could get out of this supercharged  last minute environment. Our economy  is hurting a great deal. Yesterday we  found  that consumer confidence had  dropped below the levels of the 1982 re cession. I talk to people and they say  they are puzzled by this. How can it be?  After all, unemployment is not at lev els that it was at at that time. We ac tually saw some small upturn in the  economy in the last quarter.  Why is it that consumer confidence is  going through the floor? There are a  number of other indicators we have to  look at to understand the depth of the  economic problem we face right now.  The value of residential fixed assets  has fallen 10 percent in this country in  the last 18 months, Mr. Speaker. Why  is  that  important? For  the average  middle-class American,  the  kind  of  people that my friend from North Da kota was  just talking about,  that is  their only asset. Their only asset  is  their home and  the possessions  that  are inside that home.  When they see the value of that asset  falling,  that sets off all sorts of red  lights and warning  signals  in  their  minds about their own financial secu rity.  I believe that that contributes mate rially  to  the drop  in consumer con fidence, even among people who are not  unemployed and who do not have any  great fear of being unemployed.  Housing starts are at the level of the  1920's. New business formation has fall en 5 years in a row, and that is where  the engine of growth normally comes  from in this economy.  We found out yesterday that the auto  industry for all practical purposes has  entered the double dip of this recession  that many of us have been concerned  would happen.  Mr. Speaker, all I am suggesting is,  despite the fact that it is the 11th hour,  we should act now. We should try to do  something about the economy now.  The fact that it is the 11th hour, by  the way, sort of does not state the fact  that we have been here all 11 hours. It  is not as if this issue crept up on us in  the Congress.  We could go back over all the speech es in this well, and I-minute speeches  and special orders  for  the  last year  about the lack of action on a domestic  agenda, lack of action on the economy.  We knew there was a problem. We have  been talking about a problem.  If we are now here incapable of act ing at the 11th hour, we have no one to  blame but ourselves.  Mr. Speak er,  I  further oppose  this  rule because of the issue itself, the nar row issue of the RTC. Look at the num bers. Eighty billion dollars so far has  been spent on the RTC.  D 1230  Eight hundred thirty billion dollars  so far, $830 billion more officially pro jected, of which we are going  to au thorize up to $25 billion, but the unoffi cial estimates range from $200  to $500  billion. What is that $300 billion swing  all about? It is our inability to accu rately predict  the value of the prop erties held by the RTC. We are poten tially playing with up to $300 billion  more of our taxpayers' money.  We have to spend some of that. I un derstand that. I voted for the S&L bill.  I feel it is a  responsible thing to do.  But today the responsible thing to do  is  to  take  those minimal steps nec essary to assure that at least through  tax policy we have enhanced the value  of those properties to the maximum de gree possible to minimize  the cost to  the taxpayers.  Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I am  going to vote against this bill in the  event that we fail to amend it. I do not  want to vote for it, but I want to do the  responsible  thing. But I will  tell  the  Members, beyond today I can guaran tee them if we do not do some things  like capital gains  tax  reduction and  restoration of passive  loss deductibil ity, which will enhance  the value of  those  and all  the other  real estate  properties in the country, this is one  Member that feels that he has lived up  to his obligation to help the savings  and loan pro bl em. I for one will not be  voting for one more nickel down the  RTC rathole as long as this Congress  refuses to take those steps necessary to  minimize the cost of that bailout.  Vote against  the previous question.  Vote against the rule.  ",1991
1517,935,24,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, for pur poses of debate only, I yield 2 minutes  to  the gentlewoman  from Ohio  [Ms.  KAPTUR].  ",1991
1518,935,24,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me.  I rise in support of this rule but will  vote against the final bill, whether it  has an open-ended appropriation in it  or whether or not  it specifies  such  sums as are necessary, or whether it  says $80 billion or $60 billion more. I  want to explain the reasons for that.  First of all, I think it is absolutely  wrong that, as last year, we bring up  such an important measure in the clos ing minutes of this session. I think it is  absolutely wrong, and I do not thank  the  leadership on either side of the  aisle for doing that to us and to the  American people.  All of us here understand our respon sibility  to protect  the depositors of  this country. We understand that and  we do not like being told that we do  not understand  that as part of  this  measure. But what is wrong about this  bill is that it again asks the average  taxpayers of our country to bear the  costs of the S&L bailout. They have al ready paid up to $110 billion and the  GAO estimates that overall  they will  end up paying over $371  billion. We  have to ask the important question: If  the taxpayers are going to be asked to  pay  the costs, what are  the benefits  that can go to the average taxpayer.  I have  four proposals. All we are  being asked to vote on here is the Bush  bond  bailout  scheme. Basically  the  committees here gave to us the Bush  proposal to vote on, which I do not sup port at all.  Alternative financing proposals have  been offered. One involves the measure  by  the  gentleman  from  Louisiana,  BILLY TAUZIN, that would give tax ex emptions  to average depositors who  put money into federally insured insti tutions, and it says to them if they put  in up to $500  they do not have to pay  Federal taxes on that. Revenue costs of  that are about $1.2 billion, but it would  help to promote savings inflows in in stitutions.  Mr. Speaker,  I will give  the other  three proposals during  a  succeeding  time.  All of those who serve here under stand our obligation to protect the de posits of the American consumer in our  Nation's saving and loans and banking  institutions,  but  the  question  of  a  Member like myself is: At whose ex pense? Who should be paying to protect  those deposits?  Mr.  Speaker,  essentially what has  been happening is the administration's  bill asks the taxpayers, the people lis tening, again to shoulder a S&L bail out. The U.S.  taxpayer has already  buoyed up failing S&L's to the tune of  $110 billion. Our tax dollars are going  to pay for the damage just in that in dustry, and economists estimate that  taxpayers will be asked to add as much  as $115 billion, not million, billion dol lars more to that total, and then the  General Accounting Office tells us that  the overall cost of the bailout may rise  just for the savings and loans as high  as $371 billion before it is all over.  The pit truly seems bottomless. The  focus should be on how to pay for the  damage in this S&L debacle and do so  on behalf of the American taxpayer.  The Bush bill is appallingly deficient  on balancing taxpayer costs, the taxes  the  taxpayer  is being asked  to pay,  with the benefits that go directly to  the taxpayer. In essence what has been  happening here in Washington is that  the Bush administration and the bank",1991
1519,974,24,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker, the  economy continues  to sag under  the  heavy burden of an unguided economic  policy and a $4 trillion national debt,  S3 trillion of which was incurred during  the past decade.  During  the same 10 years, 1980  to  1990,  the Department of Commerce re ported  that  the United States paid  about $1.2 trillion to import foreign en ergy.  Mr. Speaker, it is no wonder that the  economy  is sick and needs a  trans fusion. A majority of understandably  alarmed Republicans have written the  they  President to warn that the Nation is  enduring ""a stagnant economy and an  uncertain future.""  Do we want economic growth?  Early next year, we have the oppor tunity to pump new life into the econ omy by passing a national energy pol icy.  It should be a policy aimed at signifi cantly reducing  this Nation's depend ence on foreign oil and stopping  the  flow  of billions-upon-billions  of our  dollars into  the coffers of foreign oil  producers. In other words, we should  adopt a policy which keeps this money  at home.  I can think of no greater single eco nomic stimulus than paying ourselves  for our fuel.  In Sunday's Washington Post, Edwin  Rothschild spelled out the benefits of a  $5-per-barrell  reduction  in oil prices.  The benefits were great.  The reduction would:  Have the effect of an immediate $300  billion tax cut.  It would increase the GNP by 1.4 percent.  It would reduce inflation.  It would increase disposable income.  It would reduce both the trade deficit  and the budget deficit by stimulating  economy activity.  Not bad for five bucks a barrel.  But, what oil producers give,  can take away.  The benefits to our Nation of the oil  price  reduction,  in other words, will  last only as long as certain foreign oil  producers decide they will last.  It doesn't have to be this way.  We have  the means  to make  these  benefits permanent by changing direc tions in energy, by moving to depend  more on our own natural resources and  less on imported oil.  Yes, we have the means. But, we lack  the will.  Admittedly, it is easier to continue  to depend on foreign oil, at least until  it runs out.  It is less work, less trouble, less men tally  taxing  to continue business as  usual. It is also less patriotic.  We cannot afford business as usual.  I  believe  that  the  figures  in Mr.  Rothschild's article show clearly  the  folly of sticking our heads in the sand.  Those figures also show the benefits  of rolling up our sleeves and going to  work on this problem.  By increasing the use of farm-grown  ethanol, for example, we can greatly  improve the agricultural economy.  And, that will improve the economies  of our Nation's rural areas which will,  in  turn, have a  ripple effect  in  the  cities.  It  is also  important  to  remember  that American farmers will be more re liable  fuel  suppliers  than  foreign oil  producers.  One of the problems in crafting a new  agenda in energy, Mr. Speaker, is that  we are a Nation of forgetters-at least  when the gas tank is full.  We forget the oil embargoes.  We forget the huge price hikes.  We forget the tanker reflagging.  We forget going to war to protect our  oil supplies.  We  forget  that  our Nation,  that  America is being held hostage-to for eign oil.  But, our faulty memory  is costing  us-and costing us dearly in both lives  and treasure.  It is cowardly  to continue on  this  path because that will leave the solu tion of this problem to our children.  I believe it is up to us.  Mr. Speaker, a new national energy  policy must have as its goal the break ing of our addiction to foreign crude.  And, the economic benefits from our  efforts will be permanent, not a  tem porary gift bestowed by oil barons.  Yes, our economy needs help. And,  we can give it a big shot in the arm by  formulating a new energy policy which  will make us more self-reliant.  I can think of no more lasting legacy  this Congress could leave than an inno vative energy policy which will make  America and her people more free and  more independent than they are today.  Again, it is important to remember  that the economic benefits of a $5-a barrel drop in oil prices will not be re alized unless leaders in Saudi Arabia  and Kuwait decree it.  Our Revolution was fought because  we were being dictated to by a foreign  power. The situation in energy today is  no different.  America is being dictated to by those  who supply her oil. Much of our eco nomic, military, and foreign policy is  established with oil in mind.  I do not want my country to be de pendent on  the decisions of  foreign  leaders.  We should be more independent.  We can be more independent.  Unless we resist the future and forget  the past.  [From the Washington Post, Nov. 24, 1991)  AN OIL CARD UP HIS SLEEVE  (By Edwin S. Rothschild)  As President Bush watches  the economy  falter and public support for his domestic  leadership erode, he may be considering the  one option that can stimulate the economy  and deliver his margin of victory next No vember: getting oil prices down. A reduction  in world oil prices of $5 per barrel in 1992  would have the lubricating effect of an im mediate $300-billion  tax cut. This option  would, of course, require the assistance of  Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, the emir of Ku wait and other Persian Gulf producers, but  all of these have been obliging in the past to  White House entreaties and are in a good po sition to oblige Bush now.  It is well known that lower oil prices have  an immediate, stimulative economic impact.  On an annual basis, a $5 per barrel drop in oil  prices would increase U.S. GNP by about 1.4  percent, reduce inflation and increase dispos able income. Lower oil prices would directly  reduce the huge U.S.  trade deficit and the  economic activity stimulated would also re duce the budget deficit because of higher tax  ",1991

1522,987,24,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I  am pleased to support the conference  report on R.R. 3595, the Medicaid Mora torium Amendments of 1991.  The  conference  agreement  would  allow States to continue to receive es sential matching payments for Medic aid costs funded with revenues  from  provider-specific  taxes.  It would also  regarding  protect  the current policy  intergovernmental transfers.  On September 12,  1991,  the Health  Care Financing Administration pub lished  interim  final  regulations  that  would have severely restricted Federal  matching payments to States.  This regulation would have created  financial chaos for many State Medic aid Programs. It is clearly contrary to  the letter and spirit of the Medicaid  provisions of the 1990 Budget Reconcili ation Act.  If implemented, the regulation would  have been devastating for the Medicaid  beneficiaries and heal th care providers  in many States. In my own State of Il linois, many hospitals would not have  been able to survive.  Because  the regulation would have  taken effect in the middle of the 1992  fiscal year for most States, State gov ernments would have had no choice but  to cut payments for disproportionate  share providers,  eliminate  important  benefits, or restrict eligibility.  The State of Illinois acted respon sibly in relying on Federal law when it  enacted  the provider assessment pro gram, and the State, its hospitals, and  its economy should not be thrown into  disarray because of unwarranted and  arbitrary Federal agency decisions.  Under this conference agreement, the  current level of provider-specific taxes  in Illinois would be allowed  through  1995. Intergovernmental transfers may  not be affected.  In addition, under  the compromise  payments  to  disproportionate  share  hospitals would be permanently  lim ited to 12 percent. These hospitals pro vide health care services to our most  vulnerable fellow citizens. While I un derstand that this cap is not a problem  for hospitals in Illinois, I have serious  reservations about any limit on pay ments for disproportionate share hos pitals.  Until every American has health in surance, I would be concerned about a  policy  that may reduce payments  to  hospitals that provide critical health  care services in Chicago and in other  American cities.  This  conference  agreement  rep resents a good compromise. Although I  would  have  liked  the Secretary  to  withdraw the regulations altogether, I  support  the  provisions  of  the  con ference agreement.  I urge my colleagues to support this  important conference report.

1539,1026,24,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, when  the  forces of democracy  in Nicaragua won  their  resounding electoral victory  in February of  1990, it seemed that that war-tom nation was  moving away  from civil  strife and conflict.  There was hope that the vicious cycle of war  and killing had finally come to an end. As a  member of the Carter Center election observer  team for the Nicaraguan election, this Member  can  testify  to  the widespread hope  for a  peaceful future that was evident at the time.  It is becoming clear that their hope has not  yet been achieved. The Sandinistas, who were  repudiated at the polls, are seeking to thwart  the will of the people through force of arms.  Egged on by Daniel Ortega, gun-toting Sandi nista thugs have brazenly assassinated legiti mate labor leaders, and continue to threaten  any who oppose  them.  Intimidation and vio lence have once again become the norm in  Nicaragua.  Mr. Speaker,  this body cannot continue to  tum a blind eye to the completely intolerable  behavior of Daniel Ortega and his Sandinista  goon squads. The Sandinista behavior must  be condemned  loudly,  for  it poses a  fun damental threat to the domestic tranquility of  Nicaragua.  Mr. Speaker, this Member would point to an  insightful article by William C. Doherty in the  November 22, 1991 edition of the Wall Street  Journal. Mr. Doherty, the Executive Director of  the AFL-CIO's American  Institute  for Free  Labor Development and an experienced and  astute observer of the Latin American scene,  correctly demands  that  the Nicaraguan gov ernment must take a firm stand against this  lawless behavior. According to Mr. Doherty, ""If  the Nicaraguan Government refuses to take a  stand, and fails to mobilize against the new pi nata, how much longer can its friends abroad  continue to give it support and sympathy?""  This Member commends this  insightful but  troubling article to his colleagues.  [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 22, 1991)  NICARAGUA'S SECOND PINATA  (By William C. Doherty)  In the early-morning darkness on Friday,  Nov. 1, 240 sugar workers advanced on the  barricaded gates of  the German Pomares  Sugar Mill  near Chinandega, Nicaragua.  Armed only with megaphones, their purpose  was simple: They wanted to go to work.  Blocking their way was a small group of  heavily armed Sandinista ""trade unionists.""  The Sandinistas are demanding 100% owner ship of the mill. They had forcibly  taken  over the government-owned enterprise in Oc tober and sacked the modest office of the  independent Confederation of Trade Union  Unity, or CUS. Along with another independ ent union, CUS represents the vast majority  of the 2,300 factory workers at the mill and  the cane cutters.  A number of CUS workers made it over the  fence. One who did was Obdullo Herrera, who  CUS members allege was immediately shot  by Francisco Somoza, the general secretary  of the Sandinista ""trade union."" As Mr. Her rera lay bleeding on the ground, CUS memEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  bers  say  that another Sandinista  leader,  David Echeverri,  stabbed him  four  times  with a bayonet, nearly severing his head. In  a kind of posthumous ""necklacing,"" Mr. Her rera's body was placed on a burning tire and  left on display for five hours.  Other CUS members were  beaten  and  wounded in the bloody fracas. But when the  police finally arrived at 9 a.m. they did not  arrest the murderers. Instead, they arrested  the organizers of  the peaceful demonstra tion. The police, like the military, are still  controlled by  the Sandinistas nearly  two  years  after  the Nicaraguan people  voted  them out of office. The regional military  commander, called a meeting at 2 p.m. to de nounce the independent workers for causing  the confrontation.  Subsequently,  on  orders  from  Carlos  Hurtado,  the minister of government,  two  Sandinistas were temporarily detained, but  not the one who CUS members claim wielded  the bayonet. CUS will seek prosecution of  the killers, but the judicial system is also  largely controlled by the Sandinistas.  The incident at German Pomares is one of  many such Sandinista assaults on the integ rity of Nicaragua. Following their defeat in  the February 1990 election,  the Sandinista  commanders carried out the biggest, most  rapid ""privatization"" in Nicaragua's history.  State-owned enterprises, government vehi cles, equipment, buildings and homes were  grabbed by Sandinista leaders for their own  use. Former President Daniel Ortega ""pur chased""  a mansion owned by a Mexican  woman  for a  tiny  fraction of its market  value. This wholesale  looting came  to be  known as the pinata, named after the Mexi can papiermache figures stuffed with candy  and hung up at Christmastime as targets for  blindfolded children wielding sticks. In this  case,  the Sandinistas were not blindfolded,  and they wielded guns.  Officials  of Sandinista-controlled  trade  unions supported this plunder in the name of  ""defending the gains of the revolution."" Yet  many  lower-ranking Sandinistas were  ap palled at the unfairness of this. Now  they  have embarked on a second pinata of their  own. Squads of Sandinista militants are forc ibly acquiring the country's remaining as sets. The large lgosa meatpacking plant in  Rivas was taken over in September, along  with  the Amerrisque  slaughterhouse  in  Juigalpa. Workers have been locked out of  several sugar mills, and holdover Sandinista  managers repress independent union organi zations  in  the  time-honored  tradition of  former dictator Anastasio Somoza.  Looming over this growing chaos are the  two faces of Daniel Ortega. Three weeks ago  he toured the country as agent provocateur,  trying to unify Sandinista ranks by egging  on  the  thugs  in  their armed pinata. This  week he called for a ""peaceful solution"" to  his own provocation, and, putting on his  statesman's hat, negotiated yet another set tlement with the government that rewards  the Sandinista unions for  their murderous  rampage by giving them ownership of more  of Nicaragua's dwindling assets. Meanwhile,  the independent unions, which have called  for genuine worker participation in owner ship, are cut out of the process altogether.  Nicaraguan workers are fed up. Sometimes  described incorrectly as ""pro-government,""  CUS and other independent unions in an um brella group called the Permanent Congress  of Workers (CPT) are outraged by govern ment inaction. On Nov. 13  the CPT stated,  ""We deplore and condemn the passivity of  the highest authorities, civilian and mili tary, who have shown tolerance and complicNovember 26, 1991  ity with the crimes and terror of the Sandi nistas."" CUS leader Jose Espinoza, attending  the AF~CIO convention in Detroit, warned  that if the authorities fail to respect the Nic araguan Constitution and evict the Sandi nista goon squads, ""Nicaragua runs the risk  of becoming another Lebanon.""  Those of us who have admired and helped  these courageous workers throughout their  years of struggle against Anastasio Somoza  and the Sandinistas are beginning to wonder:  Where is the moral courage and strength of  their government  leaders, elected with so  much hope by  these same workers nearly  two years ago? If the Nicaraguan govern ment refuses to take a stand, and fails to  mobilize against the new pinata, how much  longer can  its  friends abroad continue  to  give it support and sympathy?

It is my pleasure to recognize  the anniversary of organized ecumenical and  interfaith work in Lincoln, NE, during the Lin coln Interfaith Council's 40th anniversary year.  I commend  to my colleagues  the  following  commendation on this worthy organization:  COMMENDING THE LINCOLN INTERFAITH COUN CIL UPON THE OCCASION OF ITS 4&rH ANNI VERSARY  1992 is a year of anniversaries and observ ances.

1541,1039,24,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, while much atten tion is presently focused on ethnic upheavals  in the Balkans, age-old friction between Greek  and Turkish inhabitants of western Thrace per sists largely unnoticed. And while tensions be tween these 2 communities infrequently erupt  In violence and into the headlines, the prob lems confronting  the approximately 100,000  ethnic Turks in Greece, and the Greek Gov ernment's response, strike at the heart of mi nority rights issues and should be addressed.  Mr. Speaker, difficulties  in  resolving prob lems  confronting  the  Turkish minority  are  compounded by the rocky historical  relation ship between Greece and Turkey. The rights  of both Turks in Greece and Greeks in Turkey  are protected by terms of the 1923 Treaty of  Lausanne; however, both communities often  claim these rights are violated. Other conten tious issues, such as Cyprus and Aegean min eral rights, sustain high levels of tension be tween  the  two nations and ethnic groups,  making  it more difficult to constructively ad dress minority rights issues.  Human rights organizations and the staff of  the Commission on Security and Cooperation  in Europe, of which I am chairman, have iden tified a number of problem areas confronting  the Turkish minority in western Thrace. Until  recently,  the Greek Government  refused  to  even  recognize  the distinct Turkish minority,  referring  to them instead as Greek Muslims.  This practice is reminiscent of another country,  Bulgaria, which until  the  last days of Com munist rule, refused to recognize its own TurkEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ish minority, referring to them as Slavs forcibly  converted to Islam.  A major source of discord concerns the air  pointment  of Turkish  religious  leaders  by  Greek officials. When Turks attempted to elect  and install their own Mufti, the Greek Govern ment refused  to  recognize his authority and  appointed a  replacement over objections of  the Turkish community. Other problems  in volve a shortage of adequate educational fa cilities  for Turkish students and difficulties in  obtaining Turkish  language textbooks. Greek  language  requirements  for minority students  have also led to sharp declines in secondary  school enrollment of Turkish children. Certain  administrative . regulations have made  it dif ficult,  if not impossible, for Turks to buy land  and property, obtain commercial licenses and  loans,  repair or build mosques and schools,  and obtain employment in state sectors. Mem bers of the Turkish minority also complain that  television signals from Turkey are jammed and  that newspapers and  literature  from Turkey  are often seized. On several occasions, edi tors of Turkish papers in Greece have been  taken to court for printing articles critical of the  Greek Government or its policies toward the  Turkish minority. Numerous reports of police  harassment and mistreatment have also been  voiced by members of the Turkish community.  Two Turkish members of  the Greek Par liament and leading advocates of Turkish mi nority  rights,  including Dr. Sadik Ahmet who  met with the Commission last June, have also  faced harassment, detention, and have had  their Parliamentary  immunity  challenged  in  court.  In 1990, while seeking election to Par liament, they were arrested, charged, and later  convicted for openly or indirectly inciting citi zens  to violence or creating  rifts among  the  population at  the expense of social peace.  They spent 64 days  in  jail  for making  ref erence to Turkish minority rights in campaign  literature. While Dr. Ahmet and another Turk ish minority member still remain in Parliament,  the  latest Greek electoral  law mandates that  independent candidates receive 3 percent of  the nationwide vote. Turkish candidates  run ning  independently of major Greek political  parties will almost certainly fail to be elected in  the future as the population of Muslim voters  is well below the 3-percent threshold.  Mr. Speaker, while serious problems facing  the Turkish minority  in Greece  remain,  the  Commission  is encouraged by significant im provements  in  the situation. Last May, while  on a  tour of western Thrace, Greek Prime  Minister Mitsotakis made a number of promis ing remarks which seem to have heralded a  new attitude on the part of the Government to wards Turks in Greece. Since then, a number  of positive developments have occurred. Turks  in western Thrace are now able to purchase  land and property and can more easily obtain  commercial and driving  licenses. Police har assment has  reportedly diminished and new  Turkish textbooks, teachers, and education fa cilities are expected to be in place shortly.  In  addition, reports  indicate that no Turks have  been deprived of their Greek citizenship  for  months.  Mr. Speaker, ethnic relations throughout the  Balkans  have  for centuries been  far  from  smooth. I believe it is vitally important that the  Congress do all  that  is possible during  this  35907  pivotal period  in history  to promote minority  rights throughout the Balkans, and indeed the  world. Greece and Turkey, two close and re spected allies of the United States, warrant  the attention of Congress and the American  people and our good offices should be offered  to help address the myriad of problems which  strain relations between the nations. Preserva tion of ethnic heritage,  respect  for human  rights and  fundamental  freedoms, and elimi nation of discrimination are universal goals  which  cannot be achived  separately. And,  while historical and cultural distinctions often  make these goals elusive,  it is the duty and  obligation of nations to strive to achieve these  ideals.  DEEP CUTS IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS  HON. JAMFS A. McDERMOTI  OF WASHINGTON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 26, 1991  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, even as  Congress concludes its legislative business for  1991, attention  is  turning  toward  the  larger  budget decisions  that will confront Members  when we return in the new year. One crucial  question  is how much we can and should  spend for defense in a post-cold war era, es pecially when we have so many unmet needs  here at home.  Representative CONNIE MORELLA,  chair of  the Arms Control and Foreign Policy Caucus,  has written a  timely op-ed  that goes  to  the  heart of this issue, pointing out that deep cuts  in our nuclear arsenals could produce major  savings and enhance our security in the proc ess. As secretary-treasurer of the caucus,  I  commend Congresswoman MORELLA  for  this  article, which draws on studies by the National  Academy of Sciences arid the Congressional  Budget Office to make the case for major nu clear weapon reductions.  I look forward to working toward legislation  to make these deep cuts a reality, beginning  in the next session, and thank Representative  MORELLA for her article, which I would like to  enter into the RECORD at this point.  WHY DEEP CUTS IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS MAKE  SENSE  (By Constance A. Morella)  President Bush's recent decision to store  or destroy nearly 20 percent of the United  States' 20,000 nuclear warheads,  including  most of our  tactical nuclear weapons de ployed worldwide, signaled a welcome shift  in U.S. arms-control policy that should spur  further debate and reevaluation of U.S. nu clear-deterrence strategy. Now,  two institu tions acclaimed for their objectivity have is sued reports arguing that much deeper cuts  would actually enhance our security further,  as well as producing major savings.  One of these reports was issued by the Na tional Academy of Sciences, which advises  the government on scientific and technical  issues. Starting from a baseline of 8,000 to  10,000 strategic warheads held by each super power under  the ST ART  treaty signed  in  July, the academy recommends that the su perpowers reduce their arsenals to 3,000  to  4,000 warheads each in post-ST ART negotia tions, and ultimately to 1,000 to 2,000 apiece.

1542,1052,24,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, many  people  from  all walks  of  life  have  been  brought together in a mission to establish the  National Marrow Donor Program  to give  the  living gift of life and hope to hundreds of fami lies throughout our Nation and the world. They  are all heroes  in their own special way and  from time to time I have shared with my col leagues their story.  Today I want to introduce you to Dr. John  Hansen, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Cen ter in Seattle, who has distinguished himself  as being one of the world's foremost marrow  transplanters. He was a major driving  force  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  behind the establishment of the National Mar row Donor Registry and through his work on  its board of directors, continues to play a lead ing role in its dramatic growth.  Next Friday, December 6, he will be award ed  the program's highest honor when  the  board presents him with  the Laura Graves  Award for distinguished service to the national  registry and to advancing the field of unrelated  marrow transplantation. As the recipient of the  first Laura Graves Award earlier  this year,  I  know what a special honor it is to be recog nized by the friends and colleagues who are  the heroes who dedicated themselves to the  establishment of the national registry.  Dr. Hansen has touched so many lives and  brought hope  to so many  families, but  the  Laura Graves Award will have a very deep  and special meaning  for him. Laura Graves  was a patient of Dr. Hansen in 1979 when she  became the first leukemic to receive an unre lated marrow transplant. Although Laura died  of leukemic relapse, she was one of the pri mary moving  forces  that began the drive for  the establishment of the national registry.  It has been a special honor for me to have  the opportunity to work with Dr. Hansen and to  have benefited from his special expertise and  prominence in the  field of marrow transplan tation. He has been an invaluable teacher to  me as I have acquired a deeper understand ing of the intricacies of this procedure which is  a modern medical miracle.  The  presentation  of  the  Laura Graves  Award will take place in Denver at the annual  meeting of  the American Society of Hema tology. It is a most appropriate forum because  it will allow Dr. Hansen to be recognized and  honored before his peers, who hold him in the  highest regard. Dr. Robert Graves, the former  chairman and now vice chairman of the Na tional Marrow Donor Program and one of the  greatest heroes of the program, will present  the award which  is named in memory of his  daughter. Doctors Graves and Hansen have a  very special and warm  relationship that has  bonded  them  together in  their work  to save  lives.  'Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that in receiving  the Laura Graves Award, Dr. Hansen and his  wife Mary Ann will take great strength in re membering the courage of Laura Graves who  was the first in what has become a long line  of heroes who have brought hope to families  throughout the world. May her memory serve  them well both now and in their future long life  together. For Dr. Hansen, it is a life devoted  to giving life to others.  A SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO ROBERT  E.HUGHES  HON.

Hughes, chairman of the Cuyahoga County  Republican Party for a record 23 years, was  taken by ambulance  to Meridia. Hillcrest  Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at  1:20 p.m. He was 63.  Cuyahoga County Coroner Eliza.beth K.  Balraj said a cause of death had not yet been  determined. Balraj said the coroner's office  investigates all unexpected deaths.  Hughes' body was found by his son, David,  who stopped by his father's house about 12:30  p.m. yesterday. Lyndhurst Police Chief Sher wood Eldredge said police were investigating  Hughes' death, but ""it doesn't appear there  was any foul play or anything strange.""  ""There was nothing to indicate anything  out of the ordinary,  to indicate suicide or  foul play,"" Eldredge said.  Eldredge  said Hughes' car was  running  when his son found the body. The police chief  didn't know if the garage door was open or  closed, but David Hughes said  in a brief  interview yesterday  that  the garage door  was closed and his father was on the floor.  David Hughes also said the car's hood was  up. Eldredge  said Hughes may have been  working on his car.  ""I really don't know,"" David Hughes said  when asked what his father was doing in the  garage. Hughes' wife, Marguerite, was not at  home when her son arrived.  The  quick-witted,  outspoken  Hughes  served as chairman of the Cuyahoga County  GOP from 1968 until early this year, when he  quit to form a consulting firm, Robert E.  Hughes & Associates Inc.  Joseph Rice, executive vice president of  the new firm, said Hughes was in good spirits  when  the  two  talked Tuesday  and  that  Hughes had been in good health.  ""The firm was doing very well,"" Rice said.  Hughes was a registered lobbyist in Colum bus, where records show his clients included  Bear Stearns Cos., Carat Co., the Cleveland  law firm of Armstrong Gordon Mitchell &  Damiani, Excel Management Systems, and  Beachwood Dr. David Grischkan.  Rice said he expected the firm, which em ployed five people including Hughes, to stay  in business.  Tributes were quick  to arrive yesterday  from a broad spectrum of political leaders  who were  influenced by Hughes during his  three decades in politics.  A White House spokesman said yesterday:  ""We deeply regret that Bob Hughes passed  away. He was a pivotal leader in Ohio Repub lican politics. We will miss his guidance.""  Gov. George V.  Voinovich  said:  ""Bob  Hughes truly became a  legendary political  leader in his own  time. He was highly re sponsible for getting me involved in politics  and government. Bob will be remembered for  his wit, personal charm, media savvy, street  smarts and uncanny sense of political tim ing.""  ",1991

A constituent, Fred Scheer, who  is a  brewmeister at Frankenmuth Brewery,  has  been named president of the North American  section of Domens-T echnikum.  I am  very  pleased  that a corner of  the global market place for brewing technique  is now in Michi gan. American brewery companies will receive  the advice and benefit of Fred Scheer's exper tise as they tap Domens-Technikum.  The Domens-Technikum is the largest uni versity in the world that trains people in the art  of brewing. The university also teaches the art  of making soft drinks and providing food serv ices. It teaches all phases of the beverage in dustry,  including quality  control, marketing,  personnel management, and public relations.  The Michigan comer of the competitive bev erage marketplace resides  in Frankenmuth.  I  am proud to say this because American bev erage companies will now send  their staff  under  the  tutelage of Fred Scheer. He will  then recommend their continuing on to Munich  to  the Domens-Technikum campus  for a full  brewmeister education.  Please join me in saluting the expertise and  good will of Fred Scheer as he adds another  hat as head of the new North American divi sion of Domens-Technikum.  THE POSTREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH  CARE ACT OF 1991  HON. MARILYN llOYD  OF TENNESSEE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 26, 1991  ",1991
1545,1065,24,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Speaker,  I am pleased  today to introduce the Postreproductive Health  Care Act of 1991. My legislation will direct the  Secretary  of Health  and Human Services  [HHS] to provide grants to health clinics serv ing women  to develop programs  to better  serve midlife and older women. Currently,  health care provided at these clinics is mainly  directed to younger women during their repro ductive years, offering important services such  as family planning and prenatal health care.  These clinics often serve as some women's  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  only contact with the health care system and  can act as important referral sources for treat ment for other conditions.  Unfortunately, as women approach meno pause and their need for reproductive-related  services ends,  it is often the case that their  contact with  the health  care  system  also  ceases. Yet women's health needs do not end  at menopause; they can actually increase. My  legislation would enable clinics to offer serv ices and train health professionals on midlife  health  issues such as menopause, hormone  replacement  therapy,  second  opinion  on  hysterectomy, cancer screening and preven tive health strategies applicable to midlife and  older women. These issues are also critical to  younger women who experience premature  menopause due to surgery.  One unique and valuable aspect of these  clinics  is that health counseling plays a fun damental  role  in  their health care delivery  model. This  is especially worthwhile  to  the  woman at menopause.  Information and edu cation are urgently needed because women  over age 50 are at increased risk of heart dis ease, breast cancer, and osteoporosis. This  makes regular cancer screening and  improv ing poor health habits essential, especially for  women  living in poverty. While breast cancer  risk increases with age, in 1987, only 22 per cent of low-income women over age 40 had  ever had a clinical breast exam and mammo gram. Older,  low-income women  are  also  more  likely  to be diagnosed with  late stage  cervical cancer, but have the poorest record  for receiving pap smears. Education and out reach are needed to reach these women.  Information on  the menopause experience  itself  is  vital  for women.  Although  every  woman,  if she lives long enough, will experi ence menopause,  it continues  to  remain a  taboo subject of conversation. Unfortunately,  jokes and colorful lore about women at meno pause have managed to make their way into  mainstream America, fueling not only harmful  stereotypes and prejudice about middle-aged  women, but also a great deal of misinforma tion. My legislation would offer women access  to accurate  information and health services  specifically related to menopause.  Additionally, education and training of health  professionals on midlife health  issues would  be provided. Outreach measures to this cur rently underserved population of women would  also be a priority.  The Postreproductive Health Care Act is not  intended to be a panacea for women's health  care. Rather,  it will enable clinics currently  serving  low-income women the ability to pro vide  continuity  of  services  through meno pause. I urge my colleagues to lend their sup port and cosponsor this urgently needed, com mon sense approach to preventive health care  for women.  HORROR IN EAST TIMOR  HON. TOM LANfOS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 26, 1991  ",1991
1546,1065,24,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, No vember 12, Indonesian security forces rained  35933  death upon unarmed mourners during a me morial service and funeral procession in East  Timor-a small  territory that has been occu pied by  Indonesia since 1975. As many as  100 mourners,  including children and the el derly, were massacred as  they  filed  into a  graveyard to lay flowers on the tomb of a 28year-old man killed by Indonesian soldiers.  As  the  innocent mourners were  being  mowed down,  Indonesian soldiers also se verely beat several journalist, resulting in seri ous  injuries to  two American  journalists and  the death of a New Zealand national. Follow ing  the murderous  incident,  Indonesian offi cials are reported to have arrested up to 300  witnesses;  dozens are believed  to  remain  under detention.  ,  Western observers report that the violence  was  entirely  unprovoked. By  chance,  the  events of November 12 were captured on  video by a CBS news team. The images are  shocking. The shooting continued  for almost  1 O minutes as the mourners rushed  into the  walled graveyard seeking refuge from the fire.  Many were shot point-blank as they cowered  behind tombstones.  Today Congressman JOHN PROTEA and  I  cochaired  a meeting of  the  congressional  human rights caucus to investigate that ruth less display of force by  the  Indonesian mili tary. The  facts show  that  incident was not   anomalous.  Indonesia has consistently and  systematically violated the human rights of the  East Timorese. The  filmed massacre was  merely concrete evidence of  the prolonged  and  institutionalized aggression against  the  people of East Timor.  For some time, human rights organizations  around the world have reported on the pattern  of abuse in East Timor. Arbitrary arrests, tor ture  and  mistreatment  under  detention,  extrajudicial killings, and denial of  the  fun damental  right of expression are extremely  widespread. Since occupation,  tens of thou sands of East Tirnorese have perished as a  direct result of extrajudicial killings, famine and  disease.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Right  Reverend Paul Moore, Jr.,  for his excellent  statement before  the  congressional  human  rights caucus  regarding  the  tragedy  in East  Timor.  I would also like to thank Amy Good man of Pacifica Radio News and Allan Nairn  of the New Yorker magazine. As eyewitnesses  to the massacre who were themselves beaten  by  those responsible  for  the slaughter,  they  provided  the caucus with extremely moving  and lucid testimony.  In the footage shot by the CBS news team,  an East Timorese man, shot in the stomach,  covered in his own blood, says to the camera,  ""Show this to the world."" Minutes later he was  dead.  Mr. Speaker, the world saw. Now let us act.  Unfortunately, the administration's response to  this  outrageous  example  of human  rights  abuse has been appalling and  I cannot ex press strongly enough my profound dismay  with  the State Department's decision not to  send a representative to today's congressional  human rights meeting.  While I am extremely disappointed with the  administration's response,  I cannot say that I  am surprised.  It reflects,  I think, the adminis tration's sad record of failing to respond force fully to human rights abuses around the world.  ",1991
1547,1104,24,Mr. SCHULZE.," Mr. Speaker, I am appalled  to learn that the people of Puerto Rico will go  to the polls on December 8 and be forced to  cast a vote affecting the United States-Puerto  Rico relationship with a ballot which a Federal  district court judge has determined to be ""un fair."" The entire  referendum measure  is so  convoluted and misleading-which apparently  was the intent of those who crafted the meas ure-that, according to a recent poll, over 70  percent of the people do not understand what  it means. The Federal  judge called  the  ref erendum provisions  ""confusing, vague, con tradictory, and deceptive.""  This referen(!um has been promulgated by  the same partisan groups who earlier this year  repealed English as an official  language of  Puerto Rico and instituted a Spanish-only law.  Their action has  signaled  a movement of  Puerto Rico away from the United States.  Similarly, the pending referendum would ask  the people of Puerto Rico if they want to be  outside of the territorial clause under three op tions while retaining independence-like charac teristics and U.S. citizenship. Only one of the  three options, statehood, can actually guaran tee U.S. citizenship while  the other two op tions can only guarantee unique characteris tics as an  independent or quasi-independent  country.  To force people who have been  loyal U.S.  citizens since as long as 1917 choose love of  their Puerto Rico home and the guarantee of  U.S. citizenship under independence-statuses,  with the implication that these can legally and  politically coexist, truly gives credence to the  judge's opinion, ""the ballot is unfair.""  The people of Puerto Rico should  reject  such an unfair ballot if they do not want to fur ther distance  themselves  from  the United  States.  The article from the San Juan Star, Novem ber 16, 1991, entitled  ""Lafitte's Ruling""  fol lows:  LAFFITTE'S RULING  U.S. District Judge Hector Laffitte's deci sion not to interfere with the Dec. 8 referen dum on ""democratic rights"" was practical  and correct.  He agreed with the group of pro-statehood  groups and individuals who asked him for an  injunction  against  the  referendum  that  ""some of the propositions"" on the ballot are  ""confusing, vague, contradictory and decep tive.""  But he concluded that ""the sound constitu tional course to follow is to defer to the vot ers and to the free competition of ideas. At  this stage, it is for the voters, not this court,  to decide whether 'yes' or 'no' on the ballot  will prevail.""  In essence, he found none of the objections  raised by the plaintiffs presently merited the  injunction relief they sought.  ""Pre-election lawsuits challenging referen dums  inevitably draw  the courts  into  the  arena of highly charged political partisan ship,""  he  said.  ""Absent  egregious  cir cumstances, intrusion by federal courts into  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  a  local electoral matter is not warranted.  The ballot is unfair. However, this unfairness  does not rise to the level of a federal con stitutional deprivation.""  Laffitte made two noteworthy comments  about the future.  He described the six propositions that the  referendum lumps under one ""yes"" or ""no""  vote, as ""log rolling"" and said the Common wealth Constitution ""explicitly"" rejects it,  stating that no more  than  three proposed  amendments may be submitted at the same  referendum.  This might have been an oblique invitation  for somebody to challenge the referendum as  a violation of the Commonwealth Constitu tion.  He also cautioned those seeking an injunc tion that they were premature in claiming  that the Dec. 8 referendum was a violation of  the  federal  laws of the Commonwealth of  Puerto Rico.""  ""If plaintiffs are saying that the approval  in  the  referendum of  the Declaration of  Democratic Rights will alter the relation ship created by Laws 600 and 447, their claim  is not ripe for decision . . . ''  He noted that a ""yes"" win in December  would lead to a second referendum to amend  the Commonwealth Constitution, and if that  Constitution were ultimately amended ""then  the Court may address whether such amend ments would contravene Laws 600 and 447.""  The referendum is not a federal matter at  this stage, he said. Plaintiffs must move in  the Commonwealth arena with complaints.  However, the day could come when the affair  could fall under federal jurisdiction.  It was a sensible and practical decision.  THE SMALL BUSINESS STOCK  EXCHANGE OF AMERICA  HON. HERBERT H. BATEMAN  OF VIRGINIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 26, 1991  ",1991
1548,1104,24,Mr. BATEMAN.," Mr. Speaker, in these times  of uncertainty over the state of the economy,  many small businesses are having difficulties  finding and obtaining new  investment capital  for their business needs. For this reason, I rise  today to call attention to efforts to assist the  long-term growth and development prospects  of small businesses nationwide  through  the  creation of  the Small Business Stock Ex change  of America  (SBEX).  Also,  I  am  pleased to note that after a year of searching  and evaluating cities throughout the country to  find one with the right entrepreneurial outlook,  SBEX officials on November 7, 1991, pro posed to locate this new exchange in the city  of Hampton, VA, which I have the privilege to  represent.  According to Ralph L. McNeal, founder and  chairman of SBEX, the exchange will be the  exclusive, specialized and dedicated market place  for small businesses who are seeking  capital, but are past the initial start-up phase,  and not yet  readily  recognized, established  corporations. In this intermediary stage where  small businesses are beginning to go public,  the SBEX could play a pivotal role in facilitat ing small business' efforts to raise the funds  needed for future growth and expansion.  The new exchange is expected to provide fi nancing opportunities for companies unable or  November 26, 1991  unlikely  to be  listed on existing stock ex changes. Modeled on other small-stock ex changes  in  12  industrially advanced coun tries-mostly  in Western Europe-SBEX ex pects  to  list small businesses with annual  sales from $1 million to $30 million that are  seeking capital between $2 and $20 million.  Such companies usually fail to meet the mini mum capital standards of the large New York  Stock Exchange [NYSE], the American Stock  Exchange  [AMEX] and the National Associa tion of Securities Dealers [NASDAQ] system.  As a result, these smaller companies and their  stock offerings are quoted only  in so-called  ""pink sheets."" The  stocks covered by  the  ""pink sheets"" are traded infrequently.  It is important to note that fewer than 3,000  companies are listed on the NYSE and AMEX  exchanges and  fewer than 5,000 companies  on  the NASDAQ  system. Also,  the  ""pink  sheets"" only quote prices for less than a third  of  the 40,000  ""pink sheet"" companies  that  issue and trade stock. This leaves thousands  of companies out in the cold when it comes to  finding money to continue their efforts to ex pand. Mr. McNeal believes that the establish ment of a new small business exchange will  increase  the public visibility of thousands of  small businesses making it easier for them to  find investors and raise needed capital.  I be lieve that this new exchange proposal certainly  merits close consideration by all who are inter ested  in helping small business continue  to  play their vital role in ensuring our Nation's fu ture growth and prosperity.  It is no small undertaking to create a new  stock exchange-none has been established  in the United States within the last seven dec ades. Nevertheless, Mr. McNeal and a group  of  like-minded entrepreneurs have  remained  committed to the idea of creating a small busi ness stock exchange. They have formed the  Small Business Stock Exchange of America  Development Corporation, a 501 (c)3 not-for profit organization, which has provided over  200 hours of educational  instruction  to  the  public and prospective SBEX seat applicants  on how an exchange operates. They also  have formed an association for broker-dealers  called the American Association of Securities  Dealers  [AASD]. Under  the SBEX business  plan, brokers would have to pass the associa tion's  testing  requirements, which will  focus  exclusively on how  to analyze and market  stocks of small businesses, in order to partici pate  in  the new exchange. A broker-dealer  would not be able to trade on the new small  business stock exchange unless he is licensed  by the AASD.  The new SBEX will be structured as a  501 (c)6 non-profit organization  like all other  stock exchanges. The SBEX also would be a  self-regulating body with  its  rules and oper ations receiving approval and oversight  from  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  [SEC]. Funding of the new exchange would  come from fees and charges from listed com panies and permanent seat memberships. Mr.  McNeal expects to sell 100 permanent seats  on the new exchange and I am advised that  59 investors and small businessmen are inter ested in purchasing such seats.  A company that wants to have its securities  listed for trading on the SBEX would have to  have been in operation for 3 years, have ade",1991
1549,1117,24,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, after months of  consultation with various health care groups patient organizations,  doctors,  psychiatrists,  pharmacists, State health agencies,  law en forcement agencies, and pharmaceutical drug  manufacturers, I have drafted legislation to ad dress needs  for improving  the prescribing of  controlled substances.  The measure allows State health agencies  to access information on prescriptions of drugs  that are controlled substances in schedules II,  Ill,  IV, or V  through electronic data  transfer  and existing computer technology. The  infor mation, administered by a State's designated  health agency, could only be used  for ad dressing illegal activity, better educating physi cians, or facilitating treatment for addicted pa tients. Comprehensive practice parameters are  established for the purposes of protecting ap propriate physician prescribing and patients'  needs. Furthermore,  the measure has strict  confidentiality requirements and safeguards, is  administered by health care agencies to pro tect the legitimate needs of patients, and pro vides  for a new patient  telephone hotline,  printed patient  inserts, educational brochures  for physicians, and other means  to  improve  patient care.  I am today requesting the advice and coun sel of interested organizations in commenting  on  this draft  legislation, and  I expect to  for mally introduce the measure, with appropriate  amendments, in late January, 1992 for its con sideration during next year's  legislative ses sion. The following is a description of the leg islation, and I also invite anyone who is inter35985  ested in receiving a copy to contact my office  at 202/225-5065, or to write me at 239 Can non House Office Building, Washington, DC  20515.  Millions of Americans benefit  from proper  prescribing and administration of controlled  substances for the treatment of problems such  as cancer pain, AIDS-related pain, narcolepsy,  epilepsy, sickle cell anemia, attention deficit  disorder, mental health needs, and several  other needs. These prescription drugs can be  found in millions of medicine cabinets and do  help improve, balance and save the  lives of  millions of our citizens every day. That's a  given.  But, unfortunately, these drugs are also po tentially dangerous if not taken as prescribed  and intended. They are a measurable part of  the  illegal drug  trafficking trade, and can be  addictive. For example:  First, According  to a Bush administration  HHS  Inspector General  report, more  than 2  million senior citizens are either addicted to or  at risk to addiction to tranquilizers;  Second, According to another HHS report,  Medicare  had  to  pay  for  250,000  rehospitalizations of senior citizens caused by  needless adverse drug reactions;  Third, According to the National Institute of  Drug Abuse [NIDA], controlled substances ac counted for 88,000 hospital emergency room  visits, right behind alcohol and cocaine, and  more  than  heroin,  LSD,  and  other  illegal  drugs;  Fourth, According  to NIDA's most  recent  National Survey  of High School Students,  more than 50 percent of all high school sen iors reported illegally using tranquilizers during  the past year, more than crack and cocaine  combined; and  Fifth, According to DEA, the street value of  illegal controlled substances-the drugs inten tionally diverted for resale  to  facilitate  illegal  drug activity-is $25 billion per year.  Obviously, these needs must be addressed.  I believe this legislation can provide immediate  benefits to society:  First, save millions in existing waste, fraud,  and abuse in the Medicaid and Medicare Pro grams;  Second, help improve the prescribing prac tices of practicing physicians;  Third, address either the underprescribing or  overprescribing of controlled substances;  (4) help those patients who are addicted to  controlled substances by helping  them get  needed drug or substance abuse  treatment  and counselling, and  (5) help State health and  law enforcement  agencies  better  target  the  ""scam  artists""  (Medicaid Mill doctors, ""scripf' doctors, back door pharmacists, and  ""professional doctor  shoppers"") who illegally divert and resell con trolled substances  for significant profit  (the  ""Valium  for crack"" market),  thus enhancing  our national ""war on drugs"".  Given  the status of  the Federal and 50  States' budgets,  lawmakers,  familiar with the  TV show ""Lars Make a Deal"", are faced with  a ""Monty Hall's"" choice: We can choose door  No. 1, door No. 2, or door No. 3.  Behind No. 1 is ""cut existing benefits for pa tients-seniors,  the  poor,  and  the  handi capped."" Of course, no one wants to choose  this door.  ",1991
1550,1130,24,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, today I join my  colleagues, Representatives MARILYN  LLOYD  and BILL RICHARDSON  in introducing the Pros tate Screening Act,  legislation which would  allow  for Medicare and Medicaid reimburse ment for the prostate screening test. This test,  known in the medical field as the digital rectal  examination and the prostate specific antigen  [PSA]  test,  is the most effective  test doctors  have to detect prostate cancer.  Prostate cancer,  the second leading cause  of cancer deaths in men, has claimed the lives  of  two of our colleagues-Senator Sparky  Matsunaga and Representative Silvio Conte.  We will see an estimated 122,000 new cases  of prostate cancer in the United States in 1991  and approximately 32,000 men will die  this  year from prostate cancer.  Because the causes of prostate cancer are  unknown, prevention of the disease is not yet  possible. However, early detection greatly in creases the chances of surviving prostate can cer. The cure  rate  for  those who are diag nosed in the early stages of the cancer is 85  percent. The digital rectal exam and the PSA  test are the two tests that doctors, the Amer ican College of Radiology, and  the National  Cancer  Institute,  recommend yearly  for men  over the age of 40. These tests, analogous to  the mammography  test  in detecting breast  cancer  in women, can greatly  increase  the  chances of surviving prostate cancer.  The problem  that  remains  is  that, while  many private insurers cover the prostate can cer screening  test,  two Federal health pro grams-the Medicare and Medicaid Programs,  which provide health coverage for millions of  Americans, do not provide reimbursement for  the prostate screening  test.  Ironically, Medi care and Medicaid do provide  for  treating  prostate cancer, but fail  to reimburse for the  screening tests used to detect the cancer at  the earliest stage.  I am pleased to join my colleagues today in  introducing this  important  legislation and will  work  for  its passage. Until we enact com prehensive health care  reform emphasizing  the need for preventive care, we must ensure  that current Federal health care programs in clude screening measures that focus on preEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ventive care and early diagnosis, which saves  in lives and health care costs.  COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND DE VELOPMENT CREDIT ACT OF 1991  HON. SANDER M. LEVIN  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 26, 1991  ",1991
1551,1130,24,Mr. LEVIN of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to introduce legislation, the Cooperative  Research and Development Credit Act, that I  believe  takes an  important step  in  restoring  U.S. competitiveness.  If the United States  is going  to  remain a  leading industrial country, we must provide a  supportive economic environment for continu ous innovation and technological advance. We  must nurture our research and development  activities because they are the best path to a  prosperous future.  Mr. Speaker, this bill provides for our eco nomic future.  Tax  relief  for middle-income Americans  is  needed, and I will work with the congressional  leadership toward this end. But we also need  to develop a long-term economic strategy that  stresses economic growth as well and pro vides  incentives to assure a better economic  future for the next generation. We must have  economic growth and tax fairness, not one or  the other.  The United States wisely relies on competi tion in the marketplace to determine what in novative  technologies  reach commercial pro duction. Other countries actively support and  directly  finance R&D  in  the precompetitive  stage. We can do better in the United States  and accomplish our goals without that direct  Government intervention.  How? We can do better by emphasizing pri vate  sector  collaboration  and  encouraging  companies to share  their R&D costs. Under  cooperative  research,  our  companies  can  share their R&D costs, and  then make  their  own product development decisions based on  the cooperative research findings. In this way,  through cooperative research, several compa nies can push the resulting new ideas into the  product development stage.  Mr. Speaker, nurturing cooperation will pro vide  leverage  for our private R&D dollars.  Through collaboration, we will enhance our  competitive position.  The Cooperative Research and Develop ment Credit Act will promote cooperation in all  phases of R&D, reduce duplicative efforts, and  let the several participants decide which find ings can be commercialized.  This bill provides  that qualifying payments  and contributions to cooperative research or ganization will be eligible for a tax credit of up  to 50 percent. The bill includes stringent quali fying definitions and restrictions on the R&D  expenditures  to avoid multiple credit and  to  clarify  interaction with other credit provisions  of the Tax Code. For example, a qualifying co operative research organization must:  (a) be  registered under the National Cooperative Re search Act of 1984; and (b) must have at least  five members, four of whom make significant  financial contributions  in support of  the  re search effort.  November 26, 1991  Mr. Speaker,  the United States still  leads  the world in basic research and science, but  we lag behind other countries in technological  development and application, particularly  in  manufacturing  industries.  Our  companies  seem hampered by an inability, unwillingness,  and just plain slowness to commercialize inno vative ideas. Basic research requires long and  costly effort to be transformed  into products  and processes, which  in  turn are eventually  commercialized.  Why help? The consensus view is that pri vate firms, working individually, and the private  market overall, are funding  less R&D than is  in  the  long-term  national  interest because  short-term profit needs are  too often para mount. U.S. companies are not doing enough  R&D, nor are they moving what they do onto  the market fast enough.  For U.S. companies,  the R&D dollar  is a  long-term,  risk-laden,  disadvantaged  invest ment dollar. To help them cope with the high  cost of capital, shorted product development  cycles, rapid diffusion of technological informa tion, and the pressure to show profits, it is cru cial  to help these companies get more bang  for their R&D buck.  Consequently, an  incentive  for cooperative  R&D spending  is warranted.  I want to make  clear  that  I support permanent extension of  the existing credit for increasing research ac tivities under section 41 of the Internal Reve nue Code. But program reviews such as the  1989 GAO  report  raise questions about the  adequacy of the existing credit to stimulate re search.  Mr. Speaker, collaboration by private com panies on R&D works. Over 200 collaborative  research groups have  registered under  the  provisions of  the National Cooperative Re search Act of 1984. The National Center for  Manufacturing Sciences, one of the largest re search  consortia,  reports  that  it  leverages  membership R&D dollars by as much as 1 O to-1 and shortens the development cycle by 2  to 5 years. Others, such as  the Microelec tronics and Computer Technology Corp.,  re port leverage factors of as high as 17-to-1.  While I do not have a revenue estimate for  this legislation, the evidence suggests that effi ciency savings through pooling of R&D efforts  should minimize costs, and  the credit  itself  should be more effective in generating techno logical improvements.  Mr. Speaker,  I insert a preliminary section by-section analysis  in  the RECORD  following  my remarks, and I would further ask that all in terested parties review the legislation and give  me any  thoughts or suggestions  they might  have.  COOPERATIVE R & D CREDIT  SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS  Section A. Addition of Credit for Payments  or contributions to certain cooperative re search organizations.  Present law  Current tax law provides a credit for re search and development expenses. Under cur rent law, such expenses may, in fact, be ex pensed. Previous to December 31, 1991, Fed eral tax law permitted, on an interim basis,  an incremental tax credit for research and  development expenses aggregating above a  three-year rolling basis. This credit is due to  expire.  ",1991
1552,1143,24,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  insert the  following, written by David Martin,  and published in the November 22, 1991, edi tion of the New York Times.  Mr. Martin  is an authority on Yugoslavia,  having served there with the OSS in the Sec ond World War, and since has written many  books on  that area of  the world,  including  ""Web of Disinformation: Churchill's Yugoslav  Blunder,"" a critical expose on the complicity of  Kim Philby and his circle of Communists in al lowing Tito to assume control of Yugoslavia.  [From the New York Times, Nov. 22, 1991]  CROATIA'S BoRDERS: OVER THE EDGE-MEDI ATORS IGNORE THAT TITO CHEATED SERBIA  (By David Martin)  The European Community, with the sup part of the U.S., has recommended  to the  U.N.  that sanctions be  impased on Yugo slavia in order to stop the civil war between  Serbia and Croatia. The sanctions will go  into effect unless both sides agree to a cease nre and accept the internal borders that ex isted with the crisis began this summer.  However well-intentioned, the community  and  the U.S.  are misguided  in  their ap proach. Yugoslavia's internal borders are the  recent inventions of a Communist dictator  and have no historical validity.  After the German conquest of Yugoslavia  in April 1941, a quisling regime was set up in  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Croatia under Ante Pavelic and his fascist  Ustashe movement. the Ustashe declared an  Independent State of Croatia, whose greatly  enlarged  frontiers extended  into  territory  that had belonged to Serbia, and gave Mr.  Pavelic pawer over a  third of Yugoslavia's  Serbian papulation. The Ustashe, not  the  Croatian people,  then embarked on a cam paign of terror that took the lives of more  than 500,000 Serbs. In addition, many thou sands of Jews and gypsies were massacred.  Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president and a  former Tito general, has done little to allevi ate Serbians' fear of an independent Croatia.  He said last year that the Ustashe regime,  which ruled occupied Croatia from 1941  to  1945, ""reflected the centuries-old aspirations  of the Croat people."" A recent article in The  Guardian of London quoted Mr. Tudjman as  saying he was thankful that his own wife did  not have any Jewish or Serbian blood, and  that for  the Jews ""genocidal violence is a  natural phenomenon,  in keeping with  the  human-social  and mythological-divine na ture. It is not only allowed, but even rec ommended.  Mr. Tudjman's treatment of the Serbs has  gone beyond his unfortunate rhetoric. Since  Croatia declared independence in June, the  Serbs in Croatia have been the victims of a  campaign of harassment. Serbs working for  the Croatian government were  dismissed.  Serbian schools were banned. The Victims of  Fascism Square in Zagreb was renamed the  Square of  the Sovereigns of Croatia. Mr.  Tudjman's decision to adopt a flag modeled  on the Ustashe flag has only made matters  worse.  Both sides complain that the war has cre ated large numbers of refugees. But it has  been forgotten that the existing frontiers be tween Croatia and Serbia were arbitrarily  drawn by Marshal Tito, a Croat, after he  came to pawer in 1944. Though Tito's borders  favored Croatia, they were substantially less  expansionist that the Ustashe borders they  replaced.  I  hold no  brief  for President Slobovan  Milosevic  of  Serbia-a  Communist  apparatchik who now calls himself a ""social ist""-or for his decision to embark on mili tary action. Mr. Milosevic would be  in a  much more defensible position  today if he  had,  instead,  embarked on  a  propaganda  campaign focusing on  the  issue of human  rights.  The Serbs cannot be blamed for fearing the  rebirth of an extremist Croatia. But one  must ask the community and the U.S. why  frontiers established by a Communist dic tator, no matter how much they may violate  the more compelling concept of ethnic fron tiers, must be considered legally valid for all  time.  Political stability cannot be achieved by  giving Mr. Milosevic  ultimatums.  Surely  there is a more moral, humane and Politi cally acceptable way of delineating frontiers.  For example, shouldn't some provision be  made for the use of a plebiscite or for arbi tration procedures? Even now, it may not be  too late for the community to shift its posi tion  in a manner that allows  for  frontier  changes in both directions.  There is much evidence that the Serbian  public could favor a compromise settlement.  Among other things,  there has been little  persecution of Croats in Serbia.  It would also be proper for the community,  the U.N. and the U.S. to address the question  of human rights in both Serbia and Croatia  instead of ignoring this question while pro testing  that  they are  interested only  in  greater regional stability.  36011  NEED FOR BONE MARROW DONORS  HON. BENJAMIN A GIIMAN  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 26, 1991  ",1991
1553,1143,24,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to  rise today to express my deepest admiration,  for a constituent of mine, Jay Feinberg, who is  desperately searching for a compatible bone  marrow donor.  Jay Feinberg  is 23 years old and  in June  1991,  he  was  diagnosed  with  chronic  myelogenous  leukemia. The  only  potential  cure for this dreadful disease is a bone mar row transplant. Without one, Jay will die be cause chemotherapy does not alter the natural  cause of this disease.  Mr. Speaker, an estimated 82,600 American  children and adults are stricken each year with  leukemia, aplastic anemia or other fatal blood  diseases. For many, the only hope for survival  is a marrow transplant. Nearly 70 percent of  those afflicted cannot  find a suitable match  within their own families. These patients need  to find unrelated donors-people who have of fered to give the living gift of life to a specific  patient in need. As the pool of potential mar row donors  increases, so do  the odds of a  match for the thousands of patients in need.  The chance that a patient will find a matching,  unrelated donor  in  the general population  is  between one in a hundred and one in a mil lion.  Currently, there are only 89,000 donors reg istered throughout our Nation. We need more  than 100,000 donors to improve the odds of  finding donors for the current list of potential  beneficiaries.  It is crucial that the public be made aware  that  they have  it within  themselves  to save  lives. To be typed as a potential bone marrow  donor only requires a small and simple blood  test. If a volunteer is identified as a match, the  donation itself requires only 2 to 5 percent of  the body's marrow, which regenerates  in full  within 3 weeks.  The requirements to be a marrow donor are  f~w. To be a marrow donor, you must be be tween 18 and 55 years old and be  in good  health. All  it takes is 1 O minutes and two ta blespoons of blood to join the National Marrow  Donor Program Registry. Those  interested  in  becoming donors should contact the National  Marrow Donor Program at 1-SOQ-654-1247.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to  give this kind of a ""living gift of life.""

1555,1169,24,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. Speaker,  the House and  Senate on November 27, 1991, passed S.  543, Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation  Improvement Act of 1991  [FDICIA]. An imporEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tant amendment to  the qualified thrift  lender  test  [QTL], which  I offered and was over whelmingly adopted by  the House Banking  Committee, was made part of that legislation.  I strongly support the new QTL test.  The  newly  adopted  QTL  requirements  should not act as an impediment to otherwise  permissible acquisitions of banks by savings  associations  that are now  facilitated by  the  FDICIA. Section 501--entitled ""Mergers and  Acquisitions of Insured Depository Institutions  During Conversion Moratorium""-authorizes  the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision  to permit an acquiring savings association to  retain  the nonconforming assets of an ac quired bank for a limited period of time for pur poses of the  investment  limits of the Home  Owner's Loan Act. The Director should also  afford  the acquiring savings associations a  similar,  limited time within which to phase  in  recognition of these assets for purposes of the  QTL test.  The  recent  improvements  in  the QTL  test  provide the needed flexibility in the test, con sistent with the housing finance purpose of the  test.  It would undermine these results if sav ings associations were subject to rigid require ments to make rapid sales of assets, acquired  in combination with banks, simply to meet the  OTL test requirements.  JOSE CANCELA  IS NAMED CHAIR MAN PUBLIC HEALTH TRUST OF  DADE COUNTY  HON. ILEANA ROS.LEHTINEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 26, 1991  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Joe  Cancela has been named the new chairman  of the Public Health Trust of Dade County,  which oversees Jackson Memorial Hospital,  one of the largest hospitals in the Nation. Mr.  Cancela's meteoric rise to success is an inspi ration. The Miami Herald ran a story on De cember 1, by staff writer Karen Branch, which  tells the path taken by Mr. Cancela from pa perboy to chairman. The article follows:  At  16-year-old  Rosy  Gonazalez's  high  school football game one night,  there was  one especially rowdy fan in the crowd. She  took notice when she realized the screaming  teen-age boy was new in town and didn't at tend either school.  ""He was so wild,"" she says. ""It wasn't even  his team, but there he was, controlling ev erything around him.""  Jose Cancela has always plowed into un known  territory-noisily and  successfully.  The  trait carried him  from  that football  game to a meteoric career in Spanish-lan guage television.  And  it got him Rosy, his wife of eight  years.  It also got him to where he is today: an ex ecutive vice president of the Univision net work and the newly elected chairman of the  trust  overseeing  Jackson Memorial Hos pital's $615 million budget.  At 34,  the community college dropout is  short on experience and education. But he  has compensated with extreme ambition, ego  and an aggressiveness that borders on terror ism. He is a salesman.  As  an 8-year-old delivering The Miami  News each afternoon, he was always the last  36037  of the four Cancela kids to make it home to  Little Havana. ""It wasn't just showing up  and tossing the newspaper,"" says his mother,  Beatriz. ""It was stopping to talk to every  family.""  It made for good business. He won a sub scription sales contest at 11.  ""I never looked at it as selling."" Cancela  says. ""It was fun. It was a way to get out of  homework.""  And a way to turn on the charm. Like the  day in 1978 when Cancela flashed the smile  that got him into the home of WLTV-Chan nel 23 account executive Osvaldo Moran.  Cancela was  peddling  fire  alarms. The  Morans already had one. It was two days be fore Christmas. Mrs. Moran was conservative  with money.  Lotsa luck kid, thought Mr. Moran, sitting  back to watch the show.  ""My wife bought the system. It was $900,""  remembers Moran. He  took Cancela to see  his boss.  Presto. From  fire  alarms  to  television  commercials. A sales career took off.  Other moves followed. In 1984, he bounded  from ad sales in Miami to general manager  of Uni vision's Phoenix affiliate.  This month, just two years after he was  named to the Public Health Trust, he be came its chairman.  When Cancela made the jump to channel  23, he was never the average account execu tive. He showed up in the newsroom, volun teered for special events in the public affairs  department, pitched in with programming. If  his customers couldn't afford a spokesman  for a commercial, he stepped in front of the  camera. He knew the names of all the soap  opera stars.  His  whirlwind  doors-leading  to  Univision stations.  ""He would be there at 11, 12 at night,"" said  Joaquin Blaya, now Univision's president  and the man behind Cancela's fast-track pro motions.  ""So when  the opening came  in  Phoenix, I figured that for all his restless ness, he could do it.""  As general manager-first in Phoenix, then  San Antonio,  then Miami-Cancela  con trolled every department. He  stepped out  into community activism, especially when  he  came  back home  to Miami  in  1988.  Cancela and his wide grin appeared every where.  It paid off when people handed out appoint ments. Cancela got a lion's share: the Great er Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau,  the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce,  the Orange Bowl Committee,  the Public  Health Trust.  Cancela says he accepted the trust posi tion, the most high-profile, ""for ego.""  ""But then I came to realize Jackson's im portance,"" he  says. He  resigned positions  with the Miami Sports and Exhibition Au thority, the chamber of commerce and the  convention bureau after  the  trust unani mously elected him chairman Nov. 14.  Cancela's rise at Jackson  followed some  major changes  in  the membership of the  trust. His selection had its critics.  ""He would not have been my choice,"" said  ousted trust member Stanley Tate. ""He's too  young, too inexperienced.""  Cancela's predecessor as chairman and his  strong supporter, Jay Weiss, insists youth is  a plus.  ""He's  indefatigable,  unbelievably  ener getic,"" Weiss says. ""He is not ashamed or  reticent to ask advice from anybody. He isn't  stiff-necked  enough  that  he won't seek  help.""  style  blew  open more  the  top spots at other  ",1991
1556,1182,24,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday, a fel low American, Clyde Mitty, bled to death in a  most unusual way. It is a sad case, and I re print the news report from the St. Petersburg,  FL, Times Mirror as a warning to others:  ST. PETERSBURG, FL.-In what the County  Coronor's office described as a bizarre case,  Mr. Clyde Mitty of Treasure Island bled to  death from a minor wound while trying to  decide which hospital most lived up to its ad vertisements.  ""Basically,"" said County Deputy Sheriff  Perry Plumart,  ""he was  touring around,  checking out various hospitals for the qual ity of their food, how big the rooms were,  what kind of color tvs they had. By the time  his wife drove him to the fourth hospital, he  had bled to death.""  ""Strangest case of consumerism  I  ever  saw,"" said Dr. Mary Popit, who performed  the autopsy. ""I don't know why  the wife  didn't put a stop to it. The front seat of the  car was just aslosh with blood.""  Mrs. Anne Raffaelli Mitty was described as  distraught and unavailable for comment. Her  son-in-law, Tom Goldstein of Tampa, said  that his father-in-law had always been fas cinated with hospital advertisements.  ""He had told me many a time after reading  one of the local papers that he liked this or  that hospital's ads and if he ever had to go to  a hospital, that was where he was going to  go,"" said Goldstein, ""Trouble was, whatever  ad he saw last, that was where he wanted to  go. The ads were so confusing that he just  couldn't decide which hospital  really was  best.""  According to a statement Goldstein filed  with the police, Mrs. Anne R. Mitty said that  on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Mitty was peeling  an orange with a common kitchen knife and  slightly slit part of his wrist. Realizing that  some stitches would be  required and that  there might be some nerve damage, they left  their Treasure Island home a.bout 2 PM and  drove  first  to St. Benedict's Hospital  in  Tampa, some twenty miles distant and past  three closer hospitals. St. Benedict's has re cently run a series of full-page ads touting  the quality of their meals and the artistic  presentation of their dinner platters.  Mrs. Ella Mumphard, a cashier at the St.  Benedict's Hospital cafeteria remembers see ing Mr. Mitty  (identified  through photos)  around3PM.  ""He looked a little pale, but was asking a  lot of questions about the pastry desserts,""  said Mrs. Mumphard. ""You know, how often  they were baked, whether they used fresh  fruit like the ads claimed, you know, real  picky. Looked like a troublemaker to me.""  Mrs. Mumphard said it was easy to recall  Mr. Mitty because  the maintenance staff  started complaining about blood on the floor  right after he left. ""They had to get out a  whole new bucket to swab it up,"" Mumpha.rd  said.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The  police  report  indicated  that  the  Mitty's recrossed  the Bay and arrived at  Pleasant View Hospital  in St. Petersburg  around 4:15.  Mr. Gerry Elliott of the hospital's social  activities center remembered Mr. Mitty well.  ""He was asking about our recent ads on tv  where we talk about our wide range of video  and audio entertainment  in each private  room. You know,  the VCRs,  the tapes, the  stereo, not to mention  the traveling book  and magazine collections. It was good to see  our ads having such an impact. He was clear ly an informed consumer,"" said Mr. Elliott.  Mr. Elliott did recall asking Mrs. Mitty if  everything was alright. ""It looked like he  needed a new towel around his arm. The one  he had was all red. Looked like blood to me.""  Mr. Mitty's trail then led to Jefferson Hos pital, the area teaching hospital, which has  been conducting an extensive radio adver tisement campaign stressing the quality of  its staff.  Ms. Tracy Spencer, assistant personnel di rector of Jefferson Hospital, vividly remem bered seeing Mr. Mitty around 4:50.  ""He sort of staggered into my office and  flopped  down  in  that stained chair over  there. He was very pale, and was in some res piratory distress. I  told him I'd call for a  wheelchair to get him to emergency but he  said no. Started asking me all kinds of ques tions about the degrees and the experience of  the hospital  staff,  the  floor  nurses, how  many RNs, all the kind of stuff we'd talked  about in the ads but perhaps were not very  specific about.""  Ms. Spencer gave Mr. Mitty one of the hos pital's promotional pamphlets that listed the  staff's credentials, and he said he would read  it over.  ""I really did try to get him to stay and get  treatment for the awful bloody arm he had,""  said Spencer, ""but he said he had more shop ping a.round to do.""  The police report indicated that Mr. Mitty  insisted on going to Coolidge Hospital back  in Tampa, because of that day's full-page  Sunday supplement ad insert in local papers  which had stressed the quality of its emer gency rooms.  ""Unfortunately,"" said Pinellas County po lice officer Joe Henderson, ""he didn't have  enough blood left in him to check out the  final hospital. So in a sense, it was his final  choice.""  Local health authorities could not remem ber a similar case in the Tampa Bay area.  Dean Phil Graeter of the University of Flor ida. Medical School said  that hospital ads  have become a major business:  ""I don't know why. Picking a hospital in  an emergency on the basis of ads is-and I  don't want to speak ill of the deceased-pret ty nutty."" Dean Graeter said. ""You could  even call it stupid.""  Communications  expert  Roxanne  Verduzco, a professor of sociology at Tampa  Community College said  that ""Ea.ch year,  America's hospitals spend a.bout $1  billion on advertising, with the average hos pital spending about $150,000 a year on ads.  They say it is to gain market share, but I  really wonder if people shop for hospitals the  way they shop for cars. If it's not an emer gency, you usually go where your doctor sug gests. Shopping for a hospital by reading ads  is odd. I guess poor Mr. Mitty did-and look  what happened to him.""  Another son-in-law, John Edgell of Tarpon  Springs, speculated on the sad end of his fa ther-in-law.  ""He was  always  so worried  a.bout health care costs that he paid a lot of  attention to things that talked about health  to $1.6  November 26, 1991  Personally, I always sort of wondered,  they didn't advertise so much, maybe their  costs wouldn't be  so  high.' Guess  that  thought never crossed old Clyde's mind. He  sure loved those dumb ads.""  'if  EUGENE  CONESE'S  AIR  SERVICES  IS  LEADER  GREENWICH  NATIONAL  HON. ILEANA ROS.LEHTINEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 26, 1991  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  I am  pleased  to  recognize Eugene Conese, Sr.,  who recently was featured in the Miami Her ald, after his firm was given approval by the  Metro-Dade County Commission  to operate  the huge jet engine service center at Miami  International Airport recently vacated by East ern Airlines. The article ""Firm Hope To Grow  Into Eastern Base"" by Larry Birger tells how  Mr. Conese has built the second largest inde pendent engine overhauling company  in  the  country.  As an accounting major in college, Eugene  Conese Sr. 's goal was to become chief finan cial officer of a Fortune 500 company.  But his horizons widened considerably in  graduate school when he fell under the influ ence of famed author and management con sultant Peter Drucker. Drucker convinced  Conese that he had the ability and vision to  be a chief executive.  Conese met this goal and more.  Now, at the age of 62, when most people  start thinking about slowing down, Conese is  aiming  for  loftier heights. His goal  is  to  build the ""best"" American company in the  aviation-services field.  ""That doesn't necessarily mean the larg est, but certainly the best in terms of treat ing employees right, being fair with suppli ers and, above all, servicing the customer  better than anyone else,"" Conese says.  The opportunity to make it happen ca.me  recently when Conese's company-Greenwich  Air Services-was given  approval  by  the  Metro-Dade Commission to lease and operate  the huge jet engine service center at Miami  International Airport vacated by the defunct  Eastern Airlines.  It fell  to Greenwich by default when its  only  competition-a  consortium  that  in cluded Federal Express and former Eastern  President Phil Bakes-broke up at the 11th  hour.  PURCHASED BATCH AIR  Not that Greenwich is that small.  When  Conese  purchased  Miami-based  Batch Air from George Batchelor in 1987, it  was a $45 million-a-year business with 450  workers. Revenues are now $75 million annu ally with 750 workers. And estimates for 1992  range to $87 million, despite the soggy econ omy.  That ranks Greenwich second  to Dallas based Aviall Inc., a subsidiary of Ryder Sys tem, as the largest independent engine over hauling company in the country.  Greenwich revenues come from overhaul ing engines and air frames of planes owned  by military, commercial and industrial com panies and second-tier airlines. The major  airlines mostly do their own maintenance.  A Who's Who of Greenwich's customers in cludes  Airborne  Express,  Arrow  Air,  Avianca, The Boeing Co., DHL Airways, Gen",1991

I'd like to  especially  recognize  the  efforts  and  leadership of the committee staff Roy  Kienitz, Mike Wiess, Jean Lauver, and  Taylor Bowlden.  Mr.  President,  with to speak?  ",1991
1560,1208,24,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Yes.  Mr. President, I simply want to say  it would be characteristic of the Sen ator  from Minnesota  that he would  speak of what others have done in this  legislation, which is epic legislation. Of  the  two or three  transportation bills  that passed  this Senate  in  two cen turies, this is surely one of the most  important. And in it, we establish a na tional highway system, something we  have not ever done, the logic of having  creating  the  Interstate and Defense  Highway System we would not  take  from our major roads the then primary  arterial roads.  This was offered by the Senator from  Minnesota here on  the  floor  as an  amendment, adopted,  I  think, unani mously by the Senate, and now part of  this legislation. It is not going to be an  easy thing to do. We are going to have  to pick from among about 150,000 miles  some 110,000 miles,  perhaps  a  little  more; there is a little leeway. Then we  are going  to have  to define what we  mean by this, what we want by it, what  timeframe,  what  amounts  of  re sources-lots of defining.  It took 40 years  to build the inter state and  longer than that to get it  from the time it got started. It will not  take 40 years to put the National High way System together. Its roads exist  now. But to put them in the shape we  want them and in the design that we  colleague  does my  desire is a 20-year project. If you do not  have 20 years to spare, do not get into  transportation.  But it is for that reason I am particu larly pleased  that  the Senator from  Minnesota has made  this his project,  and I think it should be on notice that  we expect him to stay here for 20 years  in the U.S. Senate, to see to it being  done, and when that time comes, I hope  that he, as a very senior Senator, will  speak to someone as I am now speaking  to him, saying ""Now, your job for the  next 20 years is as follows.""  But, Senator DURENBERGER, you are  hereby assigned 20 years labor on the  National Highway System, and in the  end,  they will-who knows-they will  name a bypass for you. You have the  great gratitude of your conferees, as  you know, and the respect of this body.  Mr. DURENBERGER addressed  the  Chair.  ",1991

1562,1208,24,Mr. DURENBERGER.,"  I  appreciate  the compliment. It seems to me some where within the last 20 to 24 hours I  listened to somebody suggest that we  name Superfund sites for Senators and  now  I have heard  the possibility we  will have bypasses named for Senators.  I hope I am just fortunate enough to be  here as long as PAT MOYNIHAN is here  and  to have  the opportunity  to con tinue working with him.  Yesterday,  in  the middle of all of  this, I understand I thought I was too  busy to go to the Finance Committee  meeting on taxes, since they seemed to  be irrelevant at this particular point in  time. I did not know what was going on  at  the White House and with NEWT  GINGRICH, but I understand the senior  Senator from New York took about an  hour to engage in a discourse with the  Director of the Congressional Budget  Office, Bob Reischauer, on the impact  of the tax system on the economy and  on the people of this country and to go  into his usual concern about the fami lies of America and the people of Amer ica, their earning capacity, the way in  which the tax system relates to that  capacity  to  their value  systems  to  their ability to be families, the kinds  of things that I have always enjoyed  sitting and listening to him discourse  with others as it relates to social pol icy,  behavioral  science,  that appar ently have not arrived here yet, other  than in our own personal manifesta tions. I just think it is incredible in the  middle of everything that he was doing  and I thought we were doing yesterday,  that he took that time to push our un derstanding a bit farther about the sig nificance of tax and economic policy  and fiscal policy and budget policy in  this country as well. So I appreciate  that.  Mr. President, it seems to me there  are  three ways  for  this Senator, at  least, to look at a  transportation bill.  ",1991
1563,1221,24,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I rise  today to support the conference report  on  the  Intermodal Surface Transpor tation Efficiency Act of 1991.  It is critical that this conference re port be adopted because many States,  including Virginia, have frozen further  contract work  on many  important  projects including the high occupancy  vehicle [HOV] lane extension on Inter state 95.  Mr. President, foremost today I want  to commend my conference colleagues  majority  leader MITCHELL, Chairman  MOYNIHAN,  the Environment Commit tee  Chairman  BURDICK,  Senators  CHAFEE,  SYMMS,  LAUTENBERG,  REID,  and DURENBERGER,  and  the majority  leader. Their determination and com mitment  to an  innovative  transpor tation policy have brought together a  conference report which addresses our  urgent transportation needs.  As one of the leaders of a bipartisan  group of Senators in the fight to amend  the Senate bill last June in accordance  with  the FAST  formulas,  I  renewed  that fight  in  the conference and  to gether with other FAST supporters we  improved the formula during the long  negotiations of the conference.  Although many are not fully satis fied with the results, I can assure my  colleagues that genuine attempts were  made to provide relief to highly popu lated States.  Progress was made  to give  the so called donor States-those States re ceiving far less dollars in return than  their highway users contribute to the  trust fund-a greater return on  their  contributions.  During the consideration of the Sen ate bill, objections were expressed by  many who believed the formulas used  to  allocate  Federal  highway  trust  funds were outdated and unevenly dis tributed among  the States. Virginia,  like other States, simply was not get ting a fair return for the dollars paid  into the trust fund.  For Virginia  this conference report  provides over $2.6 billion to meet trans portation demands in the next 6 years.  This amount far exceeds the Sl.5 billion  Virginia received from the trust fund  under the current bill.  It is my hope that this increase in  funds will begin  to meet  the many  highway demands across the Common weal th.  A  cornerstone of  the Federal and  Surface Transportation Act or FAST  bill which I originally sponsored was a  90-percent minimum allocation of the  dollars each State contributed to the  trust fund.  The conference  report  represents a  significant  achievement  for  donor  States by increasing the minimum al location  program  from  the  current  level of 85 percent  to  the 90-percent  goal.  This program is important because it  is  the safety net for donor States. It  guarantees  that whatever the annual  allocation, no State will  receive  less  than 90 percent of what their highway  users pay into the trust fund.  While so much of our debate has fo cused on  the dollar  return  for each  State, I believe the conference report  represents a new and users era in trans portation policy. This  is  innovative  legislation which will carry our trans portation infrastructure into  the 21st  century.  For  the  first  time, States will be  given maximum flexibility to use their  funds  to meet  their  own  pressing  needs-whether these needs are for the  Interstate System, bridge repairs, or  primary routes.  Flexibility will  allow Virginia and  particularly the metropolitan regions  of northern Virginia, Tidewater and  Richmond to transfer highway funds to  transit activities  if it is determined  that rail or bus service will more effec tively serve the needs of the traveling  public.  A result of this flexibility will be in creased efficiencies in the use of these  funds and increased performance of the  transportation system.  A second important policy  issue  in  this bill is the commitment to a strong  National Highway System. This pro",1991

1568,1234,24,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Let me begin by  complimenting my friend from  Idaho  for his bold leadership as the ranking  member of the Water Resource, Trans portation  and  Infrastructure  Sub committee of the Senate Committee on  Environment and Public Works. I com mend him for his efforts.  Contained in this legislation are nu merous items which are especially im portant to  the A venue of the Saints.  First is the National Highway System  of which the A venue of the Saints is  part. Also,  there  is a demonstration  project of approximately $120 million  for the Avenue of the Saints. And fi nally, there is considerable flexibility  built into this bill which will allow the  Iowa Department of Transportation to  commit the dollars necessary to make  the Avenue of the Saints a reality by  the end of this decade.  I would inquire of my colleague, as  the ranking member of the committee  which produced this bill, whether he  agrees with my assessment of the bill  and  its  impact,  the A venue  of  the  Saints.  ",1991
1569,1234,24,Mr. SYMMS.," I would like to say to  the Senator from  Iowa  that I agree  with his assessment. This legislation is  a good bill  that will directly impact  the Avenue of the Saints. It will make  it easier  to complete  this  important  corridor project.  I would also like to take this oppor tunity to commend the Senator from  Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, for his tenacity in  fighting for the A venue of the Saints.  Senator GRASSLEY  and  I  have  had  many conversations about the impor tance of this project to  the State of  Iowa. No one has been more determined  to make sure that this legislation was  good for his State. When the Avenue of  the Saints is completed at the end of  this decade, the Senator from Iowa will  get considerable credit for this accom plishment.  ",1991
1570,1234,24,Mr. GRASSLEY., I  thank my friend  for his kind words and cooperation.  ,1991
1571,1234,24,Mr. SYMMS.," First and foremost,  I  am proud  that the conference report  before us  is,  in every  important  re spect, virtually the same bill the Sen ate passed on a 91-to-7 vote last June.  The program structure-which places  top priority on the preservation of our  Interstate and Defense Highway Sys tem, establishes a new Surface Trans portation Program, sufficiently  flexi ble to meet the varying regional and  demographic needs of our States, and  establishes a new Congestion Mi tiga tionl Air Quality Program to help solve  the most pressing transportation prob lems of our  large urban areas. That  program structure of  the Senate bill  remains  intact  and  virtually  un changed here.  In addition,  the distribution of pro gram funds in this conference report,  although not as  favorable  for most  Western States as that of the Senate passed bill, remains much closer to the  State-by-State program shares of the  Senate bill,  than  to  the  disastrous  urban orientated formulas adopted by  the House. I went into this conference  knowing I could protect Idaho's share  of  the  total  program  through  one  means or another, but I felt a real obli gation to try my best to protect the  Western State formulas of the Senate  bill, and while we've given ground to  the donor States, I believe we've left  our Western States in a defensible posi tion to begin neogitations on the next  bill.  Apart  from program structure and  formulas, I am very pleased to report  that this bill to be the largest surface  transportation bill  in history. If the  Appropriations Committee provides ob ligation authority  sufficient  to  fund  fully  the authorized amounts over 6  years, this bill will draw the cash bal ance in the highway trust fund down to  about $2.5 billion, which is the cushion  required to meet cash flow demands in  the highway program.  In addition, I am pleased and proud  that my colleagues in the Senate and  among the conferees, both House and  Senate, have given such strong, bipar tisan support to my efforts to establish  a National Recreational Trails. Pro gram. This program, funded from fuel  taxes already being paid by offhighwc..y~  vehicle users, will provide a steady, re liable  funding source  to help States  build and maintain a trails system for  both motorized and nonmotorized trail  users.  Also, I am pleased to report that this  bill contains the largest Federal Lands  Highway Program ever. This program  provides  funds  to  support  transpor tation infrastructure improvements on  Indian  reservations,  national  parks,  and federally owned  lands across  the  country. We have made what I consider  to be an important change by combin ing the existing fore st highways and  public lands highways into one account  that will  bring  the State  transpor tation departments,  the Forest Serv ice, and the Federal Highway Adminis tration to the table with their compet ing  interests  to  establish  transpor tation priorities on our public lands.  Also, I want to mention the program  efficiencies section of Senate bill which  we have modified but preserved intact  in this conference report. The program  efficiencies section was drafted in large  part by our transportation department  in Idaho, based on consultations with  their counterparts in States across the  country,  to allow  the States greater  authority  to administer  the highway  program without burdensome and cost ly Federal oversight. The conference  agreement on program efficiencies pro vides that States may design and con struct projects off the National High way System according  to  their own  State  standards,  and  provides  that  States may  approve  those  projects  without Federal approval  if they so  choose.  Projects on  the National Highway  System must be designed  and  con structed in accordance with standards  that meet or exceed standards set by  AASHTO, but States may, on a project by-project basis, approve the design of  pavement  rehabilitation  projects  on  the NHS without Federal approval.  This streamlined approval process is  of vital importance to my State and I  believe it will lead to a more cost-effec tive and much more productive high way program.  Finally,  I want  to  say  how  dis appointed I am that the Private Prop erty Rights Act, which  the Senate  passed by a 55-to-44 vote,  is not  in cluded in the final conference report. I  wish we could have held that impor",1991
1572,1247,24,Mr. SANFORD.," Madam President, we  are obliged by our duties as Senators  to bring to the Nation a surface trans portation reauthorization bill. The Na tion needs this bill. The Nation needs  its highways  and  interstates main tained, it needs to begin construction  on its newly planned highways, and it  needs its transit systems running.  The  infrastructure  system  of  the  United States  is  the greatest in  the  world, and we should all be proud of  that  fact.  And  crafting  legislation  which authorizes  funds  to keep  this  system operating is one of the most  important responsibilities of Congress.  The surface transportation legislation  authorizes the spending of vast sums of  money-billions of dollars-which  in  turn creates jobs for countless individ uals in industries ranging from engi neering  to construction  to  sales  to  manufacturing,  and  so many  other  fields. The highways, bridges, and tran sit systems authorized by this bill keep  the Nation moving and working. None  of us  could  survive  in  this modern  world without the transportation sys tems which are  the  lifetimes  to our  jobs, to our homes, to the stores, res taurants, and businesses of America.  Indeed, our Nation would go nowhere  without this system.  The Nation is therefore at the mercy  of Congress to bring forth legislation  to provide  funding  for  the  transpor tation systems. The issue of equitable  funding is critical to our debate on this  legislation.  Going  into  this  reauthorization  cycle, North Carolina was  receiving  only 74 cents back for every dollar it  put into the highway trust fund-an ex treme  iniquity. When we  first began  our debate of this transportation legis lation, I was adamant about seeing a  better return for North Carolina's dol lars. While this bill is not revolution ary in  that regard,  I believe  I have  achieved some success. After the enact ment of this legislation, North Caro lina will be receiving 87.5 cents back  for every dollar it sends to the Federal  highway trust fund. This is clearly a  step in the right direction.  During the debates in the Senate ear lier  this year,  I was very outspoken  about the need to change the funding  formula  for  the Federal-aid highway  programs.  I pointed out  the need  to  move away from the formula used dur ing the interstate construction period,  and toward a more equitable formula  based on use and maintenance factors.  I am disappointed that this legislation  does not include such changes in the  formula, but I am certain that we have  been  successful  in  heightening  the  donor State issue  in both  the House  and the Senate.  There was a  time when it was nec essary  for  some States  to  receive a  larger percent of the trust fund than  others as all States were working to gether to fund the construction of the  interstate system. However, the period  of interstate construction is over and  we are now moving into a new era, one  that will  focus on maintenance and  use. We therefore should not maintain  the old funding  formula  to carryout  our new directives. To that end I was  successful in adding a provision to the  legislation which requires the General  Accounting Office to study the surface  transportation  funding  formulas  and  recommend  to  Congress  a  formula  which would treat all States equitably.  I believe that having an objective body,  such as the GAO, study the issue and  recommend  the necessary changes  is  the best way to ensure fair formulas  are adopted in the future.  I have found that those States which  have historically  received more  per  dollar under  the  interstate construc tion formula do not want to give up the  large returns their States have been re ceiving. During this highway debate we  have all done a very good job watching  out for the interests of our States, but  have not acted in a manner to benefit  the entire United States. We all want a  bigger slice of the pie for our State, but  there  just  is not enough pie  to go  around. We need to base our Federal aid highway allocations on need, not  greed. Therefore, I am hopeful that the  GAO study and recommendations will  help to eliminate this difficult funding  formula debate which  tears apart re gions, Senators, and  the  interests of  the entire United States.  While I have concerns about this leg islation's funding formula, it does con tain great measures for the Nation and  for North Carolina. The safety features  of the bill are enhanced. There is an  emphasis on  transit  systems, which  will allow North Carolina  to pursue  transit planning  in both urban and  rural areas. And the bill includes an in crease in the minimum allocation from  85 to 90 percent.  I will offer my support for this legis lation. I believe it is a big step in the  right direction  for  transportation  in  North Carolina.  ",1991
1573,1247,24,Mr. RIEGLE.," Madam President, this  is a historic juncture in Federal trans portation policy. Today, with construc tion of the Interstate Highway System  largely complete and many of our Na tion's oldest and  largest  transit sys tems upgraded, we are entering a new  era. The Intermodal Surface Transpor tation Efficiency Act of 1991 charts a  fresh and forward-looking approach to  transportation policy. As a conferee on  the bill, I would like to thank my col leagues who participated in  the con ference for all of their hard work. Fur thermore, I would like to commend all  of my colleagues for the high degree of  cooperation  demonstrated  between  Members on both  sides of  the aisle  which made this major initiative hap pen. The bill goes a  long way toward  renewing our Federal commitment to ward a strong national transportation  infrastructure and improving the state  of our economy. This $151 billion pack age will pump much needed Federal  dollars into local economies across the  Nation. The timing of this bill couldn't  be better-at a  time when millions of  Americans are feeling the pinch of the  recession.  Today we have  the opportunity  to  commit our Nation  to a coordinated  Federal  transportation  policy.  The  transit title will ensure that our com munities have the resources necessary  to reduce congestion, enhance the mo bility of transit-dependent populations,  and reduce our dependence on foreign  oil. I believe the highway title does a  better  job  than  the previous surface  transportation program in making sure  that all States receive a fair share of  Federal dollars. Both the highway and  transit dollars are urgently needed in  communities across  the Nation-such  as my home State of Michigan.  Most importantly the bill creates- for  the  first  time-a much  needed  mechanism to help the Federal Govern ment, States, and localities to look at  the big picture. The metropolitan plan ning provisions will provide a  formal  mechanism  for  cities and  states  to  strike an appropriate balance between  highways and transit needs. This bill  puts decision making into the hands of  the States and local communities who  best understand their own needs.  The transportation policy we develop  will have a direct impact on the qual ity of life of the American people for  years to come. This bill will enhance  our economic prosperity and competi tiveness, ensure adequate  investment  in our existing highways,  road and  transit infrastructure, and decrease the  congestion  in our cities and on our  roadways.  Madam President, I believe this bill  will promote  the continued develop ment and proper maintenance of our  national  transportation  network,  which in turn will improve the quality  of life for Americans  today and into  the next century.

1590,1351,24,Mr. NUNN.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today to join my colleague from Geor gia, Senator WYCHE FOWLER,  in intro ducing legislation to honor and assist  the centennial Olympic games being  held in Atlanta in the summer of 1996  by authorizing a special commemora tive coin. This is an exact counterpart  to a House bill already introduced by  Representative DOUG BARNARD, who is  the Georgia congressional delegation's  lead member on this issue.  This legislation follows the precedent  established when  the United States  last hosted the Olympics, in Los Ange les in 1984. As in 1984, we are establish ing a 2-year commemorative coin pro gram  to  culminate  in  the Olympic  year, with proceeds divided between  the Olympic Organizing Committee  and the U.S. Olympic Committee.  The 1984 Olympic coin helped make  the Los Angeles Olympics a  financial  success,  raising $73 million. The At lanta Committee  for  the  Olympic  games hopes  to raise a  total of $100  million with its commemorative coin,  a small but crucial element in its pro jected budget of Sl.2 billion.  Aside from its financial aspects, this  commemorative coin program provides  both American  citizens  and  inter national  supporters  of  the Olympic  movement a means of participating in  the centennial games.  From  the moment  last autumn  in  Tokyo when Atlanta  concluded  its  upset victory in  the bid for  the 1996  games,  there has been an exceptional  air of excitement about this event. It  has galvanized not just Atlanta but the  entire southeastern region. As the first  summer games ever held on  the east  coast of  the United States,  the 1996  games will be the most widely broad cast in history, and one of the most  heavily  attended, with more  than  150,000 people per day expected.  Mr. President, I urge my Senate col leagues  to express  their support  for  America's centennial games by  sup porting  establishment  of  this  com memorative coin program.   By Mr. KENNEDY:  S. 2135. A bill to amend the Federal  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to en hance the enforcement authority of the  Food and Drug Administration, and for  other purposes;  to  the Committee on  Labor and Human Resources.  FOOD, DRUG, COSMETIC, AND DEVICE  ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES ACT  ",1991
1591,1351,24,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, today  I am pleased  to  introduce  the Food,  Drug, Cosmetic and Device Enforce ment Authorities Act of 1991. The legis lation will finally provide the Food and  Drug Administration [FDA] with  the  same  enforcement  tools  granted  to  other regulatory agencies, and will en able the FDA to more effectively carry  out its critical responsibilities under  the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.  The FDA regulates products which  account for 25 cents of every dollar  spent in this country-a statistic about  the agency that is cited often. How ever, more  important than the sheer  volume of products subject  to FDA  oversight is the degree to which these  regulated products affect the lives of  every American in vital ways each day.  Ineffective oversight by the FDA ex poses  the public  to substantial risks  from unsafe or defective products.  The stark reality is that  the FDA  simply does not have  the necessary  means to enforce the law. The enforce ment provisions in the Food, Drug and  Cosmetic Act are more than 50 years  old. The enforcement authorities were  written prior to the first therapeutic  use of Penicillin, and have been ren dered obsolete by the development of  products unimagined half a  century  ago. The FDA has a unique mission as  both a scientific agency, and an agency  charged with consumer protection. The  FDA cannot fulfill its mandates with out enforcement authorities which give  it the ability to obtain essential infor mation concerning regulated products  in an efficient and timely manner.  Earlier this year the Edwards Com mittee, a blue ribbon panel of FDA ex perts,  criticized what  it called  the  FDA's mixed bag of enforcement tools  and  recommended  that ""the Agency  should be armed with the same tools  for all products that it regulates."" Last  year, passage of the Safe Medical De vices Act gave the Agency the ability  to  impose  administrative  civil  pen alties  for medical device violations.  However,  for  violations  relating  to  foods, drugs or cosmetics, FDA must  still rely solely on the harsh sanction  of criminal penalties, which is a severe  limitation of FDA's ability to institute  appropriate sanctions. Last year Con gress also provided FDA with the au thority to recall medical devices which  posed unacceptable risks, but FDA can not  institute mandatory  recalls  of  foods, drugs or cosmetics. The FDA has  record inspection authority to inspect  the records of drug and medical device  manufacturers, but that authority does  not extend to food or cosmetic facili ties.  In contrast to the FDA, the enforce ment authorities of other U.S.  regu latory agencies have been  improved  over time. For example, the FDA does  not have authority to subPoena docu ments  and witnesses  in  connection  with  investigations, unlike  the Envi ronmental Protection Agency, the Fed eral  Trade  Commission,  and  the  Consumer Product Safety Commission.  There is no reason for the FDA, with  its enormous responsibilities,  to have  enforcement  authorities  inferior  to  those of other regulatory agencies.  While there is an urgent need to in crease FDA's enforcement authorities,  the  regulated  industries have  raised  concerns about the scope of these au",1991

1593,1403,24,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  (The text of the amendment is print ed in today's RECORD under ""Amend ments Submitted."")  ",1991
1594,1403,24,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I rise in  strong  support  of  the Heal th Pro motion and Disease Prevention Amend ments of 1991. I want to commend the  distinguished chairman of  the Labor  and Human Resources Committee for  his continuing leadership in efforts to  improve  the health care available  to  Americans. I also want to thank him  for his willingness to work with me to  bring this major package of heal th pro motion and disease prevention initia tives  before  the Senate.  S.  1944  is  among the most important pieces of  health legislation the Senate will con sider this session.  Mr.  President,  I  believe  that  the  most fundamental flaw in our health  care system today is its preoccupation  with patching and mending and its vir tual neglect of prevention and health  promotion. What we really have is not  a health care system but a sick care  system. Over half of the $700 billion we  will spend this year on heal th care will  go to treat conditions that are prevent able. Yet, only a  tiny fraction, esti mated by some to be less than 1 per cent, of our health care budget is spent  on keeping people healthy and prevent ing the need for this expensive treat ment. As a result of this flaw, the qual ity and  length of the  lives of many  Americans are needlessly reduced and  billions of dollars are needlessly wast ed. We need to overhaul our sick care  system into an American health care  system of which we can all be proud.  This  takes us a  step further  toward  completing that weighty task.  I am very pleased that a number of  my ideas and components of my ""Pre vention First"" initiative are contained  in this bill. A major element is its re authorization of the Preventive Health  and Health Services block grant. This  important program is the backbone of  State and local public health efforts. It  funds a full range of key disease pre vention and heal th promotion services  provided to Americans in every State  and  locality-from  hypertension  screening,  to  health  education,  to  breast cancer  screening  to  smoking  cessation programs. S. 1944 would ex pand  and  strengthen  this  program,  building upon my  legislation of last  year,  the Health Objectives 2000 Act.  This legislation, signed into law by the  President, paved  the way  for  imple mentation of the National Health Pro motion and Disease Prevention Objec tives.  This part of S. 1944 first provides in creased  capacity  and  resources  to  States and localities to assist them in  achieving  the  Year  National  2000  Health Objectives, addressing improve ments in health status, risk reduction,  public  and  professional  awareness,  health services and protective meas ures, and surveillance and evaluations.  Second, it creates and develops and ef fective partnership of Federal, State,  and  local health agencies, voluntary  health organizations, and other health  groups,  including minority  commu nity-based  organizations,  to  develop  initiatives for preventing disease and  disability. Third, it enables States and  localities  to address national health  policy  issues. All of these provisions  will greatly improve our public heal th  system and  the health of Americans.  They are long overdue.  S. 1944 also incorporates S. 507,  the  Lead Poisoning Prevention Act, legis lation I introduced on behalf of myself  and a number of our colleagues. Inclu sion of S. 507 attacks the No. 1 prevent able disease among children-lead poi soning. Conservative  estimates  indi cate that more than 3.5 million Amer ican children  from all walks of  life  have dangerous levels of lead in their  blood. And we know  the devastating  impact lead poisoning can have on our  children. We know that even healthy  appearing children with modest  lead  elevations often display poor academic  performance,  low IQ scores,  impaired  hearing, unsatisfactory speech and lan guage  development,  and  disruptive  classroom behavior. A  recent  study  found that lead poisoned children are  seven times more likely to drop out of  school  before  graduating  from  high  school.  The costs of lead poisoning are stag gering and  the cost effectiveness of  screening for  it is clear. The annual  cost of remedial education and health  care needed as a  result of childhood  lead poisoning alone totals over $1 bil lion. Screening and early detection for  lead poisoning saves by more that 50fold the immediate cost of treatment.  Yet, there is a sorrowful lack of aware ness regarding the perils of lead poison ing,  the benefits of screening and the  resulting  preventive  and  treatment  measures that can be taken to combat  this pro bl em.  S. 507 attacks this problem by ex panding support to States and  local ities to screen children, establishing a  national education program to increase  awareness  among  children,  parents,  teachers,  and  health  professionals  about  lead  poisoning,  developing  a  more cost effective accurate  test  to  screen for lead poisoning, and finally to  make certain that the actions of dif ferent Federal agencies responding to  the problem of lead poisoning are prop erly coordinated. These steps will save  lives and money.  Mr. President, S.  1944  also  incor porates  the provisions of S. 505,  an other component of my ""Prevention  First""  legislative package. This bill  would change the name of our Nation's  flagship Federal agency on prevention,  the Centers for Disease Control [CDC],  to the Centers for Disease Prevention  and Control [CDC]. This change appro priately recognizes CDC's central role  in our national efforts to prevent dis ease and disability and will give great er national visibility to these efforts.  This  simple  change will  also  dem onstrate our commitment to increasing  the focus of our efforts in heal th care  on prevention and elevate prevention  to its appropriate high level within the  structure of government health care  programs. I want to commend CDC for  their strong work and commitment to  improving the public health. I want to  especially commend Dr. Bill Roper who  I think is doing a fine job heading up  CDC. I am very pleased to have his sup port for making this change.  I have been placing top priority in  my capacity as chairman of the Senate  subcommittee that funds health, edu cation, and social services programs on  programs that prevent disease and dis ability. In the fiscal year 1992 funding  bill which  is now  in  the President's  hands, we have provided significant in creases in funding  for prenatal care,  chronic and environmental disease pre vention, disability prevention,  child hood  immunizations, and many other  critical preventive programs. At my  urging,  and particularly  relevant  to  the bill before us today, the fiscal year  1992 funding bill contains a more than  tripling of funds aimed at lead poison ing prevention and a  40-percent  in crease  in  the prevention block grant  program.  So through these appropriations and  through adoption of  this authorizing  legislation, we are making a downpay ment on what needs to be done to turn  our ""sick"" care system into an Amer ican ""health"" care system of which we  can be proud.  Mr. President, I again commend you  for bringing this legislation before us. I  hope that we can move without hesi tation to send it to the President for  final approval.   ",1991

1613,1429,24,Mr. FORD.," Mr. President, I ask that  the Chair lay before the Senate a mes sage from the House of Representatives  on S. 1462.  The PRESIDING OFFICER  laid be fore the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:  Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S.  1462) entitled ""An Act to amend the Commu nications Act of 1934  to prohibit certain  practices  involving  the  use  of  telephone  equipment"",  do  pass with  the  following  amendment: Strike out all after the enacting  clause, and insert:  s. 1462  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ""Telephone  Consumer Protection Act of 1991''.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  The Congress finds that:  (1) The use of the  telephone  to market  goods and services to the home and other  businesses is now pervasive due  to the in creased use of cost-effective telemarketing  techniques.  (2)  Over  30,000  businesses  actively  telemarket goods and services to business  and residential customers.  (3) More  than 300,000 solicitors call more  than 18,000,000 Americans every day.  (4) Total United States sales generated  through  telemarketing  amounted  to  $435,000,000,000 in 1990, a more than four-fold  increase since 1984.  (5) Unrestricted  telemarketing, however,  can be an intrusive invasion of privacy and,  when an emergency or medical assistance  telephone line is seized, a risk to public r,afe ty.  (6) Many consumers are outraged ov1;r the  proliferation of intrusive, nuisance calls to  their homes from telemarketers.  (7) Over half the States now have statutes  restricting various uses of the telephone for  marketing,  but  telemarketers  can  evade  their prohibitions through interstate oper ations;  therefore, Federal law is needed  to  control residential telemarketing practices.  (8) The Constitution does not prohibit re strictions on commercial telemarketing so licitations.  (9) Individuals' privacy rights, public safe ty  interests, and commercial  freedoms of  speech and trade must be balanced in a way  that protects the privacy of individuals and  permits legitimate telemarketing practices.  (10) Evidence compiled by the Congress in dicates that residential telephone subscrib ers consider automated or prerecorded tele phone calls, regardless of the content or the  initiator of the message,  to be a nuisance  and an invasion of privacy.  (11) Technologies that might allow con sumers to avoid receiving such calls are not  universally available,  are costly,  are un likely to be enforced, or place an inordinate  burden on the consumer.  (12)  Banning  such  automated  or  prerecorded telephone calls to the home, ex cept when the receiving party consents to re ceiving the call or when such calls are nec essary in an emergency situation affecting  the health and safety of the consumer, is the  only effective means of protecting telephone  consumers from  this nuisance and privacy  invasion.  (13) While  the evidence presented to  the  Congress  indicates  that  automated  or  prerecorded calls are a nuisance and an inva sion of privacy, regardless of the type of call,  the Federal Communications Commission  should have  the  flexibility  to design dif ferent rules for those types of automated or  prerecorded calls that it finds are not consid ered a nuisance or invasion of privacy, or for  noncommercial  calls,  consistent with  the  free speech protections embodied in the First  Amendment of the Constitution.  (14) Businesses also have complained to the  Congress and  the Federal Communications  Commission that automated or prerecorded  telephone calls are a nuisance, are an inva sion of privacy, and interfere with interstate  commerce.  (15) The Federal Communications Commis sion should consider adopting reasonable re strictions on automated or prerecorded calls  to businesses as well as to the home, consist ent with  the constitutional protections of  free speech.
