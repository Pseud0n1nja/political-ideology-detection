0,Senate,102,-0.301,15,3,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, I rise  to  inform my colleagues  that  today  marks the 2,153d day that Terry Ander son has been held captive in Lebanon.  Shortly, Simon & Schuster will re lease a book by Terry Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, entitled ""Forgotten.""  Her narrative  recounts anxious mo ments, tremendous obstacles and, yes,  triumphs. It tells of people who have  facilitated and people who have ob structed her admirable crusade to free  her brother. Let us pray that her ef forts will soon culminate in the release  of Terry Anderson.  Mr. President, an excerpt from her  book appears in the February 11 edi tion  of Newsweek magazine.  I  ask  unanimous consent that this excerpt be  printed in the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection, the excerpt  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From Newsweek, Feb. 11, 1991]  [Book excerpt]  FORGOTTEN  (By Peggy Say and Peter Knobler)  While my brother Terry Anderson was run ning around the world as a Marine, a combat  correspondent in Vietnam, and a  journalist  for the Associated Press in South Africa and  Beirut, I was busy raising two kids, getting  divorced, remarried, moving around. I waited  tables for years and then got into cooking  and tending bar.  I never did know Terry all that well. He  was seven years younger and sort of a non entity in our family as a kid. Quiet, well be haved, he managed to carve a place for him self that nobody much noticed.  In 1979 we were sitting in the dead Florida  quiet of my house, catching up. I asked him  how he felt about what he was doing. He  started talking about his life and his work,  one and the same to him. Terry was caught  up in the spirit of his job; he had the great  ability to influence people by what he wrote,  and he took that responsibility seriously. I  liked his commitment to his work, his moral  standards.  In 1984, Terry came home on leave again but cocky, arrogant, kind of cold. I did not  like what Lebanon had done to my brother.  Once he got back to Lebanon, Terry would  call in Sundays,  just to chat, and I began  trying to get him home. He was telling me  the latest of his adventure stories when I  broke in. ""Terry, the joke is over. It's time  to get out of there.""  ""You don't understand,"" he told me. ""They  don't  kidnap  journalists.  It  would  be  counter-productive. These people need me; I  tell their story to the world. That's my job  and they know it.""  Less than a week later, three men armed  with automatic weapons wrestled Terry An derson out of a car as he was returning from  a tennis game.  AS MUCH NOISE AS POSSIBLE  A week after Terry was taken, we got a  call from the State Department saying they  wanted to send a representative to visit us.  ""What should I do?"" I asked the man.  ""It's not my place to advise you,"" he told  me, ""but if I were you,  I would make as  much noise as possible. The State Depart ment's official position is to tell you not to  go to Washington, to keep a low profile. But  you get your behind up there. Go see every one you can see. Make them look you in the  eye, so that every time they think of Terry  Anderson, they'll see your face.""  The Associated Press decided  to arrange  and pay for a three-day Washington blitz by  Terry's Lebanese fiancee, Madeleine, my sis ter Judy and me. We were met, chaperoned  and pointed in all the right directions by an  AP  representative,  and  coached on  each  meeting: ""You've only got one line and you  stick to it: Your brother is a hostage and you  want him out. How can they help you, what  advice can they give you?""  We saw  the Algerians,  the Germans,  the  Japanese, the Syrians. I'd never met anyone  from any of those countries before. I had a  hard time keeping them straight on a map. I  was absorbing everything as fast as I could,  but my head was buzzing.  Our chief contact at the State Department  was a man named Bob Oakley. He was head  of the Office of Counter-Terrorism.  We knew that Terry had been kidnapped by  Islamic Jihad, specifically by a man named  !mad Mughniyah, a member of the Shiite  fundamentalist group called the Hezbollah.  The Islamic Jihad had, in return for the re lease of the American hostages, demanded  the release of seventeen Arab prisoners being  held in Kuwait. The State Department and  anyone even vagu~ly familiar with the situa tion over there, knew that the only prisoner  the Hezbollah was really interested in was  Mughniyah's brother-in-law, who had been  sentenced to death for terrorism but had his  sentence commuted to life in prison. The sit uation seemed obvious. ""Why can't you talk  to Kuwait,"" I asked Oakley, ""and see if they  are willing to deal?""  ""Oh, Peggy,"" he said as he leaned back in  his chair, ""we couldn't possibly do that. We  don't interfere in the internal politics of an other country.""  ""Excuse me?"" I had a hard time with that  one. ""My tax dollars are financing rebels in  Nicaragua and you are going to sit there and  tell me that we don't interfere in the inter nal politics of another country?""  Oakley  just shrugg~d his  shoulders. He  seemed embarrassed.  Then  came  the TWA  hijacking.  TWA  Flight No. 847 was going from Cairo to Rome  with 153 passengers, including 104 Americans,  when it was hijacked by two Lebanese Shi ites. At first President Reagan took a hard  line, saying there would be no concessions,  no negotiations, no linkage between the pas sengers on TWA 847 and any prisoners held  anywhere in the world.  Nineteen days into the hijacking, at one in  the morning, I got a call from the State De partment. The TWA hostages were supposed  to get out the next day. In exchange for their  freedom  the Israelis had agreed-of course  with U.S. blessings, though we've never ad mitted it-to release  three hundred Shiite  political prisoners. Our State Department li aison, Jackie Ratner, said, ""Peggy, we have  reason  to believe  that when  the hostages  reach Damascus, Terry and the others will  be with them.""  Terry's friends in Beirut were monitoring  the situation. One called me the same night.  ""Peggy, you've been screwed. Reagan made a  deal and he left out the seven. Reagan could  not wait for the seven."" The President didn't  want to be embarrassed one moment longer.  The State Department used  to send me  photocopies of various newspaper articles,  mostly concerning Terry. One day I  turned  one of those copies over and saw penciled no tations on the back. It was somebody's notes  on hostage Peter Kilburn! They were deal  points.  According to these notes we knew where  Kilburn was and who had him, and the cap tors wanted money. It was going  to be a  cash-for-hostage  ransom-that  simple.  So  much  for not negotiating with  terrorists.  What was even more disturbing was that the  exchange was within  two  days  of being  made-and  then Ronald Reagan  bombed  ",1991
1,Senate,102,0.272,67,3,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President, spending  for health care services in the United  States now exceeds over one-half a tril lion dollars, or $660 billion, constitut ing 13.5 percent of our gross national  product. As  for  the Federal Govern ment, over 15 percent of  the budget  goes  toward health spending. Health  care costs continue to rise at a  rate  much higher  than  that of  inflation.  Medical costs grew 10.5 percent from  1987 to 1988, and 11.1 percent from 1988  to 1989. The costs of hospital care are  the  largest  component,  compr1smg  nearly 40 percent of the mammoth fig ure. Today, I am reintroducing a bill to  help limit these rapidly rising costs.  Of course, rising health care costs af fect virtually every American, because  we all need professional health care at  one time or another. Moreover, even if  you are perfectly healthy, rising health  care costs affect you as a Federal tax payer, because the Federal Government  funds approximately 30 percent of all  health care spending in our Nation.  Last  year,  the  Permanent  Sub committee on Investigations, on which  I serve as ranking member, held hear ings on a relatively new and rapidly ex panding type of business, known as rev enue recovery. Revenue recovery firms  are  companies which  contract with  hospitals  to recover money owed  the  hospital for services rendered but not  billed. These  companies operate na tionwide. PSI heard evidence that some  of  these  companies were conducting  unfair audits on medical bills. Many of  the audits embellished unbilled charges  while down playing, or ignoring, the in stances where the hospital had charged  too much. In short, too often revenue  recovery  firms are not presenting a  clean, fair bill.  The hearing revealed many aspects of  revenue recovery practices that were  less than ethical, but the one key fea ture  that disturbs me  is  their com pensation system. Most revenue recov ery firms are compensated for their au dits with a percentage of the so-called  lost charges they recover for the hospital. Therefore, they have a vested in terest in the results of their audits. I  am concerned about the incentives to  cheat which are created by the contin gency  fee arrangements under which  many revenue recovery firms operate. I  am equally concerned about insurance  company auditors who are paid a per centage of what they are able to knock  off a hospital bill. Both arrangements  potentially affect the impartiality and  independence of the auditor.  My bill, which is called the Fair Au diting Act of 1991, does away with per centage-based reimbursement for audi tors. The bill requires the Secretary of  Health and Human Services to promul gate regulations  to prohibit any hos pital, medical clinic or insurance com pany from paying their auditors on a  percentage-based  compensation  sys tem. It is a simple concept, but it does  away with biased auditing by either  health care providers or insurers.  Now I recognize there is a legitimate  role for medical auditors whether they  work for  insurers or hospitals.  I cer tainly don't suggest that every com pany involved in the revenue recovery  business  is operating  improperly.  In deed,  several major accounting firms  have  revenue  recovery  sidelines,  al though I should add that the business  practices of these accounting firms dif fer considerably from the practices of  the revenue recovery firms which were  the subject of the PSI hearings. More over, many hospitals are  facing dif ficult financial times, and they deserve  every penny which  is honestly owed  them.  The Federal Government pays more  than $8 billion per year as its share of  health insurance premiums for Federal  workers. Those premiums are experi ence based. That is,  if the  insurance  companies' pay outs increase, the pre miums they charge increase. Moreover,  the  long-standing  battle  betweeen  health providers and health  insurers  carries with  it heavy administrative  costs. And who do you think ends up  paying the price for these two sides to  battle it out? The effect is ultimately  the same, whether  insurance compa nies or patients are being gouged. It  drives up costs. In the end, you can bet  that it is the consumer who feels the  pinch, whether it is through an inflated  hospital bill or an inflated premi urn.  I want to repeat the hope which I ex pressed last year that these two indus tries will  synchronize  their opposing  energies  and  regulate  themselves.  I  have been in touch with the American  Hospital Association, the Health Insur ance Association of America and  the  Healthcare Financial Management As sociation, urging  that  they work  to gether to formulate medical auditing  guidelines.  I believe  this approach  is  preferable to compulsory legislation. I  know that these groups have held sev eral meetings and are planning future  meetings in an attempt to develop in",1991
2,Senate,102,-0.297,80,3,Mr. SANFORD.," Mr. President, vir tually every hour of the day we can  watch our televisions and listen to our  radios to find news and information on  the war with Iraq. Our military com manders are reporting great successes  thus far. That success is largely cred ited  to  their extraordinary prepara tion. As the war progresses, the Nation  and  the Congress begin adjusting  to  having hundreds of thousands of our  Armed Forces committed to the effort.  It  is never easy  for  families  to say  good-bye to members going off to war.  The  images of tearful farewells have  been etched in our minds much longer  than those of successful military mis sions brought into our lives from tele vision.  As we come to grips with being ana tion at war, we must fix our attention  on its effects domestically. The impact  of the large military deployment of the  Middle East is also being felt in the ci vilian communities surrounding large  military installations. All of the net works  have  had  stories  from  Fort  Bragg, home of the 18th Airborne Corps  and  the 82d Airborne Division; Camp  Lejeune, 2nd Marine Division; Cherry  Point, home of the 2d Marine Air Wing;  Seymour Johnson, AFB, home of the  4th Tactical Fighter Wing; and Pope  AFB, home of the 317th Tactical Airlift  Wing. C-SP AN had a special on a Na tional Guard unit from the mountains  of North Carolina deployed  to Saudi  Arabia. You are now starting to see,  hear, and read stories about Fayette ville, Havelock, Goldsboro, and Spring  Lake.  All of these are towns and cities in  North Carolina that have one or more  in  ",1991
3,Senate,102,-0.387,93,3,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, as  chairman of the Committee on Veter ans' Affairs, I regret that I was unable  personally to introduce S. 386, the pro posed Persian Gulf War Veterans' As sistance Act of 1991.  I  am honored,  however, that my good friend and col league on the committee, Mr. DECON CINI, has agreed to introduce this im portant measure for me. I am pleased  to note that we are joined by the fol lowing  cosponsors,  committee mem bers Senators ROCKEFELLER, GRAHAM,  AKAKA,  and THuRMOND,  and Senators  MIKULSKI, and JEFFORDS.  Mr. President, this bill would amend  title 38, United States Code, in order to  reflect  the occurrence of the Persian  Gulf war and to help ensure that cer tain Department of Veterans Affairs  programs respond adequately and ap propriately to the needs of veterans of  this period of war.  Specifically, this bill contains 10 sub stantive provisions that would:  First, add the Persian Gulf war as a  period of war, beginning August 2, 1990,  the date that Iraq invaded the country  of Kuwait. The period would end on a  date to be determined by Presidential  proclamation or by law.    Second, open to veterans and spouses  of veterans with  service during  the  Persian Gulf war the VA pension pro gram-a needs-based benefit for war time veterans who have non-service connected disabilities rated totally dis abling and the needy survivors of war time veterans.  Third, make applicable  to Persian  Gulf war veterans a  presumption of  service-connection, for  the purpose of  receiving VA medical care,  for  those  who develop an active psychosis within  2 years after discharge or release from  active military service  that included  service during a period of war.  Fourth, provide Persian Gulf war vet erans with  the  same  eligibility  for  medicines from VA that other wartime  veterans have when they are receiving  additional VA  non-service-connected  disability compensation, or  increased  VA  non-service-connected  disability  pension,  by  reason of being perma nently housebound or in need of regu lar aid and attendance.  Fifth, provide eligibility for readjust ment counseling through VA Vet Cen ters to post-Vietnam-era veterans who  served on active duty in an area at a  time during which hostilities occurred  in that area. This would  include not  only service in the Persian Gulf war  theater of operations but in other areas  ",1991
4,House,102,0.017,119,3,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker, I  ask unanimous consent that all Mem bers may have 5  legislative days  in  which  to  revise and extend  their re marks, and include extraneous matter,  on H.R. 232, the bill now under consid eration.  ",1991
5,House,102,-0.315,119,3,Mr. STAGGERS.," Mr. Speaker, it is  with mixed emotions that I rise today  in support of H.R. 232, a bill containing  the  best  provisions  concerning  the  homeless which appeared in H.R. 5002  and S. 2100 as well as certain housing  and memorial affairs provisions.  This measure is the result of consid erable hard work and effort on the part  of many. No one, Mr. Speaker, deserves  more credit than the gentleman from  Mississippi, the chairman of the Veter ans' Affairs Committee, SONNY MONT GOMERY.  I applaud his efforts this ses sion to so quickly move on legilation  in behalf of America's veterans which  had been agreed to in principle by the  other body but upon which action was  prevented during the 101st Congress. I  also want to compliment the ranking  minority member of  the committee,  Mr. BoB STUMP of Arizona; and the gen tleman from Indiana, Mr. DAN BURTON,  who is ranking minority member of the  Subcommittee on Housing and Memo rial Affairs.  At the outset, I wish to state that  the chairman and  I have agreed  to  amend the bill to eliminate the prohi bition of certain loan sales for the next  three years  since CBO has attached  such a high direct spending cost of $92  million in the first three years. Iron ically, there is no money being spent  here. Instead, DV A is allowed to collect  principal  and  interest  on  vendee  loans-thereby increasing revenues  to  the guaranty and  indemnity fund.  It  should be emphasized that the sale of  these assets is not necessary to operate  the program.  One of  the  reasons  that  the Loan  Guaranty Program has needed appro priations is due to the fact the OMB  was making DV A sell their loan assets  prematurely, thereby depleting the at tractive parts of  the  loan portfolio  which could have generated revenues.  We will be revisiting this issue in my  subcommittee.  This is a perfect example of why I  didn't  support  this  type  of  score keeping method on the floor. The  other classic example of how  some thing appears to be something it's not  is the direct spending cost associated  with providing transitional housing to  certain homeless veterans. According  to the CBO estimate, this is $5 million  the first year and $1 million thereafter.  Under this legislation, we're not spend ing a single penny from taxpayer dol lars. All of the money comes out of the  general post fund which is made up of  gifts, donations and bequests  to aid  veterans. If this committee is going to  be prohibited from  requiring DVA  to  spend  funds  to help needy homeless  ",1991
6,House,102,-0.418,132,3,Mr. MOAKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, for pur poses of debate only, I yield 5 minutes  to  the distinguished gentleman  from  New York [Mr. RANGEL], chairman of  the Select Committee  on Narcotics  Abuse and Control, a Member who has  publicly been congratulated by Gov ernor Cuomo in his State of the State  speech. I am very happy that he is still  our chairman of the Select Committee  on Narcotics Abuse and Control.  ",1991
7,House,102,-0.514,132,3,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker let me  thank the chairman and the members  of the Rules Committee for reporting  out this rule for the three select com mittees, and also the Members of the  House and the chairman and the sub committee chairmen for  the coopera tion  that we have  received over  the  years. During the time that I have been  chairman, and even before  that, we  have not had any partisan differences  on the Select Committee on Narcotics  Abuse and Control. We have worked to gether in not trying to supersede the  legislative authorities of the standing  committees, but  to work  and hold  hearings  in areas  that  their agendas  would not allow them to do.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in  support of House Resolution 51 which  will establish the Select Committee on  Narcotics Abuse and Control  in  the  102d Congress.  The  reconstruction  of  the  Select  Committee  on Narcotics Abuse  and  Control will demonstrate the continu ing commitment of the House of Rep resentatives  to  comprehensive  over sight of the war on drugs.  In the lOlst Congress, the select com mittee held 29 hearings and conducted  5 study missions  to  review narcotics  control efforts in key drug producing  and  trafficking countries and to par ticipate in a major international anti drug conference. We  issued 11 reports,  and we  supplemented our own  inves tigations with independent GAO stud ies, releasing 5 GAO reports on various  aspects of the drug problem.  Among our other activities, we have  conducted vigorous oversight of the na tional drug control strategy mandated  by  the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988,  looked  into  the root causes of drug  abuse, examined  the effectiveness of  drug abuse treatment, documented the  serious overcrowding  in our prisons  which is largely drug-related, focused  attention on the reemergence of meth amphetamine and  the  emergence of  smokable,  crystal methamphetamine  or ice, reviewed the impact of drugs on  American business, and monitored with  growing concern the crisis that drug  abuse  and drug-related violence  are  creating in hospital emergency rooms  across the country.  The Narcotics Committee  and  its  members proposed legislation and sup ported  the  legislative efforts of  the  standing committees on a broad array  of drug issues during the last Congress  including  correctional  alternatives,  funding for drug treatment and preven tion programs, drug treatment policy,  drug paraphernalia, poppers, ice and  methamphetamine,  drug-free  schools,  money  laundering,  interdiction  im provements,  hospital  emergency  rooms,  and  international  narcotics  control. As the only committee in the  Congress devoted exclusively  to com prehensive oversight of drug problems,  the select committee has served as a  highly  visible  and  accessible  focal  point for drug concerns in the House.  We have responded to Members' needs  for information on critical drug issues  through newsletters, dear colleagues,  reports, and other means, serving as a  narcotics  clearinghouse  in  the Con gress.  In the past several weeks, we have  heard a lot of good news about the drug  problem. The 1990 household survey on  drug abuse, conducted by the National  Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA] and re leased in December, shows that casual  use of drugs by most groups of Ameri cans continues to decline. NIDA's high  school senior survey, released 2 weeks  ago, continues to show that drug use in  this benchmark population-those stu dents who make  it  to  their  senior  year-is declining or leveling off. Pub lic attitudes against drugs are also  hardening.  These are encouraging signs. All of  us  in  the House  can be  justifiably  proud that the antidrug campaign of  the past several years, which we helped  initiate with  the  landmark antidrug  abuse acts of 1986 and 1988,  is having  some positive effects.  We must not, however, be misled into  thinking that these welcome develop ments constitute victory in the war on  drugs. At a  time when events in the  Persian Gulf and economic woes at  home occupy center stage, it may be  tempting to drop  the curtain on  the  drug war. But we have barely begun the  battle. We cannot afford complacency  at this time in our antidrug efforts. We  need to intensify, not relax, our cam paign against drugs.  Drug abuse and drug trafficking re main  serious  national  and  inter national  problems,  and  the  con sequences of these activities continue  to inflict enormous harm upon our so ciety. Rather than patting ourselves on  the back for the limited successes we  have achieved, we need to rollup our  sleeves  and  tackle  the  intractable,  that govern hardcore drug problems  ment surveys miss.  Middle-class Americans may be aban doning recreational drug use, but mil lions of Americans  remain mired  in  drug addiction and drug dependency.  Too often, these victims of drug abuse  are the most disadvantaged among us,  those who  have  no  opportunity, no  hope, nothing  to  lose-the homeless,  the umemployed, high school dropouts,  arrestees and prisoners, African-Ameri cans and other minority populations and often they live in urban commu nities ravaged by drugs and drug crime.  Despite some evidence of temporary  disruptions in cocaine supplies, drugs  are readily available, cheap, and po tent.  lllici t street sales of drugs remain a  $100 billion industry a year.  The most recent rock bottom esti mate of the economic costs of drugs to  society  is about $60 billion annually  which does not include  the financial  impact of the crack and drug-related  AIDS epidemics and many drug-related  business losses.  Worldwide production of heroin and  cocaine continues to set new records,  and a  thriving domestic marijuana in dustry has grown up to replace falling  marijuana imports. Powerful drug car tels  are  expanding  their  networks  worldwide and  joining alliances with  other criminal organizations. Traffick ers continue to threaten the economic  and political stability of democratic  governments in this hemisphere.  Health care professionals and law en forcement officials do not report seeing  a  lessening of the drug crisis in our  country.  In  the past 3 years,  cities  around the Nation are reporting high  rates of AIDS,  tuberculosis, hepatitis  A, kidney ailments, gonorrhea, syphi lis, and communicable childhood  ill nesses.  These  epidemics-some  of  which many  in our health establish ment  believed we  conquered  years  ago-can be  traced  to  the onset of  crack and chronic drug use in the inner  city and the resulting catastrophic im pact on the structure of the family and  the drain on  limited health care re sources.  This health care crisis can be most  dramatically  seen  in hospital  emer gency room and pediatric care wards.  Emergency care providers have  testi fied before the select committee that  they have seen an increase in homi cides,  gunshot wounds,  violent  as saults, opportunistic illnesses, a short age of beds, and other complications  from  the drug crisis. Pediatric wards  across  the country are being swollen  with  boarder  babies  afflicted with  AIDS or addicted to drugs and aban doned by parents who are either unable  or unfit to care for them.  Our  courts, prisons,  and  jails are  overcrowded  with  defendants  and  immates, many of them there for drug related  crimes. Treatment programs  ",1991

11,,102,-0.499,223,3,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr. Speaker,  on Monday morning, January 28, I began my  day with a meeting with students at Brown  Junior High School in Newton, MA. During the  previous week the students had expressed in terest in making their views known on the cur rent war in the Persian Gulf. After a discussion  with school administrators, they agreed to do  this in the form of a petition, which they would  then present  to me, as  the Member of  the  House of Representatives from that area, and  which I would have a chance to discuss with  them in an open meeting.  I did that. Several of the students presented  the petitions to me, with the names that they  had gathered, and a brief explanation of their  views.  I  then had a chance  to  respond  to  questions and comments from the entire stu dent body  for approximately one-half hour.  The text of the petition is a short and very di rect one. Obviously,  it does not reflect all of  those who go to Brown Junior High but it does  stand for the views of a large number of the  students, who went to considerable trouble to  see that these views were expressed.  I congratulate both the students and the ad ministration and faculty of Brown Junior High  for coming  together  in discussions to  find a  constructive and healthy way in which the stu dents could express their views.  I admire the  initiative of  those who gathered signatures  from their fellow students and I admire as well  the care they took to express their views in a  balanced and mature way. Members will note,  Mr. Speaker, that this petition which was cir culated by young people who were seeking to  express  their preference  for sanctions over  war at this point contains at its onset a strong  statement of support  for America's soldiers.  And  I was  impressed  that  the buttons  that  some of the people at the school were wear ing to express their opposition to the fighting  in the Middle East contained an equally promi nent decoration of opposition to Saddam Hus sein's brutal invasion of Kuwait.  Mr. Speaker, Members will  in varying de grees agree and disagree with the views the  students expressed, but  I think all Members  will join me in expressing our appreciation that  these young people showed  the confidence  they have in our democratic system by choos ing to express their views  in this way.  I was  pleased to be able to contribute to this expres sion by attending the meeting and discussing  this matter with them. The students with whom  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  I spoke were intelligent and well informed and  I believe that all of those at Brown Junior High  who participated  in  this are entitled  to be  proud of the way in which they conducted their  part in our democratic debate.  Mr. Speaker, I insert the text of that petition  here:  PETITION  This petition shows that the students of  Brown Jr. High School support the soldiers  in the Middle East and prefer sanctions and  peace to war.  Mr. Speaker, the total of students and fac ulty who signed  this petition  is  in  the hun dreds,  representing a significant portion of  those at the school, although there are obvi ously students at the school who disagree with  this viewpoint.

12,,102,0.492,223,3,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker,  I measure a  man according to how much he has given of  himself to his community. By  that standard,  Rev. Ernest Smith is a giant.  Reverend Smith  is  retiring as minister of  New Lebanon, NY Congregation Church, a  post he has held since September 1970.  Mr. Speaker, the New Lebanon Congrega tional Church is not only a place of worship,  it  is a monument to Reverend Smith's  faith  and dedication. He paid  the mortgage, built  the  new  steeple, and  finished  the  church  basement. Other projects, such as  installing  the new  roof, septic systems, windows,  fur naces, and an organ, building  the Sunday  School  rooms, and blacktopping  the parking  lot might not have been completed without his  leadership.  But his service has not been limited to his  ministry,  considerable  as  that  service  has  been.  As the town historian, he is currently writing  this history of New Lebanon. He served as  chairman of  the Governor Tilden Monument  Restoration Committee. He raised $40,000 to  restore  the decaying burial monument in  the  Cemetery of the Evergreens.  Reverend Smith is chaplain of the Masonic  Lodge, and president of the Taconic and Leb anon Valley  Association  of Churches. As  president of the Lions' Club, he used his prov en  talents  to  raise $65,000  for  the Joseph  Hooper Free Library, of which is a trustee.  He has written  three volumes of Lebanon  Valley Tales, a total of 163 tales. He served  as a State  legislator  in Maine  from 1960 to  1964, and a registered lobbyist for all Protes tant churches in Maine from 1964 to 1966.  Reverend Smith was born in Corinna, north  central Maine on February 17, 1922. He be came a minister in  the Church of the Naza rene  in 1945, and started seven Nazarene  Churches in New England.  He is married to Rev. Astrid Smith, herself  also a Nazarene minister. They have five chil dren, Brenda, David, Janice, Stephen, and  3281  Philip; seven grandchildren; and one great grandchild.  As you can see, Mr. Speaker, Rev. Ernest  Smith has led a life full of achievements and  service. It is therefore fitting that he should be  honored at a retirement dinner on Saturday,  February 23.  Mr. Speaker,  let us pay our own  tribute  today  to Rev. Ernest Smith, a pillar of his  community, his church, and his country.  FRANK J. MILLER  HON. EDWARD F.

13,,102,-0.304,223,3,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, Late last year,  northeast Ohio lost one of its most valued citi zens, Frank J. Miller. Frank was a prominent  member of the  labor movement and also a  leader in our community.  Frank grew up as a second generation op erating  engineer. He  quickly moved  from  crane operator to positions as a business rep resentative  and  special  representative with  local 18. The union was quick  to  recognize  Frank's great skills and abilities and made him  vice president and  then general manager of  local18.  In his role as trustee and chairman of local  18's pension  fund, Frank  revolutionized  the  pension process and provided extraordinary  long-term security for the members of local 18.  In  addition,  Frank  was  instrumental  in  strengthening  the education and safety  fund  which provides scholarships for the children of  the union members.  Frank's desire to see  the  labor movement  succeed led him to play a key role in both re gional  and  international  unions. Here  too,  Frank excelled. He served as general vice  president of the International, vice president of  the Ohio State Building  and Construction  Trades Council and secretary-treasurer of the  North Central States conference.  Frank also dedicated his life to public serv ice. His career serves as a terrific example of  a citizen who always strived to give back to  his community. As a member of the Ohio High  Speed Rail Authority, Frank was able to help  move  the high speed rail  legislation through  the State legislature. In addition, he played a  vital role in developing Ohio's current highway  system.  Fortunately, through his service in his union  and for our government, and his love for fam ily and  friends, Frank Miller left his mark on  many of us. He will be missed and will always  be remembered.  A  TRIBUTE  TO  MICHAEL  NAGAMOTO AND RICHARD BEN NETT  HON.

19,Senate,102,-0.396,288,3,Mr. ADAMS.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing legislation that would  allow for  the partial privatization of  one of the United States most techno logically advanced  test reactors,  the  fast flux test facility in the State of  Washington.  I join with my colleagues, SID MORRI SON, who has introduced a companion  bill in  the House of Representatives,  and Senator SLADE (',.ORTON, who is co sponsoring this important piece of leg islation for our State.  It is very important that I speak to  this  legislation,  and  the  commer cialization of the FFTF reactor, be cause the privatization of this reactor  in Washington State is a step toward  moving ourselves away from weapons  production  and  into  advanced  tech nology.  I am pleased to put forth this legisla tion, but distressed that it is needed. It  is needed because the owner of the fast  flux test facility, the U.S. Department  of Energy, is eager to shut this facility  down; very eager,  in  fact,  seeing as  they decimated the 1992 FFTF funding.  For the next year,  the Department  has  requested  only  $28 million  for  FFTF. This represents a dramatic and  potentially devastating reduction from  the $84 million I and others fought so  hard to secure in last year's appropria tions bill.  This reactor is important, and it is  important from a whole series of view points involving the environment and  involving  the manner  in which our  technology can and should be used for  means other than destructive means.  The FFTF is clean, safe, and capable  of conducting substantial testing and  isotope production into the next cen tury. The FFTF has been acclaimed  internationally,  and  praised by  the  DOE internal reviews.  Still,  the Department  of Energy  wants to shut it down. This is a  ter ribly shortsighted position, and it is  disturbing and inexcusable. Why does  the Department of Energy spend bil lions refurbishing decrepit reactors at  Savannah River and yet walk away  from  its only modern  test  reactor?  What about the administration's pro fessed concern about U.S. high  tech nology?  In  the  face  of DOE's decision  to  defund the FFTF facility, the Washing ton delegation is introducing this bill.

20,Senate,102,0.299,301,3,Mr. SEYMOUR.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce legislation that is a  first step to ameliorate the California  drought.  My State is suffering its fifth year of  drought. In fact, some parts in Califor nia have felt drought conditions for 7  years. This year,  the drought has de nied the State 75 percent of its average  rainfall. Many of my State's major res ervoirs are bone dry. In fact, Folsom  Reservoir, which was at 34 percent of  capacity last year, is now at 15 percent  of capacity.  The attendant effects on my State  are enormous. California's $18 billion  agricultural economy  is now  scram bling to find water to prevent its or chards and vines from dying outright.  In the urban and suburban areas, resi dents are rationing their water use se verely.  I expect to be heard from again on  this issue. I plan to introduce several  bills that will ease the effects of this  drought. But I rise today to announce  two steps. Mr. President, I rise today  to  introduce  legislation  that will  amend the 1911 Warren Act to extend  facilities operated by  the Bureau of  Reclamation to other uses such as for  domestic, municipal, and fish and wild life  purposes. This will  correct  an  anomaly of Federal  law which  cur rently prohibits Bureau of Reclamation  facilities from being utilized except for  specified contract and agricultural pur poses.  In my State, this will promote the  more efficient use of Federal facilities.   It will share Federal Bureau of Rec lamation facilities with municipalities,  which are heavily  impacted by  the  drought. The irrigation system of Cali fornia has been described as a network  of capillaries, arteries, and veins. Mr.  President, let me extend the analogy  and say that the patient suffers from  dehydration and poor circulation. My  bill would begin the process of helping  its circulation. Mr. President,  if  it  would have an effect on the drought, I  would  author  legislation mandating  rain. But this body can enact legisla tion that will improve the circulation  of the State's existing water.  Mr. President, the Federal water sys tem  in California is a  resource  that  we're not using to the fullest to help us  deal with  this drought. To give you  just two examples,  the city of Santa  Barbara can't use excess storage capac ity  in  the Cachuma Reservoir,  and  Santa Clara County can't move water  through the San Felipe Canal.  There are over 30 Federal reservoirs  and 5,000 miles of canals in California  that we could be using right now  to  help us cope with the water shortages  caused by  the drought. We can open  these desperately needed facilities now,  without costing taxpayers a dime and  without taking water away from oth ers. And we can do it by passing this  bill.  Unfortunately my bill does not alle viate  the effects of  the drought  in  every county in California. But it is a  start.  My bill, which has been originally co sponsored by my distinguished senior  colleague, Senator ALAN CRANSTON, ap plies only  to California. Reclamation  law  is a highly complex  tapestry of  statutes and regulation. My bill does  not affect the Warren Act's prohibition  in other States.  My bill will be an environmental plus  as well as save taxpayers' dollars. In  fact, the Federal Government will gain  unanticipated revenue based on the in creased use of its facilities, as the War ren Act requires that contractors for  surplus capacity pay an appropriate  share of the cost of the facilities they  use as well as any operating costs. In  addition, my bill will avoid the costly  duplication  in  the  construction  of  water  projects. Mr.  President,  this  amendment will simply permit the bet ter utilization of water and environ mental management of this precious  lifeblood resource through the more ef ficient use of water facilities.  Today,  I  have  also  requested  the  President to convene a Federal inter agency response team to ensure effec tive drought management. Governor  Wilson has already established a Cali fornia drought action team. It is im portant that all affected departments,  at the State and Federal levels alike,  put their collective shoulders  to  the  wheel, and work to limit the effects of  this devastating drought and its myr iad complications.

21,Senate,102,-0.426,314,3,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, I rise to  introduce a  joint resolution designat ing the week of May 5 as ""National  Correctional Officers Week.""  Make no mistake about  it; correc tional officers have a  tough  job. Our  prison population  is at an  all-time  high. Today, correctional officers are  responsible  for over 750,000 prisoners,  many of them dangerous and violent.  Correctional officers must not only  keep the peace in these facilities, but  they also must work to help rehabili tate offenders by providing worthwhile  skills and encouraging them to develop  positive attitudes.  To make the job of a correctional of ficer more difficult, we have a critical  problem with prison overcrowding. In  virtually every State, correctional re sources are severely stretched; for the  Nation as a whole, prisons are operat ing at 116 percent of their capacity. We  must address this matter by undertak ing a comprehensive strategy to elimi nate factors that lead to crime and we  must better deal with those who have  broken  the  law so we can make our  communi ties safer.  Despite these adverse circumstances,  correctional officers are doing an out standing  job  and we  should  salute  them. Congress has honored  correc tional officers by designating the sec ond week in May as ""National Correc tional Officers Week"" in 1984, 1985, 1987,  and 1989. I urge my colleagues to join  me again this year in support of this  resolution.    ",1991
22,Senate,102,0.084,314,3,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, today I  along with Senators LIEBERMAN, WAR NER, JEFFORDS, DURENBERGER, and oth ers are introducing legislation to des ignate April 15, 1991, as National Recy cling Day. The importance of educating  the public about the real benefits to so ciety from recycling cannot be over stated.  Recycling is not a new phenomenon,  at least not in concept. America's early  settlers recycled as a matter of sur vival,  turning corn husk mattresses  and old clothes into quilts. Many of my  colleagues will remember the materials  conservation efforts during World War  II, when aluminum foil was carefully  saved, used automobile tires collected,  and many other consumer i terns were  recycled and put toward the war effort.  In fact, most of us have recycled mate rials at some point in our lives-typi cally paper, aluminum, or glass.  While many of us may be familiar  with recycling, there is still a need for  public education campaigns to inform  consumers that garbage does not dis appear when  the  sanitation worker  loads  it into  the  truck. Our society  must be made aware  that  there are  very real costs, both financial and en vironmental, associated with the con tinued proliferation of municipal gar bage.  In  the United States today we are  facing a crisis in solid waste manage ment. The United States presently is  generating about 160 million  tons of  solid waste per year, almost double the  amount we produced in 1965. If present  trends continue, the United States will  generate close to 200 million tons per  year by the turn of the century. Towns  and cities across the United States are  realizing  that the city dump will be  forced to close its gates in a few short  years. Just in the last two decades the  number  of  landfills  accepting  solid  waste has been reduced dramatically,  from about 30,000 to 6,000. It is becom ing virtually  impossible  to establish  any new  landfill sites because of the  ""not in my backyard syndrome,"" and  the rising value of land and real estate.  When confronting an urgent crisis,  such as the threat to human health and  the  environment  from  burgeoning  mountains of trash, it is tempting to  look to technology to provide us with  the easy solution. Such technological  fixes, however, will not eliminate the  undeniable need for significant changes  in the way we conduct our daily lives.  Not only must we find more environ mentally sound ways of handling mu nicipal trash, but we must also greatly  reduce the amount of garbage we gen erate in the first place. This will re",1991
23,Senate,102,-0.188,327,3,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. President, as  the  past cochairman of the Union of Coun cils for Soviet Jews Congressional Call  to Conscience, I want to take this op portunity to thank my colleagues for  their participation  in  the 101st Con gressional Call to Conscience. The Call  to Conscience is one of the most effec tive means by which we in the Senate  can focus attention on the plight of So viet Jews.  The Congressional Call to Conscience  has consistently brought the cases of  long-term refuseniks to the attention  of this body and to the world. The ef forts of individual Senators, as well as  collective efforts have worked. The So viets have responded to American pres sure. In light of the upheavals in the  Soviet Union, and the uncertainty cre ated, our efforts on behalf of Soviet  Jews must be redoubled.  While much progress has been made  in the Soviet Union, and many thou sands of Soviet Jews have been able to  emigrate, much more still needs to be  done.  During 1990, over 147,000 Soviet Jews  emigrated from  the U.S.S.R. and the  numbers are  increasing dramatically.  However, Mr. President, Soviet rhet oric on perestroika does not match the  reality of the situation in the Soviet  Union facing Soviet Jews. The right to  emigrate is still a dream in the Soviet  Union, despite assurances  for over 2  years that passage of a freedom of emi gration law was imminent.  Mr. President, we must continue to  work for the right, codified in law, of  Soviet Jews to emigrate, to work for  the release of political prisoners, and  to press for an end to anti-Semitic vio lence in the Soviet Union.  Since the introduction of perestroika  and glasnost, Mikhail Gorbachev has  attempted to change the cultural and  political  landscape  in  the  Soviet  Union. For the first time discrimina tion against Soviet Jews in the work place and in higher educational institu tions has been acknowledged and con demned. Permitted cultural activities  have expanded slightly, allowing Jews  to worship, discuss Judaism and  the  Judaic culture openly.  Still, not all is well. As the rate of  Jews leaving the Soviet Union acceler ates, the American public is led to be lieve human rights abuses are decreas ing. In truth, anti-Semitism is on the  rise, and many Soviet Jews remain in  prison for purely political reasons.  A perfect illustration of this situa tion is the case of Dmi try Berman, a  Soviet Jew from the Ukraine, wrongly  accused and tried for the murder of a  Soviet Army ensign in Moldavia. Mr.  Berman was physically  tortured and  was forced to make a confession to the  murder. Some time later, the Office of  the Procuracy of the Ukrainian S.S.R.  officially  informed Dmi try Berman  that  the case against him had been  dropped because no evidence of his par ticipation in the crime that had been  committed' exists. Mr. Berman imme diately began the process of emigration  to Israel.  On his final visit to the Ovir office he  was  told that his case had been re opened. Soviet officials  immediately  stripped him of his visa and all docu ments, preventing Mr. Berman  from  leaving the country.  In light of President Gorbachev's pol icy of perestroika, a case like Dmitry  Berman's  truly makes  one wonder  whether the Soviet Union is truly com mitted to reform.  ",1991
24,,102,-0.135,353,3,Mr. ANDREWS of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, re search and development [R&D] results in eco nomic growth and enhances the quality of our  lives. Investment in R&D  is critical for the fu ture of our Nation.  I think by anyone's assessment 1990 was  an unusually tough year on Capitol Hill and  the Nation  in general. The prolonged budget  process, the deficit, the savings and loan cri sis,  the Persian Gulf and  the  recession all  played a part and the effects of those prob lems will not disappear any time soon.  In this time of scarce resources,  the good  news  is that research and development out scored all  the other categories of Federal  spending in the budget, with about a 12-per cent  increase.  Large  programs  like  the  supercollider and the space station took hits  and are growing more slowly than some of us  might hope. But others  like  the human ge nome did pretty well.  Unfortunately, according  to  the Congres sional Research Service, Federal  research  and development spending will  increase by  only 3 percent in this fiscal year, which is one half  the scientific  inflation  rate. There has  been a  lot of  rhetoric  from both  the White  House and Capitol Hill about the United States  losing its competitive edge, yet it appears we  are still losing ground.  The really bad news is that the Budget Rec onciliation Act of 1990 provides for an annual  growth rate of 3. 7 percent for nondefense dis cretionary spending. That will very likely place  severe  limits on  future  increases  for civilian  R&D  funding. But we must find ways  to  im prove the state of R&D in this country.

25,,102,-0.044,366,3,Mr. GREEN of New York.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to introduce legislation that will as sure annual funding  for mass transit and re duce our Federal deficit. I propose placing a  1 D-cent-a-gallon additional  tax on gasoline,  earmarking 3 cents  for mass  transit and re turning the balance to the Treasury for deficit  reduction. The tax would be added to the cur rent 14.5-cent-a-gallon tax, of which 1.5 cents  goes  to  the mass  transit  trust  fund. My bill  would  also make  the  5-cent-a-gallon  tax  agreed to in the 1990 budget agreement per manent. That tax is scheduled to expire in fis cal year 1995.  Each year we have a battle trying to protect  mass  transit aid. Each year we work to  re solve our Federal deficit. For every cent the  gas tax is raised, the Federal Government col lects $1 billion in revenue. Essentially, by in creasing the Federal gas tax by a dime and  making  the 1990 5-cent-a-gallon  tax perma nent, the Government would raise over $4 bil lion annually for mass transit as well as an ad ditional $9.5 billion for deficit reduction.  Many may  question  the  costs  that  are  passed onto the consumer. Study after study  conclude that the costs would be minimal. The  1 D-cent-a-gallon tax would add approximately  $40 to the annual costs of operating an auto mobile. Even with  the nominal  increase that  has resulted from the Persian Gulf war, gaso line prices are still below their peak  level of  $1.96 in March 1981. In addition, while Ameri cans are paying about $1.30 a gallor. for gas oline, Germans pay $3.04 a gallon, Japanese  $4.18, and  Italians $5.30. Finally,  increased  funding will enable mass  transit  to become  more cost efficient. This, ultimately benefits  low-income households which remain depend ent on mass transit.  In addition  to preserving mass  transit and  reducing our Federal budget deficit, the legis lation would conserve energy and protect our  environment.  Maintaining  energy  efficient  mass transit will conserve limited domestic pe troleum resources and avoid further growth in  the risky dependency of foreign sources. The  enactment of this tax will also reestablish a  gas conservation ethic. With regard to the en vironment, reduced gasoline use will help with  respect to our massive carbon monoxide and  ozone noncompliance problem, as well  as  have a positive impact on the greenhouse ef fect scientists have warned about.  I urge my colleagues to join me in protecting  our environment, conserving energy, maintain ing equitable funding for mass transit, and re ducing our Federal budget deficit.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  EMPOWERMENT TO THE PEOPLE  HON. NEWT GINGRICH  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 6,1991  ",1991
26,,102,0.377,366,3,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, 1 week ago, I  sat in this Chamber and listened to President  Bush deliver a deeply moving and highly emo tional State of the Union speech. History will  surely be kind to the President for the leader ship, courage, and strength he is providing for  our country during this difficult time.  I would  like to thank the President for his outstanding  leadership and  to share with my colleagues  some of the discussion that has served as a  prelude to this policy initiative.  In  the past  few months,  there has been  plenty of speculation and criticism of the Bush  administration's domestic agenda. New solu tions  to old problems, new names  for old  ideas,  and new allies  and  enemies have  emerged as political observers have  tried  to  predict what direction the President would lead  our country.  After all was said and done, the President  wisely chose, as  the Founders of our great  Nation did many years ago,  to empower the  people.  ""We the people""-a concept whose value  the bureaucracy and Great Society programs  have attempted  to diminish. President Bush  correctly  stated  in his State of  the Union  speech a major goal of his administration- that we  the Nation shape our  future--""by  strengthening the power and choice of individ uals, and families.""  ""We the people""-for over two centuries our  families and communities have understood the  strength  they unleash when  they work  to gether. Long before the American bureaucracy  was established, problems were solved and  creative solutions were developed by people  helping people. Our families were stronger be cause of this-our communities were respon sive  to  the  individual-and  the Government  understood that the strength of each of these  became the strength of our great Nation.  And finally, ""We the people""-the ability to  make our families, neighborhoods and country  a stronger and better place for the future. The  role of the Government should be to empower  people with the knowledge of new and better  ways to solve their local problems. The great est disservice our Government can do to  its  people  is  to put  restraints on  their endless  ability to develop creative and workable solu tions to the problems they confront.  My friend, Philip Kent of the Augusta Chron icle, published an editorial in which he asked  which side the President was on regarding the  Nation's domestic agenda. The President has  spoken.  I take comfort in knowing that he  is  on the side of we, the American people.  A NEW PARADIGM?  Fierce debate rages within  the Bush ad ministration, and the Republican Party, over  strategy for the '90s.  On one side are Budget Director Richard  Darman  and  non-ideological  pragmatists  who preach ""resource allocation"" and com promise with congressional Democrats.  On the other are veteran Reaganites (HUD  Secretary Jack Kemp and Rep. Newt Ging rich, R-Ga., among them) who want a ""new  February 7, 1991  What's  paradigm"" for education, race and poverty  issues based on ""empowerment.""  What's  a  new  paradigm?  empowerment?  Well,  the new paradigm, or model, places  emphasis on free enterprise economic growth  based on capital gains tax reduction. (The  successful GOP paradigm for the '80s was the  Reagan three-year tax cut.)  To many Democrats, empowerment means  giving power to government to control peo ple. But Kemp, Gingrich & Co. don't want  that. They want freedom for people to con trol their own affairs.  The poor don't want paternalism,  they  want opportunity. They don't want the ser vitude of welfare, they want to obtain jobs  and private property. They don't want de pendency, they want a declaration of inde pendence.  The big question: Where does President  Bush stand with regard to all of this?  He has given lip service to the ""new para digm""-and even his own White House policy  aide, James Pinkerton, gave a major speech  touting empowerment last spring.  Amazingly,  though, Darman publicly at tacked Pinkerton's remarks as  ""fad-ism""  and ""new Newt-ism.""  Darman has  since half-heartedly  apolo gized to Gingrich (and for his tone), but the  president so far hasn't moved to squelch the  infighting among his supporters.  Richard Nixon once  told historian Theo dore White that the country ""could run it self domestically without a president.""  Bush following such erroneous advice?  Perhaps,  the President's State  of  the  Union address next month will provide clues  as to which ""side"" he is on.  The worst course for Bush to take, which is  the present course, is no course at all.  Is  DIRTY SECRETS BEHIND THE  BUDGET MESS  HON. FREDERICK S.

27,,102,0.339,366,3,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker,  the  following  is  an article published  in  the February  1991  issue of  the Reader's Digest  that  I believe  warrants the attention of all Members of Con gress.  It  talks about our  inability  to control  Federal  spending,  gives  examples  of  the  wasteful projects we  fund, and outlines  the  tricks we use to give the illusion we are reduc ing spending. I know many of my constituents  will read this article and not find it a good re port card on our actions. I share their concern.

28,,102,0.475,379,3,Mr. HOLLOWAY.," Mr. Speaker, although no  one can be happy with a Federal budget  which is hundreds of billions of dollars in the  red-and I am not-there are several meas ures contained  in President Bush's proposal  which I am pleased to see.  For one  thing,  the proposed budget ad dresses  the question of what can be done  about those who use federally guaranteed stu dent loans to finance their college education,  then fail to pay their loans back. I think those  who take advantage of Uncle Sam's generos ity  in this way should be held accountable for  what they do. Our Government, intentionally or  otherwise, gives something  for nothing  too  often already. There is no reason why college  graduates shouldn't give something back. Stu dent loans create opportunities which wouldn't  otherwise exist.  Those who seize those opportunities must  also meet their moral and legal obligation to  give back what they have gotten.  Mr. Speaker, those who willfully fail to repay  their student loans should be required in some  way  to pay. The President's proposal would  authorize wage garnishment of those who de fault on student loan repayments and would  let State and Federal agencies trade informa tion to locate them. What's more, the proposal  would also require debtors to show hardship  before having  their default  forgiven  through  bankruptcy. That  is  the way  it should be.  There should be an end to the gravy train.  Latest available figures are alarming. At the  end of 1990, outstanding student loans under  the Government-guaranteed program  totaled  nearly $53 billion, roughly double the amount  in 1982. Gross default rates also  increased,  from about 12 percent in 1980 to 16 percent  last year.  Mr. Speaker, this  is unnecessary; this is a  disgrace;  this needs  to be addressed.  It  is  high time those who have benefited from the  Government's goodwill pay the piper. I strong ly support the proposal to permit the Federal  Government to obtain what it is owed.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  LET THE LITHUANIAN PEOPLE  VOTE  HON. WIWAM 0. UPINSKI  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 6, 1991  ",1991
29,,102,-0.176,379,3,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, the President of  the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev  is still  continuing his convincing  imitation of a dic tator. This one-man show would hardly be no ticed were it not for the millions of people held  a captive audience. Throughout the 15 Soviet  Republics,  subjugated peoples, who  simply  desire the freedom to choose their own future  paths, are being  forced  to bear  the violent  brunt of an authoritarian  regime desperately  clinging to power. The Baltic States, Soviet Ar menia, Georgia, and others, though home to  people with vastly different ethnic and cultural  backgrounds, have all expressed a strong de sire  to move  toward self-determination and  independence.  On Saturday, the Lithuanian people will defy  Gorbachev and his henchmen once again  when  they hold a Republic-wide, nonbinding  referendum to measure public opinion regard ing independence. The poll is expected to win  overwhelming support among ethnic Lithua nians as well as among the minority of Rus sian-speaking citizens. The question asked is  astonishingly simple in nature, but it is certain  to have far-reaching and unforeseen implica tions. In a free election, the Lithuanian people  will be asked whether they agree that Lithua nia should be an independent, democratic Re public. Although  I will not be able  to cast a  vote on this issue, I would like to have my re sounding ""yes"" vote included in the final tally.  For the last 40 years, the Soviet Union has  continued to  illegally occupy Estonia, Latvia,  and Lithuania. Although  the Western nations  have never recognized this annexation,  they  have never forced  the Soviet Union to allow  the peoples of  this  region  the  fundamental  right to choose their own fates. Even while all  the Communist governments of Eastern Eu rope have ceased to exist, the Soviet Union  has tightened  its stranglehold on  the Baltics.  In his most recent action, Gorbachev has is sued a decree to declare the referendum in valid and indicated he would attempt to block  it. I will pray that on Saturday common sense  and discretion will prevail. Unfortunately, Mos cow's actions over the preceding weeks have  left little optimism for a peaceful outcome.  I will also continue to offer my support to the  freely  elected  government  of  President  Vytautas Landsbergis. Since  the January 2  crackdown and subsequent killing of 14 peo ple, President Landsbergis and his govern ment have been forced to lock themselves in side  the Parliament building. Surrounded by  concrete barricades, Landsbergis and his leg islature have not been able to venture outside  for fear they will be arrested by the Moscow controlled police.  Mr. Speaker, on numerous occasions my  colleagues and  I have called  for measures  that will convey a strong message to President  Gorbachev regarding his use of force in Lith uania. Just as Americans felt outraged at the  brutal occupation of Kuwait, so too do they de plore the Soviet Union's most recent actions.  3437  On Saturday, the Lithuanian people will pub licly  reiterate  their desire  for  independence.  They will go to the polls and choose their fu tures. Realistically, this election probably will  not force the Soviet Union to pull its occupying  army out or discontinue  its campaign of re pression.  However,  in  democratic  nations  throughout  the world,  the collective voice of  the Lithuanian people shall be heard. Freely  elected government leaders cannot help notice  that the man who made glasnost a household  word still continues to hold the door of Lithua nian independence tightly shut.  THE VIETNAM ARMY-SECOND TO  NONE  HON. DON RfiTER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 6, 1991  Mr. AlTIER. Mr. Speaker, Operation Desert  Storm should help to renew our pride in our  veteran community, including our Vietnam vet erans who bravely served  their country  in a  noble and just cause in South East Asia.  Unfortunately, the war  in  Iraq has brought  out voices who seek to use the gulf war as a  forum to once again unfairly and unjustly at tack and denigrate the veterans who coura geously fought for our Nation in Vietnam.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit an arti cle by Richard Kolb  that helps  to set  the  record straight and give us a clear picture of  America's Vietnam Army: Who our Vietnam  veterans were, and who they were not.  I urge my colleagues to read ""The Vietnam  Army-second to None.""  [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 25, 1991]  THE VIETNAM ARMY-SECOND TO NONE  (By Richard K. Kolb)  Just when we thought the open season on  Vietnam veterans had ended,  the pot-shots  have begun again. As veterans of Vietnam we  are all especially delighted to witness  the  enthusiastic and sincere public support of fered U.S. troops now serving in Saudi Ara bia. Those who  fill  the  ranks of combat  units-especially the grunts-are to be con gratulated for their willingness to volunteer  for such hazardous duty. But is it necessary  for the so-called experts to denigrate Viet nam veterans in analyzing today's military?  The public is being bombarded by these ex perts with the same tired message pushed by  the anti-war movement during the Vietnam  era:  that the  typical Vietnam serviceman  was poor, unmotivated, a high school drop out and overall, not a very admirable char acter, who had to be dragged, kicking and  screaming, all the .way to the draft center.  So, the Cleveland Plain Dealer referred on  Nov. 4 to ""the high school dropouts and re luctant draftees who were sent to Vietnam a  generation ago."" In a confessional piece in  Life magazine  in October, a  former draft  dodger absolved his conscience by dismissing  the Vietnam era military as ""a  fighting  force made up largely of minorities and the  poor ... "" ""Overall, today's voluntary force  is far more representative of the middle class  than the draftees of the Vietnam War, who  included many high school dropouts,"" pro claimed U.S. News & World Report on Dec.  24.

Joseph Cipolla has served as mayor of the  borough of Paramus for over 20 years, 16 of  which he has served as mayor. For over 20  years he has served as  the municipal pool  manager, a member of the board of education,  and a member of the borough council. Mayor  Cipolla has been the driving force behind the  establishment of  the Paramus golf course,  senior citizens center, narcotics squad, sub stance  abuse  committee, Sunday  closing,  antipornography and head shop ordinances,  model recycling program and preservation of  home rule in the borough of Paramus. He was  a moving  force  in  preserving  non-Sunday  shopping  in Bergen County, and was  instru mental in the growth and development of his  community and surrounding area.  His dedication to the community is exempli fied by these and many other services which  he has worked  to provide. Mayor Cipolla  is  one of those special few who truly make a dif ference in our society.  Mr. Speaker,  I am proud to join  in paying  tribute to this exceptional man and extend my  best wishes to him.  RANGEL: AGAINST THE WAR, FOR  THE GI  HON. FRANK J. GUARINI  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 6,1991  ",1991
31,,102,-0.295,392,3,Mr. GUARINI.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  call  to the attention of my distinguished col leagues a recent newspaper column discuss ing the views of my good friend, CHARLIE RAN GEL, on the Persian Gulf conflict.  CHARLIE  is a man who knows war and  knows the problems of veterans in peace time.  February 7, 1991  The article was written by Earl Caldwell, the  New York  columnist and CBS  radio  com mentator.  [From the New York Daily News, Jan. 30,  1991)  RANGEL: AGAINST THE WAR, FOR THE GI  (By Earl Caldwell)  First he took a significant step to support  those he calls ""the warriors."" He did that by  proposing  legislation  to create  for  troops  who serve in the Persian Gulf a ""G .I. Bill"" of  the kind enacted for veterans of World War  II. Two days later, he was the only member  of Congress to stand on the Ellipse in Wash ington and address the huge anti-war dem onstration. Yesterday he was preparing for a  trip to Tel Aviv.  ""To thank Israel for not attacking when  we have troops on the line,"" explained New  York Congressman Charles Rangel.  It may not have been his intention but bit  by bit, U.S. Rep. Rangel, the Harlem Demo crat, has moved onto the point as a leader in  the developing opposition to use of force in  the Persian Gulf.  Maybe a part of it has to do with his own  history. Rangel has two medals from the war  of 40 years ago that in many ways forms a  link to what is now taking place. Then it was  Korea,  early  in  the 1950s,  and American  troops made up the bulwark of a coalition  formed to carry out a mandate of the United  Nations.  Rangel sees the experience of Korea being  repeated. When  troops were ordered to the  Persian Gulf,  it was  said  that dislodging  Iraqi  forces  from Kuwait would not  take  long. Some said, ""Only a  few weeks,"" and  others guessed that it would not take even  that long. But after less than two weeks, it  does not look that way anymore. Now  the  prospects are of a  long and bloody ground  war.  It also happened that way in Korea. At the  start, war was not even mentioned; just ""a  police action,"" was the prediction. But when  it was over, 33,629 Americans had been killed  and there were 103,284 wounded.  Korea,  just as  in the Persian Gulf now,  began with bombing and some believed that  the Navy and Air Force could do  the job.  Eventually the burden fell  to the infantry  and the same is expected to happen in Ku wait. Rangel was a volunteer and he came  out of the war having been awarded a Purple  Heart and a Bronze Star.  It is one thing to join a movement once it  has been established and has a constituency  large enough  to  influence. It is different,  though, to be a part of building a movement.  Then,  there are risks. By standing as the  lone member of Congress to address the rally  on Saturday, Rangel was taking the kind of  risk politicians often duck. But he had his  reasons.  ""I find myself wanting the Pz:esident  to  tell me why I should support him,"" he said.  ""Why not just sanctions? Why not just cut  him (Saddam Hussein) ofr? We could have  really put a hurt on him with sanctions. I  have yet to listen to anything (in the deci sion to use force) that makes sense."" So on  Saturday, Rangel was out there, as he said,  ""to help create an atmosphere-that you can  be against the war and still be patriotic.""  As  a member of Congress, Rangel  also  stands with the minority in another way. He  has a son-22 years old now-who is a Ma rine. So his son now faces what Rangel faced  40 years ago.  The bill Rangel has fashioned to provide  G.I. benefits has several major components.  He asks $1 billion to aid families of soldiers.  ",1991
32,House,102,-0.351,405,3,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr: Speaker, I rise to  speak of a matter of some urgency, and  that is the $400 million that Congress  voted for loan guarantees for the State  of Israel last May. These loans are des perately  needed,  because  there  are  thousands  and  thousands  of Soviet  emigrants who are streaming into Is rael, and, as  the Scud missiles  fall,  they still must be housed and taken  care of.  This Congress, recognizing that, has  voted for the loan guarantees. Yet the  delay continues.  Twenty-nine Members and I signed a  letter to Secretary Baker a month ago;  still  the delay continues.  I was dis tressed over the weekend, Mr. Speaker,  to  learn  that  tensions between  the  United States and Israel had height ened  over  this  issue.  Ambassador  Shoval, and the Israeli Ambassador to  the United States, knows how crucial  these  loan guarantees are, and he is  frustrated that they are not there.  Putting aside the etiquette of diplo macy, we must be sure not to make a  mountain out of this molehill. This is  simply a frank discussion between al lies, close allies, in this crucial time of  war.  Again, my colleagues in Congress, we  cannot let the Ambassador's voice be  the only one raised here. We have to be  the strongest voice, to urge the Presi dent to release these loan guarantees  once and for all. It is the right thing to  do. This Congress has helped  the re lease of thousands and thousands from  the Soviet Union-Jews, Christians- Pentecostals,  with  our  legislation.  Now, to not provide these loan guaran tees, which are so desperately needed,  to house the people left, would be a ter rible and tragic mistake.  Mr. Speaker, I say to the President  and to this body, that these guarantees  should be released now, without delay,  without any more requests for  facts,  and without any further politicking.

33,House,102,0.398,405,3,Mr. NICHOLS.," Mr. Speaker, I am a  brandnew freshman Congressman, and I  want to say a few words about one of  the  veteran Congressmen who  im pressed me and befriended me almost  more than any other-SIL CONTE.  I met him first at the opening Repub lican Conference when  I was scram bling  for  tickets  to  the  swearing-in  ceremony for people from Kansas who  were coming to see me. ""I've got one  you can have,"" SIL  said. And,  sure  enough, he  followed  though,  just because I asked him first and he kept his  word.  From  then on,  in  the bewildering  maze of new people, new procedures  and  everyone going  their own way,  there was always this fellow, friendly  and smiling to help reassure a begin ner.  At a big dinner in Cambridge he was  saluted by the higher-ups, but still he  had a strong handshake and warm rec ognition for me. He sent me, and many  others, a Gillette safety razor, cham pioning his home industry.  You see, for me, SIL had that extra  touch.  I knew SIL did  the big things that  made him a great Republican Congress man.  It's the little  things he did  that I  would like his survivors to know about.

The celebration will cul minate in a gala golden jubilee dinner, to be  held on March 3, 1991 at the Long Island Mar riott.  The Yeshiva of Central Queens [YCQ], the  mother Yeshiva of Queens, was the first He brew parochial school in Queens. It started in  1941  in an abandoned synagogue in Jamaica,  NY, with six children. After a couple of moves,  it settled into its own building in June of 1947.  Within a short time  the building was filled to  capacity and  in 1959 a second wing was  added.  In the late 1960's the YCQ decided to move  once again to Kew Gardens and in 1975 was  established  in  its current home. The modern  facilities  included classrooms, a synagogue,  gym, dining hall and  laboratories. Today  the  student body has grown to 700 boys and girls  who  receive a comprehensive education  in  Jewish and secular studies utilizing the most  Uj:rt<rdate methods and materials. Its students  have won many honors through competition in  citywide,  nationwide  and  international  con tests. Alumni of the Yeshiva have made  im portant contributions to our Nation in the fields  of law, medicine, science, business and Jew ish life in general.  The YCQ Board of Trustees has announced  a series of events to commemorate the 50th  anniversary. Some of the plans include the ju bilee dinner, a special homecoming event, as  well as a YCQ day program to which the pub lic will be invited.  Mr. Speaker, I want to be the first of many  to  pay  tribute  to  the Yeshiva  of Central  Queens and their 50 years of service to  the  community. A special mention goes  to Mr.  Seymour Chesir, the president of the Yeshiva,  and  the other members of the 50th anniver sary committee.  I would ask my colleagues in  the House of Representatives  to  join me  in  this tribute in wishing the next 50 years of the  YCQ to continue the great work of the first 50.  PETER E.

38,,102,-0.383,600,3,Mr. REED.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sa lute a distinguished young man from my dis trict who has attained the rank of Eagle Scout  in the Boy Scouts of America. He is Peter E.  Tondreau of Coventry, and he is honored this  week for his noteworthy achievement.  Not every young man who  joins  the Boy  Scouts earns  the prestigious Eagle Scout  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Award.  In  fact, only 2.5 percent of all Boy  Scouts do. To earn the award, a Boy Scout  must fulfill requirements in the areas of leader ship, service, and outdoor skills. He must earn  21 Merit Badges, 11  of which are  required  from areas such as citizenship in the commu nity, citizenship in the Nation, citizenship in the  world, safety, environmental science, and first  aid.  As he progresses  through  the Boy Scout  ranks, a Scout must demonstrate participation  in  increasingly  more  responsible  service  projects. He must also demonstrate leadership  skills by holding one or more specific youth  leadership positions in his patrol and/or troop.  Peter Tondreau has distinguished himself  in  accordance with each of these criteria.  For his Eagle Scout project, Peter  led a  group of Scouts in soliciting donations to pur chase paint,  then  in painting and  renovating  the basement of  the St. Vincent de Paul  Church in Coventry.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask you and my colleagues  to  join me  in  saluting Eagle Scout Peter  Tondreau. In turn, we must duly recognize the  Boy Scouts of America  for establishing  the  Eagle Scout Award and the strenuous criteria  its aspirants must meet. This program has  through its 80 years honed and enhanced the  leadership skills and commitment  to public  service of many outstanding Americans,  two  dozen of whom now serve in the House.  It  is my sincere belief that Peter will con tinue his public service and  in so doing will  further distinguish himself and consequently  better his community. I am proud that Peter E.  Tondreau  resides  in my Representative Dis trict, and I join friends, colleagues, and family  who this week salute him.  JUDGE ROBERT J. HOURIGAN HON ORED  FOR  24  YEARS  ON  THE  BENCH  HON.

39,,102,-0.303,600,3,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to  honor  a  superb  jurist,  Judge  Robert  J.  Hourigan, who  retired after 24 years on  the  bench of  the Court of Common Pleas  in  Luzerne County.  A native of Kingston, PA, Judge Hourigan is  a graduate of Wilkes College and received his  law degree from the Dickinson School of Law  in 1948 after serving in the U.S. Army during  World War II.  During  his  career,  Judge Hourigan  has  served as a special deputy attorney general  for  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,  first  assistant district attorney of Luzerne County  and U.S. attorney  for  the Middle District of  Pennsylvania, as well as a partner in a suc cessful and well-respected private law firm.  Judge Hourigan's professional and  judicial  careers parallel my own personal and profes sional careers.  I remember him as a young  man when he first came to the bar, practicing  with my father and my brother as a private at torney.  Then,  interestingly  enough,  Bob  Hourigan became a judge of Luzerne County  Court  the same day  I was admitted  to  the  Luzerne County bar.  February 19, 1991  I know Judge Hourigan wonders where the  25 years have gone, as we all do. I have the  distinct pleasure of knowing Judge Hourigan  as a friend, a judge, and a lawyer. I can attest  to the fact that this man was destined for high  judicial distinction. He is well-known for his in tellect and  fairness  in  his  service on  the  Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas.  As we acknowledge Judge Hourigan's mile stone, it would be remiss if we did not mention  the fact that in his last 10 years of service, he  was  commissioned  President  Judge  and  served with distinction until his retirement on  January 1 of this year-just 2 days before his  70th birthday.  Not only does  the  judge have a distin guished professional career, but more impor tantly, he has a grand career as husband, fa ther, and grandfather.  Those of us who know him know that his re tirement does not mean a life of leisure for his  honor. We  look forward to his further service  as a senior judge where he will demonstrate  his outstanding abilities, knowledge, and expe rience throughout the commonwealth.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is always a pleasure  to  honor a great community leader and, particu larly. a jurist, but in this instance it is even a  greater pleasure to rise  to salute a personal  friend and distinguished member of the  legal  profession. We thank Judge Hourigan for his  service and dedication and wish him well.  THE DENIAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS  TO ALBANIANS IN YUGOSLAVIA  HON.

40,,102,-0.376,600,3,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, just a few days  ago  the State Department  issued  its annual  Country Reports for Human Rights Practices.  The report confirms once again the worst sus picions concerning the continuing violation of  human  rights  against  ethnic Albanians  in  Yugoslavia.  In  the autonomous province of Kosova  in  the Republic of Serbia, the Serbian authorities  continue to dominate the ethnic Albanian mi nority. Clearly, the recent historical movement  that has brought greater democracy, pluralism  and respect for human rights to Eastern Eu rope has not extended to Serbia.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to call some of the  more salient passages of  the State Depart ment's  report  to  the attention of my distin guished colleagues.  The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugo slavia, a multiethnic, federal state, is made up  of six republics that operate under a high de gree of autonomy  from  the Federal Govern ment. This decentralized system of govern ance delegates a preponderance of power to  republic and  local authorities. Recently  the  Yugoslav  republics of Croatia and Slovenia  have made laudable strides toward more free  and open societies. However, Serbian authori ties continue to swim against the tide of de mocracy and  this past summer forcibly  took  full control over the province of Kosova.

This evening, her friends and col leagues  in Sacramento City Unified School  District will gather  for dinner  to  recognize  Amy's many contributions to the school district  and the community at large.  Her 17 years of dedicated service  to  the  school district began at Bret Harte Elementary  School where she was hired as a temporary  clerk. Within a couple of years she became a  full-time clerk  there. Upon deciding  that she  would prefer to be a secretary, she enrolled in  classes  to develop her secretarial skills. Her  pleasant and dynamic personality served her  will in this capacity, as she earned an impec cable reputation for exemplary work. Her tre mendous people skills assisted her  in effec tively working up the secretarial ladder within  the school district. This progress culminated in  her  final promotion  to  that of administrative  secretary  to  the executive assistant  to  the  board of education,  the position  from which  she is retiring today.  Retirement will certainly not slow her down.  Amy and her husband Yosh are the parents of  two grown children. She leads an active home  life with her  family, enjoying sporting events  and dances. She  is also very active with the  Sacramento Japanese Methodist Church, per forming  in  the choir and serving on  the wor ship committee. She also volunteers her time  working  at  the Asian Community Center's  bingo games.  I ask  that my colleagues  join me  in com mending  and  congratulating  Mrs.  Amy  Kawahara on her  retirement  from  the Sac ramento Unified School District.  TRIBUTE TO REV. MARTIN F.  REIDY  HON.

Reidy of my district, who is celebrat ing his 50th anniversary of his ordination on  March 29, 1991.  Reverend Reidy has been a faithful servant  to his community throughout his life and con tinues his good work today. He provided serv ices for the Holly Patterson Home  in Union dale, NY,  for 14 years and has been  the  Knights of Columbus Chaplain in East Mead ow, NY,  for 15 years. His dedication to  the  3671  local community is unquestioned, and his con tinued desire to help his neighbors has not di minished.  I would like to formally commend Reverend  Reidy for his accomplishments and kind deeds  over the last 50 years. On behalf of the Con gress of the United States, I congratulate him  for his wonderful work and wish him the best  of luck in the years ahead.

He defined all that was  the best and the noblest in this institu tion. At the same time, he understood  our weaknesses and our foibles. That  made his love and his appreciation and  respect for the institution all the more  important.  For all of us from Massachusetts, SIL  was a close friend and a person who  would always be there, whether it was  for the State, or whether it was for the  cause of people who needed his help.  It was such a wonderful experience  for all of us who traveled to Pittsfield  for his funeral to experience and share  with his constituents  the  love  that  they had for him. It is hard to imagine  a public figure more beloved in his con stituency  for more different  reasons  than SIL CONTE was. We all will miss  him greatly.  ",1991
43,House,102,-0.07,626,3,Mr. JACOBS.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for yielding, and com mend him for the resolution.  Mr. Speaker,  this  is a very  lonely  House. In fact, since SIL CONTE was big ger than life, it is very difficult to be lieve  that he has passed beyond this  life.  Mr.  Speaker,  I was  thinking, SIL  CONTE was like Sara Lee cake. I mean  nobody doesn't like SIL. And why  is  that? Everybody in this House, regard less of what party, everytdy loved SIL  CONTE.  Mr. Speaker, it occurr  to me it is  because, first of all, he was so compas sionate about the problems of people.  Maybe first of all, he was funny. He  was  just plain funny. He could have  you rolling in the aisles.  On that note, I had to make a com ment about the notice of this motion  tonight. In our offices we got a notice  I  that said there will be a motion  to night to adjourn the House in honor of  SILVIO CONTE, and there will be 1 hour's  debate on the motion.  To  the  average  person,  a  debate  means a difference of opinion. So I sub mit, Mr. Chairman,  that it is rather  like the guy with the gang down at the  office voted 6 to 5 to issue a speedy re covery for, in the way it sounded. So I  think that SIL still has had the best  laugh he has had so far during his first  week in heaven, and we are all grateful  to you, Mr. Chairman, for that.  ",1991
44,House,102,-0.379,626,3,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the chairman of  the Committee on  Rules,  the gentleman from Massachu setts.  Some of the greatest Members of this  body have been from the State of Mas sachusetts. As a small boy I went to  school in Deerfield, MA. SIL CONTE rep resents that area of Massachusetts.  In 1962, as a young man I worked for  a Senator from Maryland named Daniel  Brewster, with SIL CONTE as a Member.  He was then known as one of the most  colorful,  outspoken,  and  engaging  Members of the Congress of the United  States.  It was some 20 years later, in 1981,  that I returned to Congress as a Mem ber of  the Congress  of  the United  States. Shortly  thereafter  I had  the  great honor of being elected by Mem bers as a member of the Committee on  Appropriations, and I was appointed to  the Subcommittee on Labor, Health  and Human Services, and Education.  My good friend,  the gentleman from  Massachusetts [Mr. EARLY],  serves on  that subcommittee with me.  I had the opportunity of meeting the  engaging, humorous,  sometimes out rageous human being, SIL CONTE.  There is a book that I refer to many  times in speeches, a book called ""I'm  Okay, You're Okay.""  The gentleman from Indiana [Mr. JA COBS]  rose  and  said SIL CONTE was  loved. SIL CONTE was loved because he  gave  so much  love. SIL CONTE was  liked, because he liked us all.  Speaker,  I  will  support,  of  course, this motion, but I would like to  believe that every day of the 102d Con gress that we meet, that we commence,  and  that we address  the  issues  that  concerned SIL CONTE, that we do so in  his honor.  Mr. Speaker, on our subcommittee  the Low  Income Energy Assistance  Program was a particular concern to  SIL CONTE. It was a concern not borne  of political advantage, but of deep con cern for those who might be cold on a  winter's eve, on those who may have to  make a  judgment between buying en ergy to keep themselves warm and buy ing food or medicine.  SIL CONTE not only  loved his col leagues, he  loved  the people. No one  Mr.  ",1991
45,House,102,-0.192,639,3,Mr. RUSSO.," Mr. Speaker, over 50 years  ago, Lithuania was a country where democ racy flourished and the idea of self-determina tion and  free elections were not just distant  memories or far off dreams. A year ago, I ad dressed this body filled with excitement over  the possibility  that  freedom and democracy  might  return  to  Lithuania.  Glasnost  and  perestroika seemed to be the light at the end  of the tunnel for Lithuanian freedom. The fall  of the Berlin Wall and the emancipation of the  Eastern European countries  from  the control  of the Soviet Union offered a glimmer of hope  for the Lithuanian people.  In addition, a free  election which brought a multiparty Parliament  and the first non-Communist leader to Lithua nia in 50 years were signs that the world was  changing. When Lithuania declared  its  inde pendence in March, the small country was on  top of the world-filled with dreams of future  independence and freedom.  For the long-suffering people of Lithuania, it  seemed as  though  fate was  finally on  their  side. Sadly, however, the euphoria was short  lived and independence has proven to be just  a dream. The winds of democracy died on the  Soviet-Eastern European border and the jubi lation of a newly independent nation turned to  the most basic fight for survival when the So viet Union began  a 2112 month economic  blockade against Lithuania. Designed to stran gle any economic or political  independence  claimed by  the Lithuanian people,  the block ade resulted in a loss of 200,000 jobs, electric  and gas shortages, significant medical prob lems, and an eventual moratorium on Lithua nian independence.  As  if such a moratorium were not enough,  the Soviet Union has reintroduced a war con sisting of troops, intimidation, fear, and hand to-hand violence in its relations with Lithuania.  Fifteen innocent unarmed civilians were killed  in Lithuania and over 200 were wounded  in  the Baltics by Soviet military units in January.  The democratically  elected Government of  Latvia  is being violently harassed by Soviet  troops, and the young men of the Baltics are  being forced into Soviet military service.  The  use  of  force  against peaceful  and  democratically elected governments must be  stopped. The United States and many mem bers of the United Nations have never recog nized the forced annexation of the Baltics, and  the recent brutal repression and intimidation of  the Baltics cannot be forgotten by the United  States.  In  last Saturday's plebiscite, 90 per cent of the 3. 7 million Lithuanian people sup ported  independence  for  the Republic. Yet  President Gorbachev  rejected  the plebiscite  saying it lacked any legal basis.  The openness and democratic changes as sociated with perestroika and glasnost pro vided the basis for significant improvements in  relations between  the Soviet Union and  the  United States. As  the winner of  last year's  Nobel  Peace  Prize,  however, Gorbachev  seems to have embarked on a new course. A  course, not of peace, but of repression. And  so,  the  further persecution of Lithuania and  the Baltic States continues.  The collective voice of the Lithuanian people  cannot be silenced, however. While Gorbachev may ignore their cries for independence  arid attempt  to quell  their protestations,  the  rest of the world can still hear. On Saturday,  February 16, 1991, the United States recog nized the valiant struggles of the Lithuanian  people through the commemoration of ""Lithua nian Independence Day."" As a free born peo ple we can never forget that freedom is a pre cious commodity and that the Lithuanian peo ple have been made painfully aware of what  it is  like to live without this very basic right.  May  the commemoration of February 16 as  ""Lithuanian  Independence Day"" serve as  in spiration  to  the Lithuanian people and a re minder to Mr. Gorbachev of our dedication to  the plight of Lithuania and its people.  ",1991
46,House,102,-0.165,639,3,Mr. ROEMER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today dur ing this special order to commend the courage  and fortitude of the people of Lithuania. The  plight of the Baltic States at this critical time is  an  issue receiving attention all across Amer ica,  including  Indiana's Third Congressional  District.  Just last week I appeared before a meeting  of  the common council of  the city of South  Bend,  IN, and applauded  the efforts of that  body on its attention to the freedom movement  in  the Baltic States, and its condemnation of  the  violence  perpetrated  there  by  Soviet  troops. The council members, as I do, believe  that freedom  is a principle that deserves de fending no matter where we confront chal lenges to it. As our troops fight valiantly in the  Middle East, we must not forget those fighting  just as valiantly in the Baltic States.  I salute the Baltic Freedom Organization of  South Bend, and  the South Bend Common  Council for their local leadership on this issue.  At this point and without objection, I would like  to  insert in the RECORD a letter received by  me from the Baltic Freedom Organization, and  the  communicating  letter  and  resolution  passed by the South Bend Common Council.  I salute them for their courage and attention to  the democracy movement in the Baltic States.  BALTIC FREEDOM,  South Bend, IN, February 15, 1991.  Re Baltic States situation.  Congressman TIMOTHY RoEMER,  415 Cannon Office Building, Washington, DC.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN RoEMER, on behalf of  the members of the Baltic Freedom organi zation, let me first of all thank you for your  supportive remarks about the plight of the  Baltic States at this week's Common Council  meeting. Your remarks and, of course, your  presence are much appreciated.  We all feel that the time has come for Bal tic-Americans, and their supporters, to en sure  that binding  legislation  is  enacted  which will send a clear, firm message to the  Soviet government. This message-perhaps  the only one  that Mr. Gorbachev will  re spond  to-is simply  this:  that  the United  States government and the American  tax payer will no longer underwrite Soviet dis regard for human rights and international  law.  Bear in mind that we are not asking the  United States to punish the Soviet Union for  its behavior; our position is that it would be  immoral to reward such behavior with con tinued financial assistance and economic co operation.  In this context, we ask for your support of  legislative Initiatives, such as H.R. 559, and  ask that you press the Bush administration  ",1991

76,Senate,102,-0.332,769,3,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, mail has  long been the No. 1 morale booster of  our troops. And for the soldiers, sail ors, and air men and women stationed  in the Middle East, the situation has  not changed. Letters are an essential  component of this gulf war. Like food  and water,  receiving mail  is a  need  which is crucial to the survival of our  troops.  In an effort to maintain the high mo rale of our  troops,  I am introducing  legislation which will keep  the mail  flowing to the gulf area by extending  free mailing privileges  to  individuals  sending first class letters to members  of the Armed Forces engaged in Oper ation Desert Storm.  Unless one has served  in  the mili tary, one has no  idea what a  letter  ""mail call"" means to service members.  I remember sharing the letter box ""P""  with a friend and fellow serviceman in  World War II and he used to get letters  from his wife every, every day. Often  his would be the only letter in our box  and  I  always  thought what a  lucky  man he was.  Over Labor Day  last year,  I  led a  Senate delegation to the Middle East  49-059  0-95 Vol. 137 (Pt. 3) 25  to visit the troops and tour our region.  Before I  left, I had a  ""mail call"" of  sorts in my Providence office. I asked  Rhode Islanders interested in sending  letters or packages  to  relatives or  friends stationed in the gulf to drop off  their mail in my Providence office and  I would deliver it to Saudi Arabia. The  response was fantastic. From the time  my office  opened  that morning  till  closing at 5 p.m., I received hundreds of  letters and packages.  During this visit to the Middle East,  I had  the opportunity  to meet with  many of the brave men and women of  our Armed Forces, and I learned first hand  the priority  they place on  the  mail. While each story was different,  they all had a common  thread. Mail  from home alleviates  the  feelings of  loneliness and  isolation  in a  strange  land. A letter from a  loved one makes  it easier to cope with the hardship of  hostilities.  Many families have been divided as a  result  of  this war. Husbands  from  wives, mothers and fathers from sons  and daughters, children from parents,  relatives and friends have all been sep arated by a call to duty. A simple let ter from one  to the other can bridge  that gulf between oceans and deserts  and bring a feeling of closeness. Letters  act as a reminder of the love and appre ciation of our family and friends, a re minder which takes on added signifi cance when facing the harsh reality of  war.  We should be doing all that we can to  encourage  letter writing to keep  the  morale of the troops high. The bill I am  introducing offers one opportunity to  facilitate communications so that the  men and women serving  in  the gulf  area can hear from their loved ones at  home. It will help  to keep  the mail  flowing and will show our support for  the troops. I urge your support.  I request unanimous consent that the  text  of my  bill  be  printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 450  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. FREE MAILING PRIVILEGES.  (a)  IN GENERAL.-Chapter 34  of  title 39,  United States Code, is amended by inserting  after section 3401 the following new section:  ""§ 3402.

78,,102,-0.355,808,3,Mr. SMITH of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, today I  will  reintroduce a bill which will allow senior  citizens  to collect  the benefits and earnings  they so richly deserve. My bill, the Social Se curity Benefits  Improvement Act of 1991, will  repeal the earnings test for those aged 62-69,  provide an adjustment for  those born during  the notch years, and raise the earnings ceiling  for the workers collecting disability benefits.  The bill will first repeal the earnings test for  all workers aged 62-69. The present structure  creates a disincentive  for people  to work or  continue working, which  keeps millions  of  qualified, competent workers out of the  labor  market. The earnings test forces many skilled  employees to abandon their careers and seek  lower paying or part-time work in order to pro tect their Social Security benefits. A repeal of  the earnings test will stimulate significant eco nomic growth which will lead to an increase in  Federal revenue in excess of $3 billion.  As we all know, the notch is a result of leg islation passed by Congress in 1977 to fore stall bankruptcy in the Social Security system.  My bill will  remedy  this disparity. Notch ba bies-those born  from 1917-21-will receive  an  increase  in  their benefits which will be  computed by examining  the old benefits1972 formula-and increase them by 3.25 per cent for each year after 1916.  Finally, this legislation will reform the test for  workers collecting disability benefits. Currently,  if a person is collecting disability benefits and  is under age 70, he or she  is subject to an  earnings test.  If the person is disabled, he or  she is allowed to earn up to $500 per month.  If the person is blind, he or she is allowed to  earn up to $9,720 per year. The difference of  over  $300  a month  between  blind  and  nonblind disabled persons  is clearly  inequi table. We encourage  the nonblind disabled  persons to work; yet at the same time, we dis courage them from working. They are often times forced into accepting lower paying jobs  or jobs for which they are overqualified, just to  maintain a salary  level below  the earnings  test. My bill will abolish this discrepancy in dis ability benefits by enabling all disabled people  to earn $9,720 per year, while still collecting  their benefits.  Congress must repeal and reform the earn ings tests and amend the notch.  It is critical  that we stop punishing those seniors who are  unfortunate enough  tq have been born  from  1917-28. They have worked hard and paid a  great deal  into  the system.  It  is  time  they  reaped a portion of the benefits.  ",1991
79,,102,0.351,821,3,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Speaker, with the great so cial problems of our time growing increasingly  prominent and severe,  I am pleased  to say  that there is a source of light. The ""Daily Point  of Light"" is awarded by the President to Amer ican individuals, organizations, and institutions  who  take  it upon  themselves  to claim our  country's  foremost social problems as  their  own, and take direct action and successful ini tiative  to develop new  leaders  in community  service. One such individual is Jillene Rich of  Tucson, AZ.  In her honor  the 377th  ""Daily  Point of Light"" will be presented. She is to be  highly commended for her efforts.  Through the Resettling of Soviet Jews Pro gram, Ms. Rich matches Soviet refugees with  American families to teach them about Amer ican culture, the daily tools of living, and how  to confront day-to-day problems.  In addition,  the adoptive families assist the refugees with  applications for educational programs and em ployment. Ms. Rich, along with her husband,  is a mentor to one such family of five. In addi tion, she is responsible for recruiting adoptive  families and pairing them with future refugees.  Ms. Rich's involvement with refugees does  not stop there however. Through the Catholic  Social Services Refugee Program she has  temporarily mothered over 25 unaccompanied  refugee children until permanent housing  for  them  is located. She has personally become  the permanent mother  to  two children  from  Vietnam.  The social  responsibility  illustrated by Ms.  Rich extends even further. One week a month  she responds to emergency requests to assist  disaster victims as a member of the Disaster  Action T earn of the American Red Cross. Her  involvement in this organization has led to her  assistance in establishing shelters for victims  of  train derailments occurring  in  and effecting the Tucson community.  I, along with President Bush, commend  to  my colleagues Ms. JUiene Rich as an active  example of one individual who has made a dif ference by making service to others central to  her work and  life. The greatest social probfloods and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  terns of our times will be most diminished by  means such as those illustrated by Ms. Rich.  SUPPORT FOR HOUSE  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 44  HON. RICHARD RAY  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 20, 1991  ",1991
80,,102,0.407,821,3,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Speaker, I am introducing  the Desert Storm interim reservist assistance,  or IRA bill. This bill will affect those U.S. mili tary reservists who have been called into ac tive service in Operation Desert Shield and/or  Desert Storm.  The  IRA bill will allow  these  reservists  to  have access to the accumulated funds within  their individual retirement accounts, or IRA's,  without the 1 0-percent penalty for early with drawal.  Mr. Speaker, I am introducing this legislation  because  it has come  to my attention  that  many  reservists  are  experiencing  financial  hardship due  to  the  loss of regular  income  from their civilian jobs.  To help supplement this income, families of  reservists are turning to savings accounts they  have or what families and friends may be able  to send them. While the Soldiers' and Sailors'  Civil Relief Act of 1940 also provides assist ance and protection  to  these  reservists and  their families, that legislation does not directly  affect the principal of the outstanding obliga tions reservists may have incurred prior to ac tivation and prior  to  their salaries being  re duced to military service levels.  IRA's represent a readily available pool of  savings  for many  reservists  that could help  cushion their loss of income. These accounts  should be available to those who need emer3879  gency  funds  to compensate  for  the sudden  loss of income stemming from the  lower pay  for their national defense duties.  The eligibility period begins on the date of  the  reservist began active service and ends  180 days after the termination of such service.  This would also apply retroactively and equally  to the eligible reservists who withdrew funds  from their IRA after August 1, 1990.  Mr. Speaker, many of those who serve  in  the U.S. Reserves are, as  the New York  Times .recently pointed out, older and more  apt to hold professional jobs. They also have  a greater level of financial commitments than  typical full-time military personnel. These are  precisely  the persons who might benefit the  most from greater access to IRA accounts.  My bill allows the servicepersons' resources  to be used, without penalty, for the particular  and specific needs their families find most ur gent. I hope my colleagues will join me in al lowing reservists the opportunity to do every thing they can to help their families and meet  their many commitments while serving  their  country in Operation Desert Shield and Desert  Storm.  IN RECOGNITION OF MS. PATRICIA  DEGAND  HON. PORTER J. GOSS  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 20, 1991  ",1991
81,,102,0.421,821,3,Mr. GOSS.," Mr. Speaker,  all  across  the  country we are seeing people express  their  support  for our  fighting women and men  in  Operation Desert Storm. In Fort Myers, FL., a  very  special  lady has  turned her personal  commitment  to  the  troops  into a nationwide  initiative of hope and support. A local news paper describes Ms. Patricia Degand as ""the  founder and dynamo behind  'Operation Red,  White, and Blue,' a crusade to get an Amer ican flag flying from every business and resi dence as a symbol of support for all the sol diers  serving  in  the Middle East."" Among  those soldiers is her son, Salvatore Genualdi.  Starting early  in Operation Desert Shield,  Ms. Degand began the ambitious task of writ ing every Governor in the Nation, urging them  to join 'Operation Red, White, and Blue'. The  city of Sanibel has endorsed her idea by issu ing a proclamation of support, and several  area businesses have been most generous in  their contributions to her cause. The program  has  since expanded with proclamations of  support  from other southwest Florida cities,  the State of Florida, and even a letter of sup port from President Bush. Still, most of the ex penses come out of her own pocket.  Ms. Degand indeed personifies the selfless ness and determination that defines the Amer ican character. The  lesson here  is clear: we  should never underestimate  the power of a  single committed  individual  to affect positive  change. Mr. Speaker,  I take  this opportunity  today to add my voice to the many who have  praised Ms. Degand's efforts, and to convey to  her my personal  thanks  for showing us  that  our only limitations are the ones we place on  ourselves.  ",1991
82,House,102,0.581,834,3,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, Saddam  Hussein  told his people  this morning  that he is not leaving Kuwait. He has  committed his nation to continued war  and possible suicide.  All of those who told us a few weeks  ago  that sanctions alone would drive  Saddam out  of Kuwait  now  should  know better. He is willing to fight to  the last Iraqi standing provided he is  the last one standing.  Yet those in this body who did not  want  to stand up  to Saddam a  few  weeks ago are  today suggesting that  they know better how to run the war  than President Bush, Secretary Che ney, or Chief of Staff Powell. Instead of  giving our national leaders more prob lems to deal with, we should be more  supportive of their mission.  The American people  are  a  little  tired of those who are not willing to go  to war now  telling us how  to run it.  The American people are a little tired  of those who would not fight now fight ing with the people who are trying to  achieve a victory. The American people  are a little tired of those who say they  support the troops but spend most of  their  time  trying  to undermine  the  leadership those troops depend upon.  THE ADMINISTRATION'S ENERGY  STRATEGY WOULD TAKE AMER ICA ""BACK TO THE FUTURE""  (Mrs. LOWEY of New York asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend her remarks.)  ",1991
83,House,102,-0.388,834,3,Mrs. LOWEY of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, in the words of former Yan kee manager, Yogi Berra,  ""It's like  deja vu all over again."" Yesterday the  administration had the chance to begin  a new chapter in this country's energy  history, but instead it copied the time worn, hackneyed script of its prede cessor. Instead of a vision of the future,  the administration wants  to  take us  back to the future. Indeed, the admin istration has put forth an energy strat egy designed for another era, a  time  when American oil seemed unlimited  and problems like global warming were  confined to the pages of science fiction  novels.  The policy unveiled yesterday does  not  indicate  that  the administration  has learned the hard lessons of energy  dependence or understood the environ mental warning signs that surround us.  Moreover, events in the Persian Gulf  and their impact here at home demand  a  fundamental shift in American en ergy strategy, not a half-hearted  re prise of old energy policies. The admin istration's policy relies on the dubious  promise of increased oil and nuclear  energy production while it gives short  shrift to the significant potential of en ergy conservation and safe alternative  energy sources.  We need an energy policy that cap italizes on American ingenuity and cre ativity  in  the  fields of conservation  and alternative energy. We need lead ership not gimmicks. We need an en ergy strategy  that does not sell  the  American people short.  PROGRESS IN GETTING THE S&L  CROOKS  (Mr. WYLIE asked and was given per mission  to  address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
84,House,102,0.23,834,3,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Speaker, last year,  this Congress passed a law to assist the  administration in getting at the S&L  crooks who have stolen the taxpayers'  money in the savings and loan debacle.  I am pleased to report today, that a  great deal of progress has been made in  this area. Some of the kingpins of the  S&L  industry  have  finally  been  brought to justice. Don Dixon-Vernon  S&L-has  been  convicted. No more  fancy eating trips through Europe for  him, and passing the bill off to the tax payers.  Ed McBirney-Sunbelt  Sav ings-has  pleaded  guilty-no more  shopping sprees at Neimen Marcus for  him  on  the  taxpayers  tab. Charlie  Keating-Lincoln-has  criminal  charges filed against him and is await ing trial, and the regulators are trying  to  collect  $31 million  from David  Paul-Centrust.  All totaled, since October 1988, 566 de fendants have been charged in savings  and loan cases, and 403 have been con victed. Only 18 have been acquitted.  Prison sentences  total 768 years and  $231 million in restitutions have been  ordered.  Election year or not, this body can be  assured that this Member and the Bush  administration  remain committed  to  getting the S&L crooks.  AN ENERGY SCAM  (Mr. SCHEUER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
85,House,102,-0.478,834,3,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker, yester day the President unveiled his energy  plan. Frankly, it was not an energy  plan. It was an energy scam. It went in  precisely the wrong direction.  Mr. Speaker, nations all over  the  world  are  concerned  about  global  warming. They are  concerned about  the greenhouse effect. They are con cerned about acid rain, and  they are  trying  to conserve and reduce global  dependence on fossil fuel energy. That  is the great challenge.  This pitiful excuse for an energy plan  sends us right down the road to more  fossil  fuel production and more fossil  fuel consumption, exactly what Amer ica does not need and what the world  does not need.  Originally, the enlightened experts at  the Department of Energy under  the  leadership of Adm. James Watkins, a  terrific  leader  in  the  field of energy  and environment, came up with a very  useful and constructive plan that de pended  largely on renewed efforts  to  achieve energy efficiency, and invest ments  in  our national  economy  to  make us more fuel-effective and more  energy-effective. It depended upon con servation. It depended on production of  alternative fuels. It was an excellent  plan.  But the bean counters at the Office of  Management  and Budget  apparently  thought otherwise. Someone  took  a  surgeon's scalpel to it and cut out all  of  those construct! ve and useful ap proaches. I do not know who the sur geon was, but I suspect his name was  Sununu.  Mr. Speaker, we have asked a half  million of our finest youth, men and  women, to put their lives on the line in  the Persian Gulf. Are we incapable of  asking the American people to turn off  the water, to engage in car pooling, to  buy fuel-efficient cars, to turn out the  lights when they leave the room? This  is the approach that we need.  There are vast sources of new energy  available  just  through  conservation,  just  through  energy  efficiency. We  ought  to have  the character and  the  strength and the commitment to those  men and women out  in  the Persian  Gulf to match their zeal in producing  energy  through conservation and en ergy efficiency.

Mr. Speaker, we are 6 months into  Desert Shield-Desert Storm, and it is  past due that we have an accounting of  I  what  costs have  been  incurred  and  what contributions have been received  since this bill  is long overdue, and I  urge everyone to support its passage.  By the same token, we have account ants at the General Accounting Office  who have an equal entitlement. In fact,  they have a statutory authorization in  title  31,  section  716,  of  the United  States Code, access  to the supporting  documentation, and I hope we pass this  bill with confirmation of that author ity and the right to audit the accuracy  and the allocation of the information  we seek to have reported in this bill.  ",1991
88,House,102,-0.374,847,3,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of H.R. 586, legislation that would re quire  the administration  to provide  the Con gress with reports on the incremental costs to  the United States of the Persian Gulf war, and  on the contributions of allied nations.  Allied pledges have poured  in during  the  last  few weeks  to help offset  the mounting  costs of the Persian Gulf war. These gestures  are welcome, but we must not be  lulled into  complacency by allied promises of cost shar ing.  Nor should we forget the enormous financial  costs of Operation Desert Storm. Before the  war broke out, the congressional budget office  estimated that war could add from $17 billion  to $35 billion  to  the Pentagon's  fiscal 1991  budget. The high-technology gulf war is esti mated to cost $600 million a day, and this fig ure could climb to as high as $2 billion a day  once a ground war starts.  H.R. 586 would put  in place an  important  mechanism to chart both the financial costs of  the war in the gulf and the amount of the con tributions made to the United States by foreign  countries to offset those costs.  With persistent budget and trade deficits, a  growing recession, and many urgent domestic  needs, we must be diligent in our assessment  of  the  incremental costs of  the war effort.  Moreover,  it's time  that we demand that our  allies pay their fair share for our common de fenses.  Mr. Speaker,  586.  ",1991
89,House,102,-0.303,847,3,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  in support of the measure before us.  Many of this bill's provisions mirror those of  legislation  I introduced earlier this year. Both  require that the President submit to Congress  reports detailing  the cost of  the war  to  the  American taxpayer, as well as the contribution  of our allies.  The American people, and Congress, need  to know how many of our tax dollars are being  spent on Operation Desert Storm. This knowl edge will enable us to plan and perform to the  best of our abilities.  By knowing  the extent of our obligation  in  this area, we will be better able to estimate  what resources are available for dealing with  other concerns. This  is  true not only for the  upcoming  fiscal year, but also  for years  to  come.  Furthermore, the Amercian people deserve  to know what the contributions of our allies are  in  this war. This will enable us to determine  who really put their money where their mouth  is. This could offer us a valuable  lesson  for  the future.  I urge strong support of H.R.  *  A new world order has often been dis cussed. By knowing whether multiple countries  are truly willing to work together and contrib ute to this struggle to  force  Iraq to withdraw  from Kuwait, we will be able to determine the  likelihood of future global police force actions.  I urge my colleagues to support the meas ure.  ",1991
90,House,102,0.421,847,3,Mr. GOSS.," Mr. Speaker, well we are at  it  again-debating how we can properly do our  job without doing the President's job for him.  We have had this debate before and we will  surely have it again *  * and it is a good de bate to have. However; put in the context of  war, the merits of the decisions made in this  Chamber could very well be measured in the  life and death of our troops in the Middle East.  Now, more than ever, we must be aware of  the fine line between legislative duty and legis lative meddling.  The measure before us today allows us to  do what we were sent here to do. The prin ciple function of Congress is oversight, and in  having the President report to us on the fun damental costs of Operation Desert Storm, we  are fulfilling our obligation to our constituents  and our country.  I support H.R. 586  for  this  reason, and  I urge my colleagues to do  the  same.  What troubles me Mr. Speaker, have been  the attempts of some of my colleagues  to  micromanage every aspect of this war. There  has even been an initiative to force the admin istration to release some very sensitive infor mation-information that, if leaked during war time, could have devastating consequences to  our troops in the field. During my time in the  CIA,  I saw firsthand  that leaked secrets cost  lives-plain and simple. They undercut our  policy objectives and undermine our credibility  throughout the world.  This war cannot and should not be  fought  with 435 commanders  in chief. I believe  the  administration has done an excellent  job  in  providing this Congress with timely and accu rate  information-and I am confident that this  cooperation will continue.  We will not be  left out in this process, the  Constitution guarantees that. In these extraor dinary times of war, we owe it to our troops in  the  field  to give  them every opportunity  to  come back to us safely. Let the President do  his job and let us do ours. That is the way the  Constitution  intended, and  that  is  the way  Government works best.  ",1991

He  has marshaled the  forces of democracy and  justice, calling upon some of our wealthiest al lies to join in this cause.  The Congress, and the administration, has  reminded our allies that with prosperity comes  responsibility. Although  the United States  is  now the dominant country capable of assem bling the might to eject Saddam from Kuwait,  there are many nations around the world who  must also share  the burden, particularly  the  economic burden, of fighting this war.  We have now amassed $53 billion of IOUs  from our allies, but  they have only written  checks for $13 billion in direct payments and  in-kind contributions.

93,Senate,102,0.31,899,3,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, I thank the  Chair, and I  thank my distinguished  colleague from Wyoming.  I rise today to discuss a small, but I  think  significant,  part of President  Bush's budget proposals  for 1992-the  Federal-State partnership block grant.  This proposal seeks to give States and  possibly localities funds and flexibility  rather than mandates and lip service  for them to carry out their service to  their constituents.  Just so my colleagues can be aware  of what we mean by the burden of man dates,  let me point out some figures  that come from the National Governors  Association.  Some States, my State in particular,  the State of Missouri, will in the com ing year see  that mandates, such as  Medicaid and other programs which in volve  Federal  spending but  require  State funds to go along with it, will ab sorb a very large portion of the new  funds coming into the State for the fol lowing year.  In my State I think it is going to be  about 85 cents of every additional dol lar which will be used to pay for Fed eral mandates.  Since most  States  would be paying a large percentage of  the new dollars out for education and  higher education, which I think all of  us agree are very high priorities, that  means, in the State of Missouri, rather  than having a dollar to divide up, with  perhaps 50 cents going to education and  higher education, there is only 15 cents  left out of that dollar to be divided up.  Thus only 7.5 cents might go  to  im prove elementary, secondary, and high er education programs.  And these mandates, such as Medic aid, which we expanded again last year,  continue to grow. We expand the man dates,  demanding  the  States must  cover more, the case loads also grow, as  do  the number of people eligible, and  the costs of servicing  these patients.  As a result, we are actually command ing  from  this body how our States  spend their money.  This  proposal,  which  has  been  articulately described by the President  as an opportunity for  the Nation  to  recognize more fully  the potential of  States as laboratories, has caused quite  a bit of stir. In fact, Mr. President, yes terday, the Senate Budget Committee  held a hearing on just this one issue.  As a member of the committee, I must  say I was pleased that we were address",1991
94,Senate,102,0.551,925,3,Mr. GRAMM.," Mr. President, to save  time, let me just read part of one para graph:  We have major objections to several provi sions * * * of S. 347. Enactment now of the  administration's bill, S. 259, will extend the  DPA to October 20, 1991, and will provide suf ficient time to resolve our differences. While  we have a number of concerns about S. 347,  sections 111, 201, and 133 are especially trou blesome. Additional concerns are identified  in the enclosure.  Mr. President, my request is a fairly  simple one. We are going to be in ses sion for a year, roughly, after October  20. By October 20,  the conflict in the  Middle East should be over.  We will have an opportunity before  that time to go back and look at what  we learned from this conflict. We will  get an opportunity to look at the in dustrial base of the United States and  how it responded to the demands of the  Defense Department. The White House  will have an opportunity to sit down  with Senator DIXON and with others  who are proponents of these reforms  and negotiate with them to see if we  can come up with a bill that everyone  can support.  The President needs these powers. He  has asked for them. The Defense Pro duction Act expired Saturday, October  20.  I  think it is important we have a  temporary extension. The White House  and  the Department of Defense have  asked us to make the extension until  October 20, 1991,  to give us an oppor tunity to get through the conflict in  the Middle East, and to give them then  an opportunity to work with Senator  DIXON and with others to try to work  out a compromise.  I understand and I greatly appreciate  the  fact  that our distinguished col league from  illinois has worked long  and hard on this bill. I know that he  believes that this bill is important and  that he believes this as strongly as I  believe that some of its provisions are  unwise.  I  think, however,  that the prudent  course of action when the country is at  war, when the President has asked us  simply to extend existing law through  October 20, would be .to go ahead and do  that. Then, let us agree that once the  war in the Middle East is over, inter ested parties, especially  the Depart ment of Defense and the White House,  can sit down and try to work out the  differences  they have with Senator  DIXON and Senator HEINZ so  that we  could have a bill that would unify our  effort.

My belief that Senators should be  paid only by their employers-the peo ple-is well-known. It is only fitting  given that we serve the public in the  very highest chambers of government.  Unfortunately, under the current pay  system, Senators are permitted to sup plement the salary received from the  Treasury with honoraria received from  a  handful  of  interest groups  for  a  speech or a  roundtable meeting.

This bill should go a long way in ad dressing the important and valid con cerns of many women. I hope that the  Senate Judiciary takes prompt action  on this legislation.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to offer my wholehearted sup port  for  the Women's Equal Oppor tunity Act of 1991. Equality is one of  the bedrocks upon which our Nation  stands. Yet,  for all  the progress we  have made in the past to ensure equal  opportunity,  and Mr.  President we  have done much; we must do more. We  must make sure that, in principle and  practice, women are afforded the same  opportunities and protections that are  offered to men. The legislation intro duced today by the distinguished Re publican leader is an important step in  that direction.  First,  I am extremely pleased that  this legislation addresses the safety of  women on our streets. We must deter  criminals from committing the violent  and heinous crimes which affect  the  lives of so many women. Certainly, any  solution  to  this  problem  will  be  multifacetted. Nonetheless,  the result  is the same. Those individuals in our  communities who prey on women and  count on society's passive reaction to  their vile behavior are on notice that  we will no longer tolerate such action.  This  legislation will establish  tough  penalties  to  serve  as  a  deterrent.  Criminals must know that if they com mit atrocities  against women,  then  they will face harsh penalties rightly  imposed by a society seeking justice.  Additionally, Mr. President, for  far  too long we have put the rights of the  perpetrators of these sick crimes ahead  of those of the victims. This bill seeks  to remedy this unjust situation. There  is no  reasonable  rationale  for main taining the status quo in this area. The  legislation we are  introducing  today  will work to correct this inequity.  Title II of this legislation specifically  addresses domestic and street crime  perpetrated against women. First, the  bill requires colleges and universities  to  disclose  crimes  involving  sexual  contact, sexual assault, and rape. Sec ond, it increases the penalties for mur ders in connection with sexual assaults  and child molestations by authorizing  the death penalty for those convicted  of these crimes. Third, it increases pen alties for repeat sex offenders by pro viding  that second or subsequent of fenses be punishable by a  term of im prisonment of up  to  twice  that pres ently authorized by law.  Additionally,  title  II establishes a  Federal cause of action against a pro ducer, distributor, exhibitor, or seller  of sexually explicit material by a vic tim of a rape, sexual assault, or sexual  crime.  In this way, pornography vic tims can receive restitution from  the  criminal who has abused them. The bill  also  amends  the Federal  restitution  statute to allow victims of Federal sex  offenses to seek restitution for medical  expenses related to sexually transmit ted diseases, child care, and other costs  related to the prosecution of the crime.  It also  facilitates  the prosecution of  these crimes by ensuring that evidence  about prior sexual offenses is admissi ble in court. It further seeks to facili tate  prosecution  by  proposing  new  standards for professional conduct by  lawyers which prohibit trial tactics in tended to embarrass, harass, or humili ate a victim of a sex crime.  Furthermore, this act would further  protect victims of sexual assault by re quiring  the  testing  of  any  person  charged with a Federal sex offense for  the HIV virus. While I believe that it is  important  to protect  the privacy of  those who may be  infected with  the  virus,  the  victim of  sexual  assault  must be given the right to know if he  or she is at risk of contracting the dis ease. When a  sexual assault occurs,  combined with the spread of the HIV  virus in our communities against their  will, victims can be placed  in a  life  threatening  situation,  one  that not  only affects the victim, but where the  repercussions may echo through all of  society.  The bill also establishes a 10-member  national task force which addresses vi olence against women under the direc tion of the Attorney General. It also  authorizes $60 million under the Fam ily Violence Prevention and Services  Act for fiscal years 1992, 1993, and 1994.  This is an increase of $35 million over  the current authorization.  The bill also provides a $25 million  authorization to be used for programs  dealing with rape prevention and edu cation. Recognizing the increase in as saults commonly referred  to as date  rapes,  these programs would address  the issues affecting victims who are as saul ted by unknown as well as known  assailants.  In addition  to  addressing violence  against women,  this  legislation also  promotes  employment  opportunities  for women. Mr. President, the Bureau  of Labor Statistics reports that women  earn only 68 percent of what men earn.  This  figure points  to  something pa tently wrong in our society, and I can  find no justification for this disparity.  The statistics substantiate  the unfor tunate fact that in many sectors of our  society women are treated as second class citizens. We only need to look as  far as this esteemed institution to see  the results of such  inequity. Women  are 51 percent of our population, yet  only 2 percent of the Senate. There is  no viable reason for this disparity.  Mr. President, much remains which  needs to be done in this area, and this  bill is an important step toward aug menting  the body of labor and civil  rights  laws  that govern gender dis crimination and employment. First, it  establishes a Glass Ceiling Commission  charged with proposing  policies  for  ",1991
97,Senate,102,-0.397,1055,3,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, many of  us continue to be concerned about the  insensitivity  of  the Government  of  China  to  the whole area of human  rights.  I am particularly concerned about  the fate of Chen Xiaoping, a 29-year-old  law lecturer who helped support stu dents  who   were  demonstrating  at  Tiananmen Square.  In our country and in freedom loving  countries everywhere, he is a hero of  freedom.  I hope our Government  is making  clear to the Government of China in  unmistakable  terms, while  they may  imprison those who fight for freedom  in China, we regard them as heroes.  I hope representatives of the Chinese  Government who follow what happens  in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD will rec ognize that by this type of action, they  are creating problems for  themselves  in terms of their economic future and  their political future.  We want to work with the Govern ment of China, but as the Government  of China moves away  from  freedom,  that becomes increasingly difficult.  Mr. President, I ask  to insert into  the RECORD an article  titled, ""China  Legal Scholar Faces Death Penalty In  Democracy Trial"" by Sheryl WuDunn  at this point.  The article follows:  CHINA LEGAL SCHOLAR FACES DEATH PENALTY  IN DEMOCRACY TRIAL  (By Sheryl WuDunn)  BEIJING, February 5--A legal scholar went  on trial today for ""conspiracy to overthrow  the Government,"" the most serious criminal  charge known to be leveled so far in the lat est round of trials of Tiananmen democracy  advocates. Conviction could bring the death  penalty.  The scholar, Chen Xiaoping, a 29-year-old  law lecturer wit4 a reputation for intellec tual brilliance, is one of at least four democ racy advocates known to be charged so far  with ""conspiring to overthrow the Govern ment.""  Mr. Chen, who helped organize a citizens'  group to support demonstrating students at  Tiananmen Square, was a teacher at the Uni versity of Politics and Law until his arrest  sometime shortly after the military crack down on June 4, 1989. A graduate of Beijing  University, Mr. Chen had a background in  constitutional law and had taken part in pre vious student demonstrations.  If convicted, he would face a minimum jail  sentence of 10  years,  and  if his  case  is  deemed particularly serious, he could receive  the death penalty. The trial was closed  to  foreigners, and it was not clear whether it  ended today but no sentence was announced.  In the past, sentences have been announced  .sometime after the end of the trial.  COOPERATION BRINGS RELEASE  Many foreign diplomats and Chinese law yers say they rule out the death sentence, or  even life imprisonment, for any of the stu dents or scholars who took part peacefully in  the Tiananmen democracy movement.   But most defendants brought to trial are  convicted, although some have then been re leased because of their cooperative attitude.  In China, legal punishment is often governed  by the principle, ""leniency to those who con fess, harshness to those who resist.""  The court has recently held political trials  for nearly 30 Tiananmen democracy advo cates,  sentencing  students  to under  four  years  and  intellectuals  and workers  to  longer terms.   TRIBUTE TO OEA   ",1991
98,Senate,102,0.115,1068,3,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. President,  after 38 years of service to the readers  of the St. Paul Pioneer Press, R.J.R.  Johnson retired not long ago.  In his  time as a wielder of the pen, Bob cov ered a variety of beats and served in a  number of editors' positions. He capped  his pen as assistant editor of the edi torial page.  As an editorial writer, a  journalist  enjoys only a modicum of personal ex pression. He or she is distinguished by  the ability to reflect a collective phi losophy,  the consensus of a group of  fellow opinion  leaders. Bob did  that  well, and he will be missed.  Before R.J .R.  Johnson  retired,  he  drafted a column which appeared under  his name in the St. Paul newspaper he  has come to love. Mr. President, I ask  that his review of his career be printed  in the RECORD with my best wishes.  The column follows:  The tendency to look backward is intensi fied when  the time comes to say goodbye.  That time has come for me. So I'm looking  back, and I am satisifed with what I see,  That sounds smug, but think on that good  word: satisfied. Think of putting down  the  glass after a cold drink on an August after noon or, more seasonally, of stretching your  tired  frame under warm blankets after a  hard day's work. Rewarded and  fulfilled.  That kind of satisfied.  Actually, I am amazed when I telescope 38  years at this newspaper and  let  the good  times (properly) dominate the view. What I  see is a great adventure, the newspaper life I  dreamed of when I signed on so long ago.  Just imagine: a job that takes you to the  ends of the Earth, to the stones of Carthage,  to the trails of the Voyageurs; a  job where  you work with surgeons and astronomers and  poets, cops and crooks and loonies; a job that  changes with the big themes of the day; a job  that has such marvelous people  in it as I  have been blessed to know.  Amazed and grateful. That kind of satis fied.  Yes, there have been times when I wanted  to kick something or someone down an ele vator shaft, times when I despaired over my  craft, my newspaper, my  colleagues, my  bosses or myself, but we're talking percent ages here, and telescopic views of time and  action, and it is hard to imagine a more re warding life, at least for the unsaintly. Fig ure a satisfaction/frustration ratio of even  70/30 over the span and that ain't bad, espe cially if the 70 sparkles.  There are people who think a job is just a  job, people who cannot comprehend the idea  of the job as craft-a source of satisfaction  in  the doing. Such people are foolish and  they will never be satisfied.  You may wonder, ""Who is this guy, and  why does he carry on so?""  My name is Johnson and I am a small town  boy-a jackpine savage  from Deer River who came to the city to be a newspaperman;  specifically, to be a reporter for the St. Paul  Dispatch and Pioneer Press, newspapers that  in the '50s were delicious fun and fair. I wore  a trenchcoat then, and a hat. I chainsmoked,  drank too much, and loved to beat the Min neapolis Star and Tribune. Today, I am dull er, but more reputable. Only the last of those  vices remains.  Some of you may recognize the byline from  reporting assignments I have had: City Hall,  police, science, medicine,  the environment.  Later, as often happens in this business, I be came an assistant city editor, Sunday maga zine editor, an editorial writer, and finally,  associate editor of the editorial pages-a lay  preacher. After  today  I won't be a news paperman, or preacher, at all.  I am carrying on because that is the pre rogative of retiring newspaper writers. Our  last perk. The next best thing to being able  to write our own obituaries. It is a chance to  brag a bit, to recall good times and good peo ple. But one should keep it short. The good  times and good people live.  I am carrying on because I want to cele brate good work; specifically,  to celebrate  the craft of newspapering, of journalism; the  gathering and shaping and sharing of infor mation about the people and events. It is fun  and important work, when it does not slip  into tawdriness. It begins, always, with curi osity and ends, at best, in poetry. Sometimes  good journalism moves people to change the  world, or a little part of it, or themselves.  It has been grand to be here these nearly  four decades, but now it is time and possible  to try a different way. I  leave with no re grets, with curiosity  intact, and satisfied,  immensely  satisfied.-RoBERT  J.R.  JOHN SON.   S. 242-AMENDING ETHICS REFORM  ACT OF 1989   ",1991
99,,102,0.371,1094,3,Mr. SUNDQUIST.," Mr. Speaker, earlier this  month, the cheerleading squad from Christian  Brothers High School in Memphis captured the  1991 UCA National Championship,  its  fourth  national title in the last 6 years.  I would like to ask this House to join me in  saluting  these  fine young men and women,  who have demonstrated not only athletic ex cellence, but academic achievement as well.  They are wonderful examples of young people  of character and commitment of which our  community is justly proud.  I ask that the following roster of team mem bers  and  accompanying  account  of  their  championship season be reprinted in the CON GRESSIONAL RECORD.  The Christian Brothers High School Cheer leaders captured the 1991 UCA National High  School Cheerleading Championship on Feb ruary 3, 1991, at Sea World in Orlando, Flor ida.  Christian  Brothers  High  School  cheerleading team has competed in the UCA  National Championship for the past 6 years,  capturing the national title four times (1986,  1987, 1989, 1991).  In 1988 and 1990  the team  placed  third  in  the country. CBHS  is  the  only co-ed cheerleading team in the country  to win four national titles.  The National High School Cheerleading  Championship is administered by Universal  Cheerleaders Association and is sponsored in  part by the Personal Products Company, a  division of Johnson and Johnson. Jeff Webb,  president and  founder of UCA, hosted  the  1991  National  Championship  along with  Julianne McNamara,  1984 Olympic Gym nastic Gold Medalist. The  1991 National  Championships will be televised by ESPN in  March.  This year the Personal Products Company  awarded $67,100 in scholarship prize money to  the  top  five  teams  in each division. The  CBHS  team  received $17,000. Each  cheer leader received a $1,000 U.S. Savings Bond, a  National Champion jacket, and an individual  trophy. The school's cheer fund will receive  $1,000 as well as a big trophy. In the 6 years  of  competition,  the  CBHS  varsity  cheerleading squad has won $31,400 in schol arship money.  The Universal Cheerleaders Association  has  conducted  the National High School  Cheerleading Championship for  the past 12  years.  More  than  30,000  high  school  cheerleading squads in the United States are  eligible for the competition at the regional  level. The regional champions, as well as the  other top squads, are invited to participate  in the National Championship. There were 29  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  coed teams competing for the national title  this year.  The CBHS cheer team consists of 16 young  men and women and  two alternates. The  young men attend Christian Brothers High  School, an all-male private Catholic high  school, while the young women attend either  St. Agnes Academy or Immaculate Concep tion High School, both are all-girl private  Catholic high  schools. The 1991 National  championship squad consisted of seven sen iors, six juniors, three sophomores, and three  freshmen. The  squad  is  coached by  two  former Memphis State cheerleaders and has  a financial and travel advisor as well as a  CBHS faculty advisor.

DOWNEY  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 21, 1991  ",1991
100,,102,-0.384,1094,3,Mr. DOWNEY.," Mr. Speaker, as chairman of  the House Select Committee on Aging's Sub committee on Human Services,  I am pleased  to introduce a resolution declaring the week of  May 13, 1991 as ""National Senior Nutrition  Week.""  This week, celebrated annually by the Na tional Association of Nutrition and Aging Serv ices Providers  [NANASP]  in conjunction with  Older Americans Month, is a time for all nutri tion programs and providers to stress the im portance of meals programs in the daily lives  February 21, 1991  of our Nation's senior citizens. Many of  the  services  provided  by NANASP  are  done  through title Ill of the Older Americans Act, an  historic  legislative masterpiece designed  to  provide basic human and social services  to  our Nation's elderly.  One of the most visible signs of the success  of  the Older Americans Act  lies within  its  meals programs, both congregate and home  delivered. When Congress first authorized the  Elderly Nutrition Program in the early 1970's,  it envisioned the program to serve as an im portant mechanism  for  fostering social  inter action among participants and  facilitating so cial service delivery as well as providing nutri tion services.  The Nutrition Program  is  viewed  as  a  means of providing health promotion services  through sound nutrition practices, while at the  same time providing a range of supportive ac tivities to those elderly most in need of sup portive services. Since its enactment, the Nu trition Program of  the Older Americans Act  has received the greatest share of funding.  This year it is expected that approximately  260 million meals will be served in a combina tion of congregate and home delivered pro grams. About 145 million will be congregate  and 115 million home delivered. The role of  NANASP and other meals providers, which is  much more than just providing a meal, is cru cial in this procedure. Almost every community  in America has access  to a senior nutrition  program. Often these nutrition programs pro vide the elderly with a viable alternative to in stitutionalization, and become increasingly im portant as our elderly population grows. When  a senior has access to a center within their  community, the program nourishes them phys ically, as well as socially, and emotionally. All  too often the personal visit by the Meals on  Wheels volunteer or driver, or the  interaction  with others at a congregate site,  is the only  social contact for many elderly Americans.  Later this year, Congress will be called upon  to reauthorize the Older Americans Act.  I can  think of no better way to reinforce our commit ment to older Americans than by ensuring that  the meals programs,  funded by  the Older  Americans Act, remain intact so they can con tinue  to serve seniors, especially  those who  need it the most.  As we prepare to celebrate Older Americans  Month, and National Senior Nutrition Week,  I  would  like to take a moment to congratulate  NANASP and all other senior nutrition provid ers for the invaluable services they are provid ing. The board of directors, the staff, the mem bership, and the volunteers are all to be com mended for the fine work they do, the energy  they constantly display and  the compassion  they always exhibit. They are the ones who  make National Senior Nutrition Week more  than just a week out of the year, and the meal  more than just a meal.  REV. OTHA GILYARD  HON.

102,,102,-0.265,1107,3,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  take a moment to salute Mr. Paul R. Smiy,  who  is being honored by the Jeannette, PA,  Jaycees as their 1991 Man of the Year. The  Jaycees could not have chosen a more de serving individual.  Paul is the president and chief executive of ficer of the Elliott Co.  in Jeannette, and has  been a valued resident of the community for  many years. Most importantly, Paul has been  extremely active  in community affairs. He  is  chairman of  the Jeannette District Memorial  Hospital Board of Directors, he is a member of  the Westmoreland County Community College  Technical Advisory Committee,  he  is past  president of the  Irwin Lions Club, and  is a  member of  the  board of directors of  the  Norwin YMCA.  Paul's experience with the Elliott Co. shows  that  the American dream  is still very much  alive for someone with the dedication and de votion  that he has  shown. A graduate of  Jeannette High School, Paul attended Penn  State University's Extension School and took  evening classes at Carnegie-Mellon University  while at the same time advancing through the  Elliott Co. He began his service with the Elliott  Co. as a mailboy, moved up  to  foreman,  worked in various engineering positions, even tually became vice president of operations,  and then president and chief executive officer  of  the company.  In 1987, when  the Elliott  Co.'s parent corporation  threatened  to shut  down the Jeannette division, it was Paul who  organized a group of senior management to  buy the company and keep Jeannette's largest  employer in business.  Paul's success, and his work in the commu nity, demonstrates not only that hard work and  dedication will be rewarded, but also that this  hard work can be combined with a devotion to  family, as Paul's wife, Anna, and their three  children and  three grandchildren can attest,  and to the community. I know Paul would love  to spend more time on the golf course, but I  know personally his involvement in the com munity,  to his  family, and  to  the Elliott Co.  takes a back seat to nothing.  I'm honored to  ",1991
103,Senate,102,-0.241,1133,3,Mr. BRYAN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce the Galena Regional  Recreational Development Act of 1991,  an act designed to facilitate the acqui sition for public recreational use a very  special section of  the Sierra Nevada  Mountain Range. This  land  lies  just  outside of Reno, NV, along the Mount  Rose Highway.  This is a unique area for several rea sons. It lies along a narrow mountain  road which connects  the urban Reno  area  to Lake Tahoe,  and  quickly  climbs to a summit of nearly 9,000 feet  elevation. It comprises stands of Alpine  timber,  pristine wetlands,  and  lush  wildlife. Yet for the majority of north ern Nevada residents, it is only a short,  scenic drive away from the congestion  of daily life.  For a number of years, this area has  been under consideration as a destina tion resort, including a large ski area,  homes, condominiums, and a hotel-ca sino. Since  the  time the project was  first contemplated, the Reno area has  grown  considerably,  traffic  has  in creased, a drought has persisted for 5  years, and the air quality in Reno has  diminished despite careful planning ef forts conducted by  the  local govern ments. It is thus no longer clear that a  new large resort in this pristine moun tain area represents the best use of this  property for all Nevadans, now and in  the future.  The measure I have introduced is de signed to facilitate discussion and ne gotiations to determine if it is feasible,  through land exchanges or otherwise,  to maintain this area for low intensity  recreational use for all Nevadans and  our visitors from other States. I be lieve the prospects for a negotiated ac quisition should be fully explored be fore the character of the Galena area is  lost forever. As Edmund Burke noted:  ""We are not so poor that we have to  spend our wilderness, nor so rich we  can afford to.""  Furthermore, a public acquisition of  this property makes long term sense  for the taxpayers of northern Nevada.  The Mount Rose Highway which is the  only means  to access  this area,  is a  twisting,  two-lane  mountain  road,  which  is already carrying nearly  its  full capacity of traffic. In order to im prove or widen this road has been esti mated to cost up to $100 million. If a  major development is added,  the tax payer's burdens for additional services  will certainly be costly. And if left un developed,  the  recreational value  of  this asset  to  the  residents can only  grow over time as more people choose  to live in the Reno area and the open  spaces become fewer.  The Federal Government still owns  nearly 87 percent of Nevada's land.  I  believe there are many areas, still fed erally owned,  that can and should be  developed for private sector uses. By  selling a small part of that land-or by  direct  exchange-!  believe  adequate  funds will be generated to acquire the  rights to the Galena development with out burdening the taxpayers. The legis lation also allows for the possible con tribution to this effort of a portion of  local, State, or Federal Government  appropriations if necessary and desir able.  I will look forward to working with  the rest of the Nevada delegation, the  Governor, other elected officials, and  interested citizens to see that this area  will be available for the enjoyment of  generations of Nevadan's to come.  I am also entering into the RECORD a  Reno Gazette Journal editorial ""opin ion"" on this subject, and ask unani mous consent that it be printed.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Reno Gazzette, Jan. 13, 1991]  IF THERE'S A CHANCE To BUY GALENA LAND,  WE'VE GoT TO TRY  Can  the Mount Rose area be preserved  from large-scale development? Maybe. Part ners in the proposed Galena Resort say they  might be willing to sell their land. If such a  deal could be arranged,  this area would be  taking one of the most important environ mental steps it has ever taken. If there is  any chance, public and private agencies both  must make every effort to buy this magnifi cent property and keep it as it is, in all its  wild splendor.  Readers  of  this  newspaper  consistently  vote  the Mount Rose Road  their favorite  drive. But if the 3, 700-acre Galena Resort is  built, that drive will never be the same. The  area will never be the same for hikers, ei ther. And while the developers will have to  meet  stringent  environmental  guidelines,  the area will never be the same for wildlife.  This  is one of  the  largest projects ever  planned in this area. Certainly it is a huge  project for the mountains that surround our  valley. While it has been scaled down consid erably since the original proposal, it still in cludes a  large ski area,  three separate vil lages, a hotel-casino with 720 rooms, 100 sin gle-family homes, 1,400 condominiums and  125 employee apartments. The impact of the  project will be massive and permanent.  Lake Tahoe might also be affected. The de velopers sincerely believe  that the Galena  Resort will not generate much traffic toward  Tahoe, because it would be a destination re sort complete in itself. But Tahoe is a major  scenic attraction, and if you were visiting  from a distant place, wouldn't you want to  see  it? And even  though Galena provided  gaming, wouldn't you want to see the Tahoe  casinos as well? Sure you would. And that  would place even greater stress on this frag ile basin.  MONEY MUST BE RAISED QUICKLY  So if the developers are really willing to  sell,  it behooves us  to  try  to  raise  the  money. The price could be close to $30 mil lion, which would  include  the developers'  costs as well as the value of the land itself.  That is a considerable amount of money, but  later generations might think it a real bargain.    In the long run, a purchase might not be as  costly as it sounds anyway. That is because  the state and local governments would save  large amounts of money by not having to  provide services for the development. A clear  example is the Mount Rose Road. The devel opers will have to make improvements to the  road in order to handle the increased traffic  flow. But in the years to come further road  expansions will  probably  be  needed,  and  these expansions would cost the taxpayers  millions of dollars.  The main problem at this point is finding  the funds. But the funds could be raised if a  variety of sources are used. Washoe County  could put a bond issue before the voters to  acquire part of the land. The state Legisla ture could appropriate some funds and ac quire another part. The federal government  could become involved, adding land to the  Toiyabe National Forest. And,  of course,  there are private  trusts that specialize  in  buying sensitive land to preserve it from de velopment. If all of these forces can be ral lied,  this precious heritage could be pre served for us and our children.  But  the window of opportunity may be  short. Local officials, our state legislators  and our congressional delegation must inves tigate the possibility immediately, and the  general public must become deeply involved.

Mr. Speaker,  I take  great pleasure  in  recognizing  the Greater  Miami Jewish Federation's annual countywide  drive called Super Sunday. On March 3, 1991,  this exciting event will take place at the Great er Miami Jewish Federation building in Miami,  FL.  Super Sunday, which raises funds for a net work of 35 social, health, welfare, and edu cational programs and services  in  Israel,  in  Miami and in 34 other countries, will be held  from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on behalf of the 1991  Federation/United Jewish Appeal. All volun teers are asked to staff 3-hour phone shifts.  Now more than ever, the Jewish community  needs the help of everyone. The terrorist Scud  attacks of Saddam Hussein have not hit mili tary installations, rather, community institutions  and residential sectors. The funds raised could  contribute to the well being of those citizens  directly effected.  I would  like  to wish  the many people  in volved in this event the best of luck in making  Super Sunday a tremendous opportunity. I pay  tribute  for a job well done  to Gail Meyers,  Howard R.

109,,102,-0.298,1172,3,Mr. KOSTMAYER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to  remember  those brave men and women  who have been taken as prisoners of war in  the Persian Gulf. We all know  the struggle  each of them now faces.  I want to mention specifically one of them  who comes from my congressional district. Air  Force Maj. Jeffrey Tice of Sellersville has  been held for over 2 weeks now; we all pray  for his speedy and safe return.  I recently called Major Tice's father to as sure him of the concern all of us here in the  Congress feel for him, his family, and most es pecially his brave son, Jeff.  We are all deeply concerned about those  Americans who have fallen into the hands of  the  Iraqis because we know  they are being  mistreated. For my part, I join with President  Bush  in holding Saddam Hussein personally  responsible for their care.  For these men and women, the hardest part  of the war may just be beginning. But we want  them  to know  that we  remember  them and  love them, and will do everything we can to  bring them home soon.  To this end, people around the country are  rallying to help the families of American pris oners of war. In Perkasie, a small town in the  northern part of my district where Major Tice  grew up, Ms. Linda Holmes is organizing ""Op eration Desert Song."" This country music jam boree will take place on March 1 0 from 2 to  6 p.m.  ""Operation Desert Song"" will raise funds to  help the  family of Major Tice and a support  group for other local military families, ""Lean on  Me.""  Maria Millar, who heads ""Lean on Me"" re cently brought me a T -shirt that the group is  selling. These citizens are truly contributing to  the morale of the men and women serving in  the gulf and deserve our praise and our  thanks.  Mr. Speaker,  I join with the citizens of the  upper Bucks County in recognizing Major Tice  and I also want to commend the communities  of upper Bucks County for hosting ""Operation  Desert Song.""

111,House,102,0.268,1185,3,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Speaker, it has be come  increasingly  obvious  that  hardliners in the Kremlin allied with  Mr. Gorbachev are trying to save Sad dam Hussein's skin, and this is occur ring  at  the  same  time  that  the  prodemocracy forces are cheering the  U.S.  position  in  the Persian Gulf;  100,000 people cheered  the other day  when our policy was mentioned.  Mr. Speaker, before the war in the  gulf the Soviet Union imported large  quantities of Iraqi oil in exchange for  billions of dollars in Soviet armaments  and weapons, and then they sold this  oil to other nations for a profit, like  Bulgaria and India. It was a very lucra tive business for the Soviet military industrial complex.  I urge my colleagues to take a look  at the Monday issue of the Journal of  Commerce. It really documents it very  well. The military had an almost un limited market for Soviet-made tanks,  mines, Scud missiles, yes,  the same  Scud missiles that just killed 26 Ameri cans while Saddam Hussein is talking  peace and withdrawal.  Now many members of  this Com munist old guard in the Soviet Govern ment and military have gotten hit hard  in  the wallet by  the United States United Nations sanctions against Iraq,  and they want their military economic  relationship  restored with  Saddam  Hussein's Iraq, and  they want it re stored as quickly as possible.  Col. Viktor Alksinis, a member of the  Supreme Soviet and the leader of the  hardline faction which claims to have  outsted Shevardnadze, has called for  resumption of arms shipments to Iraq.  He said:  We have to think about lifting the sanc tions against Iraq, if only for the reason that  we are bound by Iraq by a bilateral treaty.  This treaty includes possible shipments of  defense systems to Iraq.  Mr. Speaker, the United States and  the Members of Congress need to send  a. clear signal  to the Soviet military  and hardline factions that are backing  Gorbachev that we will not stand for  resumed military shipments from the  Soviet Union to Iraq, and that we see  their diplomatic  initiatives as mis placed cover for a crackdown  in the  Baltic States.  I  would  like  to  include  in  the  RECORD, hereafter, a copy of the Feb.  25, 1991, article by Mark Berniker that  discusses this in the Journal of Com merce:  49-059 Q-95 Vol. 137 (Pt. 3) 38  [From the Journal of Commerce, Feb. 25,  1991]  LOST REVENUES FROM IRAQ TRADE BAN  SQUEEZE SOVIETS  (By Mark D. Berniker)  Moscow.-The Soviet Union is feeling the  squeeze of lost revenues resulting from the  world trade embargo of Iraq.  As United Nations-sponsored  trade sanc tions enter a seventh month, the Soviets are  assessing the impact of the embargo and cer tain circles are even pushing for revising So viet trade policy toward Iraq.  During the first six months of the trade  embargo  of  Iraq,  the Soviet Union  lost  ""about $4 billion, or maybe more,"" from the  canceled re-export sales of Iraq oil, said Igor  Mordvinov, speaking for the Soviet Ministry  of External Economic Relations at a Journal  of Commerce interview in Moscow.  Before the gulf war, Soviet-Iraqi trade re volved  around  a  triangular arrangement,  whereby Iraqi crude oil was shipped to the  Soviet Union and then re-exported, primarily  to India, Bulgaria and other East European  countries.  In return, the Soviets received hard cur rency  and  shipments  of  a  variety  of  consumer goods, including Indian paint and  Bulgarian cigarettes. The three-sided trade  deal culminated with Iraq receiving billions  of dollars worth of Soviet armaments and  military hardware.  The Soviet government has been steadfast  in supporting the trade embargo of Iraq, fol lowing Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait and the  ensuing U.N. sanctions.  Mr. Mordvinov said there has been ""abso lutely no trade"" between the Soviet Union  and Iraq since the U.N.-sponsored complete  trade embargo of Iraq began in August. How ever there are members of the Soviet mili tary-industrial complex who would  like  to  see the resumption of Soviet trade and arms  shipments with Iraq once the war is over.  ""We have to think about lifting the sanc tions against Iraq, if only for the reason that  we are bound with Iraq by a bilateral treaty.  This treaty includes possible shipments of  defense systems to Iraq,"" said Col. Viktor  Alksinis, a member of the U.S.S.R. Supreme  Soviet,  speaking  to The Journal of Com merce during a parliamentary intermission.  He is a leader of the hard-line wing known  as Soyuz.  Soyuz, which has gained strength in recent  weeks,  includes members of  the military.  The group boasts that it was responsible for  the ousting of Edward Shevardnadze,  the  former Soviet foreign minister who recently  resigned.  During the decade of the 1980s, the Soviet  Union had a  close military alliance with  Iraq, which was fighting its long and drawn out war with neighboring Iran at the time.  Moscow  supplied  Iraq with  $13.25  billion  worth of arms, according to the Stockholm  International Peace Research Institute.  The bulk of the military hardware in Sad dam Hussein's arsenal-from tanks to mis sile&-was delivered by the Soviet Union in  exchange for valuable Iraqi crude oil.  Iraqi payments for the weapons, in crude  on and cash, had begun slipping far behind  the weapons deliveries by early 1990. Iraq's  failure to hold up its end of the trade bargain  led to negative consequences for the Soviets  and India as well. The post-invasion embargo  froze that imbalance into place.  Sources familiar with Indian-Soviet trade  relations said India in recent months has had  to pay 3 billion rupees (more than $100 mil lion) because of the breakdown of the Soviet Iraqi-Indian trade triangle.  India has been forced to turn to the world  market for oil procurements, receiving deliv eries primarily from Saudi Arabia.  Based  on  statistics  released  by  Goskomstat, the Soviet State Committee for  Statistics, Iraq owes the Soviet Union 3.8 bil lion rubles, or S6 billion. Total Soviet-Iraqi  trade was nearly $2 billion in 1989. Figures  for 1990 are not yet available.  Mr. Mordvinov described Soviet-Iraqi trade  as ""stable in recent years,"" adding that Mos cow will likely resume trade links with Iraq  after the war is over. The Soviet Union pro duced a peace proposal last week aimed at  ending the war.  Despite  the United Nations embargo of  Iraq and Baghdad's large debt to the Soviets,  Moscow has in no way severed its trade links  with Iraq. The Soviets are expected to play  an  important role  in  the post-war recon struction of the ravaged Iraqi economy.  The Soviets already are involved in a se ries of major industrial projects designed to  develop a variety of sectors of the Iraqi econ omy.  The Turkish construction concern Enka  has agreed  to cooperate with  the Soviet  Union on a $5 billion railway construction  plan to link Baghdad and Basra, a port at the  northern tip of the Persian Gulf near the Ku waiti border.  ""Enka will  take part in planning, steel  construction, production and assembly and  signalization phases of the project,"" reported  the Turkish newspaper Anatolia.  In another example of Soviet-Iraqi  co operation, Zarubezhneftegazstroi,  a Soviet  oil and gas construction association, ""will  continue oil pipeline work in Iraq,"" accord ing to Ecotass, a daily economic news serv ice of the official Soviet news agency Tass.  Mr. Mordvinov confirmed that other major  Soviet-Iraqi joint industrial projects include  a 1,680-megawatt heat and electric power sta tion at al-Yusufiyah; a grain elevator with  40,000-ton capacity in Sulaymaniyah; devel opment of on fields in western al-Qurnah; oil  drilling operations  in  southern  Iraq;  and  plana for construction of a gigantic hydro power complex on the Euphrates River.  According  to Mr. Mordvinov,  all  these  projects are being ""suspended"" until after  the war is over. There is speculation here  that as part of Mikhail Gorbachev's peace  plan, Moscow has guaranteed  that it will  help rebuild  the Iraqi economy, assuming  Saddam Hussein unconditionally withdraws  from Kuwait in compliance with U.N. Secu rity Council Resolution 660.  While the Soviet Union does not share a  border with Iraq, the Moscow leadership has  clearly expressed its concern over the expan sion of the gulf war on the security interests  of its southern and predominantly Muslim  republics. Iraq borders Turkey to the north  and Iran to the east, two of the Soviets' most  important neighbors.  The conflict may not be on the Kremlin's  doorstep, but northern Iraq is less than 200  miles from  the Soviet border, a  sensitive  issue for the Moscow leadership and a reason  why the Soviets are forcing the diplomatic  card.  The Soviet Union has depended on oil gen erated by its massive sales of military hard ware to Iraq for cheap consumer goods from  India, Eastern Europe and elsewhere.  Now with shrinking  revenues  from  lost  Iraqi oil re-exports,  the Soviets are facing  huge financial losses, prompting certain con servative  forces within  the country's par liament to call for a  resumption of arms  trade for oil with Iraq.

113,Senate,102,-0.212,1198,3,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr.  President,  the  adminsitration has decided to seek an  extension of ""fast track"" negotiating  authority  to  continue  the Uruguay  round of trade negotiations.  The request for an extension marks  yet another chapter in the long history  of the Uruguay round.  The round has proceeded in fits and  starts over the last 4 years.  But the Uruguay round negotiations  remain a  critical element of United  States trade policy.  HISTORY OF THE URUGUAY ROUND  The Uruguay  round  trade negotia tions are being held under the auspices  of the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade-the GATT.  The GATT was created in 1947. It is  the charter of world  trade. But  the  GATT is an evolving document. Peri odically, the nations of the world must  enter into a new set of negotiations known as a round-to stengthen GATT  rules and apply them to emerging trade  problems.  The first five rounds of negotiations  dealt primarily with lowering  tariffs.  The sixth round-known as the Tokyo  round-addressed  such  problems  as  quotas, subsidies, and predatory pric ing as well as tariffs.  The Uruguay round  is  the seventh  GATT round. The round was officially  launched  in 1986  in Punte del Este,  Uruguay-hence  the  name Uruguay  round.  It was  aimed  primarily  at  strengthening  trading  rules  and  ex tending them to three new areas: Trade  in agricultural products, services, and  intellectual property.  The negotiations almost broke down  in 1988 when the United States and the  EC could not make progress on lower ing trade barriers in agriculture.  the negotia~  temporarily  The  differences were  patched over. But when  tions were  scheduled  to conclude  in  Brussels  last December,  the dispute  over agriculture flared again.  The EC, Japan, and Korea would not  commit to any meaningful agricultural  trade  liberalization. Many developing  countries refused to negotiate over in tellectual property, services, and other  key issues if progress was not made on  agriculture. This deadlock forced  the  United States to suspend the negotia tions.  Once again, the round appeared ready  to collapse over agriculture.  Over the last few weeks, the Director  General of the GATT, Arthur Dunkel,  has attempted to patch  together  the  negotiations. Finally, last week he was  able to convince all nations in the ne gotiations to commit to ""specific bind ing commitments"" to reduce all types  of agricultural protection.  On the strength of this commitment,  the administration has decided to seek  a 2-year extension on fast track nego tiating  authority  from Congress  in  order to continue the round.  BENEFITS OF THE ROUND  Why does the United States want to  keep these troubled negotiations alive?  Mr. President, we continue to nego tiate because the potential benefits of  a successful Uruguay round are huge.  Estimates vary widely, but the admin istration estimates  that a  successful  round could  increase U.S. exports by  $200 billion and expand the U.S. econ omy by $400 billion over the next 10  years.  The round could open new opportuni ties in many sectors.  In agriculture, the United States al ready exports $40 billion each year. If  foreign trade barriers-particularly EC  export subsidies-were eliminated, U.S.  agricultural exports could expand by as  much as $15 billion annually.  The United States is also a  leading  exporter of intellectual property-mov ies, books, and other copyrighted and  patented material. The  International  Trade Commission estimated that foreign piracy of U.S.  intellectual prop erty costs the United States $60 billion  in lost exports each years.  The United States is also seeking to  abolish tariffs in a number of key in dustrial  sectors,  including wood and  paper products,  semiconductors,  and  aluminum. A Uruguay  round agree ment to abolish those tariffs would ex pand United States exports by many  billions of dollars each year.  EXTENSION  Clearly,  the stakes are high. But,  even though I have long supported the  round,  I am now concerned that the  benefits we hoped for may not mate rialize.  Many of our trading partners, par ticularly the EC, seem to lack the po litical will to forge a meaningful trade  agreement.  But on the strength of last week's an nouncements  by  Director  General  Dunkel and signs of progress both the  EC and Japan, I am willing to support  an extension of the Uruguay round ne gotiating authority.  However, I believe we should pursue  the  round as part of a  coordinated  trade strategy to promote U.S.  trade  interests. That strategy should include  at least four major elements.  First, the President must become di rectly involved in bringing the GATT  negotiations  to a prompt,  successful  conclusion.  Ambassador Carla Hills has done a  fine job of leading the United States in  the negotiations. But she cannot do it  alone. The President and the Secretary  of State must throw their full weight  into winning concessions from the EC  and our other trading partners.  The President has  understandably  been distracted by the Persian Gulf cri sis  in  recent months. But we must  fight to protect U.S. interests on many  fronts. The Uruguay round is likely to  have a much greater  impact on  the  standard of living of American citizens  than the Persian Gulf war.  Second,  the United States  should  continue  to aggressively conclude bi lateral trade agreements with our trad ing partners. We  have already  con cluded such agreements with Israel and  Canada. Negotiations are now under  way to conclude a similar agreement  that includes both Canada and Mexico.  Such agreements demonstrate to our  trading  partners  that  the  United  States has other options if the GATT  collapses.  Third, we must continue to aggres sively use section 301 to enforce exist ing trade agreements and open foreign  markets. We must demonstrate to our  trading  partners  that  the  United  States will continue  to press to tear  down  their trade barriers. And if the  round fails, we will open foreign mar kets with section 301.  The administration should join with  Congress to strengthen section 301. It  should also aggressively use existing  section 301 provisions.  In particular, it is time for the ad ministration to finally implement the  special 301 provisions of the 1988 Trade  Act. Special 301 is a portion of section  301 specifically aimed at preventing pi racy of U.S. intellectual property. The  administration is yet to initiate any  section  301  cases under  special  301.  Now, it is time to start cases to send a  message to the world that the United  States will not tolerate continued pi racy.  Finally, the United States must con tinue  to aggressively use its agricul tural export programs. We cannot let  the EC subsidize American farmers out  of business. We must be willing to meet  the competition. To do less is to dem onstrate to the EC and the world that  their protectionism works.  ",1991
114,Senate,102,0.014,1250,3,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. President, I am  proud to be a cosponsor of the Ensuring  Access Through Medical Liability Re form Act. This  bill will  encourage  States to develop and implement alter native  dispute  resolution  systems  along with quality assurance programs.  Such changes will better protect both  the physician community and the pa tients  they serve. Under our current  system, niany physicians will not per form high risk procedures due to fear  of becoming victim  to an expensive  lawsuit of dubious merit. This fear, re sulting in the availability of fewer phy sicians, has become an especially seri ous problem in many rural areas. How ever, the tort reforms and grants in the  Ensuring Access Through Medical Li ability Reform Act will  encourage  States to develop a framework to pro vide physicians the security they need  to deliver care in such critical areas as  obstetrics and gynecology. And when  doctors do deliver care,  they will be  less likely to engage in defensive medi cine provided mostly to protect them selves  in the event that they should  ever be sued. Such changes in physi cian behavior should result in signifi cant medical  cost  savings  for  the  American public. It is estimated that  these  savings would amount  to  ap proximately $20 billion a year. In addi tion to the improved delivery of serv ices and  the potential for significant  cost savings,  this bill will encourage  States  to develop systems  to ensure  that victims of malpractice will be  made whole. At present, approximately  60 percent of claims awards to success ful plaintiffs go to legal costs. In addi tion, many victims with small claims  are unable to pursue their case through  our current legal system.  In Vermont, alternative dispute reso lution is being advocated, not so much  for cost reasons, as the cost of malpractice premiums are much lower in  Vermont compared to the majority of  States, but more to improve the qual ity of care. Moreover, alternative dis pute resolution should be more timely,  efficient and fair  to both consumers  and doctors.  At present, doctors  are  extremely  concerned about  frivolous suits  that  are settled by insurance companies be cause it costs more to litigate a claim  and prove it to be frivolous than it does  to settle a claim out of court. While  the economic costs are paid directly by  the  insurer,  the  doctor  also  pays  through damage to his reputation and  higher insurance premiums in the fu ture. In addition, doctors would prefer  that malpractice cases be heard by peo ple  familiar with  the  intricacies  in valved in this highly technical area, es pecially  the standards set  to assure  high quality health care. Physicians  believe our current trial system is one  that appeals to emotions rather than  the merits of a case.  The specific alternative dispute reso lution  proposal  being  advocated  by  many  consumers  and  physicians  in  Vermont would create an administra tive review board modeled after Ver mont's Public Service Board-monitor ing public utility concerns-and Ver mont's Workers Compensation Board.  The board would review and award  compensation to all patients who have  been harmed by health care providers.  The administrative board would work  with quality assurance programs and  licensing  entitles  to  improve  both  quality and availability of health care  services.  It would work  to assure a  broader distribution of awards, shifting  away from current practice, where a  few victims receive very large awards,  to a more equitable system  that en sures all victims could receive some thing.  Under our current system, those with  small legitimate claims usually have a  hard time finding an attorney to take  their case. For the small percentage of  victims that do  find someone to liti gate their claims, approximately two thirds of every dollar in awards goes to  attorneys' fees and other transaction  costs. Many victims don't recover out of-pocket  losses after attorneys' fees  are paid. Also,  it often  takes a  long  time for a case to come up on a cal endar because many court systems are  severely backlogged; certainly this is  true in Vermont.  Alternative dispute resolution should  ensure  that  all  claims,  even  small  claims, will be officially reviewed in a  timely  fashion.  In addition,  injured  parties with a small claim should find  it easier to file a claim and prove their  case. The alternative dispute  resolu tion system introduced in the Vermont  State Legislature would offer consum ers  the additional opportunity  to be  represented by an attorney at no direct  cost, should they so desire.

115,Senate,102,-0.231,1276,3,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President,  I am  submitting  a  resolution  today  that  condemns  the Cuban Government for  gross violations of internationally rec ognized human rights and calls on the  U.N. Human Rights Commission-now  meeting  in Geneva-to  establish  a  working group to continue the U.N.'s  investigation of Cuban human rights  violations.  The resolution also calls on the Cas tro regip1e  to allow the International  Committee of the Red Cross access to  Cuban prisons.  Senators MACK, GRAMM, LIEBERMAN,  SYMMS, LEVIN, BENTSEN, and BRADLEY  join me as original cosponsors.  Mr. President, the Persian Gulf crisis  continues to occupy our full attention,  as it should. One lesson we should draw  from this conflict, however, is that in  the name of political expediency we  cannot turn a blind eye to regimes that  engage  in  systematic  violation  of  human rights.  Iraq was and continues to be such a  regime.  Despite  numerous  and  well-docu mented human  rights violations by  Iraq, we deluded ourselves into playing  a game of accommodation. We  lulled  ourselves into an utter state of compla cency. We are now paying a very stiff  price for that complacency.  That raises the question of another  dictator, this one just 90 miles south of  the United States. Fidel Castro has  been violating human rights virtually  since  the day he  took power over 30  years ago.  Those violations have been widely  documented. The United Nations issued  one of the more recent reports in 1988its  first  ever  on Cuba-condemning  Castro's human rights violations.  Unfortunately, the human rights sit uation  in Cuba  remains  grave. Re spected  nongovernmental  organiza tions such as Amnesty International,  Americas Watch, and Freedom House  continue  to publish extensive studies  documenting human rights violations.  The Castro government, for example,  has arrested, harassed, and intimidated  scores of human rights monitors and  independent activists, many of whom  cooperated with the U.N.'s 1988  inves tigation. This after  a  promise  from  Castro that he would  take no action  against those assisting U.N. investiga tors.  Castro has come down particularly  hard on human rights monitors. Thir ty-one of them are currently serving  prison  sentences,  another  two  are  under house arrest, and many others  are awaiting trial.  Moreover, the world's longest serving  political  prisoner, Mario Chanes  de  Armas, remains in prison for the 30th  year.  As a result of this continuing pattern  of abuse, the United Nations last year  approved a second resolution calling on  U.N.  Secretary  General  Perez  de  Cuellar to maintain contact with the  Castro government,  focusing particu larly on the plight of those who cooper ated with the United Nations in its 1988  investigation.  Castro responded to the United Na tions by telling the press not to imag ine ""that we will obey one word"" of the  U.N.  resolution. This from a member  country of  the U.N.

We are now paying a very  heavy price for our misguided policy of  accommodation. Let's not repeat  the  mistake in the case of Cuba.

116,,102,0.103,1302,3,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker,  the world's  population  is growing at an unprecedented  rate. By 2025, it is expected to rise to between  8 and 1 0 billion and to reach 14112 billion by  2070. This will put a tremendous strain on the  world's resources and will clearly worsen the  world's over population problems.  The International Voluntary Family Planning  Act will  increase funding for the  international  population assistance programs of the Agency  for International Development.  Greater  international  support  should  be  given to population programs, with a goal of  making  family planning services  universally  available to every individual who wants them.  Now is the time for the United States to re sume its commitment to the largest voluntary  family planning agency in the world-UNFPA.  INTERNATIONAL VOLUNTARY  FAMILY PLANNING ACT  HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 26,1991  ",1991
117,,102,-0.362,1302,3,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, the world's pop ulation is growing faster today than it ever has  before. Every year 94 million more people in habit our planet, and nearly 80 million of them  are being born into the impoverished and al ready overcrowded nations of the Third World.  This population growth has  implications not  only  for  the countries  that must  immediately  accommodate  the new births, however, be cause  in the end we must all accommodate  them. The economic, environmental, sociologi cal, and political implications of this runaway  growth are only  too plain, and  the United  States can no longer afford to substitute moral  sermons for the hard work of doing something  to solve the problem.  The International Voluntary Family Planning  Assistance Act of 1991  is a very promising  step in the right direction. The United States  must rejoin  the  rest of  its allies around the  world in helping to provide couples in the de veloping world with the knowledge and mate rials they need to plan their families. I support  this essential legislation.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  THE  1991  INTERNATIONAL  VOL UNTARY FAMILY PLANNING AS SISTANCE ACT  HON. EDWARD R. ROYBAL  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 26, 1991  ",1991
118,,102,-0.61,1302,3,Mr. ROYBAL.," Mr. Speaker, the 1991  Inter national Voluntary Family Planning Assistance  Act basically accomplishes two goals.  The first goal is to bring U.S. expenditures  for population support for the developing world  to a more realistic and meaningful level.  The second goal is to resume U.S. partici pation in the efforts of the United Nations Pop ulation Fund.  Both goals are critically important. The Unit ed States provided nearly $290 million  for  overseas population activities 5 years ago.  The administration is requesting only $228 mil lion  for  these activities  in  fiscal year 1992.  This would be understandable if the problem  of rapid population growth was showing signs  of easing up, but that is not the case. On the  contrary, the world is growing by an unprece dented 92 million people a year. The United  Nations has revised its projections for the me dium level at which global population will sta bilize to 11 million rather than the 1 0 million it  had projected only a year earlier. We must re trench, not retreat.  The United States must resume its contribu tions to the U.N. Population Fund. To do oth erwise simply does not make sense. The Unit ed States cut off its contributions to UNFPA 5  years ago because it supported a national pro gram accused of encouraging forced abortion.  But UNFPA was never accused of supporting  abortion anywhere-voluntary or coercive.  The best defense against abortion  is vol untary family planning and the best chance for  achieving universal voluntary  family planning  is through a resumption of the strong coopera tion the U.S. Government and UNFPA have  extended to one another over the years.  THE  INTERNATIONAL VOLUNTARY  FAMILY PLANNING ASSISTANCE  ACT  HON. HOWARD WOLPE  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 26,1991  ",1991
119,,102,0.113,1302,3,Mr. MACHTLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the global  population of today will nearly triple to 14 bil lion within  the next 30 years unless critical  steps are taken. These population  increases  will occur most dramatically in the poorest and  hungriest countries, resulting in incredible star vation and suffering, and creating a  terrible  drain on the world environment.  The International Voluntary Family Planning  Act of 1991 would help to provide  the nec essary  family planning counseling and edu cation which could help prevent these tragic  consequences. Voluntary child spacing and  planning  for children can not only prevent  human misery, but can also help to conserve  the world's  fossil  fuels and other resources,  and reduce deforestation and desertification.  This  legislation  is very  important for many  reasons. According to the World Health Orga nization, 500,000 women die each year during  pregnancy and childbirth. Two hundred thou sand of these women, almost half, could be  saved if they were able to plan their families.  UNICEF has reported that 14 million children  under the age of 5 die each year. One-third of  these children could be saved if their mothers  were able to allow appropriate 2-year intervals  between pregnancies.  Without adequate family planning programs,  the world population will continue  to grow,  unabated, at a rate which will ultimately push  this planet beyond sustainability. The  Inter national Family Planning Act of 1991 would  provide $570 million for population aid to the  developing world to help stabilize global popu lation and  to provide a  fighting chance  to  those women, children and  families  living  in  the poorest areas of our world.  According to the World Bank, in order for a  country to stabilize the population, 72 percent    \  -,'    -""    -...a.....:!.a.L...- ...... "" .J.  .....  J.IJ.L.._'o_.t  ._.-  --'- - ....

120,,102,-0.52,1315,3,Mrs. UNSOELD.," Mr. Speaker, the Women's  Health Equity Act  introduced  follows on  the  work in the last Congress to draw attention to  the fact that women deserve equal attention in  medical research, services, and prevention.  There  is an abundance of anecdotal evi dence  to suggest that scientists study white  male subjects disproportionately because they  are easier and less expensive to study. Easier  because scientists do not have to account for  monthly cycles, pregnancy, or menopause.  Yet it is because of these variables that it is  so important to include women in clinic trials because all of these variables still exist when  scientists  and  doctors  apply  research  to  women.  Let me give you just one example. The Bal timore Longitudinal Study of Aging, a study  funded by  the National  Institute on Aging,  began in 1958 but did not include women until  1978, leaving a 20-year gap in the research.  In addition, the Society for the Advancement  of Women's Health Research reports that ""re search on diseases unique to women or more  prevalent  in  women-osteoporosis, meno pause, breast cancer, postpartum depression,  ovarian cancer-is often underfunded."" These  are very real  issues for all of us-issues we  are addressing  through the Women's Health  Equity Act of 1991.  Since we started this battle at the beginning  of the 1 01 st Congress, the National Institutes  of Health has created an OffiCe for Research  on Women's Health, and we have acted on 1 0  separate bills relating to women's health and  research. We must continue along this path in  the 102d Congress. To show my commitment,  I have not only cosponsored  the Women's  Health Equity Act of 1991, but each of the 22  bills in the act as well.  REMEDIOS DIAZ-OLIVER: A CUBAN AMERICAN WHO DOES NOT REST  ON HER SUCCESS  HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHllNEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 26, 1991  Ms. R05-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  I am  pleased  to  recognize  today one of my con stituents, Remedios Diaz-Oiiver, who recently  was  featured  in  the  International Business  Chronicle as one of America's  leading busi nesswomen involved in international trade.  Ms. Diaz-Oiiver represents the can-do spirit  that continues to make America the most pro ductive nation  in the world. The 52-year-old  president of American International Container,  Inc., was selected by  the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce as  the 1990 Businesswoman of  the Year, and also received the 1990 Florida  Export Achievement Award  from U.S. Sec retary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher.  American  International Container is one of  many south Florida firms, founded by Cuban  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  political refugees, which has helped America  win overseas markets. Ms. Diaz-Oiiver's firm  was honored especially for expanding ""sales  of American products to areas that were origi nally controlled by European manufacturers.""  It distributes thousands of containers-every thing  from perfume bottles  to  large plastic  jugs-for over 150 companies. Current over seas markets include Australia, New Zealand,  Hong Kong, Singapore, Europe,  the Carib bean, and Latin America, with overseas sales  and warehouses in San Jose, Costa Rica; Ca racas, Venezuela; Mexico City, Mexico, and  Guatemala City, Guatemala.  Thirty years after leaving Cuba with her hus band, an infant daughter, and a few dollars in  her pocket, Remedios has achieved promi nence at the local, national, and international  levels. She is among only 6 Hispanic women  who serve on  the boards of Fortune 1 ,000  companies. She's also president of the Cuban  Women's Club, a trustee of the Greater Miami  Chamber of Commerce, and the treasurer of  the Florida State Commission on Hispanic Af fairs.  President  Bush  recently  appointed  Remedios as one of three advisers on  inter national trade for the Advisory Committee for  Trade Policies and Negotiations. She also was  selected to represent the President at the in auguration ceremonies  for Uruguayan Presi dent Luis Lacalle.  In a recent  interview with the  International  Business Chronicle, Ms. Diaz-Oiiver empha sized  that  the old-fashioned values of hard  work and discipline are the ingredients of her  success. Luis Sabines, president of the Miami based Latin Chamber of Commerce and  In dustry said,  ""I admire her human quality.  I  don't know where she gets all  the energy to  support so many organizations with time and  money.""  TRffiUTE TO THE LATE JUDGE  JOSEPH BRANCH  HON. TIM VALENTINE  OF NORTH CAROLINA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 26,1991  ",1991
121,,102,-0.084,1315,3,Mr. VALENTINE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in trib ute to one of North Carolina's greatest citizens  and public servants, Judge Joseph Branch,  who died last week.  Judge Branch was a member of the North  Carolina Supreme Court  for 20 years and  served as chief justice from 1979 until his re tirement in 1986. Prior to his service on  the  court, Judge Branch's public career included  four terms in the State House of Representa tives, service as town attorney for Enfield, NC,  and appointment as legislative counsel to two  Governors.  I had the privilege of knowing Judge Branch  personally for many years and take great pride  in representing his home town and county in  the U.S. House of Representatives.  He was a close  friend and adviser who  could always be counted on for wise and judi cious counsel. With former Governor Dan K.  Moore, who appointed him  to  the supreme  court and under whom we both served, Joe  Branch was my political mentor,  inspiration,  4373  and role model.  In all my public  life,  I have  never known a more intelligent and fair-mind ed person or an individual of greater integrity.  Judge Branch,  I am proud  to say, was a  strong Democrat and an outstanding leader of  the Democratic Party  in Halifax County and  across the State. At the same time, he clearly  recognized the limits of party politics and the  need  for objectivity and  fairness both as a  judge and as a political leader. He was prin cipled without being partisan and always put  the needs of North Carolina citizens ahead of  any party considerations.  As an associate justice and  then as chief  justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court,  Judge Branch exemplified the highest ideals of  judicial service. No attorney, no plaintiff, no  defendant  who  appeared  before  Judge  Branch's court could ever complain of unfair  treatment. Judge Branch possessed a model  judicial temperament as well as deep knowl edge of the law and acute sensitivity to the ef fects of the legal system on every individual  who encountered it.  Judge Branch's wife Frances and the other  members of his family can take great pride in  his  life and accomplishments. Our State is a  much better place because of his contribu tions. Everyone who came  in contact with  Judge Branch was ennobled by his presence,  and we are all diminished by his loss.  North Carolinians  in public  life can only  strive  to  reach  the  standards  that  Judge  Branch established. Every citizen of our State  is forever in his debt.  JUDGE DONALD LEE MANFORD  HON.

122,,102,-0.172,1315,3,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, a good friend  and  former Missouri State Senate colleague,  Judge Donald Lee Manford, died recently at  the age of 56. He was an outstanding Missou rian, who devoted most of his life toward legis lative and judicial endeavors.  I had  the  privilege  to work with  Judge  Manford  in  the Missouri Senate, where he  served as the chairman of the prestigious ap propriations committee. During  this  time, he  built a reputation for fiscal restraint and thor oughness. In 1979, he was appointed judge of  the Missouri Court of Appeals, in Kansas City,  and served until his untimely death on Feb ruary 12, 1991.  He was my friend, and I will miss him, and  I know well  that he will be missed by those  who had the privilege to know him or serve  with him.  Judge Manford earned his law degree from  the University of Kansas and went on to serve  as a Missouri assistant attorney general. He  was elected  to  the Missouri House of Rep resentatives for 2 years and the Missouri Sen ate  for 1 0 years. Judge Manford served his  State and country well. In addition to his con tributions to the State of Missouri, he served  in the U.S. Navy during the Korean war.  Judge Manford is survived by his wife, Judy;  his mother, Juanita Manford; three daughters;  a son; two sisters; and five grandchildren.  ",1991

The  first American  hospice  opened in 1974. Today, about 1,683 pro grams exist in each of the 50 States, an  indication that Americans now see hos pice care as a legitimate and needed al ternative to the more traditional care  of the terminally ill provided in insti tutions.

124,House,102,-0.25,1393,3,Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.," Mr.  Speaker,  all Americans  remain  im mensely proud of our men and women  in uniform for what  they have been  able to accomplish with such decisive ness in the Persian Gulf region over  these past weeks. I commend President  Bush,  Secretary Cheney,  and Gen.  Colin Powell on their handling of the  effort to this point.  But having come this far with a mili tary approach to the conflicts in the  gulf, it is essential that a war which  began on Saddam Hussein's terms ends  on terms dictated by the allied forces.  We cannot permit Saddam Hussein to  unilaterally determine  the conditions  for  termination of  this war without  taking great risk that he and his gov ernment will remain a significant dan ger  to  the world community  in  the  years ahead.  A strategic and possibly temporary  retreat on the part of the Iraqi mili tary is not enough-! support President  Bush's efforts to force a surrender and  disarmament of  the Iraqi  forces,  in cluding  the Republican Guard. The  conclusion of this war should leave no  ambiguity as to the victors and the los ers. Saddam Hussein should not be per mitted the possibility of claiming a po litical victory out of a military defeat.  With the conclusion of this military  conflict, will come still more difficult  days ahead-not in  terms of combat,  but in some ways, even more difficult  task of helping to create an environ ment where  political  stability  and  eventually democracy and social and  economic justice can prevail. We hope  and pray that our military personnel  will be home soon-but we acknowl edge that the diplomatic efforts needed  to protect  the cause  for which our  troops have sacrificed so much, will  likely be with us  for generations  to  come.

125,House,102,-0.084,1393,3,Mr. STALLINGS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to express my gratitude and ad miration for the men and women of our  Armed Forces and the  job  they have  done in the Persian Gulf. What we have  seen is a  testament to the dedication,  skill, and commitment of these men  and women. They have responded loy ally and effectively to the task we set  before them, and we are grateful and  proud.  The prayers that have gone up from  southern and eastern Idaho in the past  weeks  have  been  too  numerous  to  count. They have expressed our hopes  that we be spared, to the extent pos sible,  the loss of life. I believe those  prayers are being answered, and we are  grateful for that as well.  Sadly, some have fallen, and they in clude Capt. Douglas Bradt and Capt.  Paul Eichenlaub. On behalf of  their  friends and colleagues at the Mountain  Home Air Force Base in Idaho I want  to express to this Nation our admira tion and gratitude for the devotion to  duty and country these men and their  families have shown. I hope that their  families will understand how deeply we  share their grief, and how deeply we  are  indebted  to  them  for  their sac rifice.  Our gratitude and support extend to  all our troops in the gulf. The fighting  seems to be moving toward a swift con clusion, and we welcome that. But we  must continue to make our expressions  of support tangible. We must go beyond  words.  There are ways to demonstrate that  we will remember the sacrifices they  are making. One of the best is to pay  attention to the needs of veterans gen erally. Those who have served our Na tion-both  past  and  present-must  never be  taken  for granted. Our  re sponse  to them is perhaps  the truest  guage of our pride and support, and I  encourage my colleagues here in Con gress to remember that during the next  weeks and months.

",1991
126,House,102,0.635,1393,3,Mr. ARMEY.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday  we spent 10 hours in the Committee on  Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs  debating what should have been a clean  $30 billion emergency funding bill for  the RTC. The time was divided between  complaining that the RTC is not doing  its job and adding strings to the fund ing that would make it even less capa ble of doing its job in the future.  The strings were designed  to make  political points and to  turn the RTC  into an instrument for  income redis tribution rather than what it was in tended to be, an instrument to secure  the safety of the savings of American  citizens.  In the final analysis, after 10 hours of  debate we  ended  up with  so many  strings we tied our own hands, passed  nothing out of the committee and left  this  important work  sitting on  the  table and left the Nation in need of ad ditional funding as quickly as possible.  I call on the House leadership to in struct the Committee on Banking, Fi nance and Urban Affairs to get clean  funding out on the floor in the interest  of the savers of America as quickly as  possible.

The  unique thing about this battle in the  Persian Gulf is that it was made up of  volunteers. Regardless of the color of  their skin,  their sex, creed,  their na tionality, they all had red blood that  flowed  through  their body  that  they  were willing to pour onto the sands of  the desert for a cause and for a pur pose. They believed in freedom for the  people  of Kuwait  and  for  freedom  around the world.  They  are  brave  young men  and  women, and I challenge the American  people that as these brave young men  and women come home, even those who  demonstrated against that cause in the  streets throughout this country, that  we treat them with honor and with dig nity and with respect and as heroes for  that cause  that  they so  rightly be lieved in.

I would like to also  commend Chairman SONNY MONTGOM ERY  for his  leadership  in assisting a  new Member and allowing him to have  the opportunity to bring such an im portant measure before us.  I am delighted  that both  the gen tleman from Texas, Mr. CHET EDWARDS,  and Chairman MoNTGOMERY  amended  this bill to accommodate private uni versities that may have been excluded  if tne bill had been taken up as origi nalfy drafted. I asked their assistance  in this and they bent over backward to  ensure that the opportunity was spread  between both private and public insti tutions, and I am delighted.  I rise in strong support of the bill. It  is time that we recognize that our vet erans' affairs institutions cannot con tinue to operate without the assistance  that could be given with a bill such as  this one, and I am delighted to be a  part of it.

130,House,102,-0.186,1406,3,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to thank my friend from Mississippi,  Chairman MoNTGOMERY,  for  yielding  the time, and to commend him and my  friend from Arizona, Mr. BoB STUMP,  on  the  continuing great work  they  have done since the start of this Con gress.  I said earlier today, for example, that  in going into the situation in the gulf  that  there would be ""no more Viet nama."" That was our motto, ""No more  Vietnams.''  As I said, part of it is tactical, not to  have the war run by the armchair gen erals, as was the case during Vietnam,  and not to have the punches pulled, as  they were politically pulled during the  Vietnam war.  But there is another aspect to ""no  more Vietnams,"" and that is  to wel come back our veterans with the open  arms,  the generosity, and the respect  that they deserve. Our men and women  of Desert Storm would be greeted back  home differently from the men of the  Vietnam era and  the women of  the  Vietnam era.  The work that has been done by the  Veterans' Affairs Committee has been  exemplary in that effort. I think there  must be 9 or 10  different measures  which already have been reported out  in the early stages of the 102d Congress  from the Veteran's Affairs Committee,  and of course one of them being the bill  before us  today. But each of  these  measures in its own way will help pave  the way for our veterans to return to  their situations here at home better  from an educational standpoint, small  business  standpoint,  and  medical  standpoint, which of course  is dealt  with in today's bill.  So I  really want to  thank my  two  friends and the new Member, the gen-.  tleman from Texas, Mr. CHET EDWARDS,  who introduced this bill, for his leader ship in this effort as well.  Let me say that as one who is very  proud to represent the Third Congres sional District of Kentucky, which hap pens to have a leading medical school,  the University of Louisville Medical  School, and a leading VA medical cen ter out on Zorn Avenue and which is  nearby Fort Knox or which is Ireland  Army Hospital, I am interested in the  kind of bill before us  today  from a  more local perspective.  It could be that the Third District  has the proper mix of medical and vet eran and military facilities and that it  might qualify for possible inclusion in  the program. But. suffice  it  to  say  again: The gentleman from Mississippi  and the gentleman from Arizona have  done yeoman work in bringing before  this House,  in  the early part of this  session, major bills which will guaran tee that the men and women who re turn back from the Persian Gulf after  doing  their  jobs so  remarkably well,  with such dignity, with such courage  and effectiveness, will be received back  in the United States from every per spective  and  from  every  standpoint  that  the honor  with  the respect and  they deserve.

131,House,102,0.176,1419,3,Mr. CLINGER.," Mr. Speaker, our air line industry is in deep, deep trouble.  During  the past  few weeks,  several  ideas have been  floated  to have  the  Federal Government help our ailing  airline industry. These include selling  fuel at below cost, offering Government  loans, and providing tax breaks or Fed eral grants. Just recently, several ex ecutives suggested  that their  threat ened airlines should be allowed to hold  onto the 10-percent tax on airline tick ets for the duration of the current cri sis.  There can be no doubt that the finan cial crisis faced by the airlines is very  real. Fuel costs have increased by $8  billion on an annual basis. Domestic  air travel has dropped about 15 percent  and international air travel has fallen  by as much as 50 percent.  As a result, last year, really in the  last 6 months, the airlines lost about $2  billion. This was the worst loss in air line history. It was more than double  the previous record loss of $733 million  in 1982 and a dramatic reversal from  the  $1.8  billion  profit  the  industry  earned in 1989.  The situation does not seem to have  improved during the first 2 months of  1991. In fact, some project that the in dustry will  lose another $2 billion in  the first quarter of this year alone. If  that happens, it will mean that the air line industry will have lost nearly 50  percent of its total net worth since the  Persian Gulf crisis began last summer.  That's disastrous for our commercial  airlines and the impact on individual  airlines has been devastating.  Eastern Airlines is out of business.  Pan Am  is operating in chapter 11  bankruptcy and selling routes to stay  alive.  Continental has also declared bank ruptcy.  TWA has defaulted on its debts and is  selling routes as well.  Midway has sold its Philadelphia hub  and defaulted on its debts.  USAIR has laid off 20 percent of its  work force.  Even the airlines that are supposedly  big and strong are cutting back oper ations and retrenching.  But recognizing the serious problems  of the airlines does not mean that we  must accept their proposed solutions.  Loans and  tax breaks seem particu larly inappropriate when  the Federal  deficit is so huge and there are still  other sources of capital available  in  the private sector that could help the  industry. I am referring specifically to  the availability of foreign capital.  U.S. airlines do have access to a lim ited amount of foreign capital now.  However, under current law, a foreign  investor can own no more than 25 per cent of the voting stock of a U.S. air line. This has allowed foreign airlines  to make small, but important, invest ments in Delta, Continental, America  West, Hawaiian,  and Northwest Air lines. These  investments have  been  helpful to these airlines and have not  hurt the traveling public or American  national interests.  Therefore, I believe it is time to ex pand our airlines' access to foreign cap ital. Accordingly, I recently introduced  H.R. 782. It is designed to help the air lines by giving them greater access to  foreign capital.  This approach to solving the airlines'  problems, while controversial, is gain ing  support. Recently, Secretary of  Transportation Sam Skinner suggested  that Congress should consider permit ting an increased level of foreign  in vestment  in U.S.  airlines. And  the  Washington Post, in a February 25 edi torial, stated that the foreign  invest ment approach ""is far more reasonable  and more likely to help matters"" than  ideas being pushed by the airlines.  It is important to note that my bill  would not permit foreign investment in  U.S. airlines without significant and  necessary restrictions. First of all, it  would cap foreign investment at 49 per cent of the airline's voting stock. More  importantly,  it would  ensure  that  there is reciprocity in any investment  arrangement.  This means that the foreign country  from which  the  investor comes must  permit the same level of U.S.  invest ment in its airlines as  its citizen is  seeking in our airline. It also means  that the foreign  investor must come  from a country that allows open access  by U.S. airlines  to  its  international  aviation markets.  My bill  imposes additional  restric tions as well. It would require that any  foreign investment must be consistent  with our national security. It would  mandate  that  the key offices of the  company be in the hands of U.S. citi zens. And  it would permit  the Sec retary of Transportation  to block a  particular  foreign  investment  if he  found  that the investment would not  be in the public interest.  These  restrictions ensure  that air lines would have access to foreign cap ital only when that will be beneficial  to the industry and the traveling pub lic. They would  prevent  restrictive  trading nations such as Japan or en emies  like  Iraq  from  getting  their  hands on United States air carriers.  Some may ask why anyone would  want to invest in the U.S. airline in dustry. Given the current state of that  industry, that is certainly a valid ques tion at this time. But I would ask why  an archaic Federal law should continue  to block those who wish to do so.  The war and the recession will end,  fuel prices will come down, fear of ter",1991

133,House,102,-0.316,1445,3,Mr. FROST.," Mr. Speaker, I welcome the OJr  portunity  to  join my colleagues  in observing  Black History Month.  I want  to  thank Con gressman STOKES  for taking out this special  order and choosing  to highlight the  issue of  black universities and colleges.  Historic black colleges have played a major  role over the last century in educating blacks  at the college  level. Typically  located  in  the  south, where discrimination against blacks has  been  the most profound,  these  institutions  sought to educate a population that was large ly isolated from the rest of society education ally and politically. Segregation was legal and  blacks lived under harsh economic and social  restrictions. Despite the difficulties, America is  home to nearly 1 00 historically black colleges  and universities.  Many  of  these  schools were  organized  under the direction of some of our country's  most distinguished black leaders. Hiram Rev els, for instance, the first black elected to the  U.S. Senate, left Congress in 1871 to become  the  first president of Alcorn A&M College  in  Mississippi.  In North Carolina, a black state  legislator, Hugh Gale,  introduced a bill  that  eventually  established Elizabeth City State  University.  In Texas, we have eight historically black  colleges or universities spread throughout the  State. Most recently, Bishop College in Dallas  closed and I am pleased to note that the Paul  Quinn College of Waco has relocated to the  Bishop campus in the Dallas area.  While the black colleges and universities in  our country have contributed immensely to the  education  of  America's  black  community,  many barriers to education still remain. Statis tics continue to indicate that financial acces sibility to higher education is not a reality for  the black community. When Ronald Reagan  was successful in cutting aid for education in  1982, blacks were disproportionately affected.  For the most part,  the situation has not im proved over the last decade.  Today, as we pay tribute to the accomplish ments of the many distinguished black Ameri cans,  let us  recognize  the  responsibility we  bear to change  the status quo. Let us seri ously evaluate our education agenda and con sider the possibilities before us that will enable  the black community to fully and equally par ticipate in the higher education process in our  country.  ",1991
134,House,102,-0.438,1445,3,Mr. FORD of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker, this  month has been set aside in commemoration  of the celebration of Black History Month. A  celebration of  the outstanding achievements  and contributions made by African-Americans.  We celebrate Black History Month to afford  all Americans the opportunity to learn, appre ciate and most importantly to respect the role  of the African-American in the shaping of our  Nation.  African-Americans have played a vital part  in  the building of our Nation. The story of  black America  is one of valor in the  face of  hardships, courage  in  the storm of  injustice  and faith in the wake of defeat.  The first blacks were brought to this country  against  their will, castigated, ostracized and  even criticized, yet were able  to  remain a  strong people.  Until only a few decades ago, we lived our  lives separate and unequal. We were barred  from most public facilities and even made to  drink at separate water fountains.  In a nation that proclaimed liberty and jus tice for all-African-Americans were living nei ther.  These events are significant in our lives and  should foster a sense of pride among us-a  sense of pride that enables us not to lament  on what has been done to us but rather what  we have been able to accomplish in the face  of adversity.  Let us be mindful of the fact that African Americans own a major block of stock in this  country, this State, and this city. And the stock  is beginning to pay dividends as guaranteed  by the Constitution on the United States.  African-American  students who  graduate  from Lemoyne-Owen College can expect a job  at Buckman Laboratories just as a white stu dent who gradutes from Rhodes College.  Graduates of historically black colleges and  universities [HBCU's] can look forward to jobs  at companies  like Eastman Kodak, Schering  Plough, Federal Express,  just  like graduates  from Memphis State.  Students  from my alma mater Tennessee  State University can gain a seat in the U.S.  Congress just like graduates from the Univer sity of Tennessee.  For some time, we were of the mindset that  in order to succeed in America one had to at tend predominantly white institutions.  We found that premise to be untrue. Finally  our people are learning what you at Lemoyne Owen College knew all along. HBCUs do a  better job at educating our young people than  traditionally white institutions.  HBCU's constitute only about 3 percent of  all American colleges and universities, and yet  they graduate a full 40 percent of all African Americans receiving bachelor degrees.  Our students are coming back home and  rightfully so. Our colleges and universities are  valuable and are  teaching our graduates so  well  that  in  today's America,  they will gain  seats on  the boards of  the  first Tennessee  and Cabinet positions in the U.S. Government.  Black universities and colleges are the hope  for our future. Get all that you can from your  institutions, complete your studies, enter into  the work force with a vision of unlimited suc cess, go  into your communities and assist  those who are not able to assist themselves.  As African-Americans we have a  respon sibility to take care of our own, to help one an other, our families, our neighbors, our friends.  Direct them to opportunities, encourage them  to succeed, and give them the benefit of your  learning.  ",1991
135,House,102,-0.044,1458,3,Mr. GREEN of New York.," Mr. Speak er, I  thank the distinguished dean of  the Massachusetts delegation for yield ing. As we both mourn the death of our  friend, SILVIO CONTE, but also  recall  the joys that he brought to so many of  us, many have commented on SILVIO's  wit, on his colorful speeches here in the  well of the House and in our Appropria tions Committee, and I shall certainly  remember all of those.  But I also remember him for some  other things. First, as has been men tioned, a remarkable record of legisla tive accomplishments. Second, the fact  that he really could stay on top of the  work of 13 appropriation subcommit tees, and I know that his staff some times felt that he was pushing them a  little bit, and that they were working  harder than a lot of other staffs around  the Hill, and that was probably true.  But Sn. really took the responsibility  as ranking minority member of the Ap propriations Committee very seriously,  and he always was on top of what was  going on.  And of course, I shall also remember  that back of that was SIL's encyclo pedic knowledge of the Federal Govern ment.  It was  just  remarkable  how  much he knew of the laws for which we  were appropriating funds, how much he  knew of the history of all of these pro grams and all of the agencies. What a  wealth of experience he brought to his  work as ranking minority member and  to whatever other  issues  interested  him.  But finally, most of all, I shall re member his personal kindnesses to me,  because as the gentleman from Ohio.  [Mr. REGULA] mentioned earlier in this  special order, Sn.viO  really was con cerned that his Republican colleagues  on the Appropriations Committee have  the opportunity to use their talents to  the fullest, and he say to it when I was  a freshman on the Appropriations Com mittee, having been a former HUD re gional administrator, that I got to be  ranking Republican on the HUD-Inde pendent Agencies Subcommittee, and  that certainly has made my lOlh years  on the Appropriations Committee a lot  more valuable to me, and I hope a lot  more valuable  to  those I  serve  than  they otherwise would have been. And it  was the fact that SILVO would really go  out of his way to help his colleagues  that I think on top of everything else  really crowned an extraordinary career  here in the House of Representatives.  We  shall all miss him very, very  deeply.  ",1991
136,House,102,-0.483,1471,3,Mr. LEHMAN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to join our colleagues from Massachusetts in  SILVIO 0.  paying  tribute  to  the  late Hon.  CONTE, whose loss we all mourn.  Perhaps I should begin with an anecdote. In  December 1972, shortly after my first election  to  the House,  I went to Cape Canaveral  to  view a space shot. I was sitting in the bleach ers waiting  for  the  launch when  I heard a  voice behind me talking of a forthcoming hunt ing trip to Texas. The enthusiasm and vitality,  the warmth of that voice stirred me so much  that I turned around and said hello to SILVIO  CONTE for the first time.  The zest for life that was so moving then re mained a constant quality with SIL; even in the  last days, even with bad reports, SIL still had  a ready  laugh and a joke, and his eyes still  sparkled.  The word ""unique"" is badly overused these  days, but perhaps we should retire it in mem ory of SILVIO CONTE-along with his baseball  shirt. No House Member in my memory has  combined hard work and seriousness of pur pose with the humor that disarms and yields  victories without enemies. What a guy!  Serving with SILVIO on  the Transportation  Subcommittee, on the full Appropriations Com mittee, and in the House itself has been a rare  privilege.  I will miss him, as we all will, and  Joan and I send our warmest condolences to  Corinne and the family.  ",1991
137,House,102,0.646,1471,3,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  Henry Clay once said, ""Of all the properties  which belong to honorable men, not one is so  highly prized as that of character."" The House  of Representatives  recently  lost one of  its  Members who truly personified character.  SILVIO CONTE admirably served  the First  District of Massachusetts  for 32 years.  In a  time when many Members are ensnared in the  trap of providing pork barrel projects to their  constituency with no regard to the  impact of  this spending on the rest of the Nation, SILVIO  demonstrated  the  delicate  balance  of  the  needs of his constituents in light of the needs  of the Nation. In doing so, he received the re spect and admiration of his colleagues and all  those who crossed his path.  One of the characteristics I respected most  about SILVIO was  the principles  to which he  adhered. He never shied away  from a fight  and was never afraid to let us know when he  objected to the business before the House. He  was confrontational, but he was also a gen tleman. One always left a fight admiring and  respecting  him more-whether you  agreed  with him or not.  I join my colleagues in expressing my sin cere sorrow in the recent loss of our friend. He  will be greatly missed, but certainly never for gotten by those who had the great privilege of  serving with him.  ",1991
138,House,102,0.203,1471,3,Mr. GALLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to express  my deep sadness over the loss of one of the  country's most loyal and honorable servants SILVIO CONTE of Massachusetts.  For the 6 years I have been in Congress, I  was fortunate to have served all those years  with SIL CONTE,  first on  the Small Business  Committee and  then on  the Appropriations  Committee.  During that time, we shared a pride in our  heritage, a love of the sport of baseball, and  most important, we shared a strong belief in  the value of working within the political proc ess to get things done.  There was never a job, an issue, a person  or a need that was too big or too small for SIL  CONTE's full attention.  As  the  ranking Republican on  the House  Appropriations Committee, SIL was an ardent  supporter of programs  for  the most needy  people and for the priorities of the country as  a whole. Whether  it was  funding  for people  who couldn't afford to heat their homes in the  winter or participating  in the budget summit,  SIL gave it his all.  As a member on the Small Business Com mittee, SIL took time from his major work on  appropriations to listen to the men and women  working to keep America strong. If SIL felt that  the voice of the working person wasn't being  heard around here, he was sure to remind us.  SIL was as comfortable with Presidents as  he was with  the man or woman  on  the  street-and he was  respected and  loved by  both.  Mr. Speaker,  I will miss SILVIO CONTE and  this House just doesn't feel the same without  him. But SIL set a standard for public service  we won't forget-to always remember where  we came  from, never  lose our devotion  to  what is  important, and to keep our sense of  humor even at the toughest times.

168,,102,-0.225,1523,3,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, we all  know about the health crisis  in America. For  many Americans the emergency room  is the  only health service available.  Insufficient pre ventative sevices for the poor turn treatable ill nesses into terminal illnesses.  That is why I am reintroducing the Women's  Health Care Coverage Expansion Act. This bill  expands Medicare and Medicaid  reimburse ments  to  include obstetric and gynecologic  services provided by nurse practitioners.  By expanding Medicaid and Medicare reim bursement, more women will have the chance  to stop deadly diseases,  like cancer, before  they start. We can treat them  in clinics, not  emergency rooms.  In addition, women needing obstetric serv ices will  receive  the kind of preventive care  that saves lives and money.  Forty thousand babies die each year in the  United States, and many of these deaths are  preventable-through early prenatal care. But  many State Medicaid offices face shortages of  Medicaid providers. While States search  for  Medicaid providers, pregnant patients wait for  prenatal care. At the same time, well-trained  nurse practitioners are willing to see  the pa tients, but cannot be directly reimbursed  for  their services.  The range of services that nurse practition ers can provide  is impressive: preconceptual  and prenatal care; contraceptive management;  the management of common gynecological  care, including management of sexually trans mitted diseases; and  cancer screening  for  women of all ages.  We have taken steps recently  to  increase  women's health services.  In 1989 Congress  expanded Medicaid coverage to include pedi atric nurse practitioners and family nurse prac titioners.  In addition, Congress provided pap  smear coverage for women who had not had  the  test in the previous 3 years. But further  steps must be  taken  to provide adequate  health care to women.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  I hope my colleagues will  join me  in supporting this important bill. Nurse practitioners  can help alleviate some of America's health  woes. It is OUr responsibility to let them help.  THE CITY OF LYNWOOD AND THE  BOROUGH  OF  . POINT  FORTIN,  TRINIDAD,  JOIN  AS  SISTER  CITIES  HON. MERVYN M. DYMALLY  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 27, 1991  Mr. DYMALL Y. Mr. Speaker,  I am pleased  to know that the city of Lynwood, CA and the  Borough of Point Fortin, Trinidad, West Indies,  are joining as sister cities.  It is my good for tune to represent Lynwood as well as having  grown up in the county of St. Patrich in which  Point Fortin is located.  The sister city concept was  introduced  in  1956 by President Eisenhower at a White  House conference as part of his People-to People Program. His idea was to involve peo ple and organized groups at all  levels of our  society  in personal diplomacy.  I share  this  goal for both of these fine cities. It is my hope  that this program would provide residents of  both Lynwood and Point Fortin with an oppor tunity to  learn about and share each other's  rich culture.  The borough for Point Fortin  is a pleasant  and growing community which was created in  1980. It was the first and only borough to be  created since  the country achieved  its  inde pendence  from Britain  in 1962.  It was my  pleasure and honor to be the first U.S. Con gressman to visit Point Fortin.  I was well re ceived and enjoyed the people's friendly hos pitality. Lynwood is known for its ethnic diver sity and is a sample of the fabric which com prise  the mosaic of our society.  It also has  been recognized as a city that is committed to  the development and support of its youth.  It is my hope that these two cities might be  able  to promote exchanges  in culture, busi ness, trade, or other projects of mutual inter est.  I believe this relationship will strengthen  ties between the American people and the Re public of Trinidad, Tobago.  MICKEY LELAND MEDAL  PRESENTATION CEREMONY  HON. BIU RICHARDSON  OF NEW MEXICO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 27, 1991  ",1991
169,,102,-0.321,1523,3,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, my  late  colleague Mickey Leland was recently honored  by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization  for his  international work as an advocate of  the poor and hungry. Mickey worked tirelessly  to  seek  long-term solutions  for world  food  problems, not  just  in Congress  through  the  Select Committee on Hunger which he found ed and which keeps alive his heritage, but  also through concerned individuals and organi zations. Like the FAO,  I would like to record  my appreciation for Mickey's idealism and in4581  in  the  this  tribute printed  tegrity by having  RECORD.  MICKEY LELAND MEDAL PRESENTATION CERE MONY, WASHINGTON, DC, FEBRUARY 21, 1991  (Address by Edouard Saouma, Director-Gen eral of the Food and Agriculture Organiza tion of the United Nations)  Mrs. Leland, Congressman Hall, Members  of the Select Committee on Hunger, Distin guished Guests, Dear Friends, Mickey Leland  has been greatly missed, and the country he  left behind has already done much to honour  and preserve his memory. But he did not  serve only the United States; he served the  world.  The aim of ensuring humanity's freedom  from hunger, which guides FAO as an inter national organization, guided Mickey Leland  as an individual. It took him from the plains  of Texas to the highlands of Ethiopia.  I bring today a  tribute from FAO to the  international work of Mickey Leland. It is  offered with all the humility which we, the  living, must show toward the memory of one  who has made the supreme sacrifice. It takes  the form of a medal specially struck, which  it is my privilege to offer to Alison Leland in  honour of her late husband.  Mickey Leland was an advocate of the poor  and  the hungry. Thanks  to his  skills  in  working with the Standing Committees of  Congress, with prominent  individuals and  with outside organizations, he kept world  hunger high on the national agenda of this  country. He was also a man of action. He  went straight to the heart of the worst fam ines in Africa.  The flight that was his last-and the last  for his travelling companions-was his sixth  visit to victims of starvation in the remoter  areas of Ethiopia. The help he was able to  mobilize saved innumerable lives.  Alas, Africa today needs another Mickey  Leland. The deadly combination of poor har vests and civil strife again  threatens mil lions of lives in Ethiopia and the Sudan, in  Liberia, in Angola and Mozambique. Massive  international aid is once more vitally impor tant and tremendously urgent.  While we perhaps remember most easily  the actions of Mickey Leland to bring relief  to the starving, he was fully conscious of the  need to seek long-term solutions for world  food  problems. His underlying philosophy  was to promote food self-sufficiency in devel oping  countries,  and  the  socio-economic  progress of the poorest strata of society.  In commemorating this man of compulsive  idealism and passionate  integrity,  I wish  also to pay tribute to the Select Committee  on Hunger, which he did so much to found  and to guide. The aims of the Committee,  and the aims of F AO, converge in the strug gle for a world that is free  from hunger man's oldest enemy. The continuing vitality  of the Select Committee is one of the finest  legacies that Mickey Leland has left behind.  The Select Committee could hardly thrive  if it did not respond to an aspiration of the  people of this country. The existence of the  Select Committee-a body unique among the  legislatures that I know-is witness to the  commitment of the United States to the aim  of ending world hunger. This is the commit ment that inspired the Conference on Food  and Agriculture, held at Hot Springs, Vir ginia, in the midst of the Second World War:  the Conference that led to the creation of  FAO. A host of later American initiatives  fashioned  the system of  international co operation that we know today. It is a system  that will surely be even more important and even more dependent on United States  support-in the world of tomorrow.  ",1991
170,,102,0.017,1536,3,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker, develop ments in the Persian Gulf this week suggest  that the war is  in  its final moments and  the  men and women serving in our Armed Forces  may soon be coming home.  As our soldiers and sailors and airmen and  marines  return  from  the Middle East,  they  have every right to expect from their country  appropriate benefits and services  to address  their concerns and needs.  They have a right to expect information and  assistance from counselors to direct them to ward needed services.  A combat-disabled veteran has a right to ex pect that, when he files a claim for compensa tion benefits or vocational rehabilitation, it will  be processed quickly and the benefits will be  delivered on a timely basis. They should not  have to wait.  Veterans have a right  to expect that their  claims for benefits to further their education or  purchase homes will not be delayed because  of lack of staff or inadequate resources.  They have a right to expect our veterans'  hospitals to be adequately staffed and capable  of delivering quality medical care.  And when the time comes, they have a right  to expect that they will not be  laid to rest in  a poorly maintained cemetery.  As we continue to assemble a package of  benefits to meet the needs of these new veter ans, as well as  the current population, we  must keep in mind that these benefits are as  much a cost of war as any weaponry or tech nology.  Testifying before the Joint House and Sen ate Veterans' Affairs Committees yesterday,  the National Commander of Disabled Amer ican Veterans, Joseph Andry, very eloquently  implored us not to forget the ""people"" aspect  of war and the commitment to  the warrior.  I  have never heard a more poignant statement  in  this  regard and am pleased  to share his  words with my colleagues:  STATEMENT OF JOSEPH E. ANDRY, NATIONAL  COMMANDER, DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS  Messrs. Chairman and Members of the Vet erans Affairs Committees:  On behalf of the over 1.3 million members  of the Disabled American Veterans and its  Ladies' Auxiliary, may I say that it is indeed  an honor and a privilege to appear before you  today on behalf of our Nation's wartime dis abled, their dependents and survivors.  To those of you who are returning to serve  on the Veterans Affairs Committees, and to  you who are embarking on such service, we  in the DA V wish you ""God speed"" at the  onset of this, the 102nd Congress of the Unit ed States of America.  Messrs. Chairmen, I am both proud and  humbled to act as a spokesman for veterans  at such a time in our Nation's history.  We are presently at war. For the fifth time  in some seven decades, America has become  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  engaged in a_ major conflict and placed her  sons and daughters in harm's way on foreign  shores.  Wars past and present, have a terrible con tinuity.  Though the sound and fury of the Argonne  during World War I has long since ended, its  faint echo was caught up and passed along at  Guadalcanal and the Beaches of Normandy;  again at Pusan and Pork Chop Hill; and once  more during Tet and Khe Sanh. Now, yet  again, it crashes and thunders for all to hear  in the Persian Gulf.  So too, the human costs of war. The emo tional and physical scars of those who served  are also passed on from one generation to  the next, sometimes fading from public con sciousness, only  to return and fade again.  These too have always been with us.  It is to these human costs and their ensu ing obligation on the part of our government  that I shall speak to today.  Messrs. Chairmen, I am a Vietnam veteran.  That is the context of my experience. And  though ""my war,"" if you will, may have been  unique in terms of its conduct, outcome and  impact upon our society, as a disabled vet eran of that war I am no different from, and  have shared common experiences with, dis abled veterans of prior conflicts.  Whether volunteer or draftee, we  found  ourselves in uniform and,  though we com plained and grumbled, we served. In combat,  we  shared and witnessed both the  terrible  and  the wonderful  . . .  fear and pain,  the  death of a friend; and acts of great compas sion and  love and  the making of  lasting  friendships. And when our wars were over,  there was the sheer relief of survival and the  joy of returning home.  As veterans, however, our need to depend  upon one another did not end with our depar ture from  the battlefield. The memories of  what we endured and what we saw, and the  needs of our fellow disabled veterans,  re quired our continued association and focus.  As a Vietnam veteran, I returned to a sys tem of benefits and services forged by my  predecessors-veterans of World War II, and  the Korean conflict, found in service organi zations such as the DA V and in public posi tions of power such as the U.S. Congress.  And in the intervening years since my re turn, like my predecessors, I have seen our  system of benefits both wax and wane,  its  fortune shift, subject  to  fading memories,  hard economic  times and competing inter ests.  In 1918  I am certain  that no  returning  doughboy could ever have envisioned the re alities of the Bonus March and Economy Act  of the 1930's. World War II veterans, flushed  with victory and public adulation  in 1945,  could not have imagined the adverse benefit  recommendations of  the Bradley Commis sion in the 1950's. My generation, though not  regaled with parades and ticker tape, had no  idea that it would take twenty years for our  service to be placed in a rational perspective.  Messrs. Chairmen, I do not wish these ob servations to be misconstrued.  America's veterans are proud of their serv ice. The vast majority of us feel that, more  than a responsibility, it is a privilege to don  our country's uniform. And we are grateful  for our system of benefits and the public sup port upon which it rests and depends.  But as a veterans's advocate, you and I  both know our benefit system has been sub ject to these cyclical changes. And that in  the last decade it has undergone a serious de cline. And as veterans' advocates, you and I  both have a responsibility to speak out and  attempt to set things right.  February 27, 1991  Today, this is absolutely essential-indeed,  it is a moral necessity-as the best of our  country's young men and women place their  lives and well-being on the line in the Per sian Gulf.  Do I exaggerate? Is it possible that even as  our government sent its youth into battle  and assured them of its support, that same  government was making decisions to reduce  their  entitlements  should  they  return  wounded and disabled? And that same gov ernment now contemplates still other deci sions that will undercut its ability to pro vide care?  Let us  look at  the budget  agreement  reached last Fall in the midst of our troop  buildup in the Persian Gulf.  Proclaimed as universal belt  tightening  that would be applied equally  to all pro grams,  the VA's portion of this agreement  was a $621 million reduction in 1991 existing  benefit levels. It will grow to over $3.6 billion  during the next five years.  Messrs. Chairmen, no one, least of all we in  the DA V and your two Committees, wanted  to see this occur. But deficit reduction was  upon us, hard choices had to be made and,  again, everyone was  to bite  the same dis tasteful bullet.  But when the dust cleared, were veterans  treated fairly? Were all oxen equally gored?  More  importantly, did we keep faith with  those we were even then sending into harm's  way?  Some of the reductions,  though not wel comed, were responsibily fashioned and de signed to impact upon those most able to re ceive  them. New medical care copayments  and reimbursements, income verification for  means tested programs, and increased user  fees are among their number.  But of the $3.6 billion total figure, over $1  billion was achieved through:  Reducing  disability  compensation  pay ments to veterans found incompetent to han dle their own personal finances;  Removing DIC eligibility from certain wid ows;  Eliminating  vocational  rehabilitation  training for certain disabled veterans;  Eliminating burial benefits  to survivors;  and  Delaying the receipt of a COLA adjustment  to disabled veterans,  their widows and or phans.  Messrs. Chairmen, does anyone think that  these decisions, arrived at in the eleventh  hour of a behind-closed-door deficit reduc tion process, could have stood the light of  day and been accepted by the American peo ple?  I don't think so. Not for a second.  And did these actions, hidden from public  view, reflect a uniform, across-the-board pol icy that was applied to all programs?  As payments  to some 4,100  incompetent  veterans were being reduced, this same budg et act added reforms to ensure that 3.3 mil lion incompetent Social Security recipients  received all entitlements due.  As DIC eligibility was removed from veter an's widows whose  second marrige  termi nated, the same act changed the law so that  widows of CIA personnel could continue to  draw benefits when they remarried at age 55.  This presently applies to all widows under  the Federal Employees Retirement System.  And while VA disability and death com pensation recipients were required to under go a one month delay in the effective date of  their COLA, all other categories of federal  beneficiaries were  subjected  to  no  such  delay.  Messrs. Chairmen, veterans and their pro grams, without question, were unfairly sin",1991
171,,102,0.254,1549,3,Mr. CHANDLER.," Mr. Speaker, Americans  everywhere have gone out of  their way  to  reach out to our troops in the Persian Gulf and  their families. Today, I want to compliment the  efforts taken by my State's colleges and uni versities on behalf of  the young men and  women serving  in our armed services, many  of whom also are students.  Last November, the country's major higher  education associations asked the Nation's uni versities and colleges to develop tuition refund  and credit policies for students called to active  duty as part of the National Guard or military  Reserves. As  these associations pointed out  to their member institutions, ""although Federal  laws * * * impose obligations on employers  and creditors with respect to employees and  debtors in active military service, to date these  laws have not been extended to colleges and  universities regarding students in military serv ice."" They went on to say, ""we believe * * *  tuition refunds or credits-for these students are appropriate.* * *""  The positive response has been overwhelm ing.  In my own State of Washington, both private  and  public  institutions  answered  the  call.  Schools have not only offered tuition refunds  and granted credits, but additional  refunds  have been made  for parking,  books,  and  housing expenses. Washington State Univer sity,  the University of Washington, Western,  Central and Eastern Washington Universities,  and the Evergreen State College all have ex emplary policies  in place. My State's private  and community colleges also have responded  favorably  in extending every consideration to  students called to active duty.  I wholeheartedly applaud  these schools and the thousands  like them across our Na tion-for seeing to it that students who have  been called out of class  to  join their  fellow  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  countrymen  in  the Persian Gulf  can  con centrate on the mission at hand without having  to worry about school payments, fees, or lost  credits.  Mr. Speaker,  I  recognize  there may be  schools that have not been so responsible.  I  urge those schools to answer the call-follow  the example offered by Washington State's in stitutions  that have done so voluntarily and  without Government regulation. Act now to join  the  ranks of  the  responsible within our Na tion's higher education community.  I encourage my colleagues to join me today  in commending and thanking the vast majority  of our higher education institutions, their edu cators  and  administrators,  for  their  heart warming and noble support of our Nation's  newest heroes.  DRUG CRIME LEGISLATION  HON. WilliAM F. GOODUNG  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 27, 1991  ",1991
172,,102,0.336,1549,3,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  I am  introducing  legislation which would  change  Federal law to impose stiffer penalties on peo ple convicted of lesser drug offenses involving  firearms. Under current Federal law, a person  convicted of a  felony crime  involving drugs  and  firearms  faces  increased criminal pen alties and is also prohibited from legally own ing a firearm. This is not the case, however,  for  individuals convicted of less serious drug  offenses.  My legislation is simple:  it expands current  law to treat individuals who commit less-seri ous drug offenses  in  the same manner as  people involved in other drug crimes, such as  drug-trafficking. Any person  found guilty of a  drug crime not currently classified as a felony,  including simple possession of a controlled  substance, and who possesses a firearm at  the time of the offense, will face jail time and/  or mandatory fines  in addition to any penalty  imposed for the drug offense. For second or  subsequent offenses, mandatory jail time and  fines are mandated.  Furthermore,  regardless of whether a fire arm  is present during  the offense,  the guilty  party will also be prohibited  from owning a  firearm in the future, if they are convicted after  enactment of the  law. Exceptions to this rule  can be made, however, depending upon the  circumstances  surrounding each  individual's  case. Present law states that a person con victed of a drug crime can petition to the Sec retary of the Treasury for an exemption to the  firearms prohibition if they can prove that the  circumstances  regarding  the conviction, and  the applicant's record and reputation, are such  that the applicant will not be likely to act in a  manner dangerous  to public safety and  that  the granting of the relief would not be contrary  to the public interest.  The effectiveness of current  tactics being  employed in the war on drugs is the subject of  heated debate. In my view, the time has come  for serious efforts to convince people who use  drugs that the cost of engaging in this activity  outweighs any benefits.  If my bill becomes  law, individuals who use drugs and own fire4607  arms for legitimate purposes-hunting, target shooting, collecting, or personal protection and who also engage in recreational drug use,  will  think  twice before participating  in  their  drug-related endeavors.  This bill will not affect a law-abiding citizen's  right  to own a  firearm.  It will, however,  in crease the price of drug-use for people who  choose  to continue  this  illegal and self-de structive activity. We all know  that  the drug  problem  is expensive to society as a whole;  let's try to transfer more of the costs to those  who use and abuse controlled substances.  SBIC PROGRESS ACT OF 1991  HON. JOHN J. laF ALCE  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 27, 1991  ",1991
173,House,102,-0.278,51,7,Mr. GAYDOS.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank my  colleague  for  yielding.  I  want to congratulate the gentleman up  front for taking the time. He and Mr.  MCDADE, and I understand we have an other half hour or so if we need it. We  will not have a shortage of time.  Let me make some offhand remarks  before  I go  into my prepared state ment. I knew the Senator when he first  came to the House of Representatives.  I was with him, with a whole delega tion when we were going at one time,  flying up to Pennsylvania to attend the  funeral of our colleague, Congressman  Saylor. I remember we had a two-plane  delegation. Senator HEINZ was on the  first plane.  I happened  to be,  fortu nately, at  that  time, on  the second  plane.  Up in Johnstown, people have to un derstand that it's on a plateau, and the  winds are very fierce. Once the winds  start blowing in Johnstown, PA, it is  very difficult  to handle a  plane on  takeoff or  landing. We had, at  that  time, I think for Congressman Saylor's  funeral delegation, something like 60  to 70 Members attending, and that was  Mr.  ",1991
174,House,102,-0.004,64,7,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my  colleagues in paying tribute to a man who was  dedicated to securing a better way of life for  the  little guy,  the blue-collar worker,  the  re tiree, and the aged and the infirmed, as well  as all Pennsylvanians-a man who served this  country with the utmost distinction for nearly  20 years.  I speak, of course, of JOHN HEINZ,  who was killed tragically while still very much  in the prime of his exceedingly productive and  full life.  I had the pleasure and the honor of serving  in  the House with JOHN HEINZ during  the 5  years that he represented the people of Penn sylvania's 18th District. John always believed  that what made a difference in life was people.  So, despite coming to the Congress as one of  its wealthiest Members as well as with a name  that was well known on millions of kitchen ta bles across the country, he showed himself to  be true to his convictions and quickly became  a champion of the common man.  After  just 5 years as a member of  the  House, JOHN won election to the U.S. Senate,  where he continued his crusade to get a fair  deal for the  little guy. The senior citizens of  Pennsylvania and  the entire Nation had no  better friend than Senator JOHN HEINZ. As the  ranking Republican on the Special Committee  on Aging, he tirelessly labored to ensure that  senior citizens, who had given so much to our  country, were treated with the dignity and fair ness that they deserved. Ironically, it was this  very dedication that led to JOHN'S tragic and  untimely death.  As anyone who has driven through the Key stone  State  knows,  Pennsylvania  license  plates carry the saying ""You've Got a Friend  in Pennsylvania."" Well, there was no greater  friend  of Pennsylvania  than  JOHN  HEINZ.  Whether the issue was military base closures  or taxation of home heating oil or American  export policy, JOHN HEINZ was there to see to  it that Pennsylvania got a fair shake. For this  steadfast devotion, he was  rewarded by  the  people of Pennsylvania by  their making him  their first U.S. Senator to be elected by a mar gin of more than 1 million votes.  In fact, his  popularity was so great that he never lost an  election. He was a perfect 6-0.  As the cofounder of the Northeast-Midwest  Congressional Coalition,  the death of JOHN  HEINZ  is a particularly tragic loss.  I had the  distinct honor of working with him as he estab lished and developed  the Northeast-Midwest  Senate Coalition, the sister organization of the  Northeast-Midwest  Congressional  Coalition,  which my good  friend, Mr. WOLPE,  and  I  cochair. HOWARD and I, as well as the entire  membership, will miss JOHN HEINZ' leadership  and his commitment to the region. We relied  on him  to advance  the agenda of  the  the  Northeast-Midwest in the Senate. He never let  us down.  Although Senator HEINZ is best remembered  as a champion of the elderly, he was also a  vigorous advocate  in many other areas, per haps most notably, trade. He was deeply com mitted  to  improving our Nation's economic  competitiveness through trade. He helped lead  the way to stronger laws against unfair foreign  trade practices-practices which hit the work ing men and women in the steel and other in dustries of his home State and region particu larly strongly. He was an internationally recog nized expert of export policy, sponsoring the  Export Trading Company Act and the Export  Administration  Act,  among  others.  Today,  these important laws stand as part of his leg acy.  Regardless of how great an  impact JOHN  HEINZ made as a Member of Congress, he  was always  first and  foremost a dedicated  family man. A devoted husband and  father,  JOHN leaves behind a lovely wife, Teresa, and  three sons, John IV, Andre, and Christopher.  Whether enjoying  the warm weather and re freshing sea air of a Nantucket summer week end or the serene powder of Sun Valley, he  cherished the time he had to spend alone with  his family. To them, I would like to extend the  deepest  heartfelt  sympathies  of my wife,  Nancy, and myself.  The U.S. Senate  is  forever diminished by  the death of JOHN HEINZ. The people of the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have  lost a  resolute advocate and defender, and the Unit ed States an outstanding  statesman. As  I  m~ntioned at the outset, JOHN always stressed  the importance of people.  I am proud to say  that Senator HEINZ was one person who made  a world  of difference. He will  be  deeply  missed.  ",1991
175,House,102,-0.61,64,7,Mr. ROYBAL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to express  my sorrow at the sudden death of my longtime  friend and colleague from the other Chamber,  Senator JOHN HEINZ, who passed away  in a  tragic accident on April 4.  I have known JOHN HEINZ since he was first  elected  to  the House of Representatives  in  1971 . During the time he served in Congress,  I came to admire him as a stalwart champion  of the frail and elderly. He also firmly believed  that all Americans should have access to af fordable health care.  As  chairman,  and  later  ranking minority  member of the Special Aging Committee, Sen ator HEINZ always  tried  to ensure a decent  standard of living for older Americans. Wheth er he was protecting the Social Security fund  from bankruptcy or fighting against mandatory  retirement ages, JOHN HEINZ could be counted  on to speak out for the elderly. When his life  was so abruptly ended, he was on his way to  a hearing in Philadelphia to publicize corrupt  telemarketers who have been bilking elderly  and poor Americans of their hard-earned sav ings.  Mr. Speaker, in his long tenure in Congress,  JOHN HEINZ earned the esteem and respect of  his colleagues in both Chambers. His memory  will be cherished by all who served with him.  ",1991
176,House,102,-0.153,64,7,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Speaker, I join today with  my colleagues to pay tribute to Senator JOHN  HEINZ whose life so tragically ended in a plane  crash a few weeks ago.  Throughout his 20 years of service  in  the  House of Representatives and then the Sen ate, he dedicated himself  to  the people of  Pennsylvania and to the people of this coun try. He was a tireless advocate for the elderly.  As ranking member and chairman of the Spe cial Committee on Aging and as a member of  the National Commission on Social Security  Reform, he worked  to  remove employment  barriers  for the elderly,  to secure stability of  retirement income, and to improve the quality  of health care for the elderly. He recognized  the important contributions that senior citizens  can and do make to our society.  Senator HEINZ also  recognized  the  impor tance of this Nation's industrial base and the  real human costs of the decline in the steel in dustry. He worked to end unfair foreign trading  practices, to enhance the competitiveness of  our industries, and to protect American jobs.  Senator HEINZ served his constituents and  this Nation with extraordinary energy and dedi cation. He will surely be missed by the. Mem bers of this House and of the other Chamber,  the people of Pennsylvania, and the people of  the United States.  ",1991
177,Senate,102,-0.355,90,7,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, will the  chairman yield for a question?  ",1991
178,,102,-0.301,103,7,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Our case says that  the integrity of the trust funds depends  upon a long, unbroken record of using  pension fund contributions for pensions  and not for other purposes. If you want  to put these funds in jeopardy in the  long run, establish today the idea that  they can be used for other things be sides benefits. Establish the principle  that  the  funds  can be diverted  to  nonpension  purposes with  impunity,  and in vast sums. This very week we  will spend more than $1 billion in trust  fund moneys for the general purposes  of government, everything from battle ships to paper clips, as it has been put,  but not for pensions.  Once  you  establish  that principle,  once you break that trust, once you  record in statute that we will use trust  funds for nontrust fund purposes, what  is left of the integrity of the system?  What is to prevent future reductions in  benefits in order to use the moneys for  other things? \Vhat is to prevent the  elimination of whole programs in order  to use the money for other things?  I marvel that we do not already have  an outraged public; 132 million people  pay into this system every year, and it  is a fact that their payments are being  diverted to purposes other than what it  says on their paycheck: ""Federal In surance Contribution Act."" If this were  done by a private company or a union  pension  fund  for  any  such arrange ment,  the penalties under civil and  criminal law, would be swift and venge ful. Ask any attorney, what  is  the  greatest and most solemn obligation  you undertake as a member of the bar?  They will say: as a trustee. \Ve are the  trustees of these funds.  The Members of this body, if it comes  to that, may very well regret the day  they vote to use  trust funds for pur poses other than that for which they  were formed. The day will come when,  on the political campaigns of this dec ade and the next,  the incumbent will  have to answer the question: Senator,  did you vote to use trust funds for pur",1991
179,Senate,102,-0.123,129,7,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr President,  I  rise  today to join my friend and colleague,  Senator MACK in introducing the Can cer Screening Incentive Act of 1990.  This  legislation has  two  essential  provisions. The first would give a re fundable tax credit of up to $250 to tax payers and their dependents who un dergo  certain  cancer  screening  and  early detection procedures. We hope to  encourage many Americans who are at  risk of certain kinds of preventable and  treatable cancers to go to their doctors  and have tests done.  The second part of  the bill would  make a small credit available to health  care providers for the costs they incur  in providing screening services to low income individuals. We have included  this new provision so that very low in come Americans can also benefit from  what we are  trying  to do. The very  poor are not likely to be able to afford  the up  front costs of screenings,  so  would not be likely to qualify for the  credit. The services would be free  to  the individual and the amount of the  credit for heal th care providers would  be determined by  the Department of  ",1991
180,Senate,102,-0.303,142,7,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce the Nursing School  Clinics Act of 1991, a bill that has two  main purposes. First, it builds on our  concerted efforts to provide access to  quality health care for all Americans  by furnishing grants and incentives for  nursing schools  to establish primary  care clinics in areas where additional  medical services are most needed. Sec ond,  it provides  the opportunity  for  nursing schools to enhance the scope of  their students' training and education  by giving them firsthand clinical expe rience in primary care facilities.  Any good manager knows that when  major problems are at hand and re sources are tight, the most important  act is the one that makes full use of all  available  resources.  The  American  health care system is particularly defi cient in this regard. We all know only  too well that many individuals in the  Nation have no or inadequate access to  health care services, especially if they  live in many of our rural towns and vil lages or  inhabit our  Indian commu nities. Many good people are trying to  deliver the services that are so vitally  needed, but we need  to do more. We  must make full use of all heal th care  practitioners,  especially  those  who  have been long waiting to give the Na tion the full measure of their profes sional abilities.  Nursing is one of the noblest profes sions, with an enduring history of of fering effective and sensitive care  to  those in need. Yet it is only in the last  few years that we have begun to recog nize the role that nurses can play as  independent providers of care. Just last  year Medicare was changed to author ize  direct  reimbursements  to  nurse  practitioners. Medicaid  is  gradually  being  reformed  to  incorporate  their  services more effectively. The Nursing  School  Clinics  Act  continues  the  progress  toward  fully  incorporating  nurses in the delivery of health care  services. Under the act, nursing schools  will be able to establish clinics, super vised and staffed by nurse practitioners  and nurse practitioner students,  that  provide primary care targeted to medi cally  underserved  rural  and  native  American populations.  In the process of giving direct ambu latory care  to  their patients,  these  clinics will also furnish the forums in  which both public and private schools  of nursing can design and implement  clinical  training programs  for  their  students.  Simultaneous  school-based  education and clinical  training have  been a traditional part of physician de velopment, but nurses have  enjoyed  fewer opportunities  to combine class room instruction with the practical ex perience of treating patients. This bill  reinforces  the principle for nurses of  joining schooling with the actual prac tice of medical care.  To accomplish these objectives,  the  bill has  three main parts. First,  it  amends  the  Indian Heal th  Improve ment Act to authorize up to $5 million  in grants to public and private nursing  schools as seed money for the creation  of primary care clinics to be run by the  nursing schools. As part of developing  the clinics, funds could be used on such  concerns as clinical program develop ment,  faculty enhancement, and stu dent  fellowships. Nursing schools  re ceiving these grants would be required  to establish their clinics where Indians  would have easy access to them. Sec ond, another $5 million in grants are  authorized in the Public Health Service  Nursing Education Program  for  the  same purposes and for schools that de veloped  clinics  in medically  under served areas. Third,  titles XVIII and  XIX of  the Social Security Act are  amended to designate that the services  provided in these nursing school clinics  are reimbursable under Medicare and  Medicaid. The combination of grants  and the provision of Medicare and Med icaid reimbursement furnishes  the in centives and operational resources nec essary to start the clinics and to keep  them going.  To meet the increasing challenge of  bringing  cost-effective  and  quality  heal th care to all Americans, we are  going to have to think about and de bate a variety of proposals, both large  and small. Most  important, however,  we must approach the issue of health  care with creativity and determina tion, ensuring that all reasonable ave nues are pursued. Nurses have always  been an integral part of heal th care de li very. The Nursing School Clinics Act  of 1991 recognizes the central role they  can perform as caregivers to the medi cally underserved.

A bill to amend the Federal  Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide  Act to improve the safety of exported  pesticides, and for other purposes;  to  the Committee on Agriculture, Nutri tion, and Forestry.  CIRCLE OF POISON PREVENTION ACT   ",1991
181,Senate,102,-0.374,142,7,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr.  President,  every  day, millions of Americans are exposed  to needless risk.  In neighborhood supermarkets, they  unknowingly buy food grown overseas  that has been sprayed with pesticides  so dangerous that EPA refuses to let  our farmers use  them  in  the United  States.  Worse yet, some of these pesticides  are made by U.S. companies right here  in America. And because FDA waives  through virtually all  imported  food  without  inspection,  these  chemicals  often end up on America's dinner table.  This  is  the  ""Circle of Poison.""  It  must be broken.  America is one of the safest food sup pliers in the world. We are constantly  seeking ways to make the best better.  But at a time when we are toughen ing standards at home,  it makes no  sense to allow American companies to  use a loophole in current law to dump  unsafe pesticides abroad-only to have  these chemicals show up in imported  foods in America's supermarkets.  One-fourth of the produce we eat is  imported. That's 135 pounds of fruits  and vegetables for every man, woman,  and child.  Although FDA is responsible for in specting almost all imported food,  it  only samples a minuscule 1 to 2 percent  of the food entering this country. The  rest is simply waived through at the  wharf. Overall, 5 percent of FDA-sam pled imported food was found contami nated with  illegal pesticides, where  there is no domestic tolerance or which  are illegal to use in the United States.  The actual violation rate may be sub stantially higher because FDA  rou tinely fails to screen for scores of pes ticides.  Breaking the circle of poison means  stopping U.S. chemical companies from  dumping pesticides overseas that EPA  considers unsafe. It means reducing the  chance  that  these banned chemicals  will  find  their way  into our school children's lunch sacks.

184,,102,0.426,207,7,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask  my colleagues to join me in congratulating the  Lewisburg United Methodist Homes which will  be celebrating ""75 Years of Christian Caring""  on May 18, 1991.  In 1879, Father Adolph Weidmeyer of Balti more County, MD,  recognized  the commu nity's need for a home for old people as an  agency of the church. Seeing  this need, he  placed $115 in a trust, to be cared for by his  son P.C. Weidmeyer, until a home could be  built.  This fund  later came under the custody of  the Central Pennsylvania Conference of  the  Evangelical Church. About  the  same  time,  Rev. Ammon Stapleton, A.M., D.D. of Wil liamsport, PA, recognized the need for an or phanage. The conference decided to join both  of these causes in March 1916.  The fir$t real step took place in March 1916  when the United Evangelical Home purchased  the Ross mansion and  farm near Lewisburg.  Members of the church joined in the cause by  donating whatever  they could  to make  the  home successful.  For 36 years,  the orphanage provided a  home  to over 250 children. They set up a  healthy living environment where the children  could  live a happy childhood and grow  into  caring citizens.  The members of the church provided land,  money, and most  importantly,  time  to  take  care of others in their community.  In 1988,  the Lewisburg United Methodist  Homes changed  its corporate name  to  the  United Methodist Continuing Care Services.  As you can see,  I am very proud to have  these caring and hard-working people in my  constituency. They go beyond their call of duty  to help their fellow man. They are lessons to  the youth and great examples of ideal citizens.  I hope that they will continue to grow and  have another successful 75 years. They are  greatly appreciated by all of us.  I ask you to  join me  in both  thanking and congratulating  them on  their 75 years of dedication to the  17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  BLOCKBUSTER  ENTERTAINMENT  CORP. NAMED COMPANY OF THE  YEAR  HON. ILEANA ROS.LEHTINEN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 23, 1991  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  I am  pleased to recognize today Blockbuster Enter tainment Corp. which was recently named by  the Miami Herald as the Florida Company of  the Year for 1990.  Blockbuster, and  its chairman, H. Wayne  Huizenga,  has  revolutionized  the  video cassette rental  industry with a chain of fran chised stores. The south Florida-based  firm  has grown rapidly to become the world's larg est video chain with more than 1,600 stores  serviced by 26,000 employees.  The Herald panel of  judges, all deans of  business schools at Florida universities, se lected Blockbuster for its remarkable growth,  its ability to fund expansion without incurring  large debt, and its community service efforts.  They also applauded the company's refusal to  carry X-rated adult videos in its stores.  In 1990, Blockbuster's revenues passed the  $1 billion mark for the first time in the compa ny's history, totaling $1.13 billion, a 71-percent  increase over 1989. This rapid growth shows  that the American dream can still come  true  for those willing to take the risks to make their  vision a reality.  Along with Blockbuster,  the Miami Herald  also nominated six other south Florida firms  for the 1990 award: American Bankers Insur ance of Miami, Peoples Telephone of Miami,  Claire's Stores of Miami, Lennar Corp. of  Miami, Wackenhut Corp. of Coral Gables, and  Watsco of Miami. Blockbuster joins five other  south Florida firms who were named Florida  Company of the Year by  the Miami Herald  since the award began in 1982: Citizens Sav ings Financial Corp. of Miami, 1989; Carnival  Cruise Lines of Miami, 1988; L. Luria & Sons  of Miami  Lakes,  1984; Ryder Systems of  Miami,  1983;  and  Key  Pharmaceutical  of  Miami, 1982.  These businesses have proven  that  the  American values of free enterprise and entre preneurial  initiative are still alive and well  in  south Florida.  COMMENDING NATHAN ANDERSON  HON. BOB McEWEN  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 23, 1991  Mr. McEWEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog nize Nathan Anderson, an outstanding young  man from Chillicothe, OH, who recently visited  Washington as a part of  the American Le gion's annual Americanism and Government  Test Program.  Nathan, a 17-year old eleventh grade stu dent at Union-Scioto High School, was one of  just eighteen winners from among the eighty six thousand participants in this annual com petition sponsored by the American Legion of  Ohio. The winners of this prestigious event, a  8975  tradition that dates back to 1935, are brought  to Washington, DC and other historical sites in  the area as guests of the Legion.  The  brave  American  service men  and  women of Operation Desert Storm  follow a  long line of American troops that have fought  to  protect American  interests  and  ideals  across the globe. Many of the veterans of ear lier battles for freedom are today members of  a noble association of veterans-the American  Legion.  Mr. Speaker, when I came to serve the peo ple of Ohio in the House of Representatives,  I gratefully accepted an appointment  to  the  House Veterans Affairs Committee.  I have  been equally grateful for the opportunities to  meet and work with Veterans Associations  such as the American Legion who share my  respect for America, and the traditional values  and  institutions  that made  this  the greatest  country on Earth.  The Ohio American Legion's annual ""Ameri canism and Government"" Test Program pro motes the study of our political system and  history. Nathan Anderson, a Boy Scout and  honor student with an excellent grade point  average,  is a worthy choice as one of this  year's winners. Furthermore, Nathan plans to  follow in the footsteps of the members of the  American Legion and  join the armed  forces,  pursuing a career as a navy pilot.  Mr. Speaker,  I join my colleagues  in con gratulating Nathan Anderson for his selection,  and the American Legion of Ohio for continu ing  this fine  tradition of providing a program  that  brings  outstanding  young men  and  women  to Washington  for an opportunity  to  learn a little more about their country and its  Government.  THE NEZ PERCE NATIONAL  HISTORIC PARKS ACT OF 1991  HON. PAT WIWAMS  OF MONTANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 23, 1991  ",1991
185,,102,-0.315,207,7,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Speaker, this past year  all of America marveled at the presentation of  the Civil War documentary on public  tele vision. This Nation has spent a great deal of  time understanding the Civil War and preserv ing the sites of historic consequence and bat tles.

There are important pieces of our  past being lost every day in the West, and it  is high time we move to protect those sites as  diligently as  the battlefield sites  in  the East.

186,,102,-0.33,220,7,Mr. TRAXLER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  call the attention of my colleagues to a par ticularly  insightful  article  by  David  Alan  Aschauer, which was recently published in the  GAO Journal.  Mr. Aschauer, who is also known as Prof.  Elmer W. Campbell, formerly a senior econo mist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,  helps to shed new light on the severity of our  nation's infrastructure problems. His article is  entitled ""The Third Deficit,"" and it is my belief  that Mr. Aschauer makes a compelling case  for why our  infrastructure problems are as  much of a hindrance to economic competitive ness as is our Nation's trade and budget defi cits.  I urge all Members to read this article and  carefully consider the importance of address ing our  infrastructure problems as  the Con gress moves forward on establishing our Na tion's spending priorities  for  the next  fiscal  year.  THE THIRD DEFICIT  (By David Alan Aschauer)  America's ability to meet a number of its  pressing problems-such as  environmental  deterioration, declining competitiveness in  the international economic area, a persistent  drug problem, and the burden of an aging  work  force  approaching  its  retirement  years-will depend on a strong and steady  performance by the national economy. Yet,  over the past 20 years, the U.S. economy has  not been performing as well as it did in the  ""golden age"" of the 1950s and 1960s. For in stance, we have seen a continuing slump in  the growth rate of economic productivity that is, in the annual gains in the amount of  output produced by an hour of work effort.  This slower growth  in productivity  trans lates into slower growth in per capita output  and in tax revenues, which makes dealing  with critical national problems increasingly  difficult.  So strong productivity growth is a nec essary precondition  for  innovative public  policies. And the key to productivity growth  is investment-both in physical capital such  as machines and factories and in the knowl edge achieved by spending on research and  development, education, and training.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Unfortunately,  investment has not been  particularly robust over the past few dec ades.1 In particular, public investment in the  nation's core  infrastructure of highways,  bridges, mass transit, water and sewer sys tems,  and  other  public  facilities  has  dropped-from about 4 percent of gross na tional output in  the late 1960s  to a  little  more than 2 percent in the late 1980s. Be cause  the  infrastructure  forms  a  crucial  foundation  for  the national economy,  this  falloff  in  infrastructure  spending has de tracted  from  this  country's  economic  strength and, by extension, from its ability  to address many of its current problems.  Therefore, even though it might seem that  because of  the current budget deficit we  can't afford to make substantial investments  in infrastructure, the fact is that we can't  afford not to  invest in our public capital  stock.  THE TRADITIONAL VIEW  According to conventional wisdom, spend ing on public facilities affects the economy  by creating jobs and stimulating the produc tion of goods and services. An  increase in  spending on highways not only boosts em ployment in the construction industry but  also, as construction workers spend  their  wages on goods and services, in other indus tries as well. For example, in a study of New  Jersey by The Road  Information Project  (TRIP), it was estimated that each $100 mil lion of additional highway spending would  generate a total of 2,500 extra jobs and $136  million worth of added goods and services.2  While the precision of these types of fig ures might be open to argument, the logic of  this approach is correct-as far as it goes.  But there is a fundamental limitation in this  way of looking at things. By focusing on the  way public expenditures on highways and  other public  facilities affect the  total de mand for output, the conventional approach  turns a blind eye to the important ways in  which infrastructure investment affects the  total supply of private-sector output.  INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPLY  In my opinion, the stock of public infra structure capital is a critical, though often  overlooked, determinant of the economy's  ability to supply goods and services to the  market. Public capital accumulation is at  least as important to the course of material  prosperity as  is private capital accumula tion. As stated by Richard Bartel, editor of  Challenge magazine,  Investment  is  the key, as economists know  very well,  to economic growth and material  progress. History  records how  the creation of  physical and human capital drives the wealth of  nations. Yet even some economists tend to think  of investment in narrow terms-private spending  on business plant and equipment. We often for get about additions to the stock of public infra structure-spending  on  roads,  bridges, mass  transportation, airports, waterways, water sup ply, waste disposal facilities, and other public  utilities. s  Specifically, one may argue  that public  capital is an intermediate input to the pro duction process. By  interacting in a com plementary fashion with private  labor an  capital, it renders private-sector production  more profitable and efficient.  There is a multitude of ways that infra structure might  influence productivity  in  this manner. First, an improved infrastruc ture will help to reduce or eliminate produc tion bottlenecks. One clear case would be the  efficiency gains arising from the provision of  a better transportation infrastructure, which  can enable a firm to reap the advantages inApril 23, 1991  herent in ""just-in-time"" inventory manage ment. For instance, over the past half-dec ade,  the Campbell Soup Company has em barked on a  just-in-time delivery program  for its food production operations. Because  rail transportation was regarded to be unre liable, the company has switched from rail based  to  truck-based  transportation of its  product. At Campbell's Sumpter, North  Carolina plant, this switch to trucking and  to  just-in-time  inventory control has suc ceeded in reducing inventory holdings by 67  percent. The  resulting cost  savings have  been considerable.  Just-in-time inventory control seems to be  a growing practice in this country. Accord ing to one survey, while about 19 percent of  nationwide shipments were accomplished in  accordance with  just-in-time principles  in  1987,  the survey respondents expected that  this would rise to over 32 percent by 1995. So  there is significant potential for further cost  reductions and profit enhancement through  just-in-time inventory control. But the po tential will remain just that-potential-un less adequate transportation investments are  made in the years ahead.  Second, a better transportation infrastruc ture can allow firms to diversify their prod uct lines and reduce fluctuations in overall  sales and profitability. Firms with the capa bility of switching from one product line to  another will mitigate  losses arising  from  shifts in product demand. Success in this at tempt to minimize risk, however, depends on  good access to a broader variety of material  inputs-from a greater number pf suppliers as well as good access to different groups of  consumers.  Third, an upgraded  transportation  infra structure allows  improved access  to labor.  For instance, a good surface transportation  network-roads, light rail, and the like-ef fectively lets a firm reach farther out into  the labor pool and results in better matches  between jobs and workers' skills.  Finally, a better infrastructure may allow  firms to capture various economies of scale- that is, efficiency gains arising from larger scale production facilities. For example, be cause of the existing road network, Coca Cola Midwest has been able to consolidate  all its bottling activity at a larger, more ef ficient plant in Eagan, Minnesota. The elimi nation of a number of remote warehouses  and the move to ""rolling warehouses""-that  is, storage trucks-have allowed Coca-Cola  to reap substantial efficiency gains.  For all  these reasons and more, an  im proved infrastructure can boost productivity  in the private sector. Indeed, there appears  to exist a dynamic interaction between the  infrastructure and productivity. In this ""vir tuous cycle,"" a better stock of infrastructure  capital lifts productivity and, by  lowering  costs and .raising profits, also promotes pri vate investment. This, in the space of a few  years, raises productivity still more. As this  higher level of productivity then expands the  resource base available for private  invest ment in factories and machines,  the cycle  begins anew.  Recent empirical research to be found in  the economics literature   suggest that this  ""virtuous cycle"" was broken during the lat ter half of the 1960s. Indeed, public expendi ture on  infrastructure facilities has fallen  rather dramatically over the past two dec ades or so. After rising as a percentage of  gross national output during the 1950s and  early 1960s, public  infrastructure spending  peaked at nearly 4 percent of gross output in  the late 1960s, then slid to a low of about 2  percent of output in the early 1980s.

Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to represent a  district with a significant Defense Department  presence:  Fort Monmouth  and  the Naval  Weapons Station Earle are both  located  in  New  Jersey's Third Congressional District.  Both of  these  installations made significant  contributions to our country's tremendous suc cesses in Operation Desert Storm.  The U.S.S. Detroit, which is homeported at  Earle, and the U.S.S. Seattle will be docking  at Earle  this week. Hundreds of sailors  re cently returning from heroic service in the gulf  will  be  among  those  honored  at Friday's  event. These vessels-fast combat support  ships-played a vital  role  in supplying our  forces in the area with ammunition and other  supplies. Those brave volunteers who served  on these ships, in the face of constant danger,  performed their task with a degree of courage  and professionalism that has been and contin ues to be the heart of America's strength.  In addition to the bravery and fine training of  our forces, the other key to America's success  in the gulf war is our superior technology. One  of the great centers of that technological de velopment is Fort Monmouth. The list of com munications and electronics materiel devel oped at this facility is long and impressive. It  was  this  type of technological expertise that  allowed the ground war to be completed so  quickly, so decisively and with so few allied  casualties.  The  guest  speaker  at Friday's  event will be Sergeant Major Nelson of Fort  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Monmouth who has recently returned from the  Persian Gulf. Fort Monmouth is also the home  of the 389th U.S. Army Band. This fine en semble will be performing patriotic selections  at Friday's ceremony.  Mr. Speaker, we all know about the many  difficult and challenging domestic issues that  will face our country in the months and years  ahead. But, as has been said many times be fore, the differences between Americans end  at the water's edge. Our victory in the gulf and  the  emotional  reception  that our  returning  troops are receiving all over the country have  proved  that America remains a world  leader  and a nation unified on the home front by a  shared sense of honor and purpose.

191,House,102,-0.308,259,7,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker, the Center  on Budget and Policy Priorities has re cently released a report on exactly who  would benefit from the new Super IRA  proposal. I will submit the entire re port for the RECORD, but I would like to  highlight a few of their findings.  Only one-fifth of all taxpayers have  income which exceeds $50,000. Yet, 95  percent  of  all  of  the  benefits  of  reinstituting a deductible  IRA go  to  this group. That means only 5 percent  of the benefits of this proposal would  go to the remaining 80 percent of all  families, those with incomes less than  $50,000. This is just as bad as the dis tribution of the benefits from a capital  gains tax cut.  Fully deductible IRA's are available  to 86 million families with earned in come  in 1990. Another 8 million can  take  a  partial deduction. This  rep resents 87 percent of the  ligible f~i­ lies? The Super  IRA proposal  is di rected at providing a tax deduction for  the  remaining 13 percent. These are  largely well-off families who need no  encouragement to save.  THE NEW IRA PRoPOSALS: WHO WOULD GAIN  FROM THEM?  (By Robert Greenstein)  A proposal  to expand  Individual Retire ment Accounts substantially is now before  Congress. Senators Lloyd Bentsen and Wil liam Roth have introduced the Senate ver sion along with 77 co-sponsors. On the House  side, Reps. J.J. Pickle and William Thomas  are the lead sponsors of an identical bill that  had 94 cosponsors as of April 17.  Who would benefit from these large expan sions? How much would the proposals cost?  Who would pay these costs? How solid is the  evidence  they would promote savings and  help the economy? These issues are explored  below.  CURRENT LAW ON IRAS  Under current law, two types of taxpayers  may deposit up to $2,000 a year into an Indi vidual Retirement Account and deduct the  contribution  from  their  taxable  income.  First, taxpayers at all income levels who are  not covered by an employer-sponsored pen sion plan may take advantage of this provi sion. Second, taxpayers who are covered by  an  employer-sponsored pension  plan  also  may make  tax-deductible deposits  into an  IRA  if  they have adjusted gross  income  below $35,000 for a single tax filer or $50,000  for a married couple. The current  law on  IRAs was established by the Tax Reform Act  of 1986.  Funds deposited in IRA accounts then ac cumulate interest that is tax free until the  funds are withdrawn after retirement. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income at that  point.  Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986,  tax payers at higher income levels who were cov ered by an employer-sponsored pension plan  also could get a $2,000-a-year deduction for  deposits into IRA accounts. This was one of  the  tax advantages  the Tax Reform Act  ended for these people in return for sharply  lowering their income tax rates.  The Tax Reform Act did not end all tax ad vantages from  IRAs for  those who are at  higher income levels and are covered by em ployer-sponsored pensions. While such indi viduals may not deduct contributions to an  IRA account,  the  interest on any deposits  they make into such an account still accu mulates tax-free until it is withdrawn after retirement.  THE NEW PROPOSAL  The  new  proposal  has  several  aspects.  First, and most important, it would undo the  limitations on IRAs imposed by the Tax Re form Act of 1986. Taxpayers at higher income  levels who participate in a tax-favored pen sion plan would  regain eligibility for  full  IRA deductibility.  In addition,  the proposal would create a  second type of IRA. Under the new type of  IRA, a  taxpayer at any income level could  deposit up  to $2,000 a year. The  taxpayer  would not receive an up-front tax deduction,  but all interest earned by the account would  be permanently tax-free (i.e., both the inter est and  the principal could later be with drawn free of any tax) so long as the funds  were not withdrawn from  the account for  five years. A taxpayer could use either the  conventional IRA,  the new type of IRA, or  both. If both types of IRAs were used, depos its would be limited to an overall total of  $2,000 per year.  Finally, the legislation would allow people  with IRA accounts to make early IRA with drawals without the normal penalty if the  funds were used for one of three designated  purposes: a first-time home purchase for the  depositor, his or her children, or his or her  grandchildren; education expenses for the de positor, his or her children, or his or her  grandchildren; or medical costs exceeding 7 .5  percent of income. There would be no limit  on the amount that could be withdrawn or  on the value of the home to which the with drawal could be applied.  WHO STANDS TO GAIN?  The Joint Committee on Taxation has ex amined  the question  of which  taxpayers  would gain if IRA deductibility were restored  for taxpayers who lost this deductibility in  the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The Congressional  Budget Office has looked at which taxpayers  would benefit most from a Bush Administra tion proposal that is similar to the new type  of IRA contained in the recently introduced  legislation. Both analyses reveal the benefits  would accrue overwhelmingly to those in the  upper part of the income scale.  The Joint Committee on Taxation studied  several proposals  introduced  in  the  lOlst  Congress to restore IRA deductibility for in dividuals who have other pension plans and  are above the income cut-off established by  the Tax Reform Act. The Committee's find ings indicate that:  Only one-fifth of all  taxpayers have  in comes exceeding $50,000, but they would re ceive 95 percent of the tax benefits (from re storing IRA deductibility for taxpayers who  lost it in the Tax Reform Act). This is as  high as the percentage of the tax benefits  that would go to the top fifth under a capital  gains tax cut.  The richest 4.5 percent of taxpayers-those  with incomes of at least $100,000-would col lect nearly one-third of the tax benefits. This  one-third share is not as great as the share  that taxpayers over $100,000 would receive  from a capital gains tax cut, but it still rep resents a highly disproportionate share of  the tax benefits.  The bottom  four-fifths of all  taxpayers  would receive the remaining five percent of  the tax benefits.  IRA suppo,rters often attempt to cast a dif ferent light on the distribution of benefits by  noting that 51 percent of the benefits from  restoring full IRA deductibility would go to  taxpayers with incomes below $75,000. This is  simply a reflection, however, of the fact that  taxpayers with incomes below $75,000 are so  numerous. Some 92 percent of all taxpayers  are in this category. Furthermore, nearly all  the benefits  for  the under-$75,000  income  group would go to those with incomes in the  $50,000 to $75,000 range. Joint Tax Committee  data show that about four-fifths of all tax payers have incomes below $50,000, but they  would receive only about five percent of the  tax benefits. (See table on next page.)  Indeed, most taxpayers with incomes below  $50,000 would not gain at all from the pro posal. Only one-tenth of one percent of tax payers with incomes below $30,000 would re ceive any tax benefit, according to the Joint  Tax Committee estimate. Just four percent  of  those  in  the $30,000  to $50,000 bracket  would receive a tax reduction.  By contrast, the 21 percent of all taxpayers  with incomes over $50,000 would, as noted, re ceive 95 percent of the tax benefits. Nearly  one of every three taxpayers at this income  level would receive a new tax break.  Furthermore, a Congressional Budget Of fice analysis of a proposal quite similar to  the new  type of IRA shows  that it,  too,  would direct most of its benefits to the upper  parts of the income scale. CBO examined an  Administration proposal to establish Family  Savings Accounts, under which a  taxpayer  could deposit up to $2,500 a year in an ac count (up to $5,000 for married couples) and  have all interest on the account be tax-free  forever so long as no withdrawal was made  for seven years. CBO concluded  that  tax payers with incomes above $50,000 would be  the principal beneficiaries of the proposal.  The Joint Tax Committee and CBO esti mates are consistent with past experience  with IRAs. IRA participation has been con centrated within upper income groups, not  middle-or lower-income groups. IRS tax re turn data show that in 1986, the last year in  which IRA tax deductions were available to  all taxpayers, 66 percent of the tax units in  the  top  four percent of the  income scale  made IRA contributions. But only 13 percent  of taxpayers in the middle third of the in come scale made such contributions. Only  four percent of those with adjusted gross in comes below $15,000 participated. These data  provide further evidence  that IRAs are of  much greater use to upper income taxpayers  than to those in the middle or bottom of the  income scale.  Moreover, the new proposal relaxes IRA re strictions  that affect only higher  income  taxpayers. This is because the vast majority  of those in the middle and lower parts of the  income  spectrum are already eligible  for  IRAs under current law. The Joint Commit tee on Taxation has estimated that 87 per cent of all tax filers with earned income are  eligible  to make deductible IRA contribu tions under current law. Some 80 percent are  eligible to deduct a full $2,000.  IRA proponents may contend some middle  'income households who are currently eligi",1991

194,House,102,-0.342,298,7,Mr. MAVROULES.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today, the 76th anniversary of the tragic Arme nian genocide, to pay tribute to the millions of  Armenians who were persecuted during the 8  years of genocide.  On April 24, 1915, a genocide began in Tur key  that  took  the  lives of 1.5 million Arme nians. On that day alone, about 200 Armenian  religious,  political,  and  intellectual  leaders  were either arrested, exiled or murdered. For  8 long years, from 1915 to 1923, Armenians  lived in fear of torture and death. Some were  fortunate enough to flee the mass executions,  but all Armenians suffered. More than 500,000  Armenians were exiled from their homes, and  many witnessed the death and  imprisonment  of loved ones. The memories of such atroc ities can never be forgotten by the Armenian  people, and are passed on from generation to  generation. The rest of the world must also re flect on the inhumanity of what happened 76  years ago with passionate intolerance.  Remembrance of the Armenian genocide is  imperative to preclude men from successfully  repeating Hitler's statement ""Who  today  re members  the Armenian extermination?"" Per haps the executions of the Stalin era and the  Cambodian killing fields could have been pre empted had global  recognition of the Arme nian genocide evolved earlier.  Like many of my colleagues,  I am the off spring of southeastern European immigrants.  As a Greek descendent I share a feeling of  national tragedy with  the people of Armenia.  For this reason,  I have always  felt a certain  empathy for Americans of Armenian descent.  Unfortunately, many people today would rather  forget the grim  reality of what happened 76  years ago today.  On  this,  the anniversary of the Armenian  genocide,  I urge my  fellow colleagues along  with .members of the international community,  to  join me  in  taking a moment to remember  the horrible tragedy that occurred in Armenia  so that it will not be repeated again.

195,Senate,102,-0.443,311,7,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I com mend the Points of Light Foundation  for its efforts to encourage all Ameri cans to participate in community serv ice. The foundation is a private non profit organization whose board is com posed of 24 Americans from business,  industry, the academic world, and vol untary  service  groups. The  founda tion's mission is to help make commu nity service a greater part of the lives  of every American, and thereby con tribute to the ongoing struggle against  illiteracy, poverty, homelessness, alco hol and drug abuse, delinquency, and  the plight of the elderly.  On Monday, April 15, the foundation  launched  their 12-day Celebration of  Service to honor Americans who have  been  trailblazers in community serv ice, to enhance public awareness of the  problems facing society and the need  for personal  involvement  to alleviate  them, and to identify worthwhile pro grams that can be used in all parts of  the country to challenge others to be come involved.  Each day during their Celebration of  Service,  the Points of Light Founda tion will recognize one or two Ameri cans as  service ambassadors,  people  who have made a difference by partici pating in service programs. Today,  I  join with the Points of Light Founda tion and Senator SPECTER in commend ing Manford Sales of Pittsburgh, PA,  an exemplary American who has made  a significant contribution to his com munity and his country.  It is a privilege  to work with  the  foundation, and I ask unanimous con sent that appropriate background in formation on its good works may be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the back ground was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  THE POINTS OF LIGHT FOUNDATION BACKGROUND  The Points of Light Foundation is a pri vate non-profit, non-partisan umbrella orga nization whose board  is  comprised of 24  Americans drawn  from business,  industry,  academia and voluntary service groups. The  Foundation's mission is to help make direct  and consequential community service aimed  at serious social problems central to the life  of every American and to increase the oppor tunities people have for that kind of service  through their workplace, schools, churches  and civic organizations. We also will serve as  a catalyst in the creation of new voluntary  service initiatives.  The Foundation and  its board recognize  the crucial role government programs must  play in this struggle but believe these ap proaches cannot be the only ray of hope on  the horizon.  Illiteracy, poverty, homeless ness, alcohol and drug abuse, delinquency  and the plight of the elderly are problems  that continue to defy government's best ef forts. This void can only be filled by a re doubled effort from the private sector, by the  profound and personal commitment of indi viduals to helping others.  Beginning Apr.  15,  the  Foundation  is  launching a 12-day Points of Light Celebra tion that is designed to honor those people  who have been trailblazers in the community  service effort; to sharpen public awareness of  the problems facing society and the need for  personal involvement to help alleviate them;  and  to  identify worthwhile programs  that  can be replicated in other parts of the coun try and challenge others to get involved. Lit erally thousands of disparate groups and in dividuals have already been mobilized as  part of this effort.  In conjunction with the Celebration,  the  Foundation will unveil a nationwide adver tising campaign, created pro bono by Saatchi  & Saatchi and the Advertising Council, that  will bring the message of service into the  home of every American. The slogan, ""Do  Something Good,  Feel  Something Real,""  stresses  the sense of personal accomplish ment that volunteers get from  their work.  The campaign will seek that help and co operation of the media., businesses, schools,  unions, religious groups and individuals. In  addition, a toll-free 800 number will act as a  national center for providing key informa tion for community service efforts.  The Foundation is assisting or has helped  to establish numerous successful service pro grams. These include:  One-to-One, a mentoring program for dis advantaged youth.  StarServe, a school-based community serv ice effort.  Into the Streets, a college-based commu nity service program operated by the Cam pus Outreach Opportunity League.  Naming of individual Points of Light Rep resentatives,  Leadership  Companies  and  Partnerships.  The Foundation's mandate  is  long-term.  After the Celebration of Service is over, we  will pursue our mission on several fronts.  First, we will evaluate our advertising cam paign and toll-free telephone service in an ef fort to improve the response; and second, we  will continue and  improve our efforts  to  serve as a broker and coordinator for new  programs. There are no easy answers. We are  engaged  in a day-to-day struggle  that re quires day-to-day commitment and energy.  THE POINTS OF LIGHT FOUNDA TION HO~ORS MANFORD SALES  ",1991
196,Senate,102,-0.293,324,7,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr.  President,  I  thank our distinguished leader on So cial  Security matters,  the  distin guished Senator from New York. He  has labored in the vineyards for years  in defense of the integrity of the Social  Security system. He  is acknowledged  by every Senator on both sides of the  aisle as the authority in this field.  When the President writes as he did  yesterday,  that Senator MoYNIHAN'S  proposal would return Social Security  to  the  same  financing  scheme  that  drove the system to the brink of insol vency  in 1982,  that is outright blas phemy. It is simply not true. I do not  know who is writing these letters and  speeches for our distinguished Presi dent, but he or she should hew  to a  higher standard of truth and accuracy.  I  listened  to President Bush  in his  State of the Union Address claiming  that we are reducing the deficit by over  $500 billion in the next 5 years, mean while, in part 2, page 294, of his budget  submission be proposed increasing the  national debt by $1  trillion, from $3.1  to $4.1  trillion to get us through the  1992  election. One  trillion, not  in 5  years, but in 18 months, all to get us by  the 1992 election. That is the same kind  of monkeyshine that we have here this  morning again. And  the media con spires with us in committing this ter rible charade and fraud.  The distinguished Senator from New  Jersey  claims  that  the Moynihan  amendment would create a  tax  time  bomb. You know we  live in a bizarre  society  indeed. That is exactly what  the Senator from New York is trying  to prevent, he is trying to eliminate a  tax time bomb. Incidentally, of course,  we could not have a tax time bomb now  if the people didn't agree to it. Oh no,  not as long as the people stay asleep  and reelect us. Read our lips.  And then our distinguished colleague  from New Mexico ended his peroration  yesterday claiming that Senator MOY NIHAN and his allies are raiding the So cial Security fund. The truth is that  100  percent are  agreeing  right  this  minute to raid that fund. It is exactly  this  raiding of  the Social Security  kitty that the Senator from New York  is trying to stop.  I am an admirer of Vaclar Havel, the  President of Czechoslovakia. Twelve  years ago the late Senator Scoop Jack son, myself, and others were in Prague  and we made attempts to meet with  dissident  leaders. We  found out  the  Prague police were  following us. We  were headed back to the airport when  all of a sudden our car detoured into  the mountains. We came into a private  home, sat in a room, and I  turned to  Scoop, after minutes and said we were  wasting time, there were no dissidents  there.  When our hosts determined that we  had not been followed, the door of the  closet opened and out stepped Vaclav.  He sat down with us and we started  talking. We were trying to encourage  him and express our admiration  for  what he was doing.  I can see Senator Jackson now. He  said, ""but, Mr. Havel, do you under stand that we have Jackson-Yanik that  brings economic pressure on the Com munists here so that we can get the  dissidents out?"" Havel  looked him in  the eye and said, ""Senator, we are not  a bit interested in leaving.""  You could have thrown a dish rag in  Scoop's face. It was a shock to me, too.  Havel continued. He said, ""You know  Czechoslovakia was raped in 1938 and  1948 and in 1968."" He said, ""If I and my  generation do not see it through and  stick it out, if we do not stay here, the  world will never again know a  free  Czechoslovakia.''  Riding  to  the airport,  I  turned  to  Senator Jackson and I said, ""That fel low has got a lot of courage, but he will  never see a free Czechoslovakia in his  day, and you and I will never see it.''  Of course I was wrong, despite the fact  that Havel was arrested  soon after ward. But the point is that when Havel  took the Presidency, almost verbatim,  he  told the people of Czechoslovakia  that we have been lied to for 40 years.  We Czechs have been saying one thing  and believing another. He said Czecho slovakia has many problems but only  Czechs can solve them.  And in a similar fashion, Mr. Presi dent, we  in  the United States have  been systematically lied to for 10 years  by our government. We have been say ing one  thing and believing another.

198,,102,-0.166,441,7,Mr. SHARP.," Mr. Speaker,  I am pleased to  introduce today, along with several of my dis tinguished colleagues, the Greenhouse Warm ing Response Resolution of 1991. This resolu tion calls on the United States to implement  promptly  the  recommendations  the National  Academy of Sciences issued last week to re spond to the threat of greenhouse warming.  The panel  recommended prudent, cost-ef fective actions in the following areas:  First, reducing or offsetting greenhouse gas  emissions;  Second,  enhancing  house warming;  Third, improving knowledge for future deci sions;  Fourth, evaluating geoengineering options;  and,  Fifth, exercising international leadership.  The academy told us that global warming is  not an either/or issue; that is, either believe it  and do everything in your power to stop it, or  doubt  it and study  it  for a while. Yes.  the  academy said, the risks of warming are large.  Yes, there is uncertainty. Yes, we need more  research. But we also need action.  The  academy emphasized  that  there  is  enormous uncertainty about  the  timing and  consequences of greenhouse warming. They  recommend what we should do given what we  know about the risks and costs. They rejected  some of the most aggressive and costly miti gation options. But  they concluded  that at  least some insurance is cheap.  Their recommendations are generally based  on  low-cost, currently available  technologies.  Implementation will yield a 10to 40-percent  .reduction  in greenhouse gas emissions at a  net benefit or, at worst, zero cost to the econ omy.  Many of the recommendations will also yield  major energy  security  benefits. Often  our  goals are in conflict. But conservation and en ergy efficiency offer us a way to help reconcile  our energy and environmental goals.  The academy confirmed what many in Con gress have been saying about national energy  policy  and greenhouse warming. There  is  much we can do in the area of energy effi ciency and renewables  that  is cost-effective,  good  for national energy security, good  for  consumers, and good for the global environ ment.  We can if11)1ement many of the academy's  energy-related recommendations by reworking  the Presidenrs proposed national energy strat egy to include measures already in legislation  before  the Congress. Among  these actions  are: reforming State public utility regulation to  encourage conservation, adopting nationwide  energy-efficient building codes, improving Fed eral energy use, increasing emphasis on effi ciency and renewables in the Federal energy  R&D budget, and removing barriers to the utili zation of natural gas.  The academy also advocates that the Unit ed States take a progressive, leadership role  internationally. The negotiations on  climate  change present an opportunity for the United  States to go down in history as a responsible  friend of the world's environment. This resolu tion will put Congress on record  in  favor of  positive domestic and international action.  H.RES.Whereas the National Academy of Sciences  in its report, ""Policy Implications of Green house Warming,"" has found thatIncreases  in atmospheric greenhouse gas  concentrations probably will be followed by  increases in average atmospheric  tempera ture;  We  cannot  predict  how  rapidly  these  changes will occur, how intense they will be,  or what regional changes  in  temperature,  precipitation, wind speed, and frost occur rence can be expected;  General circulation models project that an  increase  in greenhouse gas concentrations  equivalent to a doubling of the preindustrial  level of atmosp]leric C02 would produce glob al average temperature increases between 1.9  degrees and 5.2 degrees 0(3.4 degrees and 9.4  degrees F);  The temperature increases of a few degrees  projected for the next century are not only  large in recent historical terms, but could  also carry the planet into largely unknown  territory;  So far, no large or rapid increases in the  global average  temperature have occurred,  and there  is no evidence yet of imminent  rapid change, but if the higher general cir culation models projections prove to be ac curate, substantial responses would be need ed, and the stresses on this planet and its in habitants would be serious;  There are numerous cost-effective actions  we as a nation could take that would con stitute prudent insurance;  The United States could reduce its green house gas emissions by 10 to 40 percent of  their 1990 level at very low cost;  Despite  the great uncertainties,  green house warming is a potential threat suffi cient to justify action now, some current !1-C tions could reduce the speed and magnitude  of greenhouse warming, and others could  prepare people and natural systems of plants  and animals for future adjustments to the  conditions likely to accompany greenhouse  warming;  Effective action to slow greenhouse warm ing will require international effort regard less of policies in  the United States and  many of  the cost-effective options appro priate for the United States are also applica ble in other countries, including developing  nations;  The position of the United States as the  current largest emitter of greenhouse gases  means that action in the rest of the world  if the United Staes  will be effective only  does it share;  Whereas the National Academy of Sciences  in its report, ""Policy Implications of Green house Warming,"" has recommended that the  United States:  (1) Continue  the aggressive phaseout of  CFC and other halocarbon emissions and the  development of substitutes that minimize or  eliminate greenhouse gas emissions;  (2) Study in detail  the ""full social cost  pricing"" of energy, with a goal of gradually  introducing such a system;  (3) Reduce  the  emission  of greenhouse  gases during energy use and consumption by  enhancing conservation and efficiency;  ( 4) Make greenhouse warming a key factor  in planning for our future energy supply mix.  The United States should adopt a systems  approach  that  considers  the  interactions  among supply, conversion, end use, and ex ternal effects  in  improving  the economics  and performance of the overall energy sys tem;  (5) Reduce global deforestation;  (6) Explore a moderate domestic reforest ation program and support international re forestation efforts;  (7) Maintain basic,  applied,  and experi mental agricultural research to help farmers  and commerce adapt to climate change and  thus ensure ample food;  (8) Make water supply more robust by cop ing with present variability by increasing ef ficiency of use through water markets and  by better management of present systems of  supply;  (9) Plan margins of safety for  long-lived  structures to  take  into consideration pos sible climate change;  (10) Move  to  slow  biodiversity;  (11) Continue and expand  the collection  and dissemination of data that provide an  uninterrupted record of the evolving climate  and of data that are (or will become) needed  for the improvement and testing of climate  . models;  (12) Improve weather forecasts, especially  of extremes, for weeks and seasons to ease  adaptation to climate change;  (13) Continue to identify those mechanisms  that play a significant role in the climatic  response  to  changing  concentrations  of  greenhouse gases.

199,,102,-0.233,454,7,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker, today, I am in troducing the Shipbuilding Trade Reform Act  of 1991, to sanction unfair trade practices by  foreign shipbuilding and repair industries.  In troduction of this legislation reflects my frustra tion with the inability of the negotiations in the  Organization  for Economic Cooperation and  Development [OECD] to reach agreement on  strong, effective multilateral disciplines on sulr  sidies in the shipbuilding and repair market.  Current  international subsidy  rules do not  discipline, or even discourage, the use of sutr  sidies in the commercial market for ships. For  almost 2 years, negotiations have been under way in the OECD to come up with a system  of international rules on this subject. Although  some progress has been made, many key is sues  remain unresolved. And many of  the  countries  sitting  at  that  negotiating  table,  frankly, have little incentive to cooperate with  us. Indeed, there is a great incentive for them  to drag out these negotiations as long as pos sible.  I do not believe the U.S. shipbuilding indus try, which has been very patient and support ive of  this administration's approach  to  the  problem, should have to wait any longer. My  legislation simply tries to achieve much of the  objectives of the OECD  talks,  to  the extent  that U.S. laws can regulate international trade.  Subsidized trade is not fair trade. American  producers-whether of ships, or steel, or air craft-should not have to compete with firms  backed by government treasuries. Our trading  partners should be on notice  that while  the  American marketplace welcomes fairly traded  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  competition, we will no  longer tolerate unfair  competition  in commercial ships. The Ship building Trade Reform Act of 1991  is simply  one more step  to  level  the playing  field  in  international trade.  The legislation has basically two parts. The  first part will essentially prohibit any ship which  benefits from foreign subsidies from unloading  its cargo or passengers at U.S. ports. This  prohibition will apply prospectively to all ships  which  received a subsidy on or after March  21, 1991. Enforcement of this provision will be  by requiring either the shipowner or the ship builder to certify to U.S. Customs that the ship  is subsidy free. False certification may lead to  prosecution for customs fraud as well as pay ment to the U.S. Treasury for the amount of  subsidies received by the ship.  The second part of my bill will close a loop hole which currently exists under U.S.  trade  laws, by amending the antidumping and coun tervailing duty laws so as to apply to ships.  Due to a technical distinction in existing law,  dumped or subsidized sales of ships are not  currently treated the same as sales of other  dumped or subsidized goods. My bill will  change  that, so that American producers of  commercial ships will enjoy the same protec tion of U.S. trade laws as other American pro ducers.  The text of the Shipbuilding Trade Reform  Act of 1991 follows:  H.R.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ""Shipbuilding  Trade Reform Act of 1991"".  SEC.  2.. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PtJR..  POSE.  (a) FINDINGS.-The Congress finds that(1) in 1981, the United States Government  terminated funding for the construction dif ferential subsidy program, thereby ending di rect subsidization of commercial shipbuild ing in the United States;  (2) the international market for shipbuild ing and ship repair continues to be distorted  by a wide array of foreign subsidies including  direct grants, preferential financing, equity  infusions, research and development assist ance, restructuring aid, special tax conces sions, debt forgiveness, and other direct and  indirect assistance;  (3) existing United States trade laws and  trade agreements provide limited redress to  domestic products of ships for the trade-dis torting subsidies and dumping practices of  foreign shipbuilders; and  (4) a  strong, effective miltilateral agree ment  among  all  shipbuilding nations  to  eliminate  trade-distorting practices in the  shipbuilding and repair industry is the best  means of providing  for  fair  international  competition, however, absent such an agree ment, changes in United States trade laws  are necessary to provide domestic producers  of ships greater protection against unfair  trade practices than is provided under cur rent law.  (b) PuRPosE.-lt is the purpose of this Act  to ensure fair trade in the commercial ship building and repair industry by providing for  effective  trade remedies against subsidized  and dumped foreign commercial ships.  April 24, 1991  SEC. 3. CERTIFICATIONS REQUIRED OF VESSELS  WITH RESPECT TO CONSTRUCTION  SUBSIDIES.  Part II of title IV of the Tariff Act of 1930  (19 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.) is amended by insert ing after section 435 the following new sec tion:  ""SEC. ""8M. CERTU'ICATIONS REQUIRED OF VES SELS WITH RESPECT TO CONSTRUC TION SUBSIDIES.  ""(a) SUBSIDY CERTIFICATION REQUIRED AT  ENTRY.-The master of a vessel shall, at the  time of making formal entry of the vessel  under section 434 or 435, deposit with the ap propriate customs officer a subsidy certifi cation for the vessel.  ''(b) SUBSIDY CERTIFICATIONS.""(!) IN GENERAL.-For purposes of this sec tion, a subsidy certification for a vessel is a  document that""(A) is either""(i) issued by the administering authority  under subsection (d), or  ""(ii) in such form as the administering au thority shall prescribe and signed by either  the vessel owner or person that constructed  the vessel; and  ""(B) attests that the vessel meets one of  the requirements set forth in paragraph (2)  relating to construction subsidies.  ""(2) CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.-The re quirements referred to in paragraph (1) are  as follows:  ""(A) The vessel was constructed without  the benefit of any subsidy.  ""(B) The vessel was constructed with the  benefit of one or more subsidies that were  granted or provided on or after March 21,  1991, but an amount equal to the value of  each such subsidy has been repaid  to  the  agency that granted or otherwise provided  the subsidy.  ""(C) The vessel was constructed with the  benefit of one or more subsidies that were  granted or provided on or after March 21,  1991, but an amount equal to the value of  each such subsidy, reduced by any amount  repaid under paragraph (B), has been paid to  the Treasury of the United States.  ""(D) The vessel was constructed""(i) in a foreign country which is signatory  to a trade agreement with the United States  that provides  for  the elimination of con struction subsidies for vessels; and  ""(ii) after the date on which such  trade  agreement entered into force with respect to  that country.  ""(c) ENFORCEMENT.-If  the Secretary has  reason to believe that an unlawful act under  section 436 relating to this section has been  committed, the Secretary shall""(1) undertake such investigation as may  be necessary to ascertain whether action au thorized under section 436 against the master  of the vessel, or the vessel, or both, is war ranted; and  ""(2) if the vessel is not covered by a sub sidy certification issued under subsection (d)  and the information obtained during such in vestigation indicates that there is reason to  believe that the vessel does not meet any  certification requirement under subsection  (b), so  inform the administering authority  and provide such information to that author ity.  ""(d) ISSUANCE OF SUBSIDY CERTIFICATIONS  BY THE ADMINISTERING AUTHORITY.""(!) APPLICATIONS.-The owner or lessee of  a vessel, or the builder of a vessel, may apply  to the administering authority for the issu ance of a subsidy certification for that ves sel.

200,,102,0.023,467,7,Mr. RINALDO.," Mr. Speaker, on June 8,  thousands of New Jersey residents celebrate  the contributions of  Italian-Americans  to  the  State of New Jersey at the 21st annual Festa  ltaliana at  the Garden State Arts Center  in  Holmdel.  Many local Italian-American organizations in  New Jersey hold community celebrations dur ing the year, but the Festa ltaliana is the larg est such event and brings together many of  these local groups, ranging from Italian Amer ican War Veterans to UNICO. Thousands of  citizens,  including many  from New Jersey's  many different ethnic groups, attend this color ful outdoor celebration of music, entertain ment, food, and the arts.  There are 25 million citizens of this country  with Italian roots. New Jersey has one of the  largest  concentrations  of  Italian-Americans.  9235  According  to  the New Jersey Data Center,  831,000 residents of the State claim a single  Italian ancestry, making  Italian-Americans the  largest single ancestry ethnic group  in New  Jersey. Several  thousand more are  the chil dren of mixed ancestry in which one parent is  of Italian-American origin.  This large community has been assimilated  into American society. They  range  from  first  generation immigrants to some who trace their  ancestry as far back as the American Revolu tion. They have  fought  for America  in every  war, and were among the thousands of Ameri cans who took part in Operation Desert Shield  in the Persian Gulf.  Italian-Americans have enriched the cultural,  scientific,  intellectual, artistic, and economic  life of New Jersey. They are educators, busi ness men and women, scientists, artists, musi cians,  factory workers, developers,  lawyers,  doctors-virtually  every  occupation  imag inable. The hope and faith of their ancestors  in coming to America is proudly visible in the  economic,  political,  and  social  status  of  present generations who are an  integral part  of the American mainstream. They made the  American dream come true and are part of the  great American success story  that has  in spired people all over the world.  The funds raised at this event will be con tributed to  the Garden State Cultural Center  Fund which provides  free entertainment  to  school children, senior citizens,  the disabled  and disadvantaged all across New Jersey.  Mr. Speaker, Festa ltaliana is a salute to the  Italian-Americans who have enriched New Jer sey in hundreds of ways over the last two cen turies as well as a celebration of the joys of  living. I salute all the members of the commit tee under  its chairman, Anthony P. Lordi of  Linden, for the success of this wonderful and  entertaining event.

234,Senate,102,-0.352,545,7,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, the Sen ator from Kentucky just said to the  Senate that nothing positive has been  produced from the Presidential system.  I really think that that avoids rec ognition of what created this system in  the first place and of the history of  what has  led us  to be where we are  today. The Presidential system was put  in place to do away with extraordinary  abuse of corporate money and excessive  money  in  the election of our Presi dents. And Members of the House and  Senate had paid a price, some of them  criminal and other political, for having  been victims of that process.  Countless Members of this body have  participated in that process. The dis tinguished minority  leader,  Senator  DOLE,  the  current President of  the  United  States, President Bush,  the  former President, President Reagan,  many Members of the U.S. Senate have  run for President, and none of them  have ever complained that the system  that made  that money available  to  them voluntarily from a $1 voluntary  checkoff on tax returns was somehow  abusive.  What we just saw on the Senate floor  was not really a vote about child nutri tion. It was a vote to restore the proc ess of unlimited money in politics, un limited money in the electoral process  of our Presidential elections. And  it  was an exercise in politics that would  have given  to  the Republican Party,  which already has tremendous advan tages in fundraising, even more advan tages in the political process that is de pendent on money. Americans are tired  of a process dependent on money, and  nothing distances the election process  more from  the American people  than  their perception that big money con trols it. What we  just voted on was a  chance to say we are ready to vote to  reform the process but let us do it sen sibly.  My colleague says we just passed up  an opportunity to vote for more money  for  child  nutrition. Well,  the  par liamentary situation at the end of that  vote  made  my  would have put a filing fee on all the  big soft money, corporate money, and  the filing fee would have gone to child  nutrition. The distinguished Senator  from Kentucky withdrew his amend ment. It was not defeated. By with drawing his amendment he withdrew  the  underlying  amendment  which  would have allowed us  to vote more  money for child nutrition, but to take  that money from the big corporate con tributions and the big individual hun dred-thousand-dollar contributions and  use that for child nutrition.  The Senator from Kentucky decided  he did not want the U.S. Senate to vote  on child nutrition, because that is not  what this was about. This was about  relinquishing  the  one hold we  have  that puts some order into the process.  amendmen~which  ",1991

236,Senate,102,0.304,558,7,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to express my support for efforts  to correct the Social Security notch. I  have been a long-time supporter of at tempts to address this inequity.  In 1972, Congress began double index ing benefits  for  inflation. Left  un checked, this error would have eventu ally bankrupted  the Social Security  trust fund. Congress acted again in 1977  to ameliorate the situation, but did not  take back  the  overindexed  benefits  from those who had already retired and  begun relying on this higher income.  Congress gradually realigned the ben efits paid to ease the transition. How ever,  the  transition formula did not  change the fact that a person born in  1916  retiring  in 1981  receives $762  a  month while someone born a year later  and  retiring  in 1982  receives $607  a  mon th-$155 less.  Once again I have  joined with Sen ator SANFORD  in  introducing  legisla tion to correct this inequity. For the  first time we have introduced a consen sus bill with Representative ROYBAL.  We have made significant progress there are 184 cosponsors in the House  and 21 cosponsors here in the Senate.  This legislation evens out the notch  by making  the necessary adjustment  gradually, so as not to upset the stabil ity of  the  trust fund.  It calls for a  phase-in of a stable level of Social Se curity benefits for individuals born be tween 1917 and 1926, thus targeting ben efits to those who need them most.  This is an important step in the long  history of the struggle to correct the  notch.  I am hopeful  that  the Senate  will act favorably on this consensus ap proach.   ",1991
237,Senate,102,0.261,584,7,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, 5 years  ago  the world awoke  to one of  the  worst environmental horrors we have  ever experienced,  the Chernobyl acci dent.  Unfortunately even today we still do  not know how bad that accident was.  In fact, the collection of data on envi ronmental contamination in the Soviet  Union has been very sketchy, and that  data has not been  released even  to  local scientists.  One of the enduring tragedies of this  accident is that we do not know how  bad the contamination is, what its dis tribution is, and what effect it is hav ing on our ecosystem.  The Chernobyl accident was one of  the events that shook us into realizing  how fragile our environment is. The en tire world watched and worked to fight  this horrible accident.  But we need to do more. I have been  working with a  number of environ mentalists and scientists in this coun try and in the Soviet Union to promote  a better understanding of this environ mental catastrophe.  While the radioactive contamination  caused by Chernobyl is but one exam ple of the many environmental prob lems demanding the Soviet Union's- and  the world's-attention, the  fifth  anniversary of this tragedy merits spe cial commemoration. Although the tre mendous scale of the disaster is now  becoming clear, 5 years after the acci dent  the  1full  extent  of  the  con sequences have still not been deter mined, and much information remains  undisclosed.  After operators at the Chernobyl nu clear powerplant performed their dead ly experiment on April 26, 1986, radio active debris was spewed across  the  countryside and  into a wide area of  Eastern and Western Europe. At least  31 people were killed and hundreds in jured as an immediate consequence of  the accident, and medical experts pre dict  tens of thousands more will die  prematurely from cancer caused by the  radiation. Seventy percent of the fall out on Soviet territory landed on Byel orussia,  and according  to  scientists,  nearly one-fifth of all the arable land  in that republic is contaminated by ex cess! ve radioactivity.  Immediately after the accident, the  actual figures of external radiation and  environmental contamination were not  published.  Moreover,  as  Zhores  Medvedev points out, ""members of the  public-even  research  laboratories  which were not directly concerned with  the  postaccident  decontamination  measures-were forbidden to use radi ation monitoring equipment."" While  distribution of  foodstuffs  from  con taminated areas has been officially for bidden, because of food shortages, vio lations of the  rules are  increasingly  common.  Increases  in  the  rates  of  many kinds of  radiation-related  ill nesses are also being reported.  It is not surprising, then, that public  anxiety about contamination of food,  drinking water, and arable land is tre mendously high, and that government  assertions of safety do little to quell  the mistrust. I would like to draw your  attention today to an initiative that  ",1991
238,Senate,102,0.219,610,7,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President,  the  U.S. Postal Service provides a vital  function  to  the American  business  community, to our government, and to  each and every American. It is the one  government function which reaches out  and  touches  all Americans  almost  every day. As we are well aware, the  Postal Service is of vital importance to  the citizens of each of our States. In  my State, for example, many citizens  would be cutoff from any meaningful  contact with the rest of the country  were it not for the Postal Service. It is  unquestionably crucial  that  the U.S.  Postal Service remain a strong, finan cially viable enterprise.  The U.S. Postal Service is now in the  middle of the administrative and judi cial process which stemmed from the  last postal rate case. We have all heard  from those who are unhappy with the  new postal  rates, and perhaps even  from those who are pleased with those  new rates. As a result of this last rate  case, the Postmaster General has sug gested  that  the  ratemaking process  needs to be revised. In fact, the Board  of Governors of the Postal Service has  commissioned  a  study of  the  rate making  process,  and  a  prominent  Washington based think tank plans to  hold a seminar on this subject.  I could not agree more with the need  to revise the ratemaking process. I am  one of the few Members of Congress  who was here in 1969 and 1970 when we  developed and passed the Postal Reor ganization Act of 1970. One of the de fects that we discovered early on with  this new experiment in a quasi-govern ment corporation was the time and ex pense involved in setting postal rates.  We modified the process once, by trim ming the time involved.  After subsequent rate cases,  it ap pears that this was not enough. Rate  cases, al though confined under law to  10 months, have taken on a new dis turbing trend of time spent in reconsid eration and court cases after the Post al Rate Commission has made  their  recommendation.  The proposal I am offering today, I  hope, will  provide  the  flexibility  I  think we all agree is needed in estab lishing proper postal  rates  to meet  changing economies and competition.  They do so by reducing the time in volved in setting rates, and more im portant, reducing the cost incurred by  all parties, including the Postal Serv ice, in the rate case process.  Without question, rate setting is one  of the keys to the success of the Postal  Service survival. If we cannot solve the  problem we will, I believe, be forced to  reevaluate the entire concept embodied  in what is now known as the U.S. Post al Service. We may have to look seri ously at either reestablishing in  the  excutive branch  the U.S. Post Office  Department, or privatizing the mail delivery system altogether.    My purpose  today is not to discuss  the merits or disposition of the last  rate  case. Those are  issues  for  the  Postal Rate Commission,  the Gov ernors of the Postal Service, and the  courts to resolve. I am not attempting  to  second guess  the  study commis sioned by the Board of Governors, but  it is time we laid out for inspection a  series of legislative proposals that will  get the ball rolling on this issue.  For years, I have believed that the  rate making process takes far too long.  Thus, today I am introducing a series  of bills which will correct some defi ciencies I see in the current framework  for setting postal rates in the United  States. But more important, if enacted,  ",1991

241,,102,-0.487,818,7,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker. Lead is a highly  toxic substance. A 2-year-old boy died  re cently from lead poisoning. His tiny body had  been overwhelmed by toxic levels of lead. The  child apparently consumed pieces of old lead  paint when his homeless family sought shelter  in an abandoned office building. The tragedy  of this  little boy's death  is  the dramatic ex treme. Untold millions of our children are ex posed to lead from a variety of sources: solder  in pipes,  leaching  into drinking water,  lead  contaminated paint, and air emissions of lead.  Lead  is a ubiquitous  in our society. The  most important use of lead today is in  lead acid batteries. It is critical to remember as we  are advancing into the era of the electric vehi cle that 85 percent of the lead used in manu facturing  is consumed by  the production of  automotive batteries. Since  there  is no eco nomically or  technically viable substitute  for  lead in what are called SU-starting, lighting,  and  ignition-batteries, as  the electric auto mobile  industry develops, battery production,  and therefore, lead use, will increase dramati cally.  Did you know, Mr. Speaker, that more than  70 million batteries are taken out of commis sion every year? Since each battery contains  approximately 20 pounds of lead, the result is  that 14 billion pounds of lead are available for  recycling.  Used batteries are a resource. They are a  resource we must respect if for no other rea sons than the damage lead can do. The lead  that comes from lead acid batteries is highly  recyclable. You can use it over and over again  with no loss in the technical values. Unfortu nately,  lead recycling  is simply a function of  market  forces.  If the price of virgin  lead  is  high, then it is appealing for the battery manu facturer to use recycled  lead.  If the price of  virgin lead is low, then recycled, or secondary,  lead is less appealing.  Lead  that  is not recycled may wind up  in  landfills, or municipal waste incinerators. In ei ther event, it has the potential of contaminat ing our air or water supplies or severely pollut ing our land.  If the price of virgin lead is low  and recycling is sluggish, recyclers have been  known to accumulate batteries, speculating on  the price rising. Stored batteries are an envi ronmental disaster waiting  to happen. Time  and weather can cause battery cases to crack  and  leak  lead-contaminated sulfuric acid on  the ground. Rain water washes lead from the  exposed battery  into  the ground water. The  speculative accumulation of batteries  in  the  past  resulted  in a number of contaminated  sites being added  to the national priority list  [NPL] for Superfund cleanups.  April 29, 1991  Is  the battery problem simply a matter of  doing better at collecting batteries, or is  it a  matter of how much value  is placed on a  spent battery? A clear grasp of the economics  of  the  lead  recycling  industry strongly sug gests that any effective approach to increasing  the  rate of  lead and battery  recycling must  treat lead battery recovery as a demand prob lem  rather  than a supply problem.  In other  words, the supply of lead capable of being re cycled  is high-there are spent batteries ev erywhere-but the demand  for such  lead  is  low. Collecting more batteries,  though nec essary, will not increase demand, only supply.  We need to concentrate our efforts on putting  in place a market system that will increase the  demand  for used batteries. We must  find a  way to make used batteries more valuable.  Over the past 20 years the rate of recycling  has fluctuated violently, parallel with the price  of virgin lead. Any legislative or administrative  solution to the problem of lead acid battery re cycling must take  into account the wild vari ations in the price of virgin lead.  We have a pivotal opportunity now to pre vent continued lead exposure of our children.  Congress  is beginning  the process of reau thorizing the Resource Conservation and Re covery Act [RCRA], and it is a critical oppor tunity to affect significant changes in how we  handle lead.  I, along with Senator TIM WIRTH and the late  Senator John Heinz, crafted the Lead Battery  Recycling  Incentives Act to create  incentives  that enlist the power of market forces to work  for, rather than against battery recycling. H.R.  870 1 charts a new course by creating a sys tem of economic incentives to encourage recy cling.  The Lead Battery Recycling  Incentives Act  requires  the manufacturers and  importers of  batteries  to  take some  responsibility  for  the  products that they produce. Battery manufac turers would be required to use a certain per centage of secondary lead. If the manufacturer  uses more  lead than required,  the manufac turer would be entitled to sell the rights to the  excess  to  those manufacturers or  importers  who use less than the required amount. The  excess rights are called recycling credits and  would  follow  the same model of  the highly  successful EPA phaseout of lead from gaso line.  Some people confuse these credits with the  concept of tax credits. The credits are not tax  credits but a separate saleable asset which  would be produced by the battery manufactur ers as a byproduct of their normal activity. The  credits will have economic value.  It  is as  though a new product is created-a recycling  credit-when the recycler does his job. In this  way we reward positive environmental behav ior rather than solely trying to apprehend viola tors. The Lead Battery Recycling  Incentives  Act combines both carrots and sticks to pre vent lead exposure rather than trying to deal  with lead once it has gotten out of genie's bot tle.  lThe Lead Battery Recycling Incentives Act cur rently has more than 65 cosponsors in the House of  Representatives. In the Senate, the Tire Recycling  Incentives Act, S. 398, was introduced by Sena.tor  Timothy Wirth and the late Senator John Heinz as  well as Senator Jeffords, and Senator Mikulski.  ",1991

244,House,102,-0.52,831,7,Mrs. UNSOELD.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week we got an ugly reminder of what  happens when we do not get tough with  Japan and other countries who  ille gally use  30-mile-long drift nets  to  spread a curtain of death entrapping  hundreds of thousands of our fish, ma rine mammals, and seabirds.  Coast Guard planes got a bird's-eye  view of up  to  four drift net vessels  roaming 360 miles outside legal fishing  zones, without  required  identifying  marks or transponders. The sickening  picture they saw was of drift nets full  of salmon, of boats ignoring signals to  stop, and of criminals cutting  their  nets free to make a quick getaway.  That is why I have joined today with  two of my respected colleagues, GERRY  STUDDS and DON YOUNG,  to introduce  the Driftnet Act of 1991.  The bill authorizes the President to  place sanctions on fish products from  drift-netting nations. And if that does  not work, we have to look at their TV's  and VCR's and camcorders. These drift  net pirate countries have  to under stand that if they insist on stealing our  fish, we are going to get tough.

245,House,102,-0.436,844,7,Mr. LEVINE of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in strong support of the Emergency Supple ment  Iraqi Refugee Assistance Act of 1991,  and commend Chairman FASCELL and Sub committee Chairman HOWARD BERMAN for the  appropriate  speed with which  this bill has  been moved to the floor.  The horror of the human suffering on  the  Iraqi-Turkish border demands immediate and  effective action. It is tragic that the President  did not take earlier action in an attempt to pre vent this catastrophe. The assistance we air  prove today will not help the thousands who  were killed by Saddam Hussein's helicopter  gunships, or who died of starvation and expo sure in a desperate attempt to flee the geno cidal policies of the Iraqi dictator.  But the thousands upon thousands of inno cent civilians displaced as a result of the civil  war in Iraq who survived the trek to the border  regions continue  to  face  the  threat of death  every day. Aid for these individuals is more ur gent and necessary than ever.  I am pleased the president, at congressional  urging, has involved our Armed Forces in the  effort to protect the Kurds and other refugees  and assist emergency relief supplies in getting  through  to where  they are  so desperately  needed. But clearly, the catastrophic situation  faced by these long-suffering people urgently  demands  the additional assistance provided  for in this legislation.  Unquestionably, difficult policy choices  re main about how to safeguard the Iraqi Kurdish  population over the long term. I share the con cerns of many of my colleagues that United  States  forces not be caught in a permanent  holding pattern to protect Iraqi minorities, who  will never be safe so long as Saddam Hussein  remains in power.  I welcome the moves from  the United Nations indicating it will soon take  greater responsibility for administering the ref ugee facilities.  But  regardless of whatever  thorny policy  questions may arise, the human tradegy that  presently exists requires humanitarian action.  I once again commend the authors of this  legislation, and urge  its unanimous accept ance by my colleagues.  [Mr.  (Mr.  ",1991

247,,102,-0.4,857,7,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker,  last week,  south Florida lost one of its foremost environ mental crusader and civic leader. Alice Wain wright passed away at the age of 83.  A resident of Miami for 57 years, Mrs. Wain wright was a remarkable woman who became  an attorney in midlife and served as a member  of the Miami City Commission. Her activities in  behalf of the community were plentiful. But her  first love and most ardent cause was the envi ronment and  for  that she worked  tirelessly  whenever an issue arose that required atten tion.  As a longtime member and former president  of the Tropical Audubon Society,  there was  not a major issue involving the preservation of  south Florida's environment in which she was  not involved as a major player, whether it was  the establishment of Biscayne National Park,  the preservation of Everglades National Park  or the prevention of construction of a jetport in  the Big Cypress National Preserve.  If  there  was something involving the environment that  needed to be done, I knew I could expect a  call from Alice just to let me know she was  looking over my shoulder in case I didn't do all  she thought I should.  Alice Wainwright was  truly an  inspiration  and guiding force for all of us in south Florida  who cherish, and have worked for the preser vation of, our natural resources.  I commend to our colleagues an article from  the April 24 edition of the Miami Herald, along  with an editorial  from  the April 26 edition  which describe Alice Wainwrighf s outstanding  life and career. She will be deeply missed.  [From the Miami Herald, Apr. 24, 1991)  ALICE W AINWRIGIIT, CRUSADER FOR  ENVIRONMENT, DIES AT 83  (By Arnold Markowitz)  Alice Wainwright, devoted bodyguard and  booster of Mother Nature,  died Tuesday  morning in Miami, her home for 57 years.  She was 83, an active and influential envi ronmental crusader to the end.  Mrs. Wainwright, who served a term on the  City Commission from 1961~. was a  long time leader of the Tropical Audubon Society  and Fairchild Tropical Garden. She led and  supported many crusades, including preven tion of a jetport in Big Cypress Swamp and  a resort city on the Islands of what is now  Biscayne National Park.  She was admitted to Mercy Hospital fol lowing a heart attack Sunday, a  spokes woman reported, and died at 7:43 a.m. Tues day.  ""Yesterday she felt like her old self and  wanted to go home,"" said her son John T.  Wainwright, a lawyer who lives in Washing ton. ""She did not have a long, disabling 111ness. She was very active, talking to people,  appearing before regulatory boards.  ""She loved this community of South Flor ida, and she loved this state-from Key West  to the Alabama line. She always used to say  that.""  A service is scheduled for 1 p.m. Friday in  Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, on Bayshore  Drive at the corner of Northeast 16th Street.  Besides her son, Mrs. Wainwright is survived  by two grandsons and a sister-in-law.  Wainwright said his mother wanted no  flowers sent, but would appreciate donations  to the Tropical Audubon Society, the Uni versity of Miami's Chapel of the Venerable  Bede, or an Alice Wainwright Memorial Fund  being established for the city of Miami.  ""It's for anything the city wants,"" the son  said. ""Cleaning windows, fixing the sewers if  necessary. She always said she didn't want  to be remembered for parks, but for sewers.""  In her one City Commission  term, Mrs.  Wainwright led the movement to raise funds  for construction of the sewage  treatment  plant on Virginia Key.  Parks were important to her, too. She got  the  commission  to buy  land  for  a  park  named after Everett Sewell,  an old-days  mayor. Another park, between Brickell Ave nue and Biscayne Bay, is named after Mrs.  Wainwright.  CIVIC BEAUTIFICATION  In the 1960s she worked ardently for civic  beautification, a campaign led nationally by  the president's wife, Lady Bird  Johnson.  They were awarded medals together by the  Garden Clubs of America in 1968.  As a city commissioner, Mrs. Wainwright  also wrote and shoved into law a comprehen sive sign control ordinance forbidding bill boards beside expressways  inside  the city  limits. They uglied up the view; Mrs. Wain wright could not stand ugliness.  One sign rising above Biscayne Boulevard  was her candidate for worst of all, though  other  forces  for good  in  the  community  thought it cute. That was Coopertone's sun tan lotion sign, the mechanical one with a  playful dog pulling a  little girl's swimsuit  down from behind.  ""Blatantly distasteful,"" Alice Wainwright  sniffed.  NO SNOB, BUT A BLUE-BLOOD  Although no snob, she was blue-blooded,  inimitably polite, cultured, diplomatic and  refined. She would never do anything she  considered inappropriate.  Neither would she set aside her principles.  She persisted through four years of hearings  to enact her billboard ordinance.  ""I'm like a dog with a bone,"" she said. ""If  I set my mind to something. I keep on and  on and on and on.""  She was the first woman elected to  the  City Commission,  though not the first fe male member. That was Anna M. Perry, ap pointed in 1938 to finish the term of a com missioner who retired.  STILL INFLUENTIAL  Long after quitting elective politics beause  of her heart condition, Mrs. Wainwright ex erted surprising influence.  ""Alice's strength was knowing everybody  in town,"" said Joe Podgor, a Friends of the  Everglades activist.  Robert Kelley, past president of the Tropi cal Audubon Society, said Mrs. Wainwright  leaves a broad legacy:  ""She was instrumental for historic preser vation here and in Maine. She will be re membered for her work on  the Everglades  and other conservation issues. She was the  National Audubon Society's South Florida  representative for almost 20 years, coordi nating all  six chapters here, and on  the  board of directors at Fairchild Tropical Gar den for many years.    Alice Cutts Wainwright was born into a  family of military officers and lawyers.  An uncle, Marine Gen. John Wriggs Myers,  was senior U.S. officer in China. His father,  a  Confederate  general,  established  and  named the Florida Gulf coast city of Fort  Myers. Col. Richard M. Cutts of the Marines  was Alice's father. She was born at the Bear  Island Navy Yard in California.  WIDOWED EARLY  She attended Briarcliffe College  in New  York. In 1926, at a dinner in Washington, she  met her future husband, John T. Wainwright,  who was studying for a Foreign Service ca reer.  In 1930, when he was a consular officer in  Cuba, John Wainwright drowned  trying to  save a couple swept off a pier by waves. Alice  Wainwright, pregnant and a widow after five  months of marriage, never remarried.  With her small son and her mother, she  came to Miami in 1934 on vacation, fell in  love with the place and stayed.  During World War Il, she drove dignitaries  around for the Red Cross. For about eight  months, she helped assemble airplane propel lers in  the old Pan Am hangar at Dinner  Key.  OPENED LAW OFFICE  law  She  At age 40, Mrs. Wainwright started  school at  the University  of Miami.  opened a one-woman office in 1950.  Mrs. Wainwright wrote  the charter  for  Friends of the Everglades, founded in 1969 by  Majority Stoneman Douglas. It was a natu ral association of leaders in the Florida envi ronmental movement.  They were good friends and occasionally  shared vacations at the Wainwright family  summer home in Maine.  ""We were both from New England,"" Doug las said Tuesday. ""We were very much inter ested in the work we were doing. We were  both independent women.""  Douglas, who celebrated her lOlst birthday  April 7, was sad to hear of her friend's death  at 83, but said:  ""That's not such a bad age to die. She was  a very able woman. It's a great loss to the  community.""

EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The bill  is intended to provide the starting  point for a discussion of the issues affecting  California Indians.  Mr. Speaker, this bill will be carefully consid ered by  the  Interior Committee  in coming  months.  It will probably change before  it will  be  reported. However,  it is  important for all  Members to realize that we must pass legisla tion to address the problems of California Indi ans as soon as possible.  Mr. Speaker,  I urge my colleagues to join  me in support of this important bill.  A BILL TO ASSIST CERTAIN  MILITARY FAMILIES  HON. JACK FIELDS  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 30, 1991  ",1991
249,,102,0.541,870,7,Mr. FIELDS.," Mr. Speaker,  I believe  in the  family.  I believe  that by keeping  families to gether we give our young people the greatest  chance to become well-adjusted and produc tive members of society. Unfortunately,  the  drug abuse and violence  that permeate  to day's society present the family with tougher  challenges than every before.  The Government has a special responsibility  for military families. Our soldiers dedicate their  lives  to preserving our  freedom and  liberty,  and  in  return we should offer them benefits  that meet the needs of their families.    A number of cases in my district concerning  struggling military families have prompted me  to introduce legislation that would help these  families stay together. The bill that I am intro ducing today would make a slight change  in  eligibility  for  the military health care system.  Although only slight,  this change will mean  great financial and emotional relief for a few  families.    When a child has been abused or ne glected, and social service agencies decide to  remove the child from the home, social work ers first attempt to place the child in another  home within the extended family. This place ment allows  the  child  to hold onto  family  bonds that have already formed, and prevents  this child from being shuffled from one foster  family  to another.  In short, placement within  the extended  family provides  the best emo tional support and stability for the child.  However, if this happens in a military family,  some unintended problems crop up for both  the  family and  the child. A child must be  adopted, rather than in the legal custody of a  member or former member of the military to  be eligible  for health care benefits due  the  family. Unless the child is adopted, the family  must purchase private health insurance for the  child, or he must forgo health benefits entirely.  As a whole I do not disagree with this policy  of requiring adoption of a child for that child to  meet the qualifications as a dependent. I only  disagree with the policy when there is a com pelling reason .for the family not to adopt the  child.  In the instance of a grandchild being placed  with grandparents, a niece being placed with  an uncle, or a sibling with an older sister,  adoption of the child is uncomfortable for the  whole family. If adopted, the grandchild would  April 30, 1991  become the brother and brother-in-law to his  parents, and the older sibling would become  mother to her younger brother.  In  these  in stances, we should accept  the court's des ignation of legal custody to be sufficient for eli gibility of military health benefits as a depend ent of the adult who is awarded custody.  My legislation makes no changes in the mili tary health care system, it just slightly expands  the definition of dependent for eligibility in this  system. This definition would be expanded to  include children under the age of 18, who are  relatives of the member or former member of  the military, and who are under legal custody,  as granted by  the courts  to  the member or  former member.  These families are doing their best to stay  together.  I believe that we owe these military  families, who have given so much  for our  country, a little help. I hope you will join me in  supporting this measure.  TRIBUTE  TO  DETECTIVE  SGT.  PAUL MURRAY-ONE OF NASSAU  COUNTY'S FINEST  HON. NORMAN -F.

So I would agree with the gentleman  from Texas, this is a very, very impor tant debate.  It is a  basic American  right, guaranteed by the Constitution,  and we should uphold  that right  to tally.  [Mr.  0 2100  ",1991
256,House,102,0.333,948,7,Mr. RIGGS.,"  I  thank the gentleman  for yielding his  time and appreciate  the opportunity to join the colloquy at  this point, because I come at it from a  little bit different perspective perhaps  than a majority of my colleagues here  in this Chamber, and that is the per spective of, if I can use the term, of an  ex-street cop, and someone who spent 6  years in California law enforcement as  a police officer and as a deputy sheriff  for medium-sized law enforcement ju risdictions, right there on the streets,  confronting the whole crime problem  and  the other societal problems that  are bred by our runaway crime problem  here in America, firsthand.  The first thing I would like to say to  the gentleman is that he has made ref erences  tonight and, previous of our  colleagues have made  references  to night, to the vision of rank and file law  enforcement.  While  not purporting  to  represent  rank  and  file  law  enforcement  en  masse, I can say that there is a wide spread concern in rank and file law en forcement in America with the whole  issue of handgun violence. It is a much  broader issue than what we are discuss ing here  tonight with respect  to our  upcoming votes on  the Brady bill or  the Staggers amendment.  That whole issue of handgun violence  that concerns American  law enforce ment and a significant segment of the  American public so greatly  takes us  into other areas as well,  the issue of  handgun safety, handgun  familiariza tion, and handgun education for gun  purchasers, particularly those with lit tle experience in handling and main taining and storing firearms in a safe  manner.  Rank and file law enforcement has a  very real concern regarding the certain  types of ammunition which are com monly  available  in  sporting  goods  stores and gun shops in America. There  has been a concern, in fact there has  been some focus brought to bear here  in the Congress, with respect to certain  types of ammunition, even ammunition  that has the ability to penetrate the  common type of bulletproof vests worn  by rank and file law enforcement.  They have a concern also with regard  to simply being outgunned on Amer ican streets by the criminal element,  which is in many, many cases now, par ticularly in our inner cities, and in or ganized crime interests that control so  much of the drug  traffic  in America  today, are capable of obtaining and all  too often using weapons of a higher  caliber than the standard issue law en forcement weapon carried by the rank  and file police in America.  There are  still police out on  the  streets of America today who go about  performing their duties without bullet proof vests, for lack of a department-is sued vest, for lack of sufficient funding  in  their  jurisdiction  for whom  they  work,  to provide them with a bullet proof vest.  So, I just wanted to, if I could, insert  those issues into the RECORD,  into our  discussion  this evening,  so we could  look at those as well. Perhaps they are  not  immediately germane  to  the up coming debate, but certainly they are  issues that should concern us all.  I also would have  to disagree with  the inference that when everything is  said and done and we pass some sort of  measure here,  that  this background  check should be done by anyone other  than law enforcement.  Granted, it is going to be a fairly in tricate process when everything is said  and done. But, if not law enforcement,  who should be performing the inquir ies? Law  enforcement,  as  the  gen tleman knows,  right now performs a  variety of inquiries into the criminal  history, if any, on the part of a number  of local citizens, those that seek spe cial types of permits, whether it is liq uor permits, taxicab permits, or job ap plicants in certain situations.  ",1991
257,,102,0.691,961,7,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker, a consid erable decline in standards and morals can be  demonstrated regarding the standing of youth  in our society. Any number of social and edu cational  indicators point this out.  It does not  matter if you examine scholastic aptitude test  [SAT] scores, premarital sexual activity, preg nancies  to unwed  teenagers,  teen  suicide  rates, sexually transmitted disease prevalence,  juvenile crime record, and so forth, the story is  the same. American kids are taking it on the  chin by and large.ls there a central cause to these problems?  Are these problems mutually exclusive? And  why is it that the more prosperous we seem  to be as a nation,  these problems only get  worse?  Mr. Speaker,  I hold to the admonition that  no success can compensate for failure in the  home. The home  is where we should begin  49-059  0-95 Vol. 137 <Pt. 7> 31  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  our search  for answers  to  these problems.  Here we will  find answers to a  large part of  our woes. Complementing the social and edu cational declines of youth are the deteriorating  conditions of their parents. Divorce is an epi demic  today. Female-headed  single  parent  households, negligent husbands avoiding  fi nancial and moral responsibilities, and the re sulting economic strain are too much for the  remaining  familial  structure  to  bear.  This  stress leads to physical, emotional, and sub stance abuse. Pretty soon, the term ""family""  as we know it has ceased.  Unfortunately, there is little that Congress or  any other coercive  instrument can do to  im plant the backbone of moral value necessary  to prevent dysfunctional  families. But moral  value is what is needed. Don't get me wrong.  Congress tries to help, but the help is sadistic,  almost as if tax dollars were going to the Mar quis himself to provide therapy to individuals  suffering  from an  inattention disorder. Con gressional response to date has only  indem nified familial dysfunction.  One area of public policy where Congress  has some leverage is education. From 6 to 8  hours per day, 5 days a week, public school children are open  to concentrated  influence  outside of home and church. Mr. Speaker,  I  will not spend the time here to catalog the in fusion of secular humanism  into public edu cation that began, for all intents and purposes,  in the 1930's. This influence has been widely  broadcast both for good and bad.  But, Mr. Speaker, I do feel compelled at this  time to comment on what secular humanism  has replaced: Normative moral values based  on  the Judea-Christian ethic. Up until 1962,  these values were unquestioned as a positive  influence in public education. Kids were taught  to recognize the moral and historical value of  their  inalienable  rights.  The  precepts  em bodied in  the Ten Commandments were  the  mortar that held our laws together, gave them  weight, and that fueled individual self-govern ment. The consummate benefit to society, to  our moral safety net, was that the concept of  a creator or higher authority was reinforced in  the minds of public school kids.  Far from being an establishment of religion,  formally recognizing a creator as part of the  schoolday affirmed no more than the concept  that some  things  in  life  transcend man. Our  Founders called these things ""life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness."" Evidently, such veri ties are no longer important for public school  kids to understand.  Should we then wonder why our youth are  in such disarray. Should we then wonder why  our ability to govern a nation parallels our rel ative ability to govern ourselves? Would Con gress run such massive debts if each Member  was instilled with the normative wisdom of the  proper role of Government, with frugality, with  prudence? Would a citizenry elect unwise rul ers if a majority of citizens held these values  high in their own lives, if they voluntarily cared  for  the poor, old, and  sick among  them?  Under these conditions, would we really need  an all-encompassing state to use its coercive  powers to compel us to do what we ought to  be doing voluntarily?  Big Government, high crime,  illiterate kids,  and dysfunctional families are ultimately a re sult of moral negligence and a denial of a ere9729  ator. We have allowed moral values and a  creator to be kicked out of public schools, and  because most kids attend public school, we  are paying a high price.  Imagine a public schoolroom where a child  is taught that stealing  is wrong, not because  some adult arbitrarily imposes this opinion, but  because the law of the land, given to this stu dent by a creator, says that the child has an  inalienable right ""to the pursuit of happiness""  and  therefore  frowns disapprovingly on one  person taking something  that belongs to an other person.  Under what circumstances would the child  better learn this  lesson: (A) where a teacher  arbitrarily opines the belief that stealing is bad  even  though the child has friends who have  found great utility in stealing; or (B) where a  teacher  reinforces  home  and  the  religious  community of the family to say, regardless of  utility, stealing  is wrong because the Creator  of your rights, rights that could be trampled in  a climate of theft, has judged it to be wrong.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, were  you  to  choose (B), schools would not be able to im plement programs sufficient to meet this goal.  The U.S. Supreme Court has told us so. They  have said that to do so  is a violation of the  first amendment's establishment clause,  that  to allow class time to be used by students to  formally recognize the Creator who gave them  their inalienable rights is a contractual breach  never intended by the same Founders who in sisted that we have such transcendent rights.  I,  like many other Americans, believe  that  the Supreme Court has missed both the juris  and the prudence of this issue. To correct this  deficiency I am introducing the community life  amendment. The amendment says simply:  Nothing in this Constitution shall prohibit  the inclusion of voluntary prayer in any pub lic school program or activity. Neither the  United States nor any State shall prescribe  the content of any such prayer.  The community  life amendment  reaffirms  the inherent constitutional right all Americans  have to acknowledge  the Creator who gave  them  their  inalienable  rights. This constitu tional amendment would allow  local commu nities to determine for themselves the matter  of voluntary prayer  in public school.  It says  that the Federal Government has no positive  role to play in determining these issues.  I commend this measure  to all of my col leagues. With this submission, I am also creat ing a discharge petition. All Members are in vited to sign this petition. Once we reach 218  signatures, we will have the pleasure and op portunity to debate this issue on the floor and  give  the American people something  to go  on-an up or down recorded vote on voluntary  school prayer.  TRIBUTE TO GILBERT RAYMOND  ADAMS  HON. FSTEBAN EDWARD TORRF.S  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 1, 1991  ",1991
258,,102,0.098,974,7,Mr. DAVIS.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing two bills to increase the effectiveness  of the U.S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard  Management and Law Enforcement Act of  1991 consists of four titles dealing with Coast  Guard vessel acquisition and renovation,  law  enforcement, management and administration,  and  recreational boating safety. This bill will  enhance the Coast Guard's ability to meet its  responsibilities  in  these areas, and benefit  those who depend upon an effective, respon sive Coast Guard. The other bill I am introduc ing establishes a definition of ""United States  vessel""  for  the United States Code,  and  makes other technical changes in the Code to  conform existing statutory language to the new  definition.  COAST GUARD MANAGEMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT  ACT OF 1991  Title  I of this bill deals with Coast Guard  vessel acquisitions and  renovations. Section  101  authorizes $14 million  to  renovate and  modernize the Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw,  in line with the findings of a Coast Guard sur vey conducted  last year. These  renovations  will take place over a 5-year time period and  extend the useful life of the Mackinaw at least  15 years.    lcebreaking on the Great Lakes is an essen tial Coast Guard service that is necessary to  keep  the shipping  lanes open on  the Great  Lakes. I believe that the additional investment  in the Mackinaw is small compared to the ben efits realized from the operation of this vessel  on the Great Lakes.  Section 102 of this bill authorizes $500,000  for  the  Coast Guard  to  implement  the  Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention  and Control Act of 1990. This act deals with  the major problem of controlling  the spread  and repairing the damage caused by the tiny  zebra mussel  in  the Great Lakes  region.  Under the Aquatic Nuisance Prevention Act,  the Coast Guard is required to develop ballast  water management guidelines  for  the Great  Lakes and Saint Lawrence River  to become  mandatory 6 months following enactment. The  Coast Guard is also required by the act to de termine the extent of shipping as a pathway  for introduction of nonindigenous species into  water other than the Great Lakes and to as sess alternate methods  for controlling  intro duction and dispersal of nonindigenous spe cies. The  sums  necessary  to  fund Coast  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Guard implementation of this  important piece  of legislation are small yet vital to interrupt the  cycle of damage in the Great Lakes caused by  the zebra mussel.  Section 103 of this bill authorizes the Sec retary of Transportation to acquire vessels for  use by the Coast Guard by purchase, lease,  lease-purchase, or otherwise under multiyear  contracts.  I  think  that  the Secretary should  have  the broadest possible authority  to ac quire additional vessels for the Coast Guard,  subject to reasonable conditions.  I am aware  that certain budgetary limitations may restrict  the use of this  type of acquisition arrange ment, but  I believe that we should give the  Secretary the authority to use different types  of financial arrangements if necessary.  Title  II  of  this  bill  broadens  the Coast  Guard's authority to act as  the primary U.S.  law enforcement agency on the water. Subtitle  A of title II contains several sections to imple ment a new force-down authority for Federal  law enforcement officers to order aircraft sus pected of drug smuggling  to  land. This new  authority is a vital law enforcement tool for use  against drug smugglers, and was proposed by  the President as part of the 1990 and 1991  national drug control strategies. This language  is identical to the language contained in H.R.  681,  introduced earlier this year by my col league,  Representative  LARRY  COUGHLIN,  ranking minority member of the Select Com mittee on Narcotics Abuse and Control.  Section 201 of this bill establishes a criminal  penalty for failure to obey an order of a Fed eral law enforcement officer who is enforcing  the controlled substances  laws. Section 202  requires  revocation of  the  registration of an  aircraft when  the pilot of the aircraft  fails  to  obey an order to  land. Section 203 clarifies  the Coast Guard's authority  to  issue orders  and  take all other  lawful @Ctions  to enforce  U.S. laws against aircraft over the high seas  or waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Section  204 establishes a civil penalty for the operator  of a vessel or aircraft who intentionally fails to  comply with an order of a Coast Guard officer  to stop. Section 205 deals with the definition  of the term ""authorized place"" under the Tariff  Act of 1930. Section 206 establishes a civil  penalty for the pilot or operator of an aircraft  who intentionally fails to obey the order of a  customs officer to land.  Subtitle B, section 207 of the bill requires  the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation  with the Secretary of State, to submit a report  to Congress with recommendations on which  laws currently enforced by the Coast Guard in  the territorial seas should be extended in ap plication to the new 12-mile territorial sea limit  established by Presidential proclamation  last  December. This report is necessary to enable  Congress to thoroughly review the U.S.  laws  applicable in the territorial seas and make de cisions on which laws should be extended in  application to 12 nautical miles.  Title Ill of this bill contains several sections  related to Coast Guard management and ad ministration. Section 301  establishes a Mer chant Marine Reserve within the Coast Guard  Reserve. It is critical to maintain an adequate  number of qualified, available merchant mari ners to man the merchant fleet during war or  national emergency. Recent studies predicted  a shortfall of certain merchant marine personMay 1, 1991  nel, and our recent experience in the Desert  Shield and Desert Storm operations proved  these predictions to be accurate. To remedy  this problem, we must develop a pool of mer chant marine reservists ready to serve when  needed.  Section 302 clarifies that  the Secretary of  Transportation would  retain  the authority  to  execute the  functions of the Secretary under  title 46, United States Code, even if the Coast  Guard is transferred to the Navy in time of war  or national emergency. The  functions of the  Secretary under title 46 are peacetime func tions, and it would not be appropriate or advis able to transfer them to the Secretary of the  Navy along with Coast Guard military  func tions in time of war or national emergency.  Section  303  makes  certain  technical  changes to conform the description of docu mented vessels with Great Lakes endorse ments to recent changes in the vessel docu mentation laws under chapter 121 of title 46,  United States Code.  Title  IV of  this bill enhances  recerational  boating safety. Section 401 of this bill extends  the expiration date of  the National Boating  Safety Advisory Council until September 30,  1996. This group provides valuable advise to  the Secretary of Transportation on boating  safety matters and should be allowed to con tinue to serve this valuable function.  UNIFORM U.S VESSEL DEFINITION ACT  This bill is a continuation of the work begun  in  the Ship Mortgage Act codification, Public  Law 10~710. In the act, for the purposes of  chapter 313 of title 46, United States Code, a  vessel of the United States was defined to in clude vessels titled under the law of a State,  in addition  to vessels documented or num bered under  the  laws Qf  the United States.  This bill  includes this definition among those  applicable to the entire United States Code,  and changes the defined term from ""vessel of  the United States""  to  the more manageable  ""United States vessel."" Section 3 of the bill  makes  the  conforming  changes  necessary  throughout the code.  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with  my colleagues on  the Merchant Marine and  Fisheries Committee to enact the provisions of  this bill.  NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  AWARENESS MONTH  HON.

I regret to inform my colleagues  that I  think both sides have decided  they would  rather have  a  :t1'>litical  issue than a legislative solution to the  debate.  But I also inform my colleagues that  you are going to hear a lot of discus sion about whether the bill is a quota  bill and whether or not it is a bonanza  for trial lawyers.  I will go so far as  to suggest that  H.R. 1, the Democrats' civil rights bill,  is not a quota bill in and of itself. Un fortunately,  however,  the  impact of  H.R. 1 will be quotas.  D 1210  Mr. Speaker, every business in Amer ica  looking at  that  legislation will  make the decision to hire by a numeri cal basis in order to protect themselves  from potential  litigation. If my col leagues on the other side of the aisle  really want to eliminate the possibility  of a  lawyers' bonanza,  I plead with  them to bring a bill to the floor that  will eliminate section 9, because sec tion 9 of H.R. 1 says that in every case  of civil rights ever filed after the pas sage of this bill, no consent decree can  ever be entered into between the plain tiff and the defendant unless the trial  lawyer certifies to the court that any  reduction in his legal fees has been ap proved prior to that by himself. Think  of that.  ENCOURAGING  COLOMBIAN  GOV ERNMENT TO CONTINUE STRUG GLE WITH DRUG CARTEL  .

260,House,102,-0.41,1013,7,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker,  it  has been 7 years since the Colombian  Minister  of  Justice, Rodrigo Laura  .Bonilla, was assassinated. At the time  of his assassination, I was speaking in  the National Palace with  the Presi dent, Belisario Betancur. When  the  news of this assassination of the Min ister of Justice came to the Palace, the  President turned to me and said that  his country was ""a hostage to the drug  cartel."" The criminal organization that  has the wealth and power of a nation.  Since  that  time,  action has been  taken by courageous Colombian offi cials of the Government to make war  on the cartel. And there are signs of  progress, but there are also signs of  discouragement.  We would say to our friends in Co lombia that they should keep up the  war  against  the  drug  cartel;  they  should continue  the struggle because  the power of a free people is more pow erful than the guns of the cartel.  We know that the price of freedom is  high, but there is no greater gift to any  nation than for its people to be free.  We support the people of Colombia in  their struggle for freedom.  Mr.  THOUGHTS ABOUT ONGOING  AGONY IN MIDDLE EAST  (Mr. DORNAN of California asked for  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  DORNAN  of California. Mr.  Speaker, I rise this morning to pass on  a  few  thoughts  about  the  ongoing  agony in the Middle East. But before I  do, just a quick prologue.  A month and a day ago  today, on  April 1, I had my right hip removed and  replaced. And I just wanted to say that  I will do a special order about the won ders  of modern American medical  science. Even with all the problems we  have with the cost of medical care and  medical  insurance, we  are  certainly  lucky to be Americans in the end of the  20th century. What American medicine  can do for us when everything is work ing right, is absolutely incredible.  But about  the Middle East.  I was  lying there in my bed, a few days back,  at home  recuperating  from  surgery,  and  I  saw something  that made me  think I was dreaming.  It was  the  national  orchestra,  it  would be stretching it to call it a philharmonic,  of  Iraq at Saddam Hus sein's-the world's greatest first degree  mass murderer-birthday celebration.  They were playing for him Frank Si natra's big hit, ""I did it my way."" At  the same time Iraq is asking the world  permission to pump a billion dollars'  worth of its oil, while 560 oil wells are  still burning in Kuwait. It is simply  unbelievable that he brags that he did  it his way.

262,House,102,-0.479,1026,7,Mr. MINETA.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  today in strong support of H.R. 1988,  the NASA 1991 multiyear authorization  bill. I congratulate my colleagues Mr.  BROWN of California and Mr. HALL of  Texas for their hard work on this legis lation.  Mr. Chairman, space exploration has  served as a vehicle for investment in  technology, bolstered our economy, en hanced our world competitiveness, and  improved our national security.  It is no coincidence that the growth  and expansion of our Nation's high technology  industries have paralleled  the years of NASA's greatest activity  and accomplishment.  I believe  that Congress must con tinue to support our civilian space pro gram if that program is  to reach its  full potential.  The duty of Congress, as drafters of  the Nation's space policy, is to estab lish a  realistic,  long-term plan  that  will benefit the American people.  I  believe  there  is  simply no  sub stitute for making tough choices about  our space program and  then moving  ahead to make those choices work in  our national interest.  A cohesive space program that recog nizes  the  imperatives  of  competing  with Europe, Japan, the Soviet Union,  and others is in the fundamental eco nomic interests of the United States.  The truth is that our space program  is not a luxury.  In the days of the Apollo Program,  the drive  to explore space and reach  the Moon was partly a  result of the  space race between the United States  and the Soviet Union.  Today, the space race is one of eco nomic and scientific competition-and  not one with geopolitical or even mili tary overtones.  The Augustine Commission report re leased earlier this year has afforded us  a golden opportunity to crystalize pub lic attention and support behind a rein vigorated space program.  Mr. Chairman, this bill represents a  very serious attempt to reflect the rec ommendations in the Augustine report.  This bill allows  for growth and pro vides funding for a restructured space  station that is in line with fiscal reali ties.  The bill targets more money for life  sciences and puts higher priority on  space  science  to  rebuild our  ailing  space infrastructure, much of which is  30 years old. The bill also supports the  mission to planet Earth and the mis sion from planet Earth, but it keeps its  support to a level of growth that is re alistic given current fiscal constraints.  Mr. Chairman, no matter where our  space  efforts  are  focused-toward  Earth, toward our solar system, or to ward  the universe beyond-we must  never forget that the ultimate goals of  the space program must be to improve  the human condition.  And perhaps it is this point which  needs the most reinforcement.  Our  improved quality of medicine,  manufacturing, education, communica tions, and so much more just through  space-related  technological  advances  easily erases any doubts about the ben efits of the space program.  How  can we  even  consider  short changing future generations of Ameri cans by ignoring the vast opportunities  of space exploration?  The answer, Mr. Chairman, is I don't  believe we can.  ",1991

266,House,102,-0.007,1078,7,Mr. HUTTO.," Mr. Speaker, The  im pact of Desert Storm hit home hard in  northwest Florida when an AC-130H  gunship went down on a combat mis sion in southeastern Kuwait on Janu ary 31. The 14 members of the crew  were listed as missing in action. The  aircraft was found in the Persian Gulf  after the coalition victory. On Friday,  March 15, I attended a memorial serv ice held for the crew at Hurlburt Field.  It was a beautiful service in honor of  these heroes.  The  following statement was made  by Maj. Gen. Thomas Eggers,  com mander of the Air Force Special Oper ations Command:  Today we gather to honor the men of Spir it 03 and to recognize the ultimate price for  freedom a commando will be asked to pay.  Air Commandos have an extremely proud  heritage, starting with the vision of men like  General Hap Arnold. With missions  like  Desert One-the guts  to  try;  just cause- those who cared and those who dared; and  then Desert Storm giving yet another coun try and its people a chance for freedom. The  men we remember, the appreciation we show  to them here today, touches our heart but  also leaves us saddened and stunned.  When we depart from this place, let's re flect and say that these men, these Air Com mandos had the courage and the sense of per sonal duty which made them face up to the  tough tasks of each day. Each possessed an  unfailing formula for accomplishing the mis sion; those key elements of patriotism, self respect, discipline and self-confidence. Men  with very different backgrounds, yet bound  together by a sense of mission and a spirit of  teamwork that only those who have served  their country in a special way can hope to  know.  We could ask, what did our Air Comman dos  think was so  important and what  in spired them to serve this great country?  The answer may lie buried in our feelings  and hidden in our emotions. If ever you have  stood alone and watched  from  along  the  sound, the shadows of the setting sun deepen  and change the western sky, then you know  the great beauty they sought. If ever you  have walked a lonely sea shore and felt the  chill of salt air that the evening wind sends  to the shore, you have felt the peace they  yearned for.  If ever you have watched a seagull soar si lently  through clear blue skies,  then you  have known the freedom they sought.  If ever you remember the security and love  you felt, when as a young child you were  rocked softly to sleep,  then you know  the  tremendous trust they had in one another.  If ever you have watched  the stars and  stripes dip and  tug at the  lanyard, while  from somewhere deep within you a shiver of  pride welled up within your chest, then you  know the endless love they had for God, for  country, and for the brotherhood of free men  everywhere.  These dedicated military professionals these quiet professionals met the demands of  the United States of America in its finest  tradition. Their courage and sacrifice will  stand the test of time, because we will make  sure that it does.  These men who gave their lives were called  home by a loving creator. We believe and we  know that their spirits live on, and that the  spirit that bound them together lives on in  each of us present here today.  In times like this, we think of the words of  our Lord, from the prophet Isaiah * * * ""Be  strong and of good courage. Be not afraid,  neither be  thou dismayed. They that wait  upon  the Lord shall renew  their strength.  They shall mount up with wings as eagles,  they shall run, and not be weary.""  And now, I ask each of you * * * every time  you hear words like-""God Bless America,  land that I love,"" and ""I'm proud to be an  American where at least I know I'm free,"" to  think of these Air Commandos that we honor  here today and the cause that they found for  and believed  in. And  remember  that Air  Commandos will continue to answer a call  for help ""any time-any place,"" in the cause  of freedom. These were the words of General  Eggers.  The  following statement was deliv ered by Col. George Gray, commander  of the First Special Operations Wing:  These 14 airmen came to Hurlburt for one  primary reason-they wanted to serve their  country. You never had to ask them to go de fend freedom for millions of Panamanians or  Kuwaitis-they were always ready and eager  to  support our country's national policy.  They were magnificent!  These people and this squadron have built  a trust and confidence in our ground forces  that make  them  a  particularly  effective  member of our Country's Armed Forces.  I  remember  last year at  the Squadron  Christmas party, Barbara and I were hosting  some good friends at our home. His name  was Colonel Joe Hunt, the Third Ranger Bat talion Commander. When  I mentioned  the  16th was having their Christmas party that  evening, he asked if he could go and talk to  the Squadron. We, of course, went. Joe had  two messages: Thanks for saving the lives of  my  troops at Rio Hato and just as impor tantly, thanks for letting them sleep. They  had been up for  two days and engaged  in  combat for 24 hours. Most of his troops had  never  seen  combat before  and were  too  scared to sleep. But when they saw Spectre  overhead,  they knew someone they trusted  was watching over them and they slept like  babies.  The morning of January 31 wasn't much  different. Our Marines were engaged with a  large Iraqi force during the first major incur sion of the war. The first two had destroyed  numerous enemy APC's and trucks. Spirit 03  was almost at the end of their block of time  of 0600. It was starting to get light, but the  Marines were extremely concerned about a  Frog missile battery which had moved into  position several miles south of the Kuwait  border. They knew heavy Triple A was in the  area and they also knew  the Frog missile  was capable of delivering chemical muni tions on our Marines. Despite  the known  risks, Spirit 03 elected to engage and destroy  this major threat to our Marines. They were  where they were supposed to be-they knew  that they had to do and nobody could sup port our ground forces when  they were  in  trouble better than they could.  Today we remember these heroes.  Today is also the beginning of the healing  process for the Wing and the Squadron and  the families. The Wing and the Squadron will  heal quickly since we know we will be called  on again soon  to defend freedom. We only  pray that healing process for our families  will be a quick one. These were the words of  Colonel Gray.  The following comments were made  by Lt. Col. Donn P. Kegel, commander  of the 16th Special Operations Squad ron:  As I flew back to the States on Saturday,  I wondered what I could say or do to lessen  the pain many of you have today. I realized,  however, that there was no way I could take  away the hurt and loss you as family and  friends would suffer. I do hope today's cere mony can bring some comfort-some con solation into your lives.  A soldier always looks for peaceful solu tions before any hostilities begin. When the  time comes, however, a commander's duty is  to order men into battle. As commanders, we  also eulogize these same men when they do  not return.  The heroes of Spirit 03 were good men and  good  soldiers. Their actions speak of  the  very finest qualities in men: loyalty, cour age, and devotion  to duty. When called to  fight, they did so willingly, I could even say  eagerly, with the knowledge that their cause  was  just. They were selflessly serving the  cause of peace and freedom in a historic and  unprecedented United Nation's effort. They  fought for freedom and fulfilled their duty  with what Abraham Lincoln called,  ""The  last full measure of devotion."" They were  what good men aspire to be. Our memory of  them will forever be that of men who stepped  to the front-who answered the call of duty  and made the ultimate sacrifice.  Major Paul Weaver,  the pilot, was dedi cated to the Air Force mission. He was a  quiet fellow, with determination in his heart  to always do  the best for his Country-his  unit. The Air Force was not a job to Paul, it  was his life, his call to duty.  First Lieutenant Cliff Bland, the copilot. I  remember my first acquaintance with Cliff  as Vice at last year's dining in. A witty fel low with a sparkling smile, he made people  happy. As many members of the Squadron,  he wanted to fly at every opportunity. You  didn't put this guy behind a desk and not  hear about it.  Staff Sergeant Damon Kanuha, the Flight  Engineer. A very pleasant, energetic, can-do  person-always a polite man. He kept the  hub of Squadron operations moving working  at the mission control center-give him a  task and it would be done. He was profes sional in every aspect.  ",1991
267,,102,-0.361,1104,7,Mr. MANTON.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  call to the attention of my colleagues an article  which appeared  in  the Washington Post  re cently on Union Pacific Railroad chairman Mi chael A. Walsh.  In addition to his chores as  head  of  the Union Pacific Railroad, Mike  Walsh currently performs double duty as chair man of the American Association of Railroads.  I am a member of the Energy and Commerce  Subcommittee on Transportation and Hazard ous Materials, which has jurisdiction over our  Nation's  railroads.  In  that capacity,  I have  been fortunate to get to know and work with  Mike on a number of occasions. Mike clearly  has proven  to be an aggressive spokesman  for  the  interests of his  industry. Furthermore  Mike, who has not spent much time previously  on Capitol Hill, has shown himself  to be a  quick study and a good student of the legisla tive process in Washington.  Mr. Speaker Mike's management style and  his political skill has caught the attention of  many of us on Capitol Hill. The Washington  Post's recent story is simply confirmation that  Mike Walsh  is a  force  to be  reckoned with  whenever matters involving the railroad indus try are considered. Even Mike's adversaries  will agree  that he  is  indeed a worthy oppo nent. As long as Mike Walsh is at the helm as  head of the American Association of Railroads  no one will say this is a staid or passive indus try.  Mr. Speaker,  I commend this article to my  colleagues and I ask that it be reprinted in the  RECORD at this point:  [From the Washington Post, April 26, 1991]  RAIL INDUSTRY'S NEW SPOKESMAN SEEKS TO  BE AN ENGINE OF CHANGE-A KEY FIGURE IN  STRIKE, WALSH  IS VIEWED WITH ADMIRA TION AND WARINESS  (By Don Phillips)  When trains were halted nationwide by a  strike last week,  the key player from  the  railroad industry was a newcomer to Wash ington. But Union Pacific Railroad Chair man Michael H. Walsh appears to be a name  and a face  that congressional and adminis tration circles wlll get to know.  By most accounts, Walsh is an unlikely  railroad man. He is a Democrat hired by a  Republican, heading a company known for  being the first transcontinental railroad, a  company with Washington connections when  it was run by the late ambassador W. Averell  Harriman and his father E.H. Harriman.  Walsh, a graduate of Stanford University  and Yale Law School, was recruited by Drew  Lewis, chairman of the railroad's parent, the  Union Pacific Corp., and a  transportation  secretary in the Reagan administration.  Walsh  acknowledges he hardly  knew  a  thing about  the business when Lewis ap proached him in 1986, just six years after his  first venture into the business world at the  Cummins Engine Co. But this year he was  named ""Railroader of the Year"" by Modern  Railroads Magazine, based on five years of  continuous revenue growth and a dedication  to quality  that has shown up  in  reduced  costs from derailments and employee claims.

268,,102,-0.28,1130,7,Mr. KOLTER.," Mr. Speaker, just today I have  received distressing news of army-backed ter rorist anti-Croatian actions escalating in Cro atia. Just today two policemen were murdered  by these roving bands of terrorists in Bibinje,  a Croatian town outside of Zadar, and a town  near Vokovar, which is quite a distance away  from the first town.  These insidious and systematic unprovoked  attacks by  the  terrorists are all  the more  alarming because of the news that the army,  rather than playing a peacekeeping and mod erating role, has reportedly armed the terror ists in an effort to incite a Croatian response  and thereby offer the army an alibi to  install  martial law.  The increased level of terrorist and army ac tivity since January 24 and 25 have, according  to Croatian governmental sources,  increased  both terrorist and army activities as the May  15, 1991, date approaches. May 15  is  the  date when the Communist President of Yugo slavia, Mr. Jovic, will be replaced by the dem ocrat from Croatia, Mr. Stipe Mesic.  Mr. Speaker, the United States must at the  very least come out against these terrorist ac tivities and state that we support a dialog and  not violence.  I fear that unless the United States imme diately comes out with such a stand that we  may unwittingly promote a civil war.  CALUMET  REGION  MONTESSORI  SCHOOL CELEBRATES 25TH ANNI.;  VERSARY  HON.

The Calumet Region Montessori School,  CAMS, was founded in 1966 with a belief and  a dream. The belief was in the philosophy of  Dr. Maria Montessori and the dream was to  establish a Montessori school in northwest In diana.  In September  1966,  two preschool  classes began  in  the Glen Park section of  Gary. Various subsequent  locations housed  classes until 1968 when land was purchased  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  in Hobart. The school, at 2109 East 57th Ave nue, was designed from the ground up as a  Montessori school. Classes started  in March  1969. In time, an elementary program, parent toddler classes and new wings were added.  Today, children from 18 months to 12 years of  age attend the school.  As CAMS begins  its second 25 years, we  all owe a debt of gratitude to the many par ents, staff, and  friends who have kept  the  dream alive.  Special  recognition goes  to  the  following  people who gave freely of their time, talents  and money  in  the early years. Arthur and  Anne Collins, two of the original four founders  of CAMS.

JIM SAXTON  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 2, 1991  ",1991
270,,102,0.238,1130,7,Mr. SAXTON.," Mr. Speaker, over the past 2  years, I have been involved with an important  effort to reevaluate the way Government orga nizes, prioritizes, and manages environmental  research and development. Last year, many of  you joined me  in  this effort by supporting a  study to be conducted by the National Acad emy of Sciences to investigate the concept of  establishing a National Institutes for the Envi ronment-the NIE-patterned after  the Na tional Institutes of Health. That study is about  to commence and will gather  together sci entists from across the board to objectively in vestigate the multifaceted  issues surrounding  the environment and the need for competitive  and  aggressive  research and development  into the solutions we so desperately need.  In many of my discussions with scientists  around the Nation and neighboring countries,  the problem of adequately funding competitive  research has been an  issue of serious con cern. The need  to encourage more support  and  involvement  from  the private sector  in  these matters  is essential  if our country  is  going to continue taking the lead on matters of  environmental stewardship and  technological  innovations for solutions to the many aspects  of pollution, contamination and  resource  re covery.  I am pleased to bring to the attention of the  House a program, financed by a company in  the private sector,  that will help educate the  environmental  leaders of tomorrow and pro",1991

272,House,102,0.348,1143,7,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Speak er, I thank my colleagues from Wash ington for this opportunity to partici pate in this discussion regarding Amer ican  technology.  Indeed, it is  impor tant to discuss our future ability to  provide  leadership  in  the world not  only for our national defense, but also  for  the defense of freedom.  I believe  that  the B-2 and stealth  technology  will provide the kind of leadership that  allows a sustainable peace for all peo ples of the world.  This Member has generally been a  supporter  of our military  spending  through the 1980's. My support for na tional defense is in no small part be cause my district in California prob ably has as many, if not more, military  installations than any district in the  country.  It has been relatively easy for me  philosophically to reflect the attitude  of my district; but from time to time I  have had doubts about ever-escalating  defense budgets and I have questioned  some of those programs that were on  the edge of technology.  Indeed, when the debates had taken  place  in  the past  regarding  the B-2  bomber and people talked about costs  that might push half-a-billion dollars  per plane, I scratched my head, along  with  the American people, and said,  ""Wait a minute,"" even though, in the  final analysis,  I was a  supporter of  steal th technology and the B-2.  Once I became a member of the sub committee on which the gentleman so  ably serves, I could not help but face  the  reality  that  this  new  position  meant my vote might make more of a  difference on some of the most signifi cant expenditures in the DOD budget.  That forced me to take a different kind  of look at this specific technology; that  is, stealth and the B-2. I spent much of  the last 2 months on in-depth briefings  and analyses of this program, and it is  because of this extensive effort that I  have come to join with the gentleman  today in this discussion of the B-2.  The opportunity for me  to partici pate in that kind of analysis and effort,  coming almost in confluence with this  incredible  experience  in  the Middle  East,  offers  a  distinct  and  unique  chance to view the B-2 in a different  kind of way.  The American people are proud of our  country's recent success in the Middle  East. There is little doubt that our tre mendous success results from  the ef forts of our defense workers in deliver ing and producing the goods. There is a  sense of pride in this country about our  ability to defend ourselves that I have  not seen since World War II.  In that context, I think it is very im portant to focus upon why we were so  successful. We won because our  tax payers were willing  to commit huge  dollars to keep us on the cutting edge  of technology. In every sphere of effort  in the Middle East, those who helped  produce  the  technology  led  the way.  This  allowed  our  service men  and  women to be successful.  Incredibly, the Stealth F-117 was on  the battlefield. They were used in this  war and in the first 2 days,  flew be tween 2 and 3 percent of the missions-",1991

""Betty"" Duffie. On this date, Betty will  officially retire as founder and president of the  Babcock Center in Columbia, SC. The Bab cock Center  is  recognized nationwide as a  conduit for the dissemination and delivery of  services to the mentally handicapped.  Betty Duffie  is  truly  the counterpart  to Sir  Thomas More, whose exemplary life was the  subject of award-winning dramas and films en titled ""A Man For All Seasons."" In south Caro lina, she is the ""Woman For All Seasons."" Her  accomplishments stagger the imagination, and  her zeal and enthusiasm  in championing the  cause of  the mentally  retarded are without  parallel.  Our State motto in South Carolina is ""While  I breathe, I hope."" It is also the motto of Betty  Duffie. As a pioneer  in  the development of  community-based  programs  for  the  handi capped, she founded the Babcock Center in  Columbia 25 years ago with virtually no budg et. Since then, the Babcock Center has grown  from a handful of children in the basement of  a church to a comprehensive network of serv ices with a budget of $15 million per annum.  From its austere beginning, the program now  serves over 700 clients daily. In fact, the Bab cock Center is the largest provider of commu nity residential services in South Carolina.  Among her many achievements include the  founding and organization of the  first special  Olympics program in South Carolina. For over  1 O years, Mary served as volunteer executive  director of the South Carolina Special Olym pics, and her work has been recognized na tionwide  in making special Olympics such a  huge success. One of her greatest honors  was to be awarded the Order of the Palmetto,  the single greatest recognition  that a citizen  can receive from the State of South Carolina.  Mr. Speaker, because of wonderful people  like Betty Duffie,  the world  is a  far better  place. She is the epitome of model citizenship,  and her career serves as a reminder that one  person can make a difference.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  BIG MAC ATTACK ON WASTE  HON. JAMES H. SCHEUER  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 6, 1991  ",1991
274,,102,-0.478,1182,7,Mr. SCHEUER.," Last month the McDonald's  Corp., the Nation's largest fast-food chain, an nounced a major new program  to  reduce  waste at all of its restaurants and facilities.  Each day the 8,500 McDonald's restaurants  and  34 distribution  centers  in  the United  States  produce  over 2 million  pounds  of  waste. Recognizing this problem, McDonald's  has  taken  it upon  itself to  reduce  its waste  output by 80 percent over the next few years.  Working with  the Environmental Defense  Fund  [EDF], McDonald's has developed 42  separate initiatives to reduce waste. They in clude switching from styrofoam food contain ers to paper wrappers, requiring suppliers to  use  packaging material  that  is  recyclable,  using starched-based utensils which can be  recycled as opposed to traditional plastic uten sils which cannot, and testing reusable mate rials  instead of relying completely on dispos ables. They are also spending over $100 mil lion on their own recycling efforts.  McDonald's serves over 18 million people  daily. They  recognize  that  they are a major  market power and are using  this power  to  benefit  the environment. When McDonald's  talks, suppliers will  listen. When McDonald's  tells suppliers to use recyclable materials, sup pliers will use recyclable materials.  The cooperation between McDonald's and  EDF was truly unique. McDonald's gave EDF  full access to its books and operations. For its  part, EDF took the time to understand McDon ald's operation and did not charge anything for  its consulting services. Working together they  developed a sensible plan, one  that made a  major dent in the waste problem and did not  unduly interfere with McDonald's business op erations.  I applaud the efforts of McDonald's and the  EDF. They have done  this country a great  service.  It is my hope that other companies,  both  in  the  fast-food  industry and  in other  fields, will follow their example.  The next time I am in the mood for a burg er, some fries, and a milk shake, I am going  to the Golden Arches. I will satisfy my hunger  and help the environment at the same time.

275,House,102,-0.656,1195,7,Mr. HAYES of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  wish to congratulate the managers of  this bill. Both Mr. VENTO and LAGO to be congratulated  for  putting together this study.  The history of labor  is  the untold  story of the struggle for dignity for all  working people. My own city of Chi cago has been crucial to that develop ment. From  the meatpacking houses  and steel mills to the stockyards and  office buildings, Chicagoans have made  labor history. Probably the single most  significant contribution to the history  of labor by the American labor move ment was  the struggle for the 8-hour  day. Chicago is the home of that move ment. But there are very few monu ments to our history. I was fortunate  to have a building named after me in  the  location where Joe Louis fought  his first fight and George Johnson, an  African-American businessman, got his  start.  Today, however, I wish to address the  larger issue of labor education. Schools  in many other countries devote part of  their history studies to labor and its  role in the development of society. Un fortunately,  that  is not usually  the  case  in  the United States. Children  have  lost  the personal  identity with  the history of their parents.  As a Member of Congress and former  trade union officer, often I go into Chi cago-area schools and discuss the role  of labor in building this country's in dustrial and agricultural foundation. I  tell the children how the hands of labor  changed this country from a wilderness  to the most powerful Nation on Earth.  They are eager to know their history.  By dedicating certain memorials  to  labor, I hope your bill helps to bridge  the education gap.  Often overlooked is the history of Af rican-Americans  in  labor. Brother A.  Phillip Randolph, whose statue  is  in  Union Station,  founded and  led  the  Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters  Union to greatness. As is typical in the  case of African-American labor leaders,  our struggle for equal wages was also a  struggle for equal rights. Our fight for  dignity for all working people was the  fight for equality for all Americans.  That struggle  is  just as  important  today. The history of labor and the Af rican-American  community  is  still  linked. We need to look no futher than  the  life of Rev. Martin Luther King.  His last speech, where declared that he  had ""been to  the mountain-top"" and  did not fear the bigots and would not  bow to their threats, was spoken to a  labor gathering in Memphis.  So, I wish to thank the sponsors of  this bill. We need to educate the young.  We need to have pride in labor's role in  society.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.  ",1991
276,House,102,0.338,1208,7,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to speak up for the taxpayers of  this country. Tomorrow has been des ignated by the National Tax Founda tion as National Tax Freedom Day. I  am wearing a button that says ""May  8."" That is the date on which prior to  that date every single dollar that indi viduals in this country earn in income  goes directly to pay Federal and State  and local taxes. It is only after May 8  that we start earning money to provide  for our own needs.  Mr. Speaker, this is the latest day in  the history of the United States. It was  3 days ago last year, May 5.  Mr. Speaker, in 1929 people worked 52  minutes out of an 8-hour day to pay  their taxes; in 1940, they worked 1 hour  and 29 minutes out of an 8-hour day to  pay their taxes; in 1950, 2 hours 2 min utes;  in 1960, 2 hours 22 minutes;  in  1970, 2 hours 34 minutes; in 1980, 2 hours  39 minutes; and in 1990, they worked 2  hours 44 minutes out of an 8-hour day  just to pay their taxes.  In 1990 and 1991 that does not count  all the expenditures that Government  made. That 2 hours and 44 minutes only  counts  the actual revenues collected,  because that is  the  taxes we pay. It  does not count the close to $400 billion  deficit that we are going to have this  year. That bill is going to be paid much  later by myself and my children and  your children.  So if one looks over the past couple  of decades, while we  have only  in creased since 1970 to 1980 a matter of 10  minutes out of the 8-hour day,  that  number  is  really dramatically much  more.  In fact,  if you  threw  in  that  extra amount, I am sure we would be  well over 3 hours, working just to pay  for government and government serv ices.  Mr. Speaker,  the average American  will work 121 days to satisfy his gov ernment's appetite. Mississippi had the  earliest date. It was April 24, which  was 114 days. New York and the Dis trict of Columbia have the latest date,  May 26. If one lives in those areas, that  is your Tax Freedom Day, 146 days out  of the year.  Today  is Pennsylvania's Tax Free dom Day, May 7, the State I hail from.  That will quickly go up as we face a  close to $2  to $3 billion deficit in the  State of Pennsylvania. Our  taxes are  scheduled to go up and will go up, and  I am sure we will be ranked right up  there with  the  top States for paying  taxes.  Out of that 2 hours and 44 minutes, 1  hour and 50 minutes is taken to pay  just Federal  taxes. State and  local  taxes run around 59 minutes on aver age.  Mr. Speaker, the reason I bring this  up is that it points out that we in gov ernment are not doing a very good job  at what we all campaigned for,  and  that is for responsible government, for  a balanced budget, for lower taxes, for  cutting spending. The reason that Tax payer Freedom Day is 3 days later than  it was last year was because we passed  a budget last year that increased taxes  dramatically on all of us, and, as a re sult, we have to work for 3 more days.  Speaker, what happened with  that tax increase? Did the budget defi cit go down? No. Did it stay the same?  No. It went up, for every dollar that we  took  in, we  spent even more,  thus  keeping in synchronization with what  we  have done  every  single  time  in  American history that we have raised  taxes. Every single time we in the Fed eral Government have raised taxes, we  have spent even more than what we re ceived in the tax increase.  Mr.  0 1440  The answer is obvious to the Amer ican public. We must cut and curb our  spending appetites. I rise on the floor  today to bring that to the attention of  the Members and of the public that the  budget deal last year did not solve the  problem.  It,  in fact,  illustrated  that  the problem is still here and will con tinue until we have people in the Con gress who are willing to stand up and  say no. We cannot afford to mortgage  our children's future, but that we are  going to stand up for  the future and  start doing something about deficit re duction.  I serve on the Budget Committee. I  came here as a first term Member in  January and asked  to serve on  that  committee because  I wanted  to  do  something about the Federal budget. I  was  the only  freshman Member ap pointed to the Budget Committee.  I can say sadly that I did not have a  whole lot of impact in that process. We  passed a budget out of that committee  that, in fact, as I said earlier, calls for  well over $300 million, close to $400 mil lion in deficit spending.  Now, I fought against that and I lost.  I will fight it again next year and the  year after, if I am here.  It is important to do that. It is im portant to stand up and fight for what  I think American public wants. What I  had proposed in the Budget Committee  is not  just  to  fight  and  stand up  against deficit spending but  to have  the Budget Committee take a serious  look at the entire budget, to start de bating the real issues, the spending pri orities of this country, to start analyz ing the programs. That was what the  Budget Committee was put in place to  do, was to look at the big picture, was  to assess what this country's needs are  and what its priorities are and then put  them in order, not fund them all and  run deficit spending, but to put them  in priority and put them in order as to  what is the important thing for  this  country, given  the revenues  that we  have coming in.  I am going to push that debate very  hard, that we, as a budget committee,  take up the responsibility of handling  the budget and not just rubber stamp ing what has been going on here for the  past decade and  just continuing on  with the large deficits and the spending  programs. We do not want to cut any thing. We are afraid to cut anything.  My goodness, someone might not vote  for us if we cut something.  We need to stand up and say, these  are the priorities that face this coun try and this is what we are going to  spend our money on and, as a result, we  cannot spend money on what may be a  worthy program but, frankly, does not  match up in comparison to what this  other program  is. We have  to start  doing that.  The only way you can make those de cisions, other than with a purely politi cal basis, is to get the information in  that committee, become professional ized and start dealing with the level of  debate that is necessary in that com mittee to make it happen. I made that  proposal then; I will continue to make  it,  that we, as a budget committee,  cannot continue  to abdicate our  re sponsibility  of  setting  the  national  goals and priori ties.  I see my friend, the gentleman from  Colorado  [Mr. ALLARD]  is here, and I  will be happy to yield to the gentleman  from Colorado [Mr. ALLARD].  ",1991

278,Senate,102,-0.237,1260,7,Mr. FOWLER.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to support the request to extend  additional agricultural credit guaran tees  to  the Soviet Union. They have  asked for another $1.5 billion on top of  the $1 billion approved in the original  Jackson-Vanik waiver.  As we all know,  they are desperate  for  the  food. The political situation  there is very uncertain. We are rightly  quite dubious of the actions and inten tions of  the Soviet Central Govern ment. But the simple and unquestioned  fact that the people need the food in  the worst way  seems  to  transcend  other political questions right now.  We do have an important and long term stake in the future of the Soviet  Union. We want more stability in their  reforms. We want to see those reforms  move ahead in a more orderly process.  Right now the very real food shortages  in  the Soviet Union are unlikely  to  bring anything constructive to change  in that country.  If the administration finds that this  credit extension is within its purview  of administering the Commodity Credit  Corporation programs in our national  interests, if we come to an agreement,  I would .urge the President to fashion a  package that fairly represents all U.S.  products.  I have a very serious concern that in  $1 billion in credits already extended  only $25 million of that has been for  poultry products.  That  is an oversight that must be  corrected. There  is great demand for  these products  in  the Soviet Union.  The Soviets have been buying an aver age of more than 12,000 metric tons of  frozen chicken products monthly since  1989. Soviet buyers have signed a frame  agreement to purchase a total of 200,000  metric  tons of United States poultry  products in 1991.  Those transactions cannot take place  if the credit is not made available for  them. The Soviets have asked for 200  million dollars worth of poultry prod ucts to meet immediate needs. Given  this background,  I  think the poultry  industry has made a very reasonable  request in asking that a minimum of  $50 million,  in any additional credits  extended, be allocated for  their prod ucts.  It only makes good business sense to  sell the Soviets what they want. The  administration has so far pref erred to  sell grain almost exclusively. There is  nothing wrong with selling them grain,  but we need a more balanced package,  that includes more poultry, pork, beef,  and other U.S. export products.  In fact, it is better for our own econ omy  if we do  so. Poultry has more  value added than grain. When we sell  poultry we are stimulating more jobs  in production, processing, and distribu tion. It is also worth pointing out that  those  chickens  are  fed  grain,  so  a  healthy poultry industry helps support  a healthy grain industry. Most impor tant for the Soviets, these value-added  products are easily converted for im mediate use by the consumer allowing  them to fulfill more rapidly the nutri tional needs of their countrymen.  So, Mr. President, if we are going to  expand agricultural sales to the Soviet  Union,  let's not sacrifice established  export markets. Let's develop a pack age that fairly represents all U.S. pro ducers.  I  ask unanimous  consent  to have  printed  in  the RECORD  the  text of a  telex  message  from  Alexander  Krivenko, president of the U.S.S.R. for eign  trade  firm VVO Prodinatorg  to  Simon  Chilewich,  president  of  Chilewich  International Corp., White  Plains, NY.  Chilewich  is  an  inter national trading company involved in  agricultural  trade with  the  Soviet  Union for over 60 years and has handled  all United States poultry sales to date  to the Soviet Union.  This telex makes the point that our  poultry trade with the Soviets will be  terminated at the end of this month  unless credit is available. It also illus trates the want and need of the Soviets  to  purchase United  States  poultry  products.  There being no objection, the text of  the telex is ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as fallows:  Dear Sirs: As you are well aware, our cur rent poultry program covered under the GSM  guarantee program will be completed by the  end of May. In order for us to continue the  purchase of  these  food  products,  further  credit will be required.  In addition  to  leg  quarters  being  an  excellent  nutritional  value, they are a product very well known by  Soviet consumers and positively  identified  with United States.  We urge you to do everything possible to  increase our line of credit under GSM so that  we can continue this program which we feel  is beneficial to both the U.S.A. poultry and  feedgrains industries as well as an important  step in meeting the urgent needs of the So viet consumer.

279,,102,0.382,1325,7,Mr. OXLEY.," Mr. Speaker, drug violence has  erupted in the streets of Colombia once again.  This  time claiming  the  life of Enrique Low  Murtra, who  served as Minister of Justice  under President Barco. Low served as Colom bia's Minister of Justice from 1987-1989 when  he had to resign due to the numerous death  threats he received.  Former Minister Low was a pioneer in the  war on drugs. He openly supported the extraEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dition of drug traffickers to the United States  even though it meant putting his life in danger.  The Colombian drug cartels will stop at noth ing to retaliate against any government official  who challenges their businesses. Seven years  ago,  the Minister of Justice at  that  time,  Rodrigo Lara Bonilla was assassinated and  his successor had to flee Colombia after serv ing in the same post. Government officials are  not the only victims. Hundreds of journalists,  judges and businessmen have been murdered  by drug traffickers.  I hope Law's courage  in  fighting  the drug  traffickers  in Colombia will not be  forgotten.  Colombian Government officials and citizens  must make it clear that drug trafficking is not  welcomed in their country. Colombia and the  United States can not afford to  lose another  warrier in this battle.  Currently, the Colombian assembly is rewrit ing their Constitution. I hope that they are not  intimidated by the drug cartels' latest show of  violence and are able to stand firm in their de cision not to ban  the extradition of accused  Colombian  drug  traffickers  to  the  United  States.

281,,102,0.326,1325,7,Mr. LIVINGSTON.," Mr. Speaker, when Presi dent Chiang Ching-kuo passed away on Janu ary 13, 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded Chiang  as head of state. On May 20, 1990, Lee was  duly elected and  inaugurated as  the eighth  President of the Republic of China.  In the last 3 years, Lee has continued with  vigor the democratization process initiated by  President Chiang. Taiwan is now a model of  political progress and multiparty democracy.  Among President Lee's many accomplish ments during the  last 3 years, none  inspires  more admiration than the bold step he took in  announcing an end to six decades of civil war  with  the Chinese C<;>mmunists on April 30,  1991. Even though this declaration of an end  to the state of war with mainland China does  not mean reunification with the mainland is im minent, it does represent Lee's efforts in build ing diplomatic bridges to the mainland by eas ing political tensions and reinforcing mainland  China's growing  links with Taiwan's powerful  economy.  A leader of vision, President Lee has always  dreamed of achieving on Taiwan the world's  first enduringly democratic society and he fer vently hopes that this might help lead to free dom for his compatriots on the mainland.  Mr. Speaker, on the eve of President Lee's  first anniversary  in office,  I wish  to go on  record in congratulating President Lee and in  hoping that one day Taiwan and the mainland  will be reunited under the principle of ""free ec onomics, democracy, and free elections.""

Joyous because that is the day the average  American worker could pay all his Federal,  State, and local taxes if all of his pay were de voted  to  that cause  from January 1, 1991.  This is sad news as well, because ""Tax Free dom Day"" is not only 3 days  later than  last  year, but  it has gotten steadily  later since  these records have been kept.

I share his excitement and  commitment to putting education first  on the Nation's agenda.  As Congress takes up the President's  proposal, or other education bills, we  must emphasize a partnership struc ture.  The Federal Government certainly  does have a very important role in that  partnership. That role has been and  should remain, however, limited. True  education  reform and  true education  excellence can occur only at the State  and local levels.  But the most important reform effort  must take place in the children's own  homes.  We,  as national policymakers and  opinion leaders, cannot and should not  lure the public into believing that the  Federal Government can, or will, pro vide all the answers, or all the money,  for our education concerns.  I whole-heartedly  agree with  the  President's statement that what hap pens in the Federal Government is not  half as important as what happens in  each school and in each home.  ",1991

This  legislation has been submitted by the  Department of Energy. It is an impor tant milestone in the Department's ef forts to open the WIPP facility for a 5year demonstration phase.  The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant is a  research and development  facility of  the Department of Energy that was au thorized by Public Law 96-164 for the  purpose of demonstrating the safe dis posal of transuranic radioactive waste  generated by DOE's nuclear weapons  production activities. The WIPP facil ity, built 2,000 feet below the surface in  the Delaware salt basin in New Mexico,  has been under construction since 1981.  Construction of  the  facility  is now  completed, and the facility will soon be  ready  to  begin  the  demonstration  phase. During  that phase, DOE will  conduct  a  series  of experiments  to  evaluate the facility's ability to com ply with the environmental laws gov erning the safe storage and disposal of  nuclear waste.  The WIPP site consists of 10,240 acres  in Eddy County, NM, all of which is  public land administered by the Bureau  of Land Management. Currently,  the  land is utilized under an administra tive land withdrawal issued by the De partment of the Interior in June 1983.  This administrative withdrawal is for a  period of 8 years. However, it does not  authorize use of the land for transpor tation, storage, or burial of any radio active waste at the site.  The Department of the Interior has  completed action on a modification of  the  existing  land order  that would  allow use of radioactive waste at the  site for testing purposes. However, the  administration has agreed to defer its  ",1991
285,House,102,-0.084,1481,7,Mr. VALENTINE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today both to express my sadness and  to pay tribute to a distinguished citi zen of  the Second District of North  Carolina, Floyd McKissick, Sr., who  died on April 28. His passing is a great  loss not only to my State but to the  entire Nation.  Many Americans  remember  Floyd  McKissick as the national director of  the Congress Of Racial Equality from  1966 to 1968. In that position, he was a  highly visible national figure at a par ticularly turbulent time in our history.  My  own  acquaintance with Floyd  McKissick goes back many years be fore that period. In the early 1950's, he  was my classmate at the University of  North Carolina School of Law. More  significantly, he was among  the first  group of black citizens to be admitted  and attend that institution. His dig nified conduct in a difficult situation  paved the way for subsequent genera tions of black law students at Chapel  Hill.  Floyd McKissick went on from Chap el Hill  to a notable career as a civil  rights attorney and activist. He was  also ordained as a Baptist minister at  Union Baptist Church in Durham, NC,  in 1979,  and served as pastor of  the  First Baptist Church of Soul City. In  addition, last year he was appointed by  Gov. Jim Martin to serve as judge in  the ninth  judicial district of North  Carolina.  Floyd McKissick devoted his life  to  improving the opportunities available  to black citizens. As an attorney  in  Durham and Oxford, NC, he handled a  record number of civil rights cases. He  was a staunch and effective advocate  for black people and, at the same time,  an active leader in the larger commu nity. It was  through his personal ef forts, for example, that Federal funds  were granted  to establish a  regional  water supply system that continues to  serve both the black and white commu nities in the cities of Oxford and Hen derson.  Not every project Floyd McKissick  undertook produced the precise results  he envisioned. The Soul City develop ment in Warren County, for instance,  did not become  the residential-indus trial community that was planned, but  its founder never gave up looking for  ways  to  improve  the  lives of black  North Carolinians and thereby improve  the lives of all North Carolinians.  Floyd McKissick was  often  con troversial. Not everyone agreed with  every  statement he uttered or  sup ported every cause he took up, but ev eryone who believes  in equality ad mired and  respected him. He earned  that respect through a lifetime of com mitment and dedication.  I am proud that Floyd McKissick was  counted among the citizens that I rep resent in Washington. He made a dif ference  for  citizens  of  Durham,  Warrenton,  Oxford,  Henderson,  and  throughout  the Second District. He  will be missed, but his impact on North  Carolina and our Nation will continue  to be felt for years to come.  STAGGERS AMENDMENT BEST  CHOICE  (Mr.  HOLLOWAY  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1991
286,House,102,0.475,1481,7,Mr. HOLLOWAY.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  want to speak for just a second on the  reason  for  supporting  the  Staggers  amendment  and  voting  against  the  Brady bill. Basically, my first thoughts  were to vote against both, because I do  believe it is very, very important that  we  preserve  the  second  amendment  rights. After looking at the responsibil ities  that are called on  through  the  Brady bill  to our  local governments  and our law enforcement agencies  to  take these applications, and the paper work fiasco that goes with it, and then  to look at the simple bill that Virginia  has  implemented already,  to  look at  Maryland's bill, which is a waiting pe riod, and see which works best, in my  opinion there is no doubt that that of  Virginia works best.  Mr. Speaker,  I  believe  there  is  a  great need in this country for us to de velop a computer system with the data  that we need to know who has prob lems from criminal  records and who  has problems from mental illness. We  have a right to be able to give our law  enforcement officiais what  they need  to be able to pull this up and say this  person should or should not be allowed.  Mr. Speaker, neither alternative will  solve our problem of guns in the wrong  hands, because criminals will simply  break  into homes or do whatever  it  takes to steal guns. I ask Members to  vote for the Staggers amendment.  H.R. 1: DO WE WANT THE CALIFOR NIA  EXPERIENCE  FOR ALL OF  AMERICA?

287,House,102,0.464,1481,7,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Speaker, at torneys will  be  the  primary  bene ficiaries under H.R. 1. To explain this  statement, I thought it would be inter esting  to  look at what happened  in  California where punitive and compen satory  damages  were  allowed  for  wrongful discharge cases.  A study of California wrongful dis charge cases by  the highly respected  Rand Corp. found that over 50 percent  of plaintiffs attorneys who were sur veyed charged a 40-percent contingency  f ee--the  fee  collected was generally  over $119,000 per case. Of course, de fense attorneys aren't going to be left  behind-they collected an average of  $80,000. Incredibly, the study estimated  that ""defense and plaintiff lawyer fees  represent more than half of the money  changing hands in this litigation."" In  other words, the lawyers got more than  the wronged employees. I have heard of  transactional costs, but this is absurd.  Is there any wonder that one California  court concluded that the availability of  punitive and compensatory damages in  these cases created an industry com posed of lawyers, personnel administra tors, and the courts.  Let us not make the California mis take apply to the whole Nation. Join  me in stopping H.R. 1, the attorney em ployment bill.

289,House,102,0.07,1494,7,Mr. FISH.," Mr. Chairman, 10 years  ago a bullet pierced the skull of Presi dential press secretary James Brady,  nearly claiming his  life. His  coura geous battle against practically insur mountable odds; for life, the ability to  communicate, the need to feel that he  could still contribute to society and his  desire to make a difference, has been a  true testament to the human spirit.  I would also like to acknowledge the  tremendous  personal  strength  dem onstrated by another courageous indi vidual-Sarah Brady. It is because of  their interest in, and commitment to,  this  issue  that we are here  today. A  true sign of courage is the ability to  stare tragedy straight in the eye and  turn it into victory.  Jim and Sarah  Brady have proved that so well  to us  all.  I rise today in support of H.R. 7, the  Brady bill. It is fitting that this bill  should bear the name, Brady for Jim  and Sarah have made it their personal  cause to provide a vehicle for local law  enforcement agencies  to prevent gun  sales  to convicted criminals, addicts,  and mentally incapacitated persons.  In addition, I would like to acknowl edge the contributions made by my Ju-  diciary Committee colleagues, particu larly ED FEIGHAN, whose dedication on  this issue, Congress after Congress, has  kept us focused on the issue of handgun  violence.  This  legislation provides  for  a na tionwide 7-day waiting period so that  background  checks  can be made of  handgun purchasers by  local  law en forcement officers. In my own State of  New York, we already have gun  laws  more  rigorous  than  the Brady bill.  Under New York law, before a  license  to possess a gun is issued, a mandatory  investigation,  including a photograph  and fingerprint check, is conducted by  the licensing officer. While there is no  explicit mandatory waiting period, the  background  investigation must  be  completed before a license is issued and  the sale completed. This process takes  a minimum of 20 days and often takes  longer.  The  alternative  to Brady  is  the  amendment offered by my colleague,  HARLEY STAGGERS. Under the rule, this  is the only amendment in order and if  it passes,  there will be no vote on  Brady.  This measure  is being  touted as a  way  to conduct a background  inves tigation ""in an  instant."" Mr. Chair man, we would not need the Brady bill  if such a verification system already  exists.  Such  a  system,  however,  is  many years away from fruition.  A  centralized  system  of  record  checks isn't feasible now because more  than 90 percent of arrests and convic tions  in  this country are handled by  State and  local  law enforcement au thorities. The Attorney General's task  force estimates that, nationwide, 40 to  60 percent of the records of felony con victions  are not presently  in  auto mated form and thus not immediately  available. Approximately 40 States do  not have  a  computerized system al ready in place to conduct these instant  records checks.  A draft congressional study by  the  Office of Technology Assessment states  that records across the country are in  such poor shape that it would take ""5  to 10 years"" to develop a workable sys tem of instant checks. The Brady bill  would allow States  to use  their own  verification system. Once the Attorney  General determines  that an effective  verification system is in place in all 50  States, Brady will effectively sunset.  I do not believe that a delay in the  sale of a handgun is an abrogation of  any right to own a handgun. Nothing in  Brady would prevent decent, law-abid ing gun owners from buyng a hand gun,  to either add to their collection or use  for hunting, sporting, or personal pro tection.  If anything,  this  legislation  would allow a brief, but useful, cooling off period for those who might run out  to purchas_e a handgun after an argu ment and, in the heat of passion, com mit an act they would later come to re gret.  What we all seek is a prohibition of  sales to purchasers who pose a  threat  to society. On  this point, there is no  dispute. We should be demanding that  criminal and mental records be com puterized at  the Federal, State, and  local level and a quick, reliable and ac curate verification system put in place.  Lives can be saved if we enact the  Brady bill now, and while it may be in convenient  for  some  individuals  to  have  to wait a week before  they are  able  to purchase a handgun, I believe  that this short period of time is toler",1991
290,House,102,-0.491,1507,7,Mr. SERRANO.," Mr. Chairman, 96 percent of  the handguns used in crimes in New York City  are purchased outside New York State. The  implications of this statistic are powerful: While  New York's tough gun control laws have prov en extremely effective, my home and my con stituents are endangered by  the  failure of  other jurisdictions to enact similar laws.  New York's experience  is by no means  unique. A Federal Government  study  has  found  the same pattern recurring across  the  country. Local crime control measures are un dermined by the lack of a nationwide gun con trol standard, with deadly consequences.  Mr. Chairman, a solution to this problem is  at hand. The Brady bill, H.R. 7, would impose  a waiting period of up to 7 days on the pur chase of a handgun. This waiting period would  afford local law enforcement agencies the OJ:r  portunity to conduct background checks to de termine  if the purchaser is eligible to own a  gun. Similar legislation at the State level has  prevented thousands of illegal handgun sales  each year.  The Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits fel ons,  fugitives, drug addicts, and the mentally  ill from purchasing or owning firearms, but no  national legislation exists to enforce it. I urge  my colleagues  to support  the Brady bill, a  crime control measure  that  is much needed  and long overdue.  I would also like to express my strong oppo sition to the Staggers bill, which  is being of fered as a substitute  to  the Brady bill. The  Staggers bill calls for the establishment within  6 months of a nationwide instant check hotline  that gun dealers could call to verify that a pro spective gun purchaser  is not a convicted  felon.  There is nothing wrong with this plan in prin ciple. Such an instant check system is already  being developed under the Anti-Drug Abuse  Act of 1988, and  the Brady bill will sunset  once this system becomes operational. Unfor tunately, the instant check system envisioned  by the Staggers bill may not become operable  for another decade.  The 6-month  timeframe envisioned by  the  Staggers bill is unrealistic at best. Many other  features of the Staggers bill indicate that it is  not and was never intended to be a serious,  viable alternative to the Brady bill.  Mr. Chairman, my colleagues, the Brady bill  is but a first step in your Nation's journey to ward a society free of handgun violence, and  no one suggests that it will solve the problem  by  itself. But no one can deny that it would  soon have a very significant, beneficial impact.  The same cannot be said of the Staggers bill.  There are  too many  lives at stake across  the country to allow the Staggers bill to dis tract and delay us in our efforts to enact effec tive gun control  legislation. Let us pass  the  Brady bill now and begin to restore sanity and  security to our troubled streets and homes.  Mr. PANETIA Mr. Chairman,  today  I am  compelled to rise to state my support for H.R.  7,  the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention  Act. I commend my colleague, Representative  FEIGHAN and  the members of  the Judiciary  Committee for their hard work in bringing this  bill to the  floor.  I also thank you, Mr. Chair man, for allowing H.R. 7 to be scheduled this  Congress.  Nearly every time Congress considers gun  control, a strange phenomenon occurs. We  seem  to have common sense on one hand,  and political mischief on the other. Every one  of us knows  that the United States has  the  highest homicide rate  involving a handgun in  the industrailized world, and each of us would  like  to do something about these  frightening  statistics. We are presented  today with  that  chance.  Common sense tells us that waiting periods  are logical. We live in a very high stress Na tion where millions of people are known  to  lack healthy coping skills and thousands turn  to guns for solutions to their problems, to use  against themselves or others. Many of these  individuals have criminal  records, but many  also do not. The State of California realized  the need to address both concerns and imple mented a 15-day waiting period with a back ground check for the purchase of a handgun.  Some would argue that California's waiting pe riod does not work because it has not experi enced a lower crime rate since the enactment  of the legislation. To a degree, that is true  if  you do not take note that two out of its three  border States do not have waiting periods or  background checks-a problem the Brady bill  would take care of. Even taking this into ac count, however,  it stopped 2, 182 prohibited  handgun sales during 1990. One can only pre dict the possible number of murders or injuries  this number represents that were stopped be cause of a waiting period.  California now has a new State  law which  extends the waiting period for not only hand gun purchases, but all firearm purchases. This  new  law has stopped 1,275 criminals  from  purchasing any  type of  firearm  in  the first 3  months of  this year. Heading  the  top of the  denial list were prospective buyers with crimi nal records for assault. California is expecting  5,000 denials this year. Was  it easy to pass  this bill in California, which now has around 30  million people residing in  it and a strong gun  owner  constituer.cy? No,  in  fact  it barely  passed. Even for those who voted against the  bill, you can bet that they are personally elat",1991
291,House,102,0.343,1520,7,Mr. JAMES.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  today  in opposition  to  the Staggers  substitute, but also with  respect for  the alternative (H.R. 1412) presented by  the gentleman from West Virginia [Mr.  STAGGERS].  In assessing the differences between  the Brady bill and the Staggers sub stitute, I think it is important to note  what both have in common.  Both bills are efforts to keep felons,  and  inmates of mental  institutions,  from legally acquiring handguns. To fa cilitate accomplishment of those objec tives both employ waiting periods--1  day for Staggers and 7 days for Brady.  And both share  the premise that a  computerized system of instantaneous  background checks is, in the long run,  the best means of achieving the desired  goal.  Neither is perfect, as I think the pro ponents of each will concede, but both  are well-intentioned.  The real question is-which will work  better over the short term.  Proponents of H.R. 1412 argue that a  nationwide hotline, capable of complet ing instant checks, can be up and run ning effectively in 6 months.  Advocates of the Brady bill disagree.  Given the state of criminal records in  many States, we believe that a 7-day  waiting period will give local police the  opportunity to do suitable background  checks.  Lets' be clear here. I strongly favor  the development of an effective instant  check system.  Two  years  ago,  I  supported  the  amendment of my good  friend  from  Florida, Mr. MCCOLLUM, which required  the Federal Government to begin work  on an instant check system.  And I am pleased that, regardless of  what happens here today, development  of an instant check system will go for ward.  At the same time, I do not think that  the so-called instant-check hotline will  be operating effectively in 6 months.  From what I have heard and read, 2  to 8 years is a better estimate of what  it will  take to fully computerize the  criminal records of this Nation.  Another concern  I have about  the  Staggers substitute  is  that it is not  clear how much it will cost to put im plementation of an instant check sys tem on a crash course.  Given such considerations, I believe  we should follow the old adage ""better  safe than sorry.""  While, we work  to put an  instant  check system on-line, we will be giving  law enforcement a better chance  to  check out potential handgun buyers.  If the Staggers substitute becomes  law,  there  is far  less assurance  that  background checks will be conducted  simply because we will not have  the  system in place to do them.  And that would be unfortunate given  the  fact  that 23,000 people died  last  year as a result of violence involving  handguns-handguns  that  are  some times purchased over-the-counter,  in  an entirely legal manner, by felons and  other ineligibles who should not have  easy access to such weapons.  Finally, as a.representative from the  State of Florida,  I  feel mandated to  support the Brady bill.  Last year, the people of Florida over whelmingly supported a 3-day waiting  period for handgun purchases. The final  vote was 85 percent in favor of a wait ing period.  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the  Brady bill and rejection of the Staggers  substitute.  ",1991
292,House,102,0.441,1520,7,Mrs. VUCANOVICH.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for yielding time  tome.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  Staggers substitute, not for the obvi ous  reasons, but as a woman. Let's  take a  look at what  the Brady bill  means to women, more often than not  the victims of violent crimes.  Just recall the horror in Gainesville,  FL,  this past summer where a serial  killer murdered four young women and  one young man. Law-abiding citizens  needed protection  immediately. How ever, Gainesville has a 2-day waiting  period. Acting on the Sheriff's advice,  women went outside Gainesville where  there wasn't a waiting period to buy  firearms for self-protection.  If the Brady bill were law, who knows  how many more young women would be  dead in Gainesville because they had to  wait to protect themselves. Under the  Staggers bill, these women could have  protected themselves when they needed  protection,  immediately-not 2 days  later, or under the Brady bill, a  full  week later.  But there need not be a serial killer  on the loose-women face these kinds  of emergency self-protection situations  frequently. Look at the case of Bonnie  Elmasri, of Wisconsin, whose husband  repeatedly threatened to kill her. She  secured a  restraining order. But be cause of the severity of her husband's  threats, Bonnie didn't feel  this was  enough. She tried to purchase a  fire arm for self-defense, but was told there  was a 2-day waiting period. The next  day, Bonnie and her two sons, aged 17  and 3, were murdered by her husband.  In  just  this one  instance, a  2-day  waiting period cost three innocent citi zens their lives, two of them children.  Who knows how many more lives a full  7-day waiting period would cost. Yet,  under  the  Staggers  bill,  Bonnie  Elmasri and countless others like her  would still be alive today. They would  not be  required  to wait  to protect  themselves.  If we are serious about crime, let us  pass a bill to control criminals, let us  pass  the Staggers substitute.  I urge  members not  let  their  judgments be  clouded by  the antigun  lobby's emo tional banter.  ",1991
293,House,102,0.019,1520,7,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr. Chairman, ev eryone  is against  crime,  this  small  three letter word is the key to enacting  any crime bill.  Last year's debate of the crime con trol bill demonstrated that most House  Members support the following provi sions: Expanding  the use of capital  punishment,  reforming  and  limiting  death row appeals, allowing police to  use evidence in court discovered during  ""good faith"" searches, and many other  crime  fighting  proposals. Many  of  those that support these tough provi sions don't support giving their local  law enforcement a simple tool which is  provided  in  the Brady bill,  a  7-day  waiting period. Many would-be  sup porters of the Brady bill, admit they do  not  really have a problem with  the  waiting period, believe it would not do  any good.  How many of these same members  who want perfection in the Brady bill,  support  the  flawed  Staggers'  sub stitute, which  requires  a  telephone  background  check within  24  hours?  Most people agree  that  this  system  cannot be operational within  the 6months specified in the bill and so, the  Staggers  substitute  is not  really  a  workable option. In fact, it will take  closer to 6 years to implement at tre mendous cost. Now  if  the Staggers'  substitute passes, we will have  suc ceeded  in authorizing a  felon  identi fication system that will not be able to  identify felons because the records just  aren't there. Brady bill opponents will  have succeeded in killing the waiting  period and, with it, a small chance for  law enforcement  to  impede criminal  possession of handguns.  Let's not kid ourselves here  today!  Capital punishment by  itself  is not  going to cure the crime problem, it will  help. The Brady bill by itself will not  stop criminal activity with handguns,  it will provide our law enforcement of ficials with a commonsense  tool that  could be helpful. In fact,  individually  any of these measures would cut crimi nal activity only marginally. but taken  collectively, as part of a complete anti crime package,  these measures could  significantly reduce  the rising crime  rate in America.  In 1988, I became a supporter of the  Brady bill  for one simple  reason: It  made good commonsense. In Texas and  24  other States, anybody-yes,  any body-can walk into a gun shop, select  a gun, show a picture ID, fill out an  ATF 4473 Form, pay for it, and walk  out with a gun-no questions asked by  anyone. Just imagine  it.  In one-half        ..  -.  .;      -   II  I  o  ",1991
294,House,102,-0.103,1533,7,Mr. CONDIT.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in  support of the Staggers amendment.  Gun control  legislation must be aimed at  preventing criminals, not law abiding citizens,  from  acquiring guns. The Staggers amend ment would help to curb the use of guns by  criminals by mandating a criminal background  check at  the  time  of purchase. Under  the  Staggers amendment,  someone who has a  criminal record and attempts to buy a handgun  from a licensed dealer would be caught imme diately. The Staggers bill mandates a check;  the Brady bill does not.  Under the Brady bill,  local  law enforcement  officials would be burdened, if they so chose,  in  attempting  to do week-long  checks,  pri marily of  law-abiding citizens. The Brady bill  would  cause  a major misallocation  of  re sources in our fight against crime.  The instant check process already works in  Virginia, Florida, and Delaware. It is time to do  this nationally. The Staggers bill gets at the  root problem of updating and overhauling the  records of convicted felons so that accurate  checks do take place. The Brady bill provides  no such mechanism. If we do not have up-to date records, a 7-day waiting period will do  nothing to prevent guns from getting into the  hands of criminals.  It  is time we stopped lying to the American  public. Efforts  like  the Brady bill, which are  aimed at  law-abiding citizens,  fail  to  reduce  crime or deny criminals the ability  to acquire  guns.  The Brady bill is not even a quick fix. There  is no easy solution to  the problem of crime.  However, an updated national data base of  convicted felons  is a fundamental part of any  eventual solution. The Staggers bill expedites  this process; the Brady bill ignores it.  ",1991

In deed, the majority of new jobs created during  the  last decade were created by small busi nesses,  and  this  is doubly  true  in  hard pressed rural areas.  They support  freedom by earning a profit  from their labors, and paying taxes on those  earnings. It is the profits earned through their  ingenuity that provides the wealth we need to  defend and provide for our people.  America's small business owners support  our  freedom even more directly by winning  contracts and using  their  ideas  to provide  safer, more efficient, better made, and less ex pensive goods and services the United States  needs for defense.  They support our  freedom by  inspiring us  with their self reliance: whatever can be done,  they will do; whatever is broken, they will fix;  whatever needs to be supplied, they will  find  the source and if there is no source, they will  make it themselves. If one small businessman  quits, a dozen more will  line up to take his  place.  It  is  this perseverance  in  the  face of  tough competition that gives the United States  its  strength  to make  it  through  the  rough  times.  And let me point out another facet of small  business assistance. From  the day  Iraq  in vaded Kuwait until the last shot was fired end ing Desert Storm, America's small businesses  were mobilized to help, not only in actual de fense production, but also in research, as vol unteers, and through their unyielding support.  And when the war was over, they lined up  to help put out the fires and rebuild Kuwait.  Still the commitment of small business own ers did not stop at leading the charge on the  home front or providing the taxes and equip ment that form the arsenal for democracy. We  estimate that 23,000 small business owners in  the Reserves were called to active duty to de fend their country. And they went and their un counted key employees went. And  they  left  their families and friends and quietly did their  duty. And when  it was all over,  they came  home. Their leaving was a real hardship for  small businesses. Even the temporary loss of  an owner or key man for 6 months could be  devastating  to a small business. Yet  it  is a  story that we have not heard much about, Mr.  Speaker, because  these are not  the malin gerers or the bellyachers, these are the ones  we have always counted on  to get  the  job  done: The men and women who own and op erate America's  small  businesses. We  all  should be proud of them.  ",1991
297,House,102,0.273,1559,7,Mr. FRANKS of Connecticut.," Mr. Speaker,  as we note and praise the accomplishments of  the small business owners in this country, we  should be making a firm commitment to those  who are the mainstay of our economy.  Rarely has the future of our economy been  at such a turning point.  I believe  the Congress and administration  should be working  together  in  the coming  months and years to set a clear path for the  small business owners to follow, one  that is  clear of regulatory obstacles and one that en courages an array of positive initiatives for our  entire economy to grow from the bottom up.  Small businesses, or  those entrepreneurs  who are eager to enter the world of risk and  reward, have to know their Government wants  to help them realize their dreams and sustain  our economy.  Small businesses don't want handouts, they  want a hand up, and we should recommit our selves to providing opportunities at every turn.  Training programs should be oriented  to ward procurement and functional disciplines marketing, finance and management-to help  small businesses deal with Federal  regula tions.  We must do a better job of making working  capital, both public and private, available  to  those businesses which qualify and are ready  to make it work.  The private sector needs more incentives to  become full partners with the next generation  of workers to provide initiatives for high school  and vocational students.  An overwhelming majority of small busi nesses do not take advantage of Small Busi ness Administration  loans. We have to do a  better job of getting the word out that the SBA  is a vital  resource  for product development,  technical assistance, and other resources.  For those small businesses looking abroad  for new markets,  fair  trade agreements are  needed.  I hope  the Members of  this body  grant President Bush the extension needed to  negotiate trade agreements with the fellowship  of nations.  If we break precedent and allow the Presi dent's hands to be tied at the bargaining table  we will not further the interests of this country  or its small businesses.  ",1991
298,,102,-0.28,1585,7,Mr. HALL of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, as chair man of the House Select Committee on Hun ger, I am today introducing the Freedom From  Want Act, landmark omnibus antihunger legis lation.  I am pleased to be joined  in  this en deavor by my colleague BILL EMERSON, rank ing Republican on the Select Committee.  The Freedom From Want Act  is omnibus  legislation which combats hunger not only  in  its immediate symptoms by expanding domes tic and international food assistance programs,  but at its root causes through innovative do mestic  antipoverty  programs,  international  human rights policy and U.N. reform. The bill  takes its name from President Roosevelt's his toric four freedom speech, delivered to a joint  session of Congress half a century ago.  Thus far, provisions of the bill are supported  by organizations as diverse as Bread for the  World,  the U.S. Committee  for UNICEF,  the  National Council for International Health, RE SULTS, the Food Research and Action Cen ter, lnterAction, World Vision, CARE, the Inter national Eye Foundation, the Salvation Army,  the U.S. Committee  for Refugees, Save  the  Children, the Friends Committee on National  Legislation,  the National Association of State  Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, Helen  Keller  International,  the Community Nutrition  Institute, the Committee on Sustainable Agri culture, and National Association of WIC Di rectors, and the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities. Grassroots support  for  the bill  is  growing.  I am confident  that  the Freedom  From Want Act will become the rallying point  for a national constituency for solving hunger.  For the benefit of my colleagues, a sum mary of the Freedom From Want Act follows:  SUMMARY OF THE FREEDOM FROM WANT ACT  TITLE I-DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS  Part A-Nutrition, Education and Health Care  The bill establishes a five-year program for  achieving full participation  in  the Special  Supplemental Food Program for Women, In fants and Children (WlC) by FY '96, specify ing increases of: $256 million above the cur rent services  level  in FY  '92; $306 million  above the current services level in FY '93;  $304 million above the current services level  in FY  '94; $399 million above  the current  services  level  in FY  '95; and $397 million  above the current services level in FY '96.  The bill proposes funding the Head Start  Program at levels adequate  to assure  the  participation of 60 percent of  the eligible  children in FY '92; 80 percent in FY '93; and  100 percent in FY '94.  The bill increases the existing 56.76 cents  per meal  reimbursement provided by  the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  for  con gregate and home-delivered meals under the  Older American's Act to 65.66 cents in FY '92.  In FY '93 and FY '94, the reimbursement  would be adjusted for inflation in accordance  with  the  increase  in  the Consumer Price  Index.  In recognition of the fact that immuniza tion against preventable childhood diseases  significantly increases the rate of child sur vival,  the bill  requires  the Secretary of  Health and Human Services to work in conEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  sultation with the World Health Organiza tion and the United Nations Children's Fund  to establish a Children's Vaccine Initiative.  The bill proposes $30 million in FY '92 and  $40 million in FY '93 for the purpose of re searching, developing, testing, producing and  delivering vaccines to prevent infectious dis eases among children.  The bill require!\! that food labeling stand ards imposed on meat and food products for  sale to the general public apply to meat and  meat food products distributed by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture through domestic  commodity food assistance programs.  Part B-Individual Development Account  Demonstration  To help low-income persons achieve eco nomic self-sufficiency through home-owner ship, higher education, self-employment, or  savings for retirement,  the bill authorizes  the Department of the Treasury to establish  Individual Development Accounts (IDAs). An  IDA, which is similar to an IRA, is a tax-ben efitted savings account in the name of one  person that can be used without penalty for  only the aforementioned purposes. To stimu late savings among the poor, deposits into an  IDA would be matched with Federal, State,  and private contributions, and amounts in  an IDA would not reduce or terminate one's  public benefits (e.g., Food Stamps, AFDC,  and Medicaid). These accounts would be ad ministered on a demonstration basis by pri vate organizations which would work closely  with the holder of the IDA.  Part C-Microenterprise Programs  To promote  economic  development  and  economic self-sufficiency for low-income per sons  through microenterprise  (commercial  enterprises employing five or fewer employ ees, one of whom is the owner), the bill sets  up community-based, public-private partner ships which will provide  small  loans and  business assistance to persons who wish to  develop a microenterprise. Specifically, the  bill: (1) encourages a one percent set-aside of  funds from Community Development Block  Grants, the Rural Development Administra tion, and the Small Business Administration  to be used for microenterprise development;  (2) ensures that microenterprise training is  included  in Federal  job  training programs  like AFDC-JOBS and JTP A; (3) modifies the  AFDC  rules  that  impede  or  prohibit  microenterprise development; and  sets  up,  through the Department of Labor, one  million dollar competitive grants  for  ten  States to develop microenterprise programs  for low-income persons.  ( 4)  Part D-Increasing the Food Purchasing Power  of Low-Income Households  The bill authorizes a total of S2 million in  each of FY '92, FY '93 and FY '94 for grants  to  non-profit  community-based  organiza tions for the purpose of developing and im plementing  strategies  for  increasing  the  availability of affordable, nutritious foods in  areas  underserved  by  supermarkets. Ap proved activities under the grants would also  include strengthening the operation of exist ing food retail stores in underserved commu nities by providing them with services that  lower their food costs and increase the nutri tional value of their food inventories.  The bill authorizes $450,000 for each of FY  '92, FY '93, and FY '94 for grants to commu nity-based organizations to identify and im plement strategies for promoting the use of  low-cost food outlets. Grantees would initi ate programs of education and outreach for  expanding  Food  Stamp Program  partici pants' use of farmers markets and other di rect marketing outlets and for encouraging  10353  agricultural producers and direct marketers  to become certified to redeem food stamp  vouchers.  The bill increases from ten to twenty the  number of States authorized to provide WIC  participants with coupons to purchase fresh  fruits and vegetables from farmers markets.  Grants to States, awarded on a competitive  basis, would total $5 million in FY '92, S6.5  million in FY '93, S8 million in FY '94, and  $9.5 million in FY '95. This program is de signed to encourage WIC participants to pur chase and cc.nsume fresh fruits and vegeta bles and to establish new markets for small  farmers.  Part E-Assessing Food Security Within  Communities  There is currently no standardized system  for assessing food security problems at the  community level (food security is defined as  ""access by all people at all times to a con sistent nutritious food supply from conven tional sources). The accuracy of past  re search  efforts  have  been  challenged  on  grounds of their scientific validity. The bill  proposes the establishment of food security  centers at seven land-grant colleges and uni versities (selected on a competitive basis by  the Cooperative Extension Service) which  would assist community-based organizations  and local government agencies in developing  scientifically  sound  surveys  for  assessing  community food insecurity and in analyzing  the data collected through these surveys.  Part F-Communities Making the Transition to  Hunger-Free Status  The bill establishes criteria communities  can use to initiate programs and activities  for assuring that low-income residents have  access to food.  Part G-lnfant Mortality Reduction  The bill  proposes  the  establishment of  demonstration projects designed  to reduce  the high incidence of low birthweight and in fant mortality in high-risk rural and urban  populations. The demonstration projects will  provide comprehensive maternal child health  services to high-risk pregnant women and in fants, with an emphasis on addressing the  variety of socioeconomic and demographic  factors which affect birth outcomes for these  populations. Criteria for the projects' design  seek to encourage early identification and  follow-up of high-risk pregnant women and  infants via intensive outreach services, and  seeks to promote grass-roots project partici pation by establishing local Infant Mortality  Advisory Panels  in each project  location.  The bill proposes  that S6 million be used  each fiscal year beginning in FY '92 through  FY '94.  The bill proposes  that a  study be con ducted by the Secretary of the Department  of Health and Human Services to assess the  impact of breastfeeding on infant morbidity  and mortality among high-risk populations,  with an emphasis on minorities. The bill pro poses that $500,000 be used per fiscal year be ginning in 1992 until such time as the study  is completed.  Part H-Amendments to the Food Stamp Act  The bill removes eligibility restrictions in  the Food Stamp Program which are based on  outdated assumptions about the amount of  resources low-income households have avail able to expend on food and increases basic  benefit rates by:  (a) providing incremental  increases in the Thrifty Food Plan from 103  percent in FY '91 to 104% percent in FY '96;  (b) excluding from  income the first S50  in  child support payments received monthly by  a food stamp household; (c) excluding from  ",1991
299,,102,0.208,1598,7,Mr. WALSH.," Mr. Speaker, On September  20, 1989, Peace Corps Volunteer Margaret E.  Schutzius, 23, of Dallas, TX, was aboard a  French airliner that was blown up over Niger  shortly after takeoff from Chad. Ms. Schutzius  was  returning  to  the United States after 2  years service overseas as a secondary edu cation English teacher.  Along with my  colleagues Congressmen  HENRY and MOODY, I plan to reintroduce legis lation  that would  instruct the Director of the  Peace Corps to provide an American flag to  the families of any Peace Corp volunteer, who  dies during the period of his or her service.  The bill would also provide a flag to the fami lies of those volunteers who died in service  since the Corps was formed in 1962.  Peace Corps volunteers make  things hap pen. They  leave behind  far more  than  the  wells they dug, the gardens they nurtured, or  the clinics they built. They leave the local peo ple with a better sense of how to make the  most of their resources-how to make things  happen on their own. These volunteers who  die in service to others have in a sense given  their life for the greatest American ideals.  I hope you agree that the survivors of these  wonderful volunteers deserve this small token  of our country's appreciation for their dedica tion and service to others.  I ask that you join me in cosponsoring this  important measure.  INTERNATIONAL JAZZ DAY  HON. DFAN A. GAUO  OF NEW JERSEY  .IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 8, 1991  ",1991
300,,102,0.203,1598,7,Mr. GALLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call  to the attention of my colleagues the planned  celebration  for  International Jazz Day  to be  held on June 23, 1991.  In  1990,  the New Jersey Jazz Society  [NJJSJ  conceived  of,  promoted, and cele brated the Centennial of Jazz. Ultimately, jazz  clubs in 40 U.S. States and 7 nations wort~  wide celebrated the centennial. Jazz festivals  were held in Australia, New Zealand, Japan,  South America, Canada, and Europe. In New  Jersey, the general assembly passed a resolu tion honoring the centennial and the Governor  issued a proclamation.  This year, in a continuing effort to raise the  awareness of jazz the NJJS-along with the  American Federation of Jazz Societies [AFJSJ  and the United Nations Jazz Club-have es tablished an annual  International Jazz Day,  which will be celebrated each year henceforth  on the fourth Sunday in June. This year it will  be celebrated on June 23. Jazz Day  is de signed to honor both the music, which  is a  vital part of our cultural history, and the musi cians who created it and sustain it.  To date,  jazz clubs throughout the United  States-as well as clubs  in England, Ger",1991
301,House,102,0.548,4,13,Mr. KYL.," Mr. Speaker, last fall's tax  bill-the second largest tax increase in  the Nation's history-was hailed by  many in this Chamber as a  rich"" piece of legislation.  Playing upon a strategy of division  and envy, they proposed a  luxury tax.  Why should the rich not pay an extra  10 percent on their boats, fancy cars,  airplanes, furs, and jewelry? Certainly,  the weal thy can afford it, they said.  Well, Mr. Speaker, the rich will not  pay if they do not buy, and they are  not buying. Only  those  people  em ployed by the boat, plane, and auto mobile manufacturing and sales com panies, and only those employed by the  fur and jewelry companies are paying paying dearly with their jobs.  More than 3,000 people in the auto in dustry, and 19,000 in the boat manufac turing industry alone are expected to  lose their jobs as a result of the steep  drop in sales prompted by the increase  in the 1 uxury tax.  The same big taxers who aimed at  the rich and hit the middle class last  year are  the same ones who are so  quick to decry the tax policies of the  Reagan administration. Yes,  the rich  got richer during the 1980's, but so did  every other income group.  From 1982 to 1989, median family in come  jumped 14 percent. During  the  previous 14 years, median family  in come had dropped 2 percent. During the  1980's, families  in the lowest fifth in  terms of income saw their incomes rise  5.6 percent in real  terms. During the  1970's, an era of rapidly rising taxes,  that same group saw their income fall  by 15 percent.  The choice  is  really between eco nomic growth and opportunity for all,  or  the politics of division and envy.  ""Tax the rich""-it's a great sound bite.  But, sound bites are not food  in the  mouths of all of the real people the big  taxers have put out of work.

304,House,102,0.103,17,13,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Madam Chairman,  we have spent a  lot of time on  this  floor over the past few months arguing  about the direction of U.S. science pol icy, about what kinds of projects ought  to be consuming our scarce science dol lars. I'm pleased to say that today we  have before us a bill that should engen der no such debate, a bill that we can  all agree is a good and proper compo nent of our science budget.  The National  Science  Foundation  [NSF]  is a  bulwark of  the Nation's  basic  research  establishment  and  a  model for other agencies. The Founda tion funds thousands of individual uni versity researchers each year in a wide  variety of fields as well as small groups  and centers.  It has special programs to help build  our scientific base by helping poorer  States, minorities and young research ers. It has special initiatives to target  some research on areas of interest to  industry or necessary to promote life  safety. And perhaps most important of  all, it is a major source of innovative  ideas  and  programs  for  precollege  science and mathematics education.  This bill would continue this body's  strong backing of the President's plan  to double the agency's budget.  The bill would also signal our ap proval of the Office of Management and  Budget's intention to cap certain over head payments  to universities. This  should result in more research dollars  ending up in the hands of researchers a reasonable goal. Passage of this pro vision is an essential step for Congress  to  take  right now, al though  I hope  that, in the end, the issue will be set tled administratively, without any new  legislation.  NSF and the researchers and teach ers it aids deserve our continued sup[Mr.  port. I urge my colleagues to vote for  this bill.  This bill is very carefully crafted by  some dedicated colleagues on the com mittee, and  I wish  to commend  the  chairman of  the  subcommittee, my  good friend,  the gentleman from Vir ginia [Mr. BOUCHER], as well as my dis tinguished  colleague,  the  gentleman  from California  PACKARD], who  have worked  in  tandem  to develop  something which we can all be proud  of.

While I was pleased to see that  the committee  recognizes  the  importance of  UGO as a scientific project, I am dismayed by  their decision to only authorize funding for re search activities or design studies.  The  laser  interferometer gravitational-wave  observatory will use the detection of grayita tional waves  to provide new and compelling  information about the nature of the universe.  UGO represents an invaluable opportunity for  Congress  to demonstrate  its  support  for  a  project that will ensure American preeminence  in physics well into the next century.  UGO has been subjected to, and approved  by, peer review. The National Science Board  has approved a perfected UGO prototype and  the Brinkman Commission has endorsed the  project. When the UGO  instruments become  operational, the data collected will be available  to scientists to expand the study of physics  throughout the United States.  The National Science Foundation  is  in  the  process of selecting the 2 sites from 18 pro posals  located  throughout  the country. The  project is ready to move on to the construction  phase. Funding must be provided  for  fiscal  year 1992 in order to ensure U.S. leadership  in this developing new discipline. This program  represents Federal scientific investment at its  most visionary. By authorizing the construction  of UGO, Congress can bring Federal support  to the cutting edge of science.  I hope that the committee will reconsider its  decision not to authorize the use of National  Science Foundation funds for the construction  of UGO. I urge my colleagues to support this  truly visionary scientific effort.  ",1991

312,Senate,102,-0.262,186,13,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I strongly  support  reauthorization of  the Older  Americans Act which offers many valu able  services  to our Nation's senior  citizens. Since it was first enacted in  1965, the Older Americans Act has pro vided a wide array of programs to sen iors  in  their communities, programs  such as congregate and home-delivered  meals,  home health  care,  transpor tation, legal services, and employment.  The intent of these programs is to keep  people as independent as possible, thus  enhancing their quality of life.  This year, Congress will once again  reauthorize  the Older Americans Act.  As part of this process, I am introduc ing  three bills  to  amend  the Older  Americans Act which emphasize issues  of particular concern  ti ve health services, guardianships, and  assistance for family caregivers. These  bills, which  are  summarized  below,  have been introduced in the House of  Representatives  by  Congresswoman  OLYMPIA SN OWE.  to m~preven­ PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES FOR OLDER  AMERICANS AMENDMENTS OF 1991  Health problems of older persons can  be  prevented  or postponed  through  healthy lifestyles. Increasingly we are  learning of the benefits of health pro motion and wellness efforts even  if  they are begun in our older years.  This bill would strengthen preventive  health services under the Older Ameri cans Act by emphasizing services  to  prevent older individuals from falling  in  their homes, which often leads to  fractures for people with osteoporosis;  nutrition counseling  for osteoporosis  and cardiovascular disease; and medi cation management screening and edu cation to prevent incorrect medication  and adverse drug reactions.

313,Senate,102,0.271,199,13,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, in the  past 3 years,  the world has witnessed  extraordinary upheaval as the people of  nation after nation rose up to throw off  the deadening shackles of communism,  embracing democracy in its stead. For  decades, our foreign policy consciously  was designed to achieve precisely this  objective. It has been deeply gratifying  to have played a role in these wondrous  and dramatic transformations.  With  these  triumphs comes a  new  era; our single overarching goal of dis crediting communism has been largely  reached. Our  task now  is  infinitely  more difficult. In defining policies to  support  the continued growth of de mocracy, and to further its spread to  other nations, each country must be  considered  individually. What  will  work in Poland may not work in the  Soviet Union. What  is  effective  in  Nicaragua has no  relevance  to Hun gary.  But perhaps nowhere is the challenge  more difficult than in the People's Re public of China. I have spoken before of  the poignancy of what remains to be  ",1991
314,,102,-0.267,238,13,Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota.," Mr. Speaker,  today Congressman OBEY of Wisconsin and I  are introducing the American Jobs and Manu facturing Preservation Act of 1991  to remove  perverse Federal  tax  incentives  that encour age U.S. companies to shut down manufactur ing plants and other operations in the United  States and  to supply  the U.S. market  from  abroad.  Over  the past decade,  thousands of U.S.  workers have  lost jobs with companies  that  have  relocated  their plants abroad only  to  manufacture similar,  if not identical, products  for sale  in  the U.S. market. Domestic busi nesses  that have  remained  to manufacture  goods for sale in the U.S. market can't com pete with multinational companies who genJuly 11, 1991  erally enjoy  the  lucrative benefit of U.S.  tax  deferral on its foreign subsidiary's income until  it makes a dividend payment to the U.S. par ent company.  Specifically, our bill removes the tax deferral  that exists for certain income arising from run away manufacturing plants controlled by a  U.S. parent corporation.  Identical  legislation  was passed by the House of Representatives  in 1987, but was dropped in conference with  the Senate.  In my judgment, it's patently unfair that our  tax laws continue to shortchange both Amer ican workers and producers. We ought to re consider a Federal Tax Code that pays our  best and strongest companies to locate over seas.  In 1987, the Joint Tax Committee esti mated the tax deferral benefit provided to U.S.  companies that locate overseas, but manufac ture for sale in the U.S. market, to be about  $600 million over 3 years. It's no wonder U.S.  companies go abroad  to produce goods  for  U.S. consumption when we offer tax deferral  that makes it more advantageous for them to  operate abroad. This  is especially true when  foreign  countries entice  them with  low  tax  rates or labor costs.  In this respect, the Federal Tax Code's de ferral provisions fly in exactly the opposite di rection of the incentives we ought to be pro viding. We ought to encourage more compa nies to invest in the strength of this country,  the American worker, by  repealing  these  in centives  for moving abroad. Yet, current tax  policy helps to accelerate the exodus of do mestic plants and jobs to foreign countries.  This legislation pulls the plug on misguided  U.S. tax deferral provisions by imposing U.S.  taxes currently on the income that arises from  a U.S. controlled plant that manufactures and  sells a product to be used or consumed in the  United States. The  legislation does not pre vent U.S.  firms  from being competitive with  foreign  firms  that produce goods  for  foreign  markets. But, we just think that it's unfair that  American workers, who've been the backbone  of our Nation's economy, are losing thousands  of  jobs every year as companies shutdown  U.S. operations to seek greater profits by sup plying the U.S. market from overseas.  It's time that Congress acted to protect the  American worker and American economy from  the greed of many companies who would dis locate  thousands of workers  in America  in  search  for greater profits abroad. At a mini mum, we must stop participating  in the out migration of American businesses by refusing  to pick up the tab for the move. I urge my col leagues to cosponsor this  legislation  to help  protect America's economic future.  A detailed explanation of the bill follows:  The bill imposes current tax on U.S. share holders of a controlled foreign corporation to  the extent of the corporation's ""imported  property income."" The bill also addes a new  separate foreign tax credit limitation for im ported property income, whether earned by a  controlled foreign corporation or directly by  a U.S. taxpayer.  Imported property income means  income  (whether in the form of profits, commissions,  fees,  or otherwise) derived  in  connection  with manufacturing, producing, growing, or  extracting imported property; the sale, ex change,  or other disposition of  imported  property; or the lease, rental or licensing of  imported property.

315,,102,-0.161,251,13,Mr. DARDEN.," Mr. Speaker, once again  Marietta, GA has  emerged victorious over  Cheraw, SC,  in  the annual Chinaberry Cup  tennis  tournament. This prestigious competi tion held on April 20, at Litchfield Racquet  Club, near Pawley's Island, SC,  is now in  its  12th year. Under the rules of the tournament,  each side fields 5 teams to compete at various  levels. In past years, the winner has been de termined by simply adding the number of win ning matches by each team.  This year, however, Marietta's coach, A.D.  Little, negotiated a key  rules  change with  Cheraw's coach Malloy Evans. Under  their  agreement, the overall winner would be deter mined solely by the outcome of the match be tween the best team from each city.  That decision by Cheraw cost  them  the  championshp. While Cheraw won a majority of  the lesser matches, Marietta's No. 1 team of  Jon Burk and Dan Norris humiliated Cheraw's  No. 1  team of Frank Andrews and Frank  Exum and therefor won the tournament.  The Marietta  team deserves  to be  recog nized for their great effort and success at re taining  their championship title. They are as  follows:  A.O. Uttle, coach; Dr. Dan Norris; Ron King;  Dr. Clem Doxey; Wallace M. Montgomery, Jr.;  Jon R. Burke; Ronald H. Francis; Paul (Matty)  T. McCabe; Donald R. Shamblin; John Elliott;  and Buddy Darden.  To our friends from Cheraw: Best wishes in  your training for next year.  The following departed with the losing team  from Cheraw:  Malloy Evans, coach; Glenn  (Bud) Ander son; Fred Craft; M.B. Godbold; Ted Thomp son; Frank Andrews; Dr. Teddy Coggeshall;  Dr. Walter Crosby; Jackie Furr; and Frank  Exum.  ON  THE NOMINATION OF  CLAR ENCE THOMAS TO THE SUPREME  COURT  HON. WII!IAM (Bill) CLAY  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 11, 1991  Mr. Speaker, President Bush in nominating  Clarence Thomas  for  the Supreme Court  grossly distorted the fact when he proclaimed  Mr. Thomas the most qualified person for the  position. But what's new about Mr. Bush tak ing excessive liberty with political speech?  And Mr. Speaker, Judge Clarence Thomas'  track  record  in citing history and historical  events is not much better. In 1987 Mr. Thom as wrote to the San Diego Union newspaper  18183  attacking Justice Thurgood Marshall for stating  that blacks should not celebrate the bicenten nial of the Constitution nor should they revere  the Founding Fathers because  they  sanc tioned slavery.  Mr. Thomas, the nominee for the highest ju dicial post in our Nation and the one being va cated by Mr. Marshall, sternly attacked the Su preme Court Justice. He wrote that Mr. Mar shall's criticism was  insulting and  flawed by  concentrating  on  the  issue of  slavery,  an  anomaly. Then Mr. Thomas decided  to be come an interpreter of black history by stating  that  ""Justice Marshall's  understanding  of  blacks and  the Constitution stands  in stark  contrast  to  that of notable Americans  from  Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln  to  Martin Luther King.""  Mr. Speaker, let me state that Mr. Thomas  is no more capable of interpreting history than  he is of interpreting the Constitution, especially  the Bill of Rights. It is apparent that Mr. Thom as needs to revisit the ""nuns"" for a refresher  course  if he  thinks Frederick Douglass and  Martin Luther King would disagree with Justice  Marshall's  feelings about celebrating  the bi centennial.  I will cite  for Mr. Thomas' edifi cation precisely what Frederick Douglass had  to say about the Founding Fathers and slav ery.  I hope Mr. Thomas and  those who are  promoting his nomination will  read carefully  the  following speech delivered by Mr. Doug lass on the Fourth of July 1852 to an audience  in Rochester, NY. The emphases are mine for  the purpose of alerting Mr. Thomas  to must  reading.  FREDERICK DOUGLASS' FOURTH OF JULY  SPEECH 1852  Fellow Citizens: Pardon me, and allow me  to ask, why am I called upon to speak here  today? WHAT HA VE  I OR THOSE I REP RESENT TO DO WITH YOUR NATIONAL  INDEPENDENCE? Are  the great principles  of political freedom and of natural justice,  embodied in that Declaration of Independ ence, extended to us? And am I,  therefore,  called upon to bring our humble offering to  the national altar, and to confess the bene fits resulting from your independence to us?  Would  to God, both for yours sakes and  ours,  that an affirmative answer could be  truthfully returned to these questions. Then  would my task be light, and my burden easy  and delightful. For who is there so cold that  a nation's sympathy could not warn him?  Who so obdurate and dead to the claims of  gratitude,  that would not  thankfully ac knowledge such priceless benefits? Who so  stolid and selfish that would not give voice  to swell the halleluiahs of a nation's jubilee,  when the claims of servitude had been torn  from his limbs? I am not that man* * *  I am not included within the pale of this  glorious anniversary! Your high  independ ence only reveals the immeasurable distance  beween us. The blessings in which you this  day rejoice are not enjoyed in common. The  rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosper ity, and independence bequeathed by your fa thers is shared by you, not by me. The sun light that brought life and healing to you  has brought stripes and death to me. THIS  FOURTH OF JULY IS YOURS, NOT MINE.  YOU MAY REJOICE, I MUST MOURN. To  drag a man in fetters into the grand illumi nated temple of liberty, and call upon him to  join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman  mockery  and  sacrilegious  irony. Do  you  mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to  speak today? * * *  ",1991
316,House,102,-0.398,264,13,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker, the auto in dustry plays an important role in our economy.  As of 1987, nearly 12.7 million American work ers were employed in motor vehicle and relat ed industries. This figure represents nearly 15  percent of total U.S. employment. A significant  sector, with significant influence on our econ omy.  Before 1987, personal interest on car loans  was  fully  deductible  on  individual  income  taxes. The Tax .Reform Act of 1986 phased  out the deductibility of consumer  interest on  car loans and removed an  incentive for con sumers to take out a loan to finance a car pur chase. Although  it was designed  to accom plish certain savings rate objectives, a side ef fect has been the subsequent collapse of the  automobile industry.  Cars have become more rexpensive for the  consumer. Automobile companies have expe rienced far fewer sales. From 1982 to 1986,  automobile sales grew 41.8 percent. From  1987 to 1990 automobile sales grew only 9.2  percent.  Fewer sales have hurt auto company profits  and decreased tax  revenues  for  the Federal  Government. From 1984 to 1986 automobile  manufacturers made an average of $7 .1 billion  in taxable income. From 1987 to 1989, directly  after the Tax Reform Act, their taxable income  had dropped to an average of $1.4 billion. In  1991, first quarter losses for the big three of  General Motors,  Ford,  and Chrysler were  $2.75 billion.  Although actual  tax  figures  for automobile  companies are closely guarded secrets, a sim ple  illustration  using  approximate  figures  shows how the Government has  lost money  after the tax change in 1986. General Motors,  for instance, had domestic sales of $5.2 billion  in 1985. With the Federal Government's cor porate tax rate of 46 percent, such sales result  ",1991
317,,102,0.227,420,13,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  pleased once again to  join my colleagues  in  observing the anniversary of Captive Nations  Week.  It has been more than three decades since  we  first started speaking out on the plight of  the captive nations in 1959, the year that Con gress  passed  and  President  Eisenhower  signed Public Law 86-90, the Captive Nations  Week Resolution.  There have been many dark moments in the  years since then, years when  it looked as  if  the dark night of prison camps, thought con trol,  rigid economic planning, and  religious  persecution would settle over the whole world.  As  it  turned out,  there was nothing  inevi table about a victory of communism, particu larly when  it was being fought so tenaciously  by dedicated people like Lev Dobriansky and  others who have never let us forget the fate of  those nations which have been  forced  into  captivity by the Soviet Government.  While  there are signs of hope,  this  is no  time  to ease up. Many of the nations within  the Soviet Union are still captive, and even in  1991 citizens of those nations are still being  shot and killed by Soviet soldiers.  Above all, the people of the Salties, for ex ample, know from their own history that it is  one thing to gain independence, and another  thing to maintain it.  I recently spoke with the new Russian Presi dent, Boris Yeltsin. He made it quite clear that  he would be perfectly willing to support inde pendence for those nations now within the So viet Union.  That  is  the  type of  thinking  that America  should support  through political pressure as  well as economic assistance. When  the day  comes  that  the captive nations  regain  their  independence, and the people of the captive  nations regain their freedom, we want to en sure that they have the means to enjoy real  independence in every sense of the term.  IDAHO WILDERNESS  NEGOTIATIONS  HON. LARRY l.aROCCO  OF IDAHO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 15, 1991  ",1991
318,House,102,-0.766,433,13,Mr. WASHINGTON.," Mr. Speaker, the  Supreme Court of the United States is  the most  important  of  the  three  branches  of Government,  and  the  Founding Fathers saw to that.  Members of Congress may come and  go, Presidents may come and go, but  only the Supreme Court has positions  for life.  It seems  to me,  then, as  the gen tleman  from Georgia  [Mr. GINGRICH]  addressed,  it should not be an emo tional debate, it should be on logic, it  should be on intellect, it should be on  the merits.  For that reason, after  the close of  business tomorrow, I invite any Mem ber of Congress who desires to do so to  come to the well and join with me in  the 1-hour time I have set aside for spe cial orders so that we can talk about  how this man thinks; that is what is  important, not what color his skin is  but how he thinks.  The Black Caucus opposed him, obvi ously not based on his color but upon  his reasoning or lack of it and his in telligence. Let us discuss the 50 times  he has  testified before congressional  committees; let us discuss the opinions  he has written as a member of  the  Court of Appeals; let us discuss law re view articles that he has written. And  when you do and when the American  people do, they will do as I have done,  and that is to vigorously oppose him.  He would be a great justice in 1891,  but no good in 1991.  BOAT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY  HURT BY EXCISE TAX  (Mr. SHAW asked and was given per mission  to  address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
319,House,102,0.3,433,13,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Speaker, the Amer ican boat manufacturing  industry  is  hurting. Sales are down significantly,  and an estimated 19,000 skilled Amer ican workers will lose their jobs this  year.  Why will these workers soon be col lecting an unemployment  check  in stead of a paycheck? Largely because  of the 10-percent excise tax on boats.  Congress passed this destructive tax  last year, even though no experts were  consulted, nor were hearings held  to  gauge the effect of this tax. Now that  we  know  that  this  tax  is  counter productive, it is high time that we re pealed it.  Mr. Speaker, this issue is not about  tax fairness, or making the rich guy  pay more taxes, or even supply side ec onomics.  It is about American  jobs,  pure and simple. People who can afford  boats can wait out this destructive tax;  the 19,000 productive American workers  who will lose their jobs cannot. I urge  my colleagues  to repeal  this onerous  tax by joining the 131 cosponsors of my  bill, H.R.  951,  the Boating  Industry  Jobs Preservation Act of 1991.  THE LARGEST DEFICIT IN U.S.  HISTORY  (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
320,House,102,-0.413,433,13,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. Speaker, there is  more bad news from the White House  for American  taxpayers. New  reports  indicate that next year's budget deficit  will be $350 billion-by far and away  the largest in U.S. history.  Over the last 10 years, our Govern ment has negligently piled deficit upon  deficit, saddling trillions of dollars of  debt on the backs of our children. And  what do we have to show for these defi cits? Are our roads and rails in good  shape? No,  they are crumbling more  and more every day. Are our children  receiving  the education they need  to  drive a 21st century economy? Hardly.  Dropout rates and  illiteracy are sky  high. Are our citizens  receiving  the  health care they need to be productive  workers? Do not bet on it--36 million  Americans have no insurance coverage  at all. And are our industries maintain ing  their  technological preeminence?  Once again, no; the number of areas in  which we are technologically superior  has dropped by a  third in the last 10  years.  The fact is, Mr. Speaker, that these  deficits are a tribute to a decade of tax  cuts for the rich and sugar daddy de fense  spending for our European and  Asian allies. It is time for the White  House to get serious about putting this  country back on track. Not by preach ing the false gospels of no new taxes  and racial tension. But by forcing our  allies  to pay more for  their own de fense, and by requiring the wealthiest  Americans  to pay their fair share of  taxes, and by  investing in  the  infra structure and the people of this great  country.

I rise to join him and others in  emphasizing the importance of enact ing national energy policy legislation  during this Congress. I think our past  attempts at forging an energy policy  have been characterized by crisis pol icymaking. There are many instances  in the last decade or so that we can  cite to reach that conclusion. Unfortu nately, each time when the crisis of the  day went away and  the country got  sidetracked on other issues, our com mitment to deal with our energy prob lems also went away.  Obviously, this is not good policy for  our country. The citizens of our Nation  deserve better, expect better of us. I do  think that the events in the Persian  Gulf highlighted the need to get back  on this issue and to seriously deal with  it; specifically, to deal with the grow ing reliance on foreign oil. There is a  consensus in the country that we need  ",1991
323,Senate,102,0.287,537,13,Mr. COCHRAN.," Madam President, if  the Senator will yield, I am suggesting  that it is more appropriate for the Sen ate to act as a maker of law rather  than regulation. We should make clear  that  the  law contains a  clear state ment of policy, reflects the sentiment  of the Senate, of the Congress. It is up  to the executive branch  to write the  details of the regulations that carry  out the laws as passed by Congress.  And so part of my objection to the  Chafee amendment that is pending is  that it seeks  to  rewrite  the  regula tions. I think that is inappropriate. It  is much more appropriate for the Sen ate  to be on record stating what  it  thinks  the policy should be on  this  issue.  ",1991

326,,102,-0.347,641,13,Mr. MOODY.," Mr. Speaker, here in Washing ton, and in Congress, as  laws are conceived  that are meant to  improve our public policy,  we often overlook our fellow friends in public  service  in State and  local governments. The  interests of these individuals, especially those  who assist  in public safety, are  frequently  taken for granted as we work to develop con structive and equitable public policy.  Today I am introducing a bill to modify sec tion 457 of the Internal Revenue Code relating  to  the  treatment of deferred compensation  plans of State and local governments and tax exempt organizations.  This bill is a response to the expressed in terests of the employees and union represent atives of State and  local governments and a  response to the interests of the Governments'  administrations  as  well.  This  bill  clearly  crosses both sides of the aisle.  My bill will amend section 457  in  three  ways. Together, these three measures should  prove to be at least revenue neutral, and pos sibly revenue positive. Despite their minor rev enue  implications,  these measures will have  major beneficial and fair effects on the policies  of deferred compensation plans for many indi viduals. These measures will also ease  the  burden on  the Government and pension ad ministrators.  First, my bill will provide for a cost-of-living  adjustment to the maximum deferral amount  49-059  0-95 Vol. 137 (Pt. 13J 21  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  per year. The  level which  is currently estab lished under section 457 has not changed  since 1978. Conversely, the maximum deferral  amount per year of virtually every other exist ing deferred compensation plan is allowed to  increase with  inflation. My bill will  justifiably  align section 457 plans with 401 (k}'s, 403(B)'s,  and other deferred compensation plans by al lowing for this cost-of-living adjustment.  The second provision of my bill allows an in dividual who has separated from service from  a State or local government or tax-exempt or ganization to make a one-time change in the  date in which distributions from deferred com pensation plans under section 457 will begin.  Under present law, an individual who retires  early, or separates from service for other rea sons, must select a date  in the  future when  distributions  from  the deferred compensation  plan will begin. After selection, the  individual  does not have the option of changing this fu ture date. My bill would allow the individual to  make one change  in this date of distribution,  but the change can only be  to a date  later  than the original distribution date.  This modification of current law would espe cially benefit individuals who are employed in  public  safety-police,  firefighters-and  nor mally retire at an early age. Upon arrival of the  predetermined distribution date, my bill would  give  retirees  the option of receiving distribu tions from the deferred compensation plan, or  selecting another date  in  the  future  for dis tributions to begin. This is a fair adjustment to  the law. Early retirees should not be expected  to accurately determine financial needs many  years in advance.  Finally, my bill will permit unpenalized dis tributions to  individuals whose deferred com pensation plans hold  less  than $3,500 and  have been inactive for at least 2 years.  The individuals most affected by this will be  young workers who decide, or are forced,  to  make changes in their lives that prevent them  from continuing  to defer  income. Marriage,  raising a family, purchasing a home, and sud den  health  problems are  all  examples  of  events  that could prohibit an  individual  from  being able to defer income. By allowing dis tribution  from only small,  inactive accounts,  there  is virtually no  likelihood that this provi sion could be abused.  This provision will also ease much adminis trative burden, since under current section 457  law, these accounts must remain until time of  distribution, which  is after separation  from  service.  By  letting  individuals  obtain  their  money and dissolve their deferred compensa tion plans, administrators are  relieved of the  costs associated with maintaining  these ac counts.  If the  individual does not want to dissolve  their plan, then the plan administrator will have  the option of dissolving the plan after 2 years  of inactivity and distributing the money without  the individual's consent, thus relieving itself of  the costs associated with keeping the account  open.  Mr. Speaker, this bill should not raise any  major concerns among my colleagues. How ever,  this bill has  important  implications  for  many  of  the State  and  local  employees  throughout the country.  I urge my colleagues  to support their public service employees and  sign on to this bill.  18573  GERIATRIC REACTIVATION  PROGRAM FOR VETERANS  HON. LANE EVANS  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 16, 1991  ",1991
327,,102,-0.454,641,13,Mr. EVANS.," Mr. Speaker, by the year 2000  nearly  two out of every  three men over the  age of 65 will be a veteran of the U.S. armed  services. Many of  these veterans will  inevi tably experience the effects of aging, the rav ages of  illness, and  the  increasing depend ence on family caregivers. For many of these  veterans, commitment to institutional care may  be unavoidable, but  for many others  institu tionalization can be avoided by restoring and  maintaining physical, psychological, and social  functioning.  Today, therefore, I rise along with 17 of my  distinguished colleagues from the State of Illi nois  to  introduce  legislation authorizing  the  Secretary of the Department of Veterans Af fairs to conduct a 5-year pilot program to dem onstrate the advantages of providing veterans  in nursing homes with treatment and services  to maintain or reactivate their living functions.  With  this  legislation  in mind,  the  Illinois  AMVETS Health Care Facility Corp.,  in co operation with the University of Illinois at Chi cago  and Veteran's Administration Medical  District 17, proposes  to  finance,  construct,  own, and operate a teaching nursing home.  The  facility will establish a geriatric reactiva tion program for dependent elderly veterans in  a national pilot project adopting research re sults and applied care systems  tested and  proven effective in Sweden. This unique initia tive will coordinate the resources of a veter an's service  foundation, a major university,  and the Department of Veterans Affairs  in a  program to improve the quality of life expecta tions of elderly veterans and their families.  This pilot project will not only enhance the  quality of life for millions of elderly veterans,  its demonstrated benefits will ultimately trans late into an enhanced quality of life for all el derly Americans.  I am  confident  that  this  project will display reductions  in hospital ad missions, nursing home stays, physician serv ices, and various social services. Applied on a  national  level,  this program will  result  in an  oveall reduction  in health care costs and an  improved quality of life for aging Americans.  For too long, we have failed to fully explore  opportunities to increase the independence of  aging Americans in our elderly care services.  For too long, we have failed to recognize the  potential in many elderly Americans for a self sufficient lifestyle. For too long, Mr. Speaker,  we have  failed  to show the kind of resolute  faith in many of our aging Americans that they  have continued to show in themselves.  I strongly urge  the House  to swiftly enact  this legislation thereby renewing its faith in mil lions of elderly veterans.  ",1991
328,House,102,-0.081,654,13,Mr. MURPHY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the chairman of  the Committee on  Rules,  the gentleman from Massachu setts  [Mr. MOAKLEY],  for  this oppor tunity to speak on behalf of the rule.  We will have hours of debate as the day  progresses to discuss the merits or de merits of this legislation, and I would  like to say in answer to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania  [Mr. RIDGE], my  good colleague, that this is a very lim ited measure in itself, and we will dis cuss that during the day later.  I do not know;  I am sorry  that I  missed the opening few minutes of the  debate, but something apparently set  off my good friend and colleague on the  committee, the gentleman from Texas  [Mr. ARMEY]. But I would like to say in  answer to what he was speaking of; he  was besmirching  this  legislation and  painting all unionized workers in our  country of violent activities, that that  is not the case. We have ample laws, in  answer to  the gentleman from Texas,  to protect us against violence  from  whatever source may be. Sometimes we  are not satisfied with the enforcement  of that protection, whether it be on the  streets of Washington, DC, or in the  coalfields of West Virginia or western  Pennsylvania. But  every State  and  every community in our Nation has a  law against violence.  Believe me. Coming  from  the coal  country and  the steel valleys  that I  come from, I have seen those laws en forced against union activities, against  law violaters. There are ample  laws.  We do not need to encumber this legis lation with talking about supposed vio lence because it is already controlled.  There are Federal laws, ample Federal  laws,  that protect  legitimate worker  activity, whether  it be unionized or  non unionized.  Mr. Speaker, we are seeing today in  the  Federal  courts  provisions  that  limit the number of pickets on a picket  line to a very, very few members, as  low as  three, and four, and five, and  six. There are fines if unions permit or  encourage  their members  to commit  any  type of violent activity. We saw  last year where the United Mine Work ers of America union was fined  thou sands and thousands of dollars, not be cause of what the union did, but be cause of what some radicals were ac cused of doing.  There are plenty of laws, and I say to  my colleagues, ""You need not encum ber this very limited legislation.""  I think we should support this rule.  It is a good one. We offer the oppor tunity for two full substitutes, one by  the  gentleman who  is  the  ranking  member on  the Committee on Edu cation and Labor, the gentleman from  Pennyslvania  [Mr. GooDLING], which  will totally limit this legislation, and  we will debate his amendment in full.  Then  there  is one by  the gentleman  from Florida [Mr. PETERSON] which fur ther limits and clarifies this measure.  There are ample amendments being of fered. There will be ample debate time,  and I see no reason that we should not  adopt the rule, pass the previous ques tion, and go on with the debate as it is.  Mr. Speaker, let me say to the gen tleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. RIDGE],  my very good friend and colleague, who  he  and  I  are  perhaps  2 percentage  points apart in voting in our history  together  in Congress, who  says  the  matter is going nowhere, the following:  I submit to those of you who are in your  offices listening on both sides of the aisle  that, if you think it is going nowhere, let's  think about  the votes  that Claude Pepper  cast back in the 1930's, or Lyndon Johnson in  the 1940's and 1950's, or John Kennedy in the  1960's, and Hubert Humphrey  in  the 1950's  and 1960's. Many times these great leaders of  our country voted, and they lost, but what  they provided us was a constant, steady flow  of a vision for America of improvement in  our legisfation,  improvement in the condi tions of our workers,  improvement in  the  lives of our people.  So, Mr. Speaker, the threat of its not  going anywhere does not deter me, and  I say that it did not deter those great  Americans. Let us  go  on with  the  measure.  ",1991
329,House,102,-0.49,654,13,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman  from Massachusetts  [Mr.  MOAKLEY] for yielding time to me, and  I  rise  in full  support of this rule.  I  think it is a fair rule, and I think it is  the kind of rule that we need. We have  permitted the minority to have their  say.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Res olution 195. In my view, H.R. 5 is the most im portant legislation affecting the rights of work ers  that this body is  likely to consider in the  1 02d Congress. This rule enables the House  to consider practical alternatives to the bill as  reported by committee without being  side tracked by demagoguery. The rule  fully pro tects the minority by making in order a motion  to recommit with or without instructions.  The rule makes in order an amendment in  the nature of a substitute to be offered by ",1991
330,House,102,0.336,654,13,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. GOODLING's amendment  seeks a middle road  in what is admittedly a  very partisan and emotional issue. While I do  not believe  this amendment adequately pro tects the rights of workers, and will oppose the  amendment when  it is offered,  I believe  the  House should have the opportunity to consider  it.  H. A. 5 seeks to restore balance to our sys tem of labor-management relations and pro tect the right of American workers to exercise  a voice  in  the determination of  their wages  and working conditions. Its enactment will both  further the economic security of the citizens of  this country and promote the democratic val ues which serve  to distinguish our country  from all others.  I urge  the Members of  this  House to support this rule that makes possible  consideration of the vital legislation and I urge  the Members to support H.A. 5 when this rule  is adopted.  ",1991

One is a country inn,  one is a small restaurant, and one is a  gas station and convenience store. We  have 52 employees, and I can say frank ly that I have to go in on a Saturday  night when the dishwasher left and do  dishes myself, so I know what it is all  about.  We have a chef, we have key individ uals. We just cannot call out and bring  people up to replace these individuals.  Even  the  amendment  process  of  8  weeks would be a disaster for our busi nesses.  Small business in general is not like  the big business  that we may  read  about. We are talking about moms and  pops. We are talking about rural areas.  This bill, H.R. 5, would be an absolute  disaster to the ability of a small busi ness to be successful.

334,House,102,-0.592,680,13,Mr. PAYNE of New Jersey.," Mr.  Chairman,  the Strikers Fairness Re placement Act is one of the most cru cial issues that will affect the lives of  almost all American employees as we  enter the next century.  Since 1935, the National Labor Rela tions Act has protected  the right of  workers to join unions and engage in  collective bargaining. One of the most  important protections of the act is the  prohibition of firing workers for exer cising their right to join or help orga nize a union.  Ironically, only during a strike is it  legal to replace employees for support ing union activity.  Mr. Chairman, it is crucial that when  workers go on strike to gain improved  working conditions that they are not  faced with the threat of being replaced.  Permanently replacing workers who  strike was deemed lawful by the U.S.  Supreme Court 53  years ago  in  the  Mackay Radio case.  Indeed in the past years some em ployers have not hesitated  to  effec tively fire many striking workers, and  that is not fair. This is unfortunate be cause now is the time to ensure that  labor and management try and work  together if we want to remain competi tive in the global market.  Moreover,  the  effective  right  of  workers to withhold their labor as le verage during negotiations is an essen tial element of our bargaining system.  As workers have felt increasingly un able to strike, faith in collective bar gaining has been seriously undermined.  Yet,  the Strikers Fairness Replace ment Act can help to restore that faith  in  the  system.  It will  reverse  the  Mackay Radio case by prohibiting the  hiring of permanent replacements dur ing a  labor dispute and prohibit dis crimination against striking workers  returning to their jobs once the labor  dispute is over.  Mr. Chairman, I support this legisla tion wholeheartedly because  it pro vides a clear statement in the law that  workers will not be permanently re placed during a  strike and American  workers deserve that support.  I cannot emphasize enough the im portance of ensuring that when work ers ,go on strike to gain improved work ing conditions that they are not faced  with the threat of being replaced.  The right to strike is a part of our  democratic heritage.  Indeed working  people have earned the right to have a  voice  in  the determination of  their  working conditions.  ",1991
335,House,102,-0.321,693,13,Mr. SYNAR.," Mr. Chairman, today  I rise  in  support of H.R. 5, which bans the use of per manent  replacement workers  during  legal  union strikes. This legislation is vital to main tain a healthy, balanced relationship between  management and labor.  The right to strike is labor's single most ef fective bargaining  tool  in  the collective bar gaining  process. Since  1935  the National  Labor Relations Act [NLRA] has protected the  rights of workers to join unions and engage in  collective bargaining. A key component to that  right is that employers may not fire employees  for engaging  in union activities.  In  the 1938  Mackay decision,  the Supreme Court  ruled  that the National Labor Relations Act grants  employers the right to hire permanent replace ments for striking workers. This decision has  governed  labor-management  relations  ever  since.  So, as we deal with this legislation we are  being asked  the question, ""Why now?"" The  answer is simple: Up until the 1980's employ ers valued experienced, loyal, and well-trained  employees, and did not generally take advan tage of this ruling. Unfortunately, one needs  only to look at the actions taken in a number  of  recent well-known strikes such as Grey hound, Eastern and Continental airlines, TWA,  and International Paper to see that this trend  no longer holds. We must not allow the right  to strike to become a hollow, useless right.  It  is very important that we protect the right to  strike as a credible protection  for workers'  rights in this country.  However, I am also concerned that the deli cate balance between labor and management  be kept even. Some people argue that H.R. 5  shifts  the balance  too  far  in  favor of  labor,  however there is very little difference between  being  fired and being permanently  replaced.  This legislation in no way alters an employer's  right to hire temporary replacements. The hir ing of  temporary  replacement workers has  long been considered an effective manage ment tool to keep a business open during an  organized labor strike. Other techniques, such  as  temporarily  reassigning managment  to  strikers' jobs, stockpiling products in anticipa tion of a strike, or subcontracting out certain  jobs, are also still effective means of dealing  with strikes. Employers do win strikes without  ever hiring or threatening  to hire permanent  replacement workers.  Concerns have also been expressed  that  this bill would encourage more strikes, but it is  not  reasonable  to assume  that employees  would prefer to strike than work out an agree ment and remain on the job and bring home  necessary paychecks. Going on strike is never  an easy decision  for workers, and  it  is not  taken  lightly. Additionally,  this bill applies  to  only organized union strikes, which should  prevent sudden, unpredictable work stoppages  by employees who have no clearly defined  reasons for striking or negotiation structure.  And finally, concerns have been expressed  by some in the business community that, at a  time when  the  issue of American  industrial  competitiveness is constantly at the forefront it  is inappropriate to alter the status of manage ment-labor relations.  I disagree.  In  fact, both  Japan and Germany guarantee their workers  the right to reinstatement after a strike. Most  of our big competitors favor the use of highly  trained, well-paid, loyal work force. They also  favor fostering an atmosphere of cooperative  between management and labor.  I think all of us would like to see a coopera tive  relationship exist between management  and labor. Let's start working on building that  relationship now. As  long as workers can be  permanently replaced for striking, the relation ship between  labor and management will re main tense. I am voting for H.R. 5 because it  will restore workers' faith in the collective bar gaining process and return the labor-manage ment relationship to an even balance. Employ ers will retain their right to hire temporary re placements during any strike, and employees  can  join  in organized  labor activities without  losing their jobs.  ",1991
336,House,102,-0.465,693,13,Mrs. SLAUGHTER of New York.," Mr. Chair man,  today  I am proud to rise  in support of  America's working men and women and their  families. H.R. 5, the Workplace Fairness Act,  prohibits employers from permanently replac ing organized workers striking on economic is sues,  thereby eliminating a  loophole which  threatens to unravel American workers' long held right to strike.  Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal guaranteed  workers the right to strike without fear of being  fired. But since 1981,  thousands of working  Americans have been permanently  replaced  for standing up for benefits they were prom ised by  their employers.  It's hard  to believe  this  could happen  in America,  but  in  the  1980's corporate profiteers like Frank Lorenzo  have replaced striking workers and tried to gut  the very fundamental right to strike. The bal ance between labor and management in col lective bargaining has begun to shift against  workers. This begins to explain why working  Americans have suffered a 6-percent decline  in weekly wages during the last 1 O years.  Opponents of this bill charge  that we are  giving workers a blank check, encouraging  them to strike, and endangering our Nation's  ability  to compete abroad. Nothing could be  further from the truth. Any worker will tell you  that going out on strike is a last resort. Loss  of wages and benefits can devastate a work ing  family. Moreover, this bill applies only to  organized workers,  responding  to business  concerns that unorganized workers could walk  off the job over an unclear issue and have no  clear bargaining agent  to negotiate with an  employer.  In almost every  industrialized country,  the  right to strike is recognized as a basic work ers' right.  If Germany and Japan can protect  their workers from being permanently replaced  and remain competitive in the global market place, surely we can do no less here.  ",1991
337,House,102,0.217,693,13,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Chairman, to protect the  interests of striking workers and employers  alike, our labor laws have maintained a clear  and consistent distinction between  two  types  of striking workers: Those who walk off their  jobs due to an employer's abusive labor prac tices-an unfair  labor practices  strike-and  those who voluntarily strike for higher pay or  increased benefit~conomic strike.  For more than 50 years, the distinction be tween unfair labor practice disputes and eco nomic strikes has been considered so essen tial to fair and balanced  labor relations  that,  until recently, it had never been questione~  even by organized labor.  But a bill now before Congress banning per manent replacements (H.R. 5) would eliminate  this distinction, dismiss any notion of equitable  bargaining  terms, and grant unions unlimited  leverage during strikes and bargaining.  Because strikers in an unfair labor practice  dispute have been forced to the picket line by  an employer's illegal practices, they are guar anteed immediate reinstatement with full bene fits after the strike is over. Current law recog nizes that an employer who violates employ ees' legal rights should not be able to continue  business as usual while operating outside the  law.  When organized  labor does  resort  to  the  economic strike, current law already prohibits  discrimination based on union membership,  mandates  preferential  rehiring  of  returning  strikers with  full benefits as vacancies occur,  and makes  illegal any promised preferential  treatment of prospective employees.  But in an economic strike, such as a strike  for higher pay, the law also recognizes that an  employer who has not broken  the  law-who  simply disagrees with the unions economic de mands-has the right to try to stay in business  by hiring replacement workers. To attract such  replacements,  it  is often necessary  to offer  permanent  replacements. However, when a  company does bring  in permanent  replace ments,  it  is prohibited  from offering  them a  better deal than it offers the strikers at the bar gaining table.  Current law is intended to discourage every  dispute  from  triggering a strike. When union  members voluntarily walk away from $38,000a-year production jobs in Maine, or $98,000-a year jobs as pilots, or $200,000-a-year jobs as  professional  football players,  they know  that  there  is a substantial risk  that other workers  might find such pay acceptable.  Thus an economic strike is a calculated risk  on the part of the union. A union striking for  economic demands, that may or may not be  reasonable, should not be afforded the same  immunity to risk of replacement given to work ers whose legal rights have been violated by  their employer.  Under the provisions of House Resolution 5,  Representative WILLIAM  legislation,  unions would no  longer have  to weigh  the  risks of job loss against the reasonableness of  their economic demand. Under this proposal,  strikers making any economic demand, no  matter how outrageous, would have the same  right to automatic reinstatement after the strike  as workers protesting an employer's unfair  labor practices.  A permanent replacements ban would abol ish the mutual risk faced by opposing sides in  an economic strike-the important mutual risk  that pressures both management and labor toCLAY'S  ",1991
338,House,102,-0.345,706,13,Mr. HERTEL.," Mr. Chairman, I grew  up on the east side of Detroit. At the  age of 7,  I knew what a recession was.  I knew, and today I know many peo ple laid off permanently. I have been in  their living rooms and talked to them  about it, and what it does to their fam ilies. No  one  in my  neighborhood  talked about  taking somebody else's  job. That is what this issue is about.  There  is nothing worse  than  losing  your job, or fearing losin~ your job.  Many  on  the minority  side  talk  about families, and their concern for  families. What is worse than a family  losing  their  livelihood?  There  is  nothign worse than that. That is what  this issue is here today.  Ironically, many people in the House  did not want to vote on this controver sial issue; they think it is controver sial. I  think it is one of human rights.  Why? Because they were afraid of the  next election, afraid of losing their job.  How tragic. Stand up for the American  people. Let Members protect American  jobs. Let Americans pass this bill, and  let Members talk about what we should  be doing. After we take care of the peo ple that have jobs today, let Members  talk about creating jobs.

339,House,102,-0.058,719,13,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support  of H.R. 5. I do so only because the Peterson  amendment was adopted on the House floor  today which makes clear that the  legislation  does not cover nonunion employers.  While I will support the bill, I do so with res ervations.  I by no means see H.R. 5  in  its  present form as a final solution to the broad  issues in disagreement and I will reserve judg ment on the future of this bill.  Unfortunately,  I think  that  faults  on both  sides have brought us to this point today.  I am sympathetic to the concerns the busi ness community has raised over H.R. 5. I real ize that a company subjected to a strike suf fers from  lost productivity and profits. We are  all concerned with America's competitiveness  and we understand that our businesses face  unfair practices from overseas. American busi ness must have  the flexibility  to  respond  to  these challenges. But we need  to consider  some of  the startling occurrences  that have  been brought out by this discussion.  Over the last decade, some major employ ers have demonstrated no sense of loyalty to  long-term workers who  have  helped  build  companies and communities. These are tough  economic times for our families too and many  American workers have  their backs against  the wall  in bargaining for just wages, working  conditions, and health and pension benefits.  Business and labor should be able to discuss  these  issues  in  a constructive manner. All  Americans deserve this consideration.  I feel  it  is  important that this  legislation be  initially adopted as a vehicle for further discus sions and that passage of H.R. 5 should be  viewed only as a starting point. We must re store a balance and fairness to labor-manage ment relations. I hope that passage of H.R. 5  will allow us to pursue that objective.  Mr. DE LUGO. Mr. Chairman, I speak today  in support of  the amendment offered by  the  gentleman from Florida. The language in  this  amendment strikes a  fair balance amid  the  controversy  that  surrounded  the Workplace  Fairness Act.  In the past decade we have seen the Na tion's  economy  and  the  global  economy  change in many ways, some of them drastic,  many of them affecting the very foundations of  the American workplace. We have seen our  country move from a creditor to a debtor na tion as our balance of trade has tilted in favor  of foreign countries. We have seen substantial  decreases  in American manufacturing  jobs  and significant increases in service jobs. We  have witnessed corporate mergers designed  to  improve productivity and  reduce competi tion. We have seen much of our research and  development go  to  foreign corporations who  sell their products back to us.  We have seen changes, too,  in the Amer ican work force.

WHY I HAVE CHOSEN TO PURSUE A PUBLIC  SERVICE CAREER  (By Anne Leslie Asher)  Throughout the past nineteen years I have  remained determined to pursue a public serv ice career within the field of psychology. It  is natural that I would aspire to become a  psychologist,  since  the  range  of options  within this profession  includes the diverse  pursuits to which I was exposed during my  childhood and adolescence. Due to the influ ence of my parents' wide variety of abilities  and interests, I am both empirically and ar tistically-oriented. Psychology draws  from  science and the arts in a unique manner, and  I would be hard pressed to suggest a  field  which more exhaustively utilizes this wealth  of perspectives!  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  I initially became interested in psychology  while I was attending high school. I was de termined to gain as much awareness as pos sible regarding the spectrum of applications  within my intended profession; and I spoke  with practicing psychologists from various  specialties. In order to ascertain if I had the  potential to perform effectively within the  domain of psychology, I gained ""hands-on""  experience serving the public as a volunteer  counselor. I derived tremendous satisfaction  from  counseling others, and became con fident that I would find fulfillment and chal lenge within the ""helping profession."" I have  devoted a combined total of ten and a half  years to working as a counselor within four  community service agencies.  Upon entering college,  I  enrolled  in as  many psychology courses as my schedule  permitted. As soon as I completed the lower  division requirements of university study, I  declared a major in psychology. These stud ies increased my awareness of the various as pects of psychology, and my appreciation for  this  discipline was  heightened. However,  until  I encountered serious medical prob lems, my professional goals within psychol ogy lacked definition. I had intended to com bine an empirical background with my desire  to make an  impact  as a psychotherapist  within a publically funded institution; yet I  was uncertain about how to channel  these  interests.  Although others might consider me a ""dis abled"" person,  I perceive myself as chal lenged rather than disadvantaged. I do make  use of crutches or canes to walk about; yet,  I have been enriched and fortified by the ad versity which I have faced. My experiences  contending with a  life-threatening and dis abling neuromuscular  condition have not  only enhanced my strength and stamina; the  obstacles I have encountered have deepened  my appreciation for life, clarified my goals  and toughened my resolve.  I aspire to treat clients within public hos pitals,  clinics and physical  rehabilitation  centers.  Specifically,  I  visualize myself  working with people  confronting physical  challenges such as life-threatening, chronic,  terminal  and  disabling  conditions.  I  am  greatly interested in caring for economically  deprived individuals receiving medical serv ices within publically funded health facili ties, since I am especially sensitive to the  unique problems which are encountered by  low-income ill and disabled persons.  I  desire  the  finest  training possible  in  order to make the most profound and lasting  difference within  the field of clinical psy chology. I have been admitted to the Doctor  of Psychology program at the outstanding  California School of Professional Psychology  in Berkeley/Alameda, and I will begin my  studies there during the coming fall semes ter. I am confident that my doctoral training  will allow me to attain my professional goals  within public  service. No  accomplishment  could give me a greater sense of satisfaction  and achievement than assisting ill and dis abled patients within public health facilities  to lead the most independent, productive and  fulfilling lives possible!  18807  INTRODUCTION OF THE LEAD  PAINT HAZARD ABATEMENT ACT  HON. BENJAMIN L CARDIN  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 17, 1991  ",1991
344,,102,-0.328,875,13,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing, along with Congressman HENRY WAX MAN, the Lead Paint Hazard Abatement Act of  1991, an  innovative measure  for preventing  the ""most common and societally devastating  environmental disease of young children"" U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices,  ""Strategic Plan  for  the Elimination of  Childhood Lead Poisoning,"" February 1991, p.  1.  This  legislation provides  for  the only  real  cure  for  lead poisoning-prevention. The bill  establishes a Trust Fund of about $1 billion  per year for use by States and cities to oper ate comprehensive programs addressing  the  most intractable source of high-dose lead ex posure  for children: deteriorating  lead-based  paint  in  low-income housing and child care  centers.  This dedicated source of funds will be used  to cleanup lead paint hazards in older hous ing,  the primary cause of  the epidemic of  childhood lead poisoning which affects one out  of every six American children-causing IQ re ductions, reading and learning disabilities, re duced attention span, hyperactivity and other  learning and behavioral problems.  By generating revenues from an excise fee  on lead, this legislation is consistent with the  pay-as-you-go  requirements  of  last  year's  budget agreement and will not increase  the  Federal budget deficit. Funds will be allocated  from this trust fund based on a staMory for mula reflecting local needs in terms of poverty  and  lead paint health hazards. To  receive  grants each year under the formula, cities and  States must match a portion of the Federal  grant and demonstrate their capacity to carry  out an effective cleanup program.  The tax will be 75 cents per pound on newly  mined lead and 37 cents per pound on recy cled lead. The price of lead with the tax, how ever, will be roughly the same as it was a dec ade ago-adjusted for inflation. This two-tiered  tax structure will provide strong incentives for  expanded recycling of lead, a major environ mental goal. Consumers will most frequently  see this tax reflected in the price of a car bat tery which will  increase by about $15. Since  most car batteries last 4 to 5 years, the actual  cost to the consumer will amount to only $3  per year.  The Secretary of Health and Human Serv ices will  review and approve local plans-(in  consultation with the Department of Housing  and Urban Development). A minimum of 75  percent of the funds will go into actual clean ups, with 1 O percent allowed for inspections to  identify the worst hazards, 5 percent for train ing  contractors and workers, 5 percent  for  oversight and quality assurance, and 3 per cent for counseling occupants in lead poison ing prevention methods. Only 2 percent will be  permitted for administrative expenses. A statu tory requirement will guarantee that funds will  be targeted to low income families.  This legislation is the product of months of  deliberation, drafting and revision by a great  ",1991
345,,102,-0.253,888,13,Mr. OWENS of Utah.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am  introducing a joint resolution designating  1991 as the 25th anniversary year of the for mation of the President's Committee on Men tal Retardation.  Since the formation of the President's Com mittee on Mental Retardation  in 1966, many  need of the mentally retarded have been ad dressed. Due to the efforts of the Committee,  persons with mental  retardation have been  freed from back wards of institutions. Training  opportunities have been developed and our  citizens with mental retardation are learning to  live and work  independently,  free of  institu tional restraints.

DREIER  of  California. Mr.  Speaker, a  little over 10 years ago, I  was approached by a  young woman  called Sherry Masterson, whose father,  Lt. Col. Michael Bat Masterson, was  shot down over Laos in October 1968.  She looked to me and said, ""David,  please tell me that my father is dead.""  Well, at that time I made the deci sion that I would do everything that I  possibly could to resolve the crisis and  there are many Members of this House  who have worked diligently for years  to try to resolve the POW/MIA crisis.  I look first to the gentleman sitting  in the chair, our friend, the gentleman  from Mississippi  [Mr. MONTGOMERY],  who led a commission in an effort to  try to bring about a resolution to this.  We have all been very sincere, and  yet  the  release  of  the  photograph  which showed these three people who  have been identified by family mem bers as those classified as missing in  action has been something  that has  brought a great sense of frustration,  especially when those of us who serve  on the POW/MIA Task Force find out  about this by looking at it in the news paper, and then we hear this picture  has been available for nearly a year.  Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we re double our efforts so that we can as sure that if there are Americans still  being held against their will in South east Asia,  that we do everything we  can to get them out and that we get a  full accounting of the 2,273 Americans  still classified as missing in action.

Even when  the  SBA  talks  about  small business it can be talking about  a business with as many as 500 employ ees.  Well Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of the  businesses in my State of Maine have  fewer than 20 employees.  If we are going to lift our economy  from the grips of a recession, then we  are going to have to pay more atten tion to  the needs of our truly small  businesses, particularly when it comes  to getting access to the capital that is  needed  to take promising ideas from  the drawing board to the economy.  That is why I have  introduced the  Small Business Economic Opportunity  Act of 1991.  The  legislation will provide entre preneurs and our smallest businesses  with the capital that is simply unavail able to them during the credit crunch  that is strangling our economy. These  are the people who have been hit first  and hardest by the recession and they  are the people who are the key to eco nomic recovery for our Nation.  Mr. Speaker I urge the Members of  this body to join me in supporting the  Small Business Economic Opportunity  Act of 1991 so that we might unlock the  economic strength that exists in com munities  throughout our Nation and  get our economy moving again.

That is a $5 experiment I do not want  anybody  in my district  to make.  I  think it is silly. It is a  lousy law. It  was applied in a bad way. It should not  have been done the way it was done.

In fact, Mr. President, I ask unani mous consent to have printed in the  RECORD a letter signed by myself, Sen ator MITCHELL, Senator KENNEDY, and  Senator HATCH with reference to this  particular amendment.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  U.S. SENATE,  July 17, 1991.  DEAR COLLEAGUE: On Monday, July 15, 1991,  the Centers for Disease Control published  guidelines on  ""Recommendations  for Pre venting Transmission of Human Immunode ficiency Virus and Hepatitis B Virus to Pa tients During Exposure-Prone Invasive Pro cedures"".  These guidelines represent a consensus on  this issue among scientists and public health  professionals as the best way to protect the  health of the American public while main taining an adequate system of health serv ices.  During debate on the Senate floor on July  11,  an amendment was offered addressing  this topic, but consideration of the amend ment was postponed until this week, so that  the CDC guidelines could be issued and Sen ators would have the opportunity to review  them.  After reviewing these guidelines, we are in  agreement that they provide the most effec tive means of providing genuine protection  for patients against the possibility that they  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE  July 18, 1991  be  could  infected  with  the  Human  Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) virus or the  Hepatitis B virus  (HBV)  transmitted from  their physician, dentist or other health care  worker.  We  therefore will jointly offer an amend ment on July 18 that will require states to  adopt these guidelines by regulation or legis lation.  This amendment  respects  the  scientific  judgment of Federal public health officials  and the traditional right of the states to de termine their own public health regulations.  We enclose copies of the CDC guidelines and  our amendment, and we urge you to vote for  this amendment as the Senate's position on  this complex but extremely important issue  of health policy.

355,,102,-0.334,1005,13,Mr. WOFFORD.," Mr. President, today,  I speak in support of the Dole amend ment, which requires states to adopt  the  rules of  the Centers  for Disease  Control to prevent the transmission of  the HIV virus by heal th care profes sionals to their patients.  The issue before the Senate today is  a vital public health  issue that con cerns all Americans. The transmission  of the AID's virus from a health profes sional to a patient is a tragedy of the  highest order and one which we are  called upon  to do everything  in our  power to prevent. We need to protect  everyone. And we need to ensure that  what we are doing will provide  that  protection.  Mr. President, I believe that adoption  the Dole amendment provides such pro tection and best assures the peace of  mind to which each American is enti tled every time they visit their doctor  or dentist.  On Monday,  the CDC  issued guide lines that toughen their recommenda tions  to prevent  transmission of the  HIV virus and hepatitis B virus to pa tients in a health care setting. I com mend the CDC for the careful way in  which they formulated these guidelines  and the thoroughness with which they  addressed public concerns about pos sible transmission.  Mr. President, we need  legislation  which  lays out steps  to protect  the  public health. The Dole  amendment  does  just  that.  It directs  states  to  enact legislation adopting the recently  issued CDC  guidelines  and  provides  that they incorporate these guidelines  into  their rules  for  licensing health  professionals. Under the Dole amend ment, no State shall receive assistance  under the Public Health Service Act if  it fails to do so.  Mr. President, to adequately provide  for the public health, and more impor tantly, to retain the confidence of the  people  in  the quality and safety of  their public health environments, we  need to mandate compliance with the  CDC guidelines throughout this coun try. With  this legislation we provide  tough incentives for states to do just  that.  Doctors who fail to comply with the  CDC policy should face stiff, criminal  penalties.  I urge all States to incorporate  the CDC guidelines  in such a  way that every health provider under stands the need to follow CDC policy to  the letter. Doctors should be required  regularly  to certify that they are in  strict compliance with the guidelines.  States should instruct their licensing  boards to assure universal compliance  and empower those licensing boards to  hand out stiff punishments  to  those  who do not comply. And every State  should clearly spell out what the pun ishments will  be,  including  strong,  criminal penalties.  Most importantly, we need to do ev erything in our power  to assure that  what happened once to a lovely young  woman and four other innocent people  in Florida, never happen again. The  CDC guidelines lay out on a scientific,  medical basis precautions  to provide  this assurance. I urge every State to  lay out clear, tough penalties that as sure the widest possible compliance.  ",1991
356,,102,0.084,1005,13,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I want  to say a few words about the amend ments before us, and our efforts  to  come up with effective methods of pre venting the transmission of HIV inf ec tion from health care workers to their  patients.  The amendment proposed by the Sen ator from North Carolina would make  it a Federal crime carrying a minimum  10-year prison sentence for an HIV-in fected health care worker  to provide  treatment to a patient without disclo sure  of his/her HIV  infection. The  amendment proposed by Senator DOLE  will require states to adopt the Centers  for Disease Control guidelines.  There is no question that HIV infec tion-and AIDS-is one of the most sig nificant health problems facing our Na tion today. Most people infected with  the human immunodeficiency virus, or  HIV, will develop AIDS, which  is al ways  fatal. Despite  the  tremendous  gains made by the medical community  over the past decade in broadening our  understanding of this deadly virus, and  its affect on the body's ability to ward  off infection, we are still not close to  achieving a definitive vaccine or treat ment. We  have,  however,  learned  a  great deal about how this virus is-and  is not-transmitted.  There are  situations where health  care workers have been infected while  they were caring for HIV-infected pa tients. These situations, although trag ic and heartwrenching, are relatively  few in number-only 40 cases out of the  several million people  in  the United  States estimated  to be  infected with  HIV.  What about the transmission of the  virus from a health care worker to a  patient? We've all seen the recent re port about the apparent transmission  of HIV from an infected dentist to pa tients in his practice. This situation,  while horrifying in its impact on these  individuals' lives, appears to be unique.  Of the 1.5 million people estimated to  be  infected with HIV  in  the United  States, only five have been infected by  a heal th care provider, and all five of  these unfortunate individuals were in fected by the same Florida dentist.  No  studies about HIV  transmission  have identified doctor-to-patient trans mission. Health care workers from all  professional  backgrounds-physicians,  nurses, nurses aides-have cared for pa tients  in many different health care  settings over the past decade, and yet  only this one example has indicated a  link of HIV transmission from health  provider to patients. Clearly something  unusual was going on in this dentist's  practice, and I am sure investigations  will uncover these activities.  CDC has estimated that the risk of  getting HIV infection from an infected  surgeon  is miniscule--one-tenth  the  risk of death from anesthesia for sur gery. Yet because AIDS is universally  fatal,  even one  case  resulting  from  transmission from a health care work er to a patient is one too many. These  cases, although few, must be prevented.  The amendments we are considering  today  seek  to  accomplish  this  end  through  very  different mechanisms.  The Helms amendment will criminalize  the medical practice of HIV  infected  healt;h. care workers. The Dole amend ment  reinforces  public health prin ciples by requiring States to enforce  the newly released Centers for Disease  Control  guidelines  to  prevent HIV  transmission to patients during expo sure-prone  invasive procedures. I will  support the Dole amendment because it  will effectively accomplish our goal of  eliminating the remote risk of trans mission from health care workers  to  patients. It is based on scientific fact  and is good health policy. I will not  support the Helms amendment because  I do not feel it will accomplish the goal  we desire, and in fact may actually un dermine our current HIV prevention ef forts.  First, we know that an infected phy sician poses no threat to his patient by  touching him, by doing a routine phys ical examination, or performing most  examinations,  tests,  or  procedures  which we have all undergone in a phy sicians office. Taking a pap smear test  or drawing blood poses no risk to a pa tient.  Studies  show  that  the  only  risk  which may occur-and even then it is a  minimal risk-is with what are called  exposure-prone  invasive  procedures,  such as orthopedic surgical procedures,  where  the doctor may  inadvertently  nick a glove. Yet  the restrictions in  the Helms amendment require disclo sure even for procedures which pose ab solutely  no  chance  for HIV  trans mission. The restrictions and potential  for criminal prosecution are simply too  broad.  Second,  since  this  amendment  criminalizes only those providers who  know of their HIV  infection but con",1991

358,Senate,102,0.466,1070,13,Mr. MACK.," Mr. President, I strongly  object  to  the  language  in  this bill  which changes the HOME matching re quirements. The change represents a  severe policy mistake  that  threatens  the  future  of  the HOME  program,  which was established under  the Na tional Affordable Housing Act.  As a conferee to the National Afford able Housing Act, I can assure you the  match issue was well deliberated and  resolved. The  authorizers  never  in tended the match be waived. The waiv er undermines the whole HOME Pro gram.  For more than 3 years in working on  the National Affordable Housing Act,  we have been talking about a partner ship. With  the partnership came  the  match. By waiving  the match,  the  partnership falls apart. It is an outrage  that  the Senate has allowed  this  to  happen.  As I said, the essence of the HOME  program is the idea of a partnership be tween the Federal Government and the  States/localities to provide low-income  housing  for  the poor.  In that spirit,  HOME was designed as  a matching  grant program;  the Federal Govern ment would  at  least  double  every  State/local dollar spent for low income  housing.  For example, if a community chose  to lightly rehabilitate older housing or  offer  vouchers  to  the  poor, HOME  would provide a 4-to-1 match;  if the  community  chose  new  construction,  HOME would provide a 2-to-1 match.  However,  the Appropriations Com mittee-in response to the current fi nancial strain in the cities and states waived the match for 1 year. But, as a  July 10 New York Times editorial sug gests,  the appropriator's ""compassion  is shortsighted. HOME's political popu larity is due, in part, to the significant  local commitment it requires. Waiving  that cornrnitment----even before the pro gram gets started-could erode future  support."" Mr. President, I ask unani mous consent  to have  this editorial  printed in the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection,  the edi torial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  HOUSING THE POOR, SENSIBLY  Low-income housing is in short supply, and  state and local governments are in no shape  to help. That makes vital today's vote by a  Senate subcommittee on HOME, a new low income housing program. HOME authorizes  block grants  to states and localities on a  matching basis. And  it gives authorities  great flexib111ty to use the money for reha bilitation, construction or rental assistance.  The question before the committee is how  much to spend on HOME. The House has ap proved $500 million, barely enough  to get  started. Rehabilitation can cost $25,000 or  more per unit; new construction $60,000 or  more. Even after state and local authorities  chip  in  their share,  the House allocation  won't make much of a dent.  To make a meaningful  start, Congress  would need to allocate at least $1 billion, and  with any luck more. That would generate al most $100 million for New York City.  The money wouldn't be wasted. Last year's  housing legislation compels local authorities  to put together comprehensive plans for low cost housing.  In New York, city housing  agencies, private corporations and nonprofit  groups have begun the process. Community based development groups have already es tablished an impressive record of rehabilitat ing-and maintaining-low-cost housing  in  rundown neighborhoods. With an adequate  infusion of HOME  funds,  their yeoman ef forts to reclaim abandoned buildings, block  by block, would have a chance to prosper.  The subcommittee will also take up local  matching rates. The law calls for at least a  25 percent contribution from local authori ties for rehabilitation and 50 percent for new  construction. But because of the fiscal crisis  afflicting city and state governments, many  in Congress proposed  temporarily waiving  the matching shares.  Their compassion is shortsighted. HOME's  political popularity is due,  in part, to the  significant  local  commitment  it  requires.  Waiving that commitment-even before the  program gets  started-could erode  future  support. Better to reduce, but not waive, the  local obligation. That way the program will  prosper, and Congress will deliver a big boost  to cities and town struggling to house their  poor.  ",1991

You see, about twelve  years ago I signed a piece of paper that con tained an oath. I swore to protect the United  States of America and the freedom created  by  its democracy by  joining our United  States Armed Forces. You can't understand  the privilege you have to live in America.  Other parts of the world live in hunger, war,  and oppression. These people have  to  live  with the fear that their very own govern ment may simply come  in and take their  homes, their families, and even their lives.  Here, you can live without the worry of  this. Our government is set up on the prin ciples of liberty and freedom. It is set up to  protect us and our way of life. It has been  like  this for over  two hundred years. Our  founding fathers set up such a model for the  world to follow. We are considered the apex  of freedom. This height could have only been  reached through a single path, and that, son,  is democracy. Everyone who lives in Amer ica believes in this philosophy, and we hold  it sacred in our hearts. We want the entire  world to be able to live as free as we. And  son,  that's what I'm doing, helping  these  people live as we do.  After  the  invasion of  this  country  six  months ago,  the people's lives have gone  from a heaven to a hell. They can no longer  walk the streets for a breath of fresh air  without the fear of being shot, and this en rages me.  I am here to try and recapture  heaven for these citizens. They believe in the  same principles as we do, and I want them to  live that way again. We are trying to re-es tablish the democracy. When democracy  is  re-established, freedom will be restored with  it. You see, democracy is the vanguard of  freedom, son. One cannot and does not exist  without the other. Where you have democ racy, you will have freedom. In communist  societies, freedoms are little if any, and it  goes the same for socialistic societies.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  We, as a democracy, must help preserve  the democracies of the world. If we help pro tect and help other nations move  towards  democratic societies, the world will be a bet ter  place. But,  if we  don't,  the  anti democractic  societies will  begin  to  take  over, taking our homes, jobs, and our entire  way of life. So I put my life on the line ev eryday to protect the democracy of the Unit ed States and of the world. With the protec tion now, when you are my age son, you may  never have to worry about a situation like  this. But, if you are unfortunately faced with  the situation I am, I hope you face it brave ly. It is our:duty as Americans to protect the  democracy of the United States and of the  world because democracy is truly the van guard of freedom.

Signedl,  Dad  LABOR LAW REFORM-""UPDATE  THE NLRA''  HON'. STEVE GUNDERSON  OF WISCONSIN  IN 'l'HE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 18, 1991  Mr~ GUNDERSON. Mr. Speaker. in my on,  going effort to make the case for the need to  reform our labor laws, ~ want to focus attention  today on  the National Labor Relati.ons Act  [NLRA}. Specifically,  I want to briefly discuss  two  issues which point out  that  the NLRA  could be much more effective  in serving the  best  interests of American businesses and  workers.  Congress' last comprehensive review of the  NLRA-the Nation's main  law guiding  labor management  relations-was during passage  of  the Landrum-Griffith Act  in 1959. Since  then, many labor-management disputes have  demonstrated both that the focus of the NLRA,  and the ability of the National Labor Relations  Board  [NLRB]  to help resolve disputes could  be greatly improved.  Given the divisive debate on the House floor  yesterday over H.R. 5,  the strikebreaker re placement bill, it is appropriate today to look at  more comprehensive changes that should be  made to the NLRA.  In general, employers argue that the collec tive bargaining process is too inflexible under  present  law, causing polarization  in negotia tions. Employees argue that, while the law de fines an employer's minimum legal responsibil ities to his or her employees,  it offers no in centives to fulfill moral and social responsibil ities. Changes to the NLRA could emphasize  the common elements both parties share  in  maintaining productivity and  improving com petitiveness.  RESTORING BALANCE: SECTION 8(a)2  First, we must look for ways to restore true  balance  between  labor  and management  under the NLRA. The act is intended to help  balance  the competing self-interests of labor  and management. As  the middle ground be tween these interests often shifts in one direc tion or the other when applied to individual cirJuly 18, 1991  for  this  cumstances,  the act should provide  needed flexibility.  For example, section 8{a)(2) of the NlRA  limits an employer's ability to influence orga nized labor. While this provision was designed  to  prevent  employer-sponsored  ""in-house""  unions-which blocked outside unions from  entering the work place-the provision also in hibits positive  labor-management programs,  such as in-house ""quality councils"" and other  innovative, joint management programs.  In a 1987 report by the Department of labor  {""U.S.  labor law and  the Future of Labor- Management Relations""), the department con siders section 8(a)2 prohibitions on employer  contributions  to such  labor-management pro grams  (referred  to as  the  ""unlawful assist ance"" branch of the section) to be too broad.  The report characterized the provision as ""po tentially so broad and all-inclusive that it was  thought necessary at the outset to exempt one.  farm of indirect financia~ support, the payment  of wages  to an employee while negptiating.  with the employer during working hours.""  While  the DOL  report did not adVocate  changing section 8(a)2,  interpretations of the  statute are sufficiently broad in this and other  areas as to likely prevent some labor-manage ment ventures which otherwise might be pur sued. If our emphasis should be on strength ening the collective bargaining process as an  important institution of the labor-management  refationship, emphasis should also be on pro moting positive cooperative ventures between  the two outside of the collective bargaining ar rangement.  Section 8(a)2 and similar provisions may  still be warranted to prevent unfair employer  advantage over employees. But they should  be updated to reflect changes in workplace re lations which have occurred since 1934.  IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS: THE NLRB  Second,  in order to further strengthen  the  collective  bargaining  process,  we  must  strengthen  the avenues available under  the  NlRA to enforce and mediate between parties  to such agreements. The National Labor Rela tions Board, though designed for this purpose,  has been unable to mediate disputes quickly  enough.  A 1991 GAO report found that, in both 1988  and 1989, 95 percent of all cases  filed with  the NLRB were resolved at the regional level.  When cases were litigated before an adminis trative law judge, the median time to obtain a  decision was about 1 year. Half of nonlitigated  cases were resolved within 50 days.  However, problems with delay still affect  those  cases  directed  to  the NLRB  head quarters. Since 1973, this has been an aver age of fewer  than 5 percent of cases  filed.  Though this number is small in relation to the  total,  in 1989 it amounted  to 874 cases  (of  40, 108 filed). During the period 1984 through  1989, the median time to resolve cases before  the national board increased, and 17 percent  (823) of those cases took a median of more  than 2 years to decide.  Charges that the national board is not as re sponsive as it might be in resolving these dis putes tend to center on perceptions that cases  befor.e  the Board are backlogged. The GAO  report  found  that 30 percent of cases had  been pending 2 or more years in 1988. How ever,  the backlog, as high as 300 cases  in  ",1991
360,,102,0.415,1278,13,Mr. ROBERTS.," Mr. Speaker, today I would  like to recognize Nancy Letourneau of Aurora,  KS. Miss Letourneau is the first district winner  in the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars Voice  of Democracy script writing contest.  Her script is a fine example of the dedica tion and pride she feels toward democracy. As  a tribute to her hard work, I ask for her script  ""Democracy-The Vanguard of Freedom"" to  be inserted into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  DEMOCRACY-THE VANGUARD OF FREEDOM  (By Nancy Letourneau)  What is something that millions of people  have sacrificed there lives to taste and mil lions more die to protect? No-I am not talk ing about that morning cup of coffee that  you cannot begin the day without or that  afternoon chocolate bar that just hits the  spot. It is something both you and I partici pate in, depend upon, and expect. Any ideas?  I am talking about democracy-the vanguard  of freedom. Let's examine why this commod ity is so precious that people are willing to  die to possess it.  What is democracy? Democracy is the lib erator of people held behind Berlinian stone  walls, something our American forefathers  graciously died to protect, something stu dents in Beijing courageously shed blood in  hopes of, as well as something we partici pated in  this November as we elected our  congressional representatives.  Have you ever gone window shopping? Re member admiring  that item on  the other  side of the glass? This is just like the people  all around the world who have only seen de mocracy  through the cracks of the Berlin  Wall. These people's faces wear an exhausted  expression which have never  smiled with  freedom. They have never held  their head  high with freedom's pride.  Freedom is not some bold term, it is the  pleasure  to worship what you choose,  the  privilege to participate in government, the  opportunity to choose a  job, the selections  found on grocery shelves, and the liberty to  go where you want and the right to speak  one's mind.  Clara Smith Reber explains freedom this  way  in here poem  appropriately entitled  ""Freedom"".  Freedom is a breath of air, pine scented, or  salty like the sea;  Freedom is a field, new-plowed furrows of de mocracy!  Freedom is a forest, trees tall and straight  as men!  Freedom is a printing press, the power of the  pen!  Freedom is a country church, a cathedral's  stately spire;  Freedom is a spirit that can set the soul on  fire!  Freedom is a man's birthright, a sacred ram part;  July 22, 1991  The pulse beat of humanity ... the throb of  a nation's heart!  It is because of thiB-'--freedom-that people  seek the treasury of democracy.  Our ancestors fought the American Revo lution to free  themselves and their grand children from  the tyrannical yoke of Eng land. To  taste democracy  they gave  their  lives. Through their victory, we drink the  freedom of democracy. Also as the end of the  Cold War shapes a new global political arena,  and enemies become allies, democracy  is  changing the world. For example, the histor ical 1989 unveiling of the Iron Curtain and  the tumbling of the Berlin Wall exposed peo ple to freedom that before they could only  dream about. Also on October 3, 1990 as Ger many  reunified,  democracy  offered  those  who had only eaten the spoiled fruits of sup pression, the ripe fruits of freedom through  democratization. Finally, students in Beijing  gathered in Tiananmen Square to protest for  something they saw in the West, but never  experienced due to communist domination.  Sadly, their blood fell like rain because old  hardliners refused to quench their thirst for  democracy. Their cries for freedom were si lenced with bullets.  All of these examples illustrate a desire in  people to be free. Democracy provides the ve hicles to drive freedom  to the poeple. Just  like there will always be wars, there will al ways be people dying for the democratic way  of life.  So  the next time you hear someone say  ""I'd just die for a piece of chocolate,"" think  of all those people who have died for a taste  of something far more precious-democracy,  the vehicle to freedom.  A  SPECIAL  SALUTE  TO  CLEVE LAND  INVENTOR  GARRETT  A.  MORGAN  HON. LOUIS STO~  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 22, 1991  ",1991
361,,102,-0.578,1278,13,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday,  July 24, 1991 , the city of Cleveland will pause  to pay tribute to a great African-American  in ventor, manufacturer, businessman, and hu manitarian, Garrett A. Morgan. On  that date,  the Division Avenue water facility will be  re named  in honor of this  famous Clevelander.  The July 24 tribute marks the 75th anniversary  of the rescue effort lead by Garrett Morgan to  save workers  trapped beneath Lake Erie  in  Cleveland's worst water works disaster in his tory. Garrett Morgan will be  remembered  for  his bravery, heroism, and compassion for his  fellow man.  I want to take this opportunity to commend  the Cleveland City Council and,  in particular,  Councilman Craig E. Willis,  for his commit ment and  longstanding efforts  to honor  this  great American. At this  time,  I would  like to  share with my colleagues some biographical  information regarding this individual.  Mr. Speaker, Garrett A. Morgan is hailed in  American history  for his many  inventions.  In  fact, during his  lifetime Morgan  invented so  many things that he was referred to as ""the  Black Thomas Edison.""  Garrett Morgan was born  in Paris, KY,  in  1 sn and moved to Cleveland in 1895, where  he worked as a machinist in a textile factory.  ",1991
362,House,102,-0.204,1291,13,Mr. GORDON.," Mr. Speaker, by direc tion of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 197 and ask for its  immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the resolution, as fol lows:  H. RES. 197  Resolved, That at any time after the adop tion of this resolution the Speaker may, pur suant to clause l(b) of rule XXIII, declare the  House resolved into  the Committee of the  Whole House on the State of the Union for  the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1096)  to  authorize appropriations for programs, func tions, and activities of the Bureau of Land  Management for fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994,  and 1995; to improve the management of the  public lands; and for other purposes, and the  first reading of the bill shall be dispensed  with. After general debate, which shall be  confined  to  the bill and  the amendments  made in order by this resolution and which  shall not exceed one hour, to be equally di vided and controlled by  the chairman and  ranking minority member of the Committee  on Interior and Insular Affairs, the bill shall  be considered for amendment under the five minute rule. It shall be in order to consider  the amendment in the nature of a substitute  recommended by the Committee on Interior  and Insular Affairs now printed in the bill as  an original bill for  the purpose of amend ment under the five-minute rule, each sec tion shall be considered as having been read,  and all points of order against said sub stitute for failure to comply with the provi sions of clause 7 of rule XVI are hereby  waived.

For 17 years,  tens of thousands of Greek  Cypriots have lived under an oppressive Turk ish rule; 35,000 Turkish soldiers have occu pied 40 percent of  the  island state. Ankara  has  ignored a series of  resolutions by  the  United Nations on  this matter as well  as  countless calls by the international community.  This is an opportune moment to speak forth  on this  issue. Not only did Turkey's invasion  take place 17 years ago last Saturday, but the  United States has spent the better part of the  last year addressing another  invasion of a  large country by a smaller one  in the Middle  East.  If President Bush could expend billions  of dollars in time and money to  liberate Ku wait, he should certainly  focus some energy  on bringing justice to Cyprus. I was pleased to  ",1991
367,,102,-0.502,1473,13,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, today I join with  my colleague, the ranking Republican member  of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications  and Finance, Mr. RINALDO, as well as Messrs.  SCHEUER, TAUZIN, WYDEN, RICHARDSON, BRY ANT, BOUCHER, COOPER, MANTON, MCMILLEN  of Maryland,  LEHMAN of California, HARRIS,  OXLEY, BILIRAKIS, ECKART and SCHAEFER,  in  introducing the Public Communications Act of  1991. This  legislation authorizes appropria tions for the Corporation for Public Broadcast ing  [CPB] for fiscal years 1994 through 1996  and authorizes the appropriation of funds for  the Public Telecommunications Facilities Pro gram for fiscal years 1992 through 1994.  Specifically, the act authorizes CPB appro priations of $310 million for fiscal year 1994,  $373 million  for  fiscal year 1995, and $425  million for fiscal year 1996. These funding lev els are necessary  to ensure  that CPB can  continue to assist stations in maintaining high  quality service and to provide adequate funds  for  the production of diverse and  innovative  programming. Moreover, the funds will enable  CPB  to harness the  resources of  the public  broadcasting system for educational purposes  and to continue the expansion of radio serv ices  to presently unserved and underserved  audiences.  In addition, the legislation authorizes contin ued funding of the Public Telecommunications  Facilities Program [PTFP], administered by the  National Telecommunications and Information  Administration [NTIA], at $42 million for each  of fiscal years 1992, 1993, and 1994. These  funds will enable public television and radio to  extend service  to areas not already served,  and to maintain and upgrade existing facilities.  The  funds authorized by  this  legislation are  necessary as well  if PTFP  is  to continue  its  role in the development of public broadcasting  facilities owned and operated by minorities  and women.  The legislation  I am  introducing today also  would expand the role of PTFP in enhancing  the  provision of public  telecommunications  services to underserved audiences,  including  deaf and hearing-impaired and blind and vis ually-impaired people. This provision will help  to ensure that public telecommunications serv ices are fully accessible to all Americans.  In order to maintain managerial efficiency at  CPB, the legislation reduces the number of di rectors on the Board of CPB from 1 O to 9, per mits directors to serve until  their successors  are confirmed, increases the term of the Board  members from 5 to 6 years, and staggers the  terms of Board members so that three Board  seats will  turn over every 2 years. These  changes will allow CPB to operate more effi ciently by keeping a full Board  in place and  eliminating the potential for tie votes that tend  to inhibit the work of the institution.  Through two statements of policy, the legis lation emphasizes the potential for public tele vision  and  radio  stations  and  public  tele communications services  to address national  concerns and solve local problems by utilizing  community outreach programs and services,  and it recognizes the importance of the provi sion  of public  telecommunications  services  through all appropriate available distribution  technologies.  The  legislation also mandates  that CPB,  after consultation with  the  system, prepare  and submit to Congress an annual report for  each of fiscal years 1994, 1995 and 1996 on  CPB's activities and expenditures  relating  to  educational programs and services and  the  expansion of public radio services to unserved  and underserved audiences.  Finally, the  legislation clarifies the  intent of  Congress with regard to the Children's Tele vision Act of 1990 to ensure  that both com mercial and noncommercial broadcasters are  required, as a condition of license, to meet the  informational and educational needs of chil dren.  Since the passage of the Public Broadcast ing Act of 1967 almost 25 years ago, Con gress  has  enacted  legislation  increasing  CPB's authorization from $9.0 million in fiscal  year 1969 to $285 million in fiscal year 1993.  These funding levels reflect a continued con gressional commitment  to ensuring sufficient  funding for the public broadcasting system in  the United States. The bill  I am  introducing  today, and the  funding  levels contained in it,  reaffirm this long-standing commitment.  Today, public television reaches 94 percent  of American homes through 342 local commu nity stations across  the United States, com pared with just 60 percent of homes reached  by cable. For many Americans, therefore, pub lic television is their only source of program ming in the fields of science, cultural events,  and children's  television. Similarly,  in many  communities, public  radio-which serves 86  percent of the population-is an unparalleled,  if not the sole, source of radio news and pub lic affairs programming. Public radio also pro vides listeners with access to classical and al ternative music and other unique service offer ings.  Public broadcasting has a reputation for ex cellence  in educational, cultural and  inform ative programming. Moreover, public broad casting has been at the forefront of new tech nologies; it was the first to use a satellite inter connection system to broadcast its programs  across the country. Public television and radio  also have used technology  to provide media  access to people that in the past have been  denied full and equal access. CPB and public  television stations,  for example, have  funded  over 1,600 hours of closed captioned pro grams  for deaf and hearing-impaired  individ uals.  Similarly, Descriptive Video Service  [DVS],  developed by the WGBH Educational Founda tion, provides narrated descriptions of a pro gram's key visual elements without interfering  with the program audio or dialog, making tele vision more accessible  to blind and visually  impaired people. Public radio programs during  which newspapers are read aloud over the air waves  also  provide  important services  for  blind and visually-impaired  listeners.  In addi tion,  simultaneous  second  language  audio  broadcasts of public television programs and  Spanish  language radio programs have pro vided access  to public broadcasting  for mil lions of Spanish speaking people in the United  States.  Local public  television and  radio  stations  also have been a source of community leader ship in a variety of fields ranging from environ mental clean-up to remedying social problems  such as drug abuse and  illiteracy. For  in stance, since 1993, ""Project Literacy U.S.,"" a  joint project of public  television and Capital  Cities/ABC, has recruited volunteer tutors and  created 450 local literacy task forces. Locally,  public  television programs are  the  focus of  community  campaigns  designed  to meet  hometown and  regional needs;  in Dallas,  to  encourage racial harmony; in Albuquerque, to  raise  concern  about domestic violence;  in  North Carolina,  to  spotlight  the  crisis  in  childcare. Public radio also has sponsored a  This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

368,,102,-0.465,1486,13,Ms. SLAUGHTER of New York.," Mr. Speak er, this past July 4 marked more than another  year of independence for the United States of  America. In Batavia, NY, friends and relatives  gathered  to  celebrate  an  additional mile stone-the  80th  birthday  of Mrs. Angela  Falcone. Angie, as she  is known to all, was  the  first child born  to Nicholas and Victoria  Tessitore, who  immigrated  to  the  United  States from Italy at the turn of the century.  It  was fitting that she was born on July 4, once  they had come here for the opportunities and  freedom our great country had to offer.  Angie worked until age 73, as a superviser  at  the Melton Shirt Factory and at Genesee  Memorial Hospital. She survived her husband,  Ralph, and has two sons. She has been a life long member of St. Anthony's Church. Angie  remains active, and her friends and family rely  on her advice and wisdom.  Mr. Speaker,  I urge my colleagues to join  me  in wishing Mrs. Angie Falcone a very  happy belated 80th birthday.  COMMEMORATING  SARY  OF  THE  FAMILY FARM  lOOTH ANNIVER BAUMGARDNER  HON.

The  Baumgardner farm is located south of Welling ton  in the Texas Panhandle,  just one of the  fine rural communities I have the privilege to  represent.

Many times we do not pause to say  thank you to him for his service to this  body and also to this country, not only  for his prayers but also for his books  and for his leadership and for the great  pastoral way in which he has assisted  us. It has truly been a real asset to this  Senator, and I  think to all of us who  have had the pleasure of serving in the  Senate for  the last 11 years since he  has been Chaplain of the Senate.

",1991
373,House,102,-0.264,172,18,Mr. HEFNER.," Mr. Speaker, I would  just like to point out a couple of things  to my friend, the gentleman from Indi ana. The gentleman mentioned the tex tile business.  We passed three or four textile bills  here  in  this Congress  in  the past 8  years. They have all been vetoed. The  textile industry by this administration  is considered expendable. We have lost  thousands of jobs in the textile indus try. People are modernizing in foreign  countries. We are letting more exports  come into this country. We forgave $7  billion to the Egyptians. Hey, no big  deal, $7 billion. We forgave $2 billion in  debts to countries in the periphery of  our area before the fiscal year ending  where they could borrow more money,  where we can forgive it next year.  Mr. Speaker, the textile industry is  in total disarray. We are having people  competing with us in other countries  in  textiles, and in one specific place,  the Chinese are absolutely killing us in  textiles. And what are  they doing it  with? They are doing  it with  slave  labor.  And what do we do? We say we will  grant them most favored nation status  where they can continue to do it.  What we need to do is to have these  textile people doing the research where  we can compete. If we are going to give  our industry away, at least we need a  level playing field.  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill and  this is a good proposal. I strongly sup port this committee's position.  I just want the gentleman from Indi ana to realize that this is not pork bar rel. This is something that is protect ing jobs and helping to produce jobs in  this great country of ours, and to call  it pork barrel is totally ludicrous.  ",1991
374,House,102,0.236,185,18,Mr. MYERS of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the gentleman  for yielding  time to me.  I am hesitant at this late hour when  many Members are interested in get ting home this evening and making air plane reservation connections. I come  because so many Members seem to me  confused about what we are doing here.  I  think  it deserves some clarifica tion. It seems to me that many Mem bers here are more concerned about  turf, that their feathers have been ruf fled, that they were not given the con sideration or brought into the picture  when the decision was made.  I have been over there a couple of  times to visit that building, and it is in  bad shape. A lot of mistakes have been  made. Let us  look at where we are  today. We know that the present Em bassy in Moscow is in an old building,  a mortar frame, had numerous fires,  has two elevators. One is a firetrap. We  know most recently of a very  tragic  fire,  fortunately without  loss of life,  but loss of a lot of property.  We do know that we have to get out  of that one as soon as possible. What  we have is a building built with a lot of  mistakes,  as  I  recall,  seven  stories  high.  When  I  say  roughed  in, brick and  mortar is there. The openings for win dows, the openings for doors are there.  We know that it is bugged. There is no  question that it is bugged. It could not  be used for classified activities as an  Embassy, but all of us have visited em bassies over the world. Have we seen  one that is large enough?

378,,102,0.382,341,18,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize  the  fact that more than 300 years  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ago, the first group of German settlers arrived  in America. They sought to build a new life for  themselves and in so doing, began a tradition  of helping to build a better America for every one.  I would  like  to pay  tribute  to our Nation's  German-Americans as we  look  forward  to  celebrating German-American Day this week end, on October 6. For more than 3 centuries,  their contributions  to America's growth and  world standing have ranked among the great est of any people's.  It is significant that we note for the record  the accomplishments of German-Americans  today,  for 1 year ago on  this date-October  3-West and East Germany were  reunified  into one nation, thus marking the beginning of  the end of the cold war. The Berlin Wall was  torn down, and with  it one of the most stark  and brutal  reminders of  the oppression  that  had haunted Europe and the world since the  end of World War II.  Today, Germany looks with eagerness to a  future bright with promise and vibrant with pro ductivity, even as we  look  fondly  to  its past  that has sent us so many of our most promi nent citizens.  On October 6, 1683, after a 75-day Atlantic  crossing aboard the vessel Concord, 13 Ger mans  led by  a young Franconian  lawyer,  Franz Daniel Pastorius, made a settlement at  what is now called Germantown  in Philadel phia. As part of William Penn's holy experi ment,  they were  fleeing European  religious  persecution.  It didn't take them long to initiate their own  experiment in steadfast industriousness. With in the year, they had harvested their first crop  of flax, erected  looms and spinning wheels  and were conducting business in Philadelphia.  This diligence and dedication to craftsmanship  has been a hallmark of the German-American  people to this very day.  The  rollcall of honored German-Americans  is a vocal testament to this fact. These men  and women have contributed right across the  spectrum  in art,  literature,  industry, science,  and politics among others. Names such as  Levi Strauss, Albert Einstein, Marlene Dietrich,  Babe Ruth, H.L. Mencken, Henry Kissinger,  and Thomas Mann need no explanation of  their importance to our society and our history.  They helped shape, not only America, but  the world as we know it and as generations to  come will continue to know it. Today, German Americans  continue  to  work  actively  to  strengthen  the  bonds  of  friendship  and  progress between the United States and Ger many.  Mr. Speaker, as the Representative of Flor ida's Ninth District, home to a large and active  German-American community,  I can testify to  the many civic, cultural, scientific, and busi ness contributions of  this special group of  Americans. Therefore, I am pleased and privi leged  to have this opportunity  to pay  tribute  today to this tradition of service.  25555  TRIBUTE TO WISCONSIN  MANUFACTURER  HON. GERAID D.

379,,102,-0.322,341,18,Mr. KLECZKA.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I am  pleased  to bring  to  the attention of my col leagues  the 90th anniversary of MagneTek  Louis Allis, a manufacturing firm operating in  my hometown of Milwaukee.  The firm's longevity is a tribute not only to  its competitive achievements, but to  its con tribution to our Nation in helping build a strong  industrial base, which  led  us  through  two  World Wars and on toward economic expan sion.  Through  the years, Magne T ek Louis Allis  has compiled an impressive list of manufactur ing innovations in the categories of specialized  motors and electric generators. Among  the  firm's numerous  innovations are cement mill  and  rapid  reversing motors, and submarine  outboard motors. In fact, during World War II,  the firm was the first electric motor producer to  receive the U.S. Navy's prized ""E"" award for  excellence in production, as well as the cov eted Fifth Star award for continuous outstand ing contribution to the war effort. Today, every  U.S.  naval  submarine  is  equipped with  a  MagneTek Louis Allis generator.  Mr. Speaker, manufacturing has been  the  backbone of U.S. economic strength through out the 20th century. The Milwaukee area has  historically been a critical part of the industrial  base, and MagneTek Louis Allis,  founded  in  1901, has been there since it all began. The  firm has a  rich history of accomplishments,  and I have only outlined a few of its achieve ments.  Let us wish  them  the best  for continued  strong performance, and look forward to see ing MagneTek Louis Allis motors and genera tors power our Nation's economic engine  for  the next 90 years.

381,,102,0.268,367,18,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Speaker, today, I have in troduced  the Federal Communications Com mission  Engineering  Sciences Qualification  Act of 1991.  The bill requires that at least one member of  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  [FCC] have an engineering background.  The FCC  is charged with regulating one of  the  fastest growing and  technologically dy namic industries in this country. Since its for mation  in 1934,  there have been 64 FCC  Commissioners. Of these, only eight have had  an engineering background.  Engineering  talent  is now more necessary  than ever at the FCC. The FCC deals with  many complex  telecommunications engineer ing issues and until 1982, the Communications  Act required that one professional staff assist ant for each Commissioner had to be an engi neer. Yet today only 1 of the 15 professional  staff assistants to the current FCC Commis sioners has a background in engineering.  The technical sophistication and complexity  of communications  regulatory  issues has  in creased dramatically over the 57 years since  the FCC was formed. Advances in technology,  such as digital audio broadcasting [DAB], high  definition television [HDTV] and personal comEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  munications  systems  [PCS]  represent  just  some of  the  regulatory challenges  that  the  FCC must face  in the near future. These is sues, where technology meets regulation, re quire technical, as well as economic, legal and  political expertise.  That is why  I believe that one of the FCC  commissioners should be required to have an  engineering background. This will give a new  level of technical sophistication to the FCC.  It  will give the Commission greater ability to han dle  the complex  technical engineering ques tions that will be coming before the Commis sion in the years to come.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill  so that our telecommunications regulators will  be able to keep up with this the fast-paced in dustry that it oversees.  FANNY PIEMONTESE AND  JOSEPH  COLOSIMO: YONKERS' COLUMBUS  DAY HONOREES  HON. NITA M. LOWEY  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 3, 1991  ",1991
382,,102,-0.388,367,18,Mrs. LOWEY of New York.," Mr. Speaker,  Columbus Day  is a special day for all Ameri cans. It is particularly so for Americans of Ital ian descent, who take this time every year to  celebrate their myriad contributions to the de velopment of American society, and  to pay  tribute to members of their community whose  recent achievements are of special note. For  499 years,  Italian-Americans have played a  vital role in the growth, and the greatness, of  the United States.  Tomorrow, members of the Yonkers Italian American community will gather for the annual  Columbus Day Celebration Committee dinner dance. They will honor two very special  indi viduals for their lifetimes as champions of Ital ian heritage. I want to join them in paying trib ute  to  Fanny  Piemontese  and  Joseph  Colosimo.  Fanny Piemontese was born and  received  her formal education in Italy. After coming to  this country as a young woman, she settled in  Yonkers with her husband, Morris. Together,  they built a successful clothing business, and  Fanny became a  leader of  the community.  She  is a past-president of  the Westchester  Women's Division of the American Committee  on Italian Migration, and has been chairman of  such organizations as  the Soroptimist Fund  Raising Committee  for Yonkers  youth pro grams,  the United Fund of Yonkers, Boys'  Town of Italy, the Benefit Shop of St. John's  Riverside Hospital,  the Enrico Fermi Stamp  Committee, the Yonkers Cancer Crusade, and  the Yonkers Cancer Society. She has raised  funds for the Sicilian Disaster Relief Fund and  Fruili  earthquake  victims,  organized  Italian  classes at the Yonkers Y.M.C.A., gave  tele vision commentaries for Italian-speaking view ers, and helped win approval by  the  Italian  Government  of  a  stamp  honoring  Enrico  Fermi. Her  tireless and effective work has  been  recognized  and  honored  numerous  times. I am very pleased to add my name to  the many others who have recognized Fanny's  accomplishments. She  is one of our commu nity's finest assets.  25581  Joining  her  in  the  spotlight  tomorrow  evening will be Joseph Colosimo. An accom plished public engineer and a Yonkers civic  leader, he has made it his work to ensure that  the accomplishments of Italian-Americans are  widely  recognized. After seeing a children's  text book which purported  that Lief Erikson  and  not Christopher Columbus  discovered  America, he led a crusade to have New York  State school syllabi  recognize  the  important  contributions  that people of  Italian descent  have made, and particularly the importance of  the events whose quincentennial we will all  celebrate together next year. Working together  with  the State Sons of Italy, he was able  to  convince  the Federal Government to  fund a  curriculum study by the New York State Edu cation Department  to evaluate  the  Italian American experience. He was also appointed  to the Education Department's Advisory Coun cil of Ethnic Studies. Thanks to Joe Colosimo,  students all over New York are taught about  all of the things that members of the  Italian American  community  have  done  to make  America great.  The Columbus Day Celebration Committee  has  chosen wisely  in  naming  this  year's  honorees.  Fanny  Piemontese  and  Joseph  Colosimo are making a difference in the Yon kers  Italian community and  throughout our  area. I am sure that all of my colleagues join  me in wishing these two great individuals well  and in congratulating them for that honor that  they are receiving.  KATHERINE AFENDOULIS, MICH IGAN TEACHER OF THE YEAR 1991  HON. PAUL 8. HENRY  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 3, 1991  ",1991
383,,102,0.264,367,18,Mr. HENRY.," Mr. Speaker, education is the  key to our future, and our hopes for the Nation  can only be as bright as the people we entrust  to develop our children's minds.  So, it is with great pride that I rise today to  tell you about Michigan's Teacher of the Year,  Katherine Afendoulis.  Katie teaches third grade at Collins Elemen tary School in Grand Rapids. In her 19 years  as an educator, she has demonstrated a deep  commitment to the many young lives she has  touched.  She has particular concern for children who  need special help in the critical early years of  education. At Collins Elementary, she  is  in volved  in the gain academic power program,  aimed at helping high-risk youngsters.  Mr.  Speaker,  on October  23, Michigan  Teacher of the Year Katie Afendoulis will be  here  in Washington, along with Teachers of  the Year from the other 49 States, the District  of Columbia and Puerto Rico,  for a sympo sium on the critical issues in education. I urge  my colleagues to take the  time to meet with  these important educators, to learn from their  knowledge and experience what we  in Con gress can do to better meet the needs of our  Nation's young people.

386,House,102,0.381,575,18,Mr. WEBER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of  the  conference  report on H.R.  2698,  the appropriations bill  for Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Adminis tration, and related agencies.  I want to  take  this opportunity to commend the chairman of  our subcommittee, the honorable JAMIE WHIT TEN, for his work on this legislation. The chair man has brought a bill to the floor which ad dresses the needs of rural America in spite of  tight budgetary constraints.  I also want to thank the new ranking mem ber of our committee, JOE SKEEN,  for his ef forts on this legislation. His concern and work  on behalf of rural America is certainly reflected  in this bill.  Mr. Speaker, this bill has a number of wor thy programs that I strongly support and de served to be mentioned here today. However,  I want to take this opportunity to talk about the  increasing  importance of the Food and Drug  Administration and  the need  to ensure  that  this agency will have adequate  funds to ac complish  its mission. As we move  in to  the  1990's, Mr. Speaker,  the consumers of our  Nation will continue to insist that their food is  safe, pure, and wholesome. They will want to  be assured that drugs and cosmetics are safe  for  their use. The consumers of our Nation,  Mr. Speaker, are demanding  that  the FDA  take an activist role on their behalf.  The agency, and Congress, need to be in a  position to respond to these new demands.  I  was glad to see  that our subcommittee was  able to provide over $725 million for the Food  and Drug Administration. This money is sorely  needed by  the agency  in order to carry out  new  legislative mandates recently placed on  them by Congress. However, Mr. Speaker,  I  am afraid that this level of funding will not be  adequate for the agency to accomplish its mis sion  in  future years. Furthermore,  I am dis turbed by the continuing budgetary games that  the administration continues to play with this  agency.  In  the conference report, Mr. Speaker, the  conferees provided that over $188 million of  the appropriated amount would be available  for the Food and Drug Administration when an  official budget request for this amount would  be transmitted to Congress. The conferees felt  that this was necessary since OMB and  the  Department of Health and Human Services  routinely have not requested sufficient funds  for this important agency. As the report states:  ""It is disheartening  that  these  two agencies  continue  to  resort  to budget gimmickry by  claiming  fictitious user  fees as part of  the  Food and Drug Administration's annual budget  request."" It would seem, Mr. Speaker, that the  administration is intent on playing a game of  Russian roulette with  the  funding request for  this agency. Obviously,  the administration's  approach  funding  this agency  is penny wise  but pound foolish.  Mr. Speaker,  it is my hope that when our  subcommittee considers next year's  funding  for the FDA that the administration will present  us with an accurate  funding  request. Those  groups who rely on this agency to ensure that  we have safe food and drugs are demanding  it, Mr. Speaker, and I think it is time that Con gress demands it as well.  ",1991
387,House,102,-0.051,575,18,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of the conference report making appropriations  for agriculture and rural development for fiscal  year 1992. In particular, I would like to point  out one decision made by the conferees that  I believe will yield great benefits  for many  years to come.  This legislation will provide $4.5 million for  the activities under the Alternative Agricultural  Research and Commercialization Act of 1990  [AARC] authorized in the 1990 farm bill.  There  is an urgent need  for jobs and  in come  in rural America. Based on much dis cussion and a series of hearings before the  House Agriculture Committee, we determined  that AARC is the best way to increase the de velopment  and  commercialization  of  new  nonfood, nonfeed products made  from  farm  commoc:lities.  New  uses  commercialization  represents a significant opportunity to increase  demand for agricultural commodities,  thereby  strengthening the agricultural sector and rural  economies.  From experience we know that the Govern ment by itself or industry working alone is not  bringing  these products  to  the marketplace  with the speed necessary in today's competi tive world. According  to  the Foreign Agri culture Service, over 50 percent of U.S. agri cultural exports are unprocessed bulk com modities. Another 20 percent of exports have  had some  intermediate processing such as  vegetable oil from soybeans. In contrast, over  75 percent of the farm exports of the United  Kingdom,  France, Germany,  and  Italy are  value-added products. The European Commu nity controls over 50 percent of the world trade  in value-added and high-value products, while  the United States has merely 8 percent of that  trade. Our loss in terms of jobs and income is  tremendous. The Economic Research Service  estimates  that $15  to $20 billion could be  added  to farm  income alone by substituting  new crops and products for imports.  Realistically, this country has to change the  way it does business if it is to compete more  effectively in international markets. Japan and  other countries often assist their companies in  commercializing  technology, quite often U.S.  technology. In this country, there are substan tial barriers to moving these new products to  the market which private companies just face  alone. Three primary obstacles-coordination,  high  cost,  and  long-term  risk-hamper and  often prevent commercialization.  In addition, our excellent Federal agricultural  research system focuses primarily on increas ing  farm production  rather  than developing  new uses and markets for farm products.  In  1988, about 1.5 percent of the total $900 mil lion budget for the Agricultural Research Serv ice and the Cooperative State Research Serv ice was spent on nonfood products. Funding  for new uses research was actually less since  this $16 million  includes  feed and traditional  textiles research. Even when researching new  uses, researchers often do their work without  talking with private companies and  farmers  about market needs and economic feasibility.  In today's increasing competitive world mar ket, significant resources must be focused on  developing new uses and assisting the private  sector to overcome  the barriers  to commer cialization. Offering a company a patent or co operative agreement is not enough-the public  and private sectors must work in partnership if  we are to grasp the opportunities presented by  new uses.  We enacted AARC to change the way the  Government works with  the private sector.  This innovative program will help researchers  and companies speed new uses from the lab oratory to the marketplace. The key to AARC's  success is its independent with resources fo cuses solely on coordinating and assisting ef forts to get these new products on the market.  In addition to providing  first-time  funds  for  AARC,  I think  it  is critical  to send a strong  message to the USDA that the  intent of the  authors of subtitle G was that AARC be a sep arate entity within the Department, and not a  part  of  the Agricultural Research Service  [ARS]. There are some  indications  that  the  ARS would  like to exercise control of AARC  which would not, in my opinion, be in the best  interests of  the  long-term development and  commercialization of new products. Again, the  intent of subtitle G is to create a separate en tity with its own board of directors.  We must  implement a  forward-looking  in dustrial age policy to maintain U.S. competi tiveness in the value-added agricultural sector,  and not continue to deliver this sector to the  Europeans. AARC can be an important part of  that agricultural policy. I applaud the conferees  for  investing  in  the  future of American agri culture by providing funding for AARC.  I look  forward to working with them and the Depart ment of Agriculture to implement this important  program.  ",1991

391,,102,-0.547,757,18,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr. Speaker, we've gotten so  accustomed to seeing yet another JOHN DIN GELL-inspired headline that when we see an  article recapping his career,  the breadth and  depth of his interests takes us by surprise.  That's the case with the recent profile of him  in U.S. News & World Report, by Harrison  Rainie and Gary Cohen. Appearing  in  the  magazine's special issue detailing examples of  the best of America, the article not only sum marizes his achievements but captures JOHN  DINGELL'S personality and wit.  From the moment I first came to the House  of Representatives I have had the privilege of  getting advice and direction from this man who  has contributed so much to American society,  and has earned this fall's U.S. News accolade  many times over.  But not everyone in the House has had that  experience. For that reason I insert this article  in  the RECORD, and commend  it to my col leagues:  [From U.S. News & World Report, Aug. 26Sept. 2, 1991]  CONGRESS' MOST FEARED DEMOCRAT  (By Harrison Rainie and Gary Cohen)  One day in 1982, John Dingell sat at his  desk, playing with a rifle and arguing over  the  phone with  then  Interior Secretary  James Watt about documents Dingell wanted  to examine. As the lawmaker spoke, he at tached a brand-new scope  to  the gun and  started playing with the bolt and trigger. As  metaphor, Dingell's end of the discussion  was hardly subtle: ""This is not a personal  (tshick, tshick went the bolt ... click went  the trigger) attack on you. I know others  (tshick, tshick ... click) have made fun of  your religious beliefs [Watt is a fundamen talist Christian]. I think that's awful and I  promise  that's not what I'm doing.  I  just  want  to make  sure  your department  is  (tshick,  tshick)  doing  its  job  properly.  (Click.)""  Those who watched Dingell talk are sure  he was not aware his hunting metier was  dominating  the conversation. Yet  in Din gell's case, there is hardly a moment when  he is not hunting and there are few  times  when he doesn't bag his prey. His office is  adorned with numerous animal trophies, and  his files are filled with other kinds of kills:  His  investigation of spurious ""administra tive cost"" billings at Stanford University led  to the announced resignation of its presi dent, Donald Kennedy, this summer. Dingell  brought a Nobel Prize-winning biologist to  his knees this spring after a five-year science  fraud  investigation. The Red Cross said it  would spend $120 million to change its han dling of blood supplies recently after Dingell  and a colleague, Rep. Ron Wyden, found it  had allowed tainted blood into the system.  All this on top of 10 years of investigations  that cornered White House aides, defense  contractors and financiers and reshaped the  way the government treats everything from  bottled water and heart pacemakers to nuts  and bolts.  Dingell is the most feared Democrat in the  land. He has used the spacious authority of  his House Energy and Commerce Committee  to thwart much of the conservation plan to  dismantle Washington's regulatory  frame work.  Beyond  his  institutional  power,  though,  the  thing that makes Dingell  the  best of his breed is the vigor and intelligence  of his investigative work. He has brought to gether a dogged staff on his oversight and in vestigations subcommittee, including a good  number of ringers from other government  agencies who have helped him promote his  control over everything that moves, is sold  or is burned-the things he argues are within  his panel's purview. ""He has instituted an  ethos of permanent investigation into poli tics,"" argues Suzanne Garment, author of  the upcoming book ""Scandal: The Culture of  Mistrust in American Politics.""  The world of the Michigan Democrat is bi nary-either the force is with you, or you've  gone to the dark side. Those to be distrusted:  bankers, Wall Street sharpies, big-league in stitutions in almost every industry (except  the U.S. auto makers, whom he usually pro tects because they dominate his district in  Dearborn), and gun controllers. The Jedi are  those who uphold his father's legacy as a  New Deal Democrat, whistle-blowers (""God's  special men and women""), his aides, blue collar workers,  small  investors  and  like minded, aggressive colleagues on his panel  such as Reps. Wyden of Oregon and Dennis  Eckart of Ohio.  Still and all, many politicians  see  the  world  through  a Manichaean  lens,  have  smart staffs with subpoena power and want  to make headlines. Why do Dingell and his  crew stand out?  His voracious appetite. Dingell figures he  has a right to go after anything he chooses.  Sometimes his whims are capricious, but the  motive  is always  the same:  to extend his  reach. After the now 65-year-old had a hip re placement operation several years ago, he  reported back to the staff that he was wor ried about the safety of the nation's blood  supply. That led  to  the investigation that  prompted the upheaval at the Red Cross.  Dingell maintains that his committee, the  oldest in Congress, has been ceding its juris diction ever since it was founded in 1795. His  modern-era  colleagues  see matters  dif ferently. Since Dingell took over the panel  in 1981,  the  committee has  substantially  broadened its investigative horizons by beat ing his more politically inert peers to big is sues. He aced out a host of environmental panel legislators in the EPA scandal of the  early 1980s  that  led  to  the resignation of  Ronald Reagan's Environmental Protection  Agency administrator, Anne Burford, and a  perjury conviction against one of her key  deputies, Rita Lavelle. He outgunned  the  Armed Services Committee to dominate the  defense procurement outrages of the mid1980s, among other things unearthing such  massive questionable billings at General Dynamics (including  taxpayer funds  to board  the company chairman's dog) that the gov ernment withheld a record $250 million in re imbursements from the firm. And he rolled  his education committee colleagues by un covering the academic and science research  scandals of the past year. Among them: the  case of Dr. David Baltimore, a Nobel laure ate immunologist who was forced to with draw a paper done by a researcher using fal sified data and apologize to his chief accuser,  a whistle-blower named Margot O'Toole.  His  ""Energizer""  probing machine. The  oversight subcommittee is the scandal-seek ing machine  that keeps going and going.  Dingell's demands for documents are legend ary. In the late 1980s, a worker at the EPA  named Angie Holovka had the sole mission  of coordinating  the agency's return  cor respondence to Dingell, and there were usu ally 20 pending appeals for information at  any given moment. She called her self ""Mrs.  Dingell.""  The staff, too, has an unqualified mandate  to prowl. In 1989, some subcommittee inves tigators flew to Los Angeles with subpoenas  for Michael Milken's accountants during a  long-running probe  of Milken  investment  schemes. There were guards at the door who  prevented them from entering. But rather  than return  to Washington empty-handed,  they decided to launch a surprise visit at a  McDonnell Douglas Corp.  plant  in Long  Beach to see the new C-17 cargo jet and peek  inside its books. They did not like what they  saw and a larger probe ensued. It turned up  a massive cost overrun, and Air Force pay ments  to  the  firm were  suspended  for  a  while.  In like manner, investigator Peter Stock ton was on vacation in Maine in 1989 and had  lunch in a restaurant near Bath. He noticed  he was across from  the Bath Iron Works,  spotted  the new DDG-51 destroyer  in  the  water and decided to ask for a tour. In Wash ington, he convinced Dingell something was  awry. A General Accounting Office probe was  ordered, and it discovered a substantial over run.  The  company  voluntarily  cut  its  charges to the government by $3.2 million.  His whistle-blowers' jubilee. Dingell's sub committee has long been known as a  safe  haven  for  those who  see wrongdoing and  want  redress. One  of  the  highest  com pliments to the panel's work was paid by pri vate  investigators who had been hired by  Mylan Laboratories, a generic-drug company  that thought its applications for approval to  market drugs were not being  treated as  quickly by the Federal Food and Drug Ad ministration as those of competitors. The de tectives combed the garbage of an FDA offi cial two times a week for several months and  dug out receipts for lavish vacations to Eu rope and a host of other goodies. They de cided to pass the information to Dingell's of fice because  they  thought he would more  quickly remedy the problem than any of the  executive branch agencies that could probe  the FDA. The result was a massive investiga tion and these results, so far: Five former  FDA employees, five generic-drug-company  executives, one consultant and  four drug  companies have been convicted on varying  charges,  including racketeering and giving  and receiving illegal gratuities.

While geo graphically small,  the  industriousness of  people has propelled Taiwan to its current po sition as our 6th  largest trading partner and  the possessor of  the world's 13th  largest  economy.  Its economic success is matched by its re newed emphasis on human rights for the peo ple of Taiwan. Its distinguished President, Lee  T eng-hui, recognized the importance of human  rights when he said, ""A new world order can  only be  forged  if built upon a  respect  for  human  rights."" To  further  emphasize  that  statement, President Lee went on to say that  the ""world's political, economic, and cultural  affairs  should be  based upon  respect  for  human rights.""  It is encouraging to note that other govern ments of the world recognize the simple prin ciple  that democracy  is unattainable without  the full recognition of individual human rights.  Hopefully,  the Republic of China will stand  steadfast in its respect of human rights and its  commitment to freedom and liberty for all  its  people.  A TRIBUTE TO FATHER PAUL  CULL  HON.

398,House,102,-0.513,848,18,Mrs. MINK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join  in support of the Women's Economic Equity  Act of 1991 , legislation which promotes eco nomic advancement and equity for women  in  the workplace and at home.  Over the last 20 years women have entered  the work force in record numbers. By the year  2000, two out of every three new entrants into  the work force will be women. Though women  are welcomed into the workplace, many must  still  contend with  lower wages, barriers  to  high-skilled and technical jobs, the lack of pro motions and no health benefits.  Today, women workers earn only 71 cents  for every $1 men earn; women constitute 62  percent of the work force with poverty level in comes; almost 45 percent of families with chil dren  under  are maintained  by  single  women and live in poverty; and 14 percent of  all women workers have no health insurance  benefits.  Mr. Speaker, as the  fastest growing seg ment of our work force, women deserve equal  pay, equal treatment, and equal opportunity to  advance to highly skilled, well paying jobs.  The Women's Economic Equity Act is com prised of 25 bills that address increased edu cational and employment opportunities, busi ness ownership, economic justice, and retire ment equity.  It provides technical assistance to organiza tions in eliminating discriminatory wage-setting  practices, and establishes a council within the  legislative branch  to consider Federal policy  with  respect  to  the  economic problems of  women, particularly those living in poverty.  The act seeks to create new employment  opportunities for women through increased job  training and education. It includes legislation I  authored to expand Pell grant eligibility for 6  million students who attend college on a less than-half-time basis, the majority of whom are  18  women.  For  these women-undereducated,  working, many with children-education is the  only means to economic self-sufficiency.  Mr. Speaker these issues addressed by the  Women's Economic Equity Act are important  not only to women, but to all families, employ ers, and communities across the Nation. The  economic well-being of America is dependent  on a work force in which women are accepted  and considered equal.  Mr. Speaker, women deserve equity  in the  workplace, in our communities, and in our Na tion.  I urge my  colleagues  to  support  the  Women's Economic Equity Act.

400,,102,-0.25,874,18,Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.," Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to introduce legislation, with  my colleague from North Dakota, BYRON DORGAN, to target farm program benefits to familysized  farmers and  ranchers.  I serve on  the  House Agriculture Committee, and maintaining  a strong family  farm-based agricultural economy  is critically  important to me. Farm program payments in the grain sector of the ag  economy continue to be important, and I support a higher target price for grain commod ities. However, as we see the budget levels  for  farm  program  spending  continuing  to  shrink, I would like to see those payments di rected at family size operations.  Family farmers, however, cannot rely on the  Federal Government over  the  long  run. We  need to structure an ag economy where family  farmers and ranchers can prosper on decent  market prices rather than reliance on govern ment payments. In order to accomplish this, I  support higher nonrecourse  loan  rates and  management of production  levels.  In an  in creasingly  international ag market,  it will be  essential for our Government to negotiate pro duction levels and export enhancements with  our grain growing allies as well as  imposing  limits on domestic production.  The alternative to creating a better market price environment is to continue following the  Reagan and Bush administration efforts to de velop a completely  free market agriculture.  While I doubt that a completely free market is  ever achievable, the emphasis of the past two  administrations has been on phasing out gov ernment payments while simultaneously en couraging a cheap grain policy. This has been  great for the huge grain trading corporations,  but a disaster for family farmers. We are on  the  verge of achieving  the worst of both  worlds-no subsidies and no decent market  prices, either one.  The  legislation  that Congressman DORGAN  and I have introduced would increase the tar get prices for wheat and feed grains to $4.50  for wheat, $3.10 for corn, $1.63 for oats, and  $2.94 for grain sorghum to begin to more ac curately reflect the cost of production for these  crops. These  increased  target prices will be  paid on the first 26,000 bushels of corn pro duction and comparable amounts for the other  feed grains to be determined by the Secretary  of Agriculture. Wheat producers would receive  the target price of $4.50 on their first 18,000  bushels of production.  The  loan  rate  for wheat and  feed grains  would be set at 100 percent of the average  market price-figured over  the  last 5 years  dropping the high and low-versus the 85 per cent figure contained in the 1990 farm bill. The  5 and 1 O percent reductions based on ending  stocks would remain in place. However, we re peal the additional 1 o percent competitiveness  reduction.  While  I do not claim that this will solve all  of the problems facing our agricultural produc ers,  it will continue  the dialog that we must  have to try to maintain the network of family  October 9, 1991  farms which support our rural cities and towns.  I am hopeful that my colleagues will take an  active interest in this debate and look forward  to addressing this issue as we look for ways  to shore up  the slumping agricultural economy. As Senate Minority Leader Boe DOLE indicated in a letter to President Bush recently,  ""the agricultural economy now could best be  described as a house of cards.""  We cannot afford  to  ignore  the  financial  health of America's farmers and ranchers.  If  we do, I am not certain that we are ready to  pay the price involved to consumers and rural   communities.  INTRODUCTION OF THE WOMEN'S  ECONOMIC EQUITY ACT  HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON  OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 9, 1991  ",1991
401,House,102,0.79,887,18,Mr. HANCOCK.," Mr. Speaker, it has  been 1 year since the much-trumpeted  budget summit of 1990. And what a year  it has been-a year of nothing but bad  economic news.  The Heritage Foundation has docu mented this bad news in a new study and it is grim. Two million more Amer icans are out of work, the deficit has  soared to more than $350 billion, per sonal and business bankruptcies are at  all-time highs, family incomes are fall ing, and the rate of personal savings is  approaching an all-time low.  How can we call ourselves represent atives when we allow this mayhem to  continue? This recession is not due to  forces beyond our control-it is a di rect result of the Government's mas sive interference in the economy and a  Congress that wants to place blame on  the administration rather than correct  the problem.  It's time to change course. It's time  to cut taxes. It is time to reduce bur densome regulations, to cut pork bar rel spending, to stop bouncing checks our's and the Nation's. It's time to get  out of the way and let the American  economy grow.

402,House,102,0.315,887,18,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr.  Speaker.  I  rise  today in a continuing effort to promote  awareness of breast cancer, one of the  most urgent health  issues currently  facing the women of our Na ti on.  October  has  been  designated  as  ""Breast Cancer Awareness Month.""  Over 3,000 constituents in my congres sional district have contacted me re garding  breast  cancer. Women  and  their families are frightened by newly  released  statistics which  state  that  44,000 women will die from breast can cer this year. It is obvious to me that  people are demanding action to address  this issue.  I have continued to expand my own  awareness on this issue through meet ings with several women's groups. The  statistics hit home for me during one  meeting when I realized that one out of  the nine women I was speaking with  would be diagnosed with breast cancer  during her lifetime.  One  of  the most  important  steps  which we can take as a Nation is to  promote prevention. According to the  National Cancer Institute, breast can cer deaths could be reduced by 30 per cent if all women underwent regular  mammographies. As an Ohio State sen ator, I worked as an advocate for pro posals to expand insurance coverage for  screening mammographies.  In my role as vice chair of the Bipar tisan Congressional Caucus  for Na tional Health Care Reform, I am glad  to  continue  to  promote  improved  health care for women. My wife, Caro lyn,  is also committed  to  this issue,  traveling  throughout Ohio's Seventh  Congressional  District  to  promote  early detection of breast cancer. It is  vital  that we  continue  to work  to gether  to educate women and  their  families on  the early detection and  treatment of breast cancer.  D 1020  SUPPORT PAY-AS-YOU-GO PLAN  FOR RTC FUNDING  (Mr. SLATTERY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1991
403,House,102,-0.099,887,18,Mr. SLATTERY.," Mr. Speaker, eco nomic growth has averaged 1.6 percent  under the Bush administration. This is  the worst economic growth record in  over 40 years. Real disposable per-cap i ta income is now lower than when this  administration took office.  These measures of economic stagna tion are a direct result of the immoral  10-year policy of deficit spending pur sued by the last  two administrations  that has resulted in the tripling of our  Nation's debt.  On Tuesday  the Financial  Ins ti tu tions Subcommittee approved legisla tion that would require that $60 billion  in RTC funding be paid for up front on  a pay-as-you-go basis. That is $60 bil lion that should be paid, not billed to  our children and grandchildren.  This legislation is an important first  step in leveling with the taxpayers. I  urge my colleagues to support this plan  and require the President and the Con gress to work out a pay-as-you-go plan  for the RTC funding.  This approach will save our children  and grandchildren more than $125 bil lion.

405,House,102,0.276,900,18,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Chairman, it has  been a source of great disappointment  to me that as we have watched the sale  of many of our major assets-Columbia  Pictures, MCA,  and  now,  possibly,  Time Warner  to  Japanese  interests  that no public action has been taken  on the part of the Justice Department  or the Federal Trade Commission,  to  even question  the antitrust  implica tions of these actions.  Therefore,  I am not surprised that  Chairman BROOKS  and Congressman  HYDE-two of the most respected of the  constitutionalists in Washington-feel  so strongly that certain provisions of  Sherman  Antitrust  need  to  be  reasserted by the Congress in this leg islation.  The very existence of strong anti trust legislation going back to the turn  of  the century speaks  to  the never  changing  temptation of producers  to  control their markets. At the time of  the original Sherman Antitrust,  the  action grew out of practices developed  through our own industries.  Now, however,  in  the U.S. market place-which  is  growing  ever more  international-this action is necessary  to counter foreign marketing practices  which in many instances are not illegal  in other nations. The  nation most  noted for vertically integrated corpora tions is Japan. Its keiretsu system of fers classic examples of not only verti cal  integration,  but  in many  in stances-horizontal integration.  [Mr. HYDE]  It is fine for Japan. It, seemingly, has  worked very well for Japanese business  interests, but--the Japanese consumer  has been notoriously shortchanged in  the process.  I think it appropriate-and timely to reassert U.S. law and practices with  this new legislation. It is impressive to  me that attorneys general of 48 States  support this law. These are the people  who are on the front line. These are the  officials charged with upholding  the  Federal law in the States, in absence of  appropriate Federal action and,  it is  obvious, that they are asking for our  help.  Let's give it to them today. Let us  pass H.R. 1470.  ",1991
406,,102,-0.321,913,18,Mr. SYNAR.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the Campbell amendment.  If I could just take a minute on an  aside,  for all  those people watching  this debate on the floor today, particu larly those  law students who will be  taking the bar in  the  immediate fu ture, or  those students who may be  taking courses  in  this area,  let me  strongly suggest as  they write  their  answers to questions in this area that  they be very careful  that when  they  are debating that issue such as this, a  per se violation in price fixing, with re spect to section 1 of the Sherman Act,  that  they  do  not  use  references  throughout their answers with respect  to the Clayton Act, which is section 7,  because we have not really been talk ing about the same thing as we have  been watching the debate.  But for those of us and for those of us  who have a responsibility to try to put  this in terms where the nonlawyer citi zen can understand it, let me say that  what you have been listening to here  the last couple of minutes is basically  a theory on proposed market power and  whether or not the market-power de fense to price fixing can be deterred by  ""the market power  that one has on  that impact.""  Now, call me crazy, call me a con servative, but I always believed that  price competition leads  to price cut ting, and, therefore, that leads to lower  prices.  I agree with the last 75 years of the  Supreme Court which have reaffirmed  time and time again that price fixing is  price fixing, and that is illegal.  Some of my colleagues are going to  argue today that some price fixing can  be a heal thy  thing for  the economy  and,  therefore, should be  judged with  lax rules. Well, if you follow that logic,  then price fixing is beneficial, because  it brings higher prices. And how in the  heck can that be better for consumers?  I reject that argument. I  think my  colleagues will reject that argument as  they did last year.  Now, what is wrong with this mar ket-power  test  that  the  gentleman  from California brings us today? Well,  first of all, no one even knows what  this test is. This amendment does not  tell us.  Combined with  the existing prece dent, this amendment could pave a way  for companies like Exxon, Sony, GE,  Du Pont, Philip Morris, and literally  half the Fortune 500 could make claims  that  they  lack  the market power  in  many markets in which they operate.  Since the gentleman from California  will not listen to the Supreme Court,  since he will not listen to the Justice  Department, maybe he will  listen  to  Judge Robert Bork, who often led the  fight for conservatives on the issue of  antitrust issues. And he has rejected  the market-power test as too extreme.  As he put it:  If small parties were allowed to prove lack  of market power, all parties would have the  right, thus introducing the enormous com plexity of market definition into every price fixing case.  To my colleagues on  the floor and  who will be coming over shortly for  this vote, the centerpiece of this legis lation is the affirmation of the per se  rule. The Campbell amendment would,  in effect, say that price fixing is only  per se when there is market power. Not  even the Supreme Court of the United  States takes this extreme position.  This amendment is worse than cur rent  law, and I ask for  it to be de feated.  ",1991

The 19 members  of the team are a source of great pride to my  district.  In the words of Christopher Jones, a  staff writer for the Courier-Post newspaper:  BROOKLAWN IS NATIONAL CHAMPION  (By Christopher Jones)  BOYERTOWN, PA.-It took 40 years but Joe  Barth Sr. and his Brooklawn baseball team  finally won its first American Legion base ball national championship.  Brooklawn scored four runs in the sixth in ning to ease a 3--0 deficit, and Scott Lavender  hurled 6% innings of two-hit relief en route  to a 5-3 win over Newark, Ohio in the Amer ican Legion World Series final Sunday night  at Bear Stadium.  ""This is the greatest feeling in the world,''  said coach Joe Barth, Jr. ""I'm just so happy  for my dad. I didn't think this would ever  happen. My dad has put so much time and so  much money into this team, but it has been  worth it.""  ""This makes up for 40 years of hardship,""  said Barth Sr.  Brooklawn, 54-10-2  and  the New  Jersey  Champion, started  the game-winning rally  when Mike Harris reached base to lead off  the sixth after getting hit by a pitch.  After Mike Morarity  flew  out, Kevin  Cunane  (2-for-3) walked and Lavender was  hit by a pitch to load the bases. John Mader  followed with a bloop single to score Harris,  cutting the deficit to 3-1.  When Brett Laxton walked to force  in a  run, Newark pitcher Troy Hupp was lifted by  Manager Dave Froelich, who opted to bring  in reliever Brad Hostetter.  .  Hostetter walked Jeff Manuolato to score  Lavender,  the winning  pitcher, with  the  tying run before Derek Forchie walked  to  force the winning run.  Brooklawn added an insurance run in the  seventh when Moriarity, who led off the in ning with a single, scored on an error.  ",1991

410,,102,0.276,1004,18,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker, distinguished  colleagues,  I would  like  to take  this  time  to  celebrate with  the  Italian community Chris topher Columbus' brave trips of exploration to  the New World. The voyage Columbus made  with his small crew in 1492 would change the  path of history the world would take.  After  finally persuading  the Spanish King  and Queen, Ferdinand and  Isabella,  to  fund  his expedition, Columbus acquired  the ships  Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria,  thus setting  forth to seek fortune in the unexplored regions  of the world. Their  fourth, and  final  journey,  would last over a grueling 30 days and 4,500  miles with only  the stars and experience  to  guide  them. His courageous voyage would  help  to map  the world during a  time when  many still believed it to be flat.  Columbus' drive and commitment to his ex pedition led him to discover a New World. Not  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  only did he find a land filled with treasures, but  what he found was even more priceless. This  New World Columbus  found soon would be  colonized to become our Nation, a nation built  on the visions of undaunted persistence and  independence,  that  Columbus  fought  to  achieve almost 500 years ago.  Today, as we celebrate Columbus' coura geous spirit, we remember  it was  this same  courage  that  led our  forefathers  to come  to  settle our Nation. The Old World soon turned  to the New World for wealth.  It is this same  entrepreneurial spirit that the American small  businessman and investor still possess.  In Maryland, the Italian-American community  has maintained its ethnic heritage and remem bers with pride the voyage of Christopher Co lumbus. His name will always be synonymous  with exploration and the New World.  It  is duly appropriate  that Baltimore's new  Biotechnology Research Center is to be called  the Christopher Columbus Center. Reflecting  the name of the greatest adventurer in Italian  history, and reminding us that those who work  there are today's heroes and explorers.  It is on this day that the Italian-Americans of  our country are called to remember with pride  the contributions of Christopher Columbus to  the world, both ""Old"" and ""New.""

I also wish to extend my heartfelt con gratulations  to Notre Dame Academy on  its  being chosen by the U.S. Department of Edu cation as one of the  recipients of the 1991  Blue Ribbon Awards  for excellence  in edu cation.  Established in 1949, this college-preparatory  Catholic high school  for girls has provided a  positive, challenging, and interactive environ ment for young women with varied ethnic, so cial, and economic backgrounds. Notre Dame  Academy was 1 of only 53 private schools in  the country and the only school chosen in Los  Angeles by the Department of Education ac cording to their rigorous requirements for the  Blue Ribbon Award.  The Blue Ribbon Award schools are evalu ated on such factors as use of an up-to-date  and rigorous core curriculum and instruction,  maintenance of a safe, orderly, and drug-free  climate  for students, and encouragement of  strong parent and community support.  It  is  clear that Notre Dame Academy has excelled  in all of these areas, and many others as well.  Notre Dame Academy has a  full and bal anced program of student activities beyond  the world of academics. These include a pop ular and successful sports program, a campus  ministry group, various volunteer service orga nizations, and several traditional activities, all  of which serve to broaden the experiences of  the young women attending the academy.

Manuel Avila,  the pastor of  the Springfield  Baptist Church,  in Springfield Township, PA.  Reverend Avila has announced that he will re tire from his pastoral duties on November 15,  1991, after 34 years of service  to his con gregation.  During his tenure with the Baptist Church of  Springfield  the membership has grown  from  less than 200 to well over 550, and several  young people have gone to the seminary for  a  life of Christian vocations. Reverend Avila  has led seven work parties to Central America  to assist in the building of churches in those  countries.  Reverend Avila has become well known na tionally too. He has served as the president of  the Regional Baptist Churches of Pennsylva nia and Delaware. He is also serving his sec ond term as the moderator of the county-wide  Riverside Baptist Association. Last year,  the  American Baptist Churches of USA recognized  him as the leader of the second highest con tribution drive in the United States.  The people  that have benefited  the most  from Reverend Avila's service have always  been his own congregation. Reverend Avila  visited over 900 parishioners  last year. He  served 3 weeks a year as the Chaplain of the  Week, at Taylor Hospital and provides scores  of counseling and emergency calls for those  people in need.  Mr. Speaker and  fellow colleagues, Rev.  Manuel Avila has served the congregation of  the Springfield Baptist Church with a strong  commitment to excellence. He provides inspi ration not only to those living in his parish, but  to  those across  the country who share his  faith and values. We will surely miss the serv ice  that he provides, but his service and  record will be an  inspiration  for all to  follow.  Please  join me  in congratulating Reverend  Avila on the announcement of his retirement  from the Springfield Baptist Church in Penn sylvania.

414,House,102,0.591,1017,18,Mr. HEFLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  2436, a bill  to expand Fort Necessity  National Battlefield. This bill would  make an approximately 200-acre addi tion  to  the existing historic site  in  southwestern Pennsylvania.  sub committee Chairman VENTO  has de scribed, this battlefield protects a site  which was  very  important  in  the  French and Indian War.  The bill before Members  today  is  based on  the park's general manage ment plan which  called  for  limited  park  expansion. Unfortunately,  that  plan was seriously flawed in several re spects. First, it contained almost no  mention of Dunbar's Camp which the  subcommittee  heard  likely  contains  valuable archeological resources. Due  to this lack of information, the bill be fore us is undesirably vague as to pro posed park boundaries needed to pro tect these resources. Second, the park  plan proposed a new boundary based on  a viewshed analysis which unrealisti cally assumed clearcutting of all lands  in the vicinity, including existing Na tional Park Service  lands. For  that  reason, the bill before us includes more  lands  than are necessary  to protect  this site.  I do not object to the bill because I  know that the bill's author, Mr. MUR PHY, has worked very closely with the  affected private landowners to ensure  that developed portions of their lands  were excluded and that their interests  were protected to the maximum extent  possible. Similarly,  I want  to  thank  the subcommittee chairman for modi fications to this bill which place appro priate limitations on potential acquisi tion of interests in lands outside the  park boundary.  While  the  administration  initially  recommended deferral on this measure  until after a land acquisition cost esti mate had been developed, it is my un derstanding that such information has  now been forwarded to the committee.  For these reasons, I recommend other  Members  join me  in supporting  this  measure.  ",1991
415,Senate,102,0.361,1108,18,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. President,  In my  short tenure as a Member of the U.S.  Senate,  I  have never  experienced a  week such as this last one. I am not  sure even the so-called old timers have  ever witnessed such a week.  I would  say all of us have run the full scale of  our emotional ladder.  Those of us who do not serve on the  Judiciary Committee  have watched  every minute of the proceedings since  last Friday. We have  recorded  those  proceedings on our home VCR's, took  notes, watched  faces,  and  agonized  with the members of the committee.  I want the RECORD  to show how ap preciative  this Senator is of Senator  JOE BIDEN, chairman of the Judiciary  Committee. No chairman in my short  tenure as a Member of the U.S. Senate  has worked in a more charged atmos phere than his committee did in a situ ation created by unknown forces; and  he was remarkable  in his fairness.  I  commend him and thank him.  I think all would agree that the de bate on whether Judge Clarence Thom as should or should not be confirmed to  the highest Court in this country had  been center<>d around rights prior  to  this weekend. That should not come as  a surprise to anyone in this body or  any American. We deal with rights ev eryday on every piece of legislation.  Rights-personal, property and human  rights-are the very heart of the Con stitution.  Sensitive to rights? You bet we are,  or this Senator is. Does it concern me  when voting on a person nominated to  the  Supreme Court  of  the United  States? Even more so.  That is why it is important to point  out that as confusing and terrible as  the hearings this weekend were, some  good has come.  As many have said already, a height ened awareness and discussion of sex ual harassment  in  this country  is a  good thing.  But it is also a good thing that after  what  he  has  gone  through,  Judge  Thomas,  if confirmed, will be  even  more sensitive than before to people's  rights.  Let me be clear. Prior to the hear ings this weekend, I supported Judge  Thomas because I believed he under stands the truest meaning of rights.  The belief was reaffirmed for me and  for  the  judge  himself  through  the  course of the allegations against him  and the hearings that followed. He said  himself when  asked what  he  has  learned through this experience:  The other thing that I have learned in this  process are things that we discussed in the  real confirmation hearing, and that is our  rights being protected, what rights we have  as citizens of this country, what constitu tional rights, what is our relationship with  our government. And as I sit here on matters  such as privacy, matters such as procedures  for charges against individuals in a criminal  context or a civil context, this has height ened my awareness of  the  importance of  those protections,  the importance of some thing that we discussed in theory-privacy,  due process, equal protection, fairness.  Judge Thomas clearly understands  the importance of these values now.  And so in fairness to the judge, and  under  the  context of constitutional  rights, I will continue to support him.  This weekend was  an emotionally  charge one, but we must  remember  that in this country a person is inno cent until proven guilty. That is para mount  in  our  judicial  system.  To  change it is to destroy the very founda tion of our society.  In my mind, Judge Thomas has not  been proven guilty. When the hearings  began, the presumption was with Judge  Thomas because he was the accused,  and the presumption remains with him  today because the hearings were incon clusive in my mind and to many Amer icans.  There is nothing in Judge Thomas's  character to indicate that he would be have in the manner described or to in dicate that he is insensitive to women  in the workplace. To the contrary, he  had dozens of women with whom he has  worked coming forward  to praise his  treatment of them.

416,,102,0.411,1160,18,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, this week,  the House will finally take up the anticrime bill.  It's about time. I am concerned, however, that  H.R. 3371 as reported will do little to stem the  tide of crime and insure justice.  Several weeks ago,  I met with  the San  Diego Police Department,  the San Diego  County Sheriff's Department, and  the San  Diego County District Attorney's Office. The  men and women who are in the frontlines of  the war on crime realize that H.R. 3371 will  not  take  the needed steps  to address  the  problem of crime in the streets.  Mr. Speaker,  the San Diego District Attor ney, Edwin L. Miller, Jr., has set out his con cerns to me in a recent letter. I am including  his letter in the RECORD, because I think it is  important that we in Washington not lose sight  of what is going on in our districts in the war  on crime.  I commend Mr. Miller's  letter  to my col leagues. He presents clear and concise argu ments against the so-called Fairness in Death  Sentencing Act. As he puts  it,  the measure  should be renamed the Criminal Defense's At torney's and Statisticians' Full Employment Act  of 1991. He endorses needed reforms of the  habeas corpus system and the exclusionary  rule.  Mr. Speaker, in the debate on anticrime leg islation, let us not lose sight of the goal. We  must enact anticrime  legislation which helps   This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

The Wood County Council on Alcohol and  Drug Abuse,  in conjunction with the office of  Bowling Green Mayor Ed Miller and a coalition  of concerned citizens,  is participating  in Red  Ribbon Week, an opportunity  to spread  the  word  about  creating  a drug-free America.  Through well organized activities and events,  Wood Countians will proclaim,  ""good neigh bors get involved.""  I can think of no better message  to send  when  it comes  to drug abuse prevention.  I  have often said that the best way to stop alco hol and drug abuse  is  through education.  When all of our children get  the message  about the evil of drugs, America's future will  be safer.  President Bush uses  the  term  ""points of  light"" to describe citizens who volunteer their  time and energy  for a valiant cause. As  it  makes its contribution to a drug-free America,  I would say that Wood County will be shining  bright from October 19 through 26.

Roger Herndon was a cadet in his senior  year at  the U.S. Military Academy at West  Point, NY. He was working toward a degree in  aerospace engineering and was enrolled in a  summer flight training program at the time of  the accident. His flight instructor also perished  in the crash.  I had the distinct honor of nominating Roger  to  the Academy. He was a bright and  intel ligent young man. He was the valedictorian of  the 1988 graduating class of Calloway County  High School, where he had been active in the  school's ROTC program.  He is survived by his parents, Mr. and Mrs.  Woody  Herndon,  Jr.,  his  sister, Melissa  Graves, and his grandparents, Mr. and Mrs.  Clarence Woodrow Herndon, Sr. and Mrs. Vir gil Grogan, all of Murray.  My wife Carol  joins me  in extending our  sympathy  to  the  family of  this exceptional  young man, Roger Allan Herndon.  LEGISLATION CONCERNING YUGO SLAVIA: IT'S TIME TO STOP THE  FIGHTING  HON.

Glen McAdoo, with whom I was privileged to  serve for 2 years before I was elected to Con gress, will be  retiring on November 11  be cause of a major job relocation. Although we  don't always agree on every  issue, nobody  can doubt Glen's commitment to the commu nity.  Glen has been deeply involved in civic af fairs for years, as a community activist, a plan ning commission member and for the past 7  years as a city council member, despite the  heavy demands placed on his time by his ca reer with Coca-Cola USA.

420,Senate,102,0.1,1264,18,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, I find my self in a somewhat unique position. I  have the pleasure of serving with the  Senator from Ohio on the Armed Serv ices Committee and the Governmental  Affairs Committee. When I was a mem ber of the Intelligence Oversight Com mittee, I had the privilege of serving  with him on that as well. I usually find  myself in agreement with him. I regret  to say that today I do not.  First, I would suggest to the Senator  from Ohio he is absolutely right. This  is not about  leaks. There  is,  in my  judgment, no  suggestion or substan tiation of the fact that any confirma tion proceedings for any of the deputies  that have  been  designated  in  this  amendment would lead to leaks coming  out of the Intelligence Committee.  Senator BOREN-Chairman BOREN myself, Senator MURKOWSKI, and others  have worked during  recent years  to  adopt procedures which I believe have  stemmed the possibility of leaks com ing out of that committee. We have  done a very good job, so this is not a  matter of whether we would enhance  the possibility of leaks coming out of  the Intelligence Committee.  It does have to do with the question  of balance of power.  I do not  think  there is any question about that. Mr.  President, when I first came to Con gress, we  talked a great deal at that  time about balance of power, checks  and balances.  We have a Government of checks and  balances.

423,House,102,-0.215,1329,18,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, for pur poses of debate only, I yield 3 minutes  to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Washington [Mrs. UNSOELD].  UNSOELD. Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  distinguished  gentleman  from South Carolina for yielding time  tome.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  rule and of the Volkmer amendment.  There is no question, Mr. Speaker, we  have a serious crime problem. Banning  certain  types of guns, however, not  only will not solve that problem, but  restricting civilian access  to certain  firearms might actually  impede our  own police officers' ability  to  fight  crime.  Our domestic firearms manufacturers  invest millions of dollars into research  and development for example to create  accurate weapons that have the lowest  potential to harm innocent bystanders.  Olympic Firearms developed a special  Mrs.  AR-15 which uses  .11  caliber bullets  that will not penetrate walls, thus pro tecting individuals in adjacent rooms  during a drug raid. The innocent de serve the best protection our American  ingenuity  can  provide. Without  a  healthy  domestic market,  Olympic  Firearms would not have had the cap ital to make that investment.  Does this House really want to make  our military and law enforcement de pendent upon foreign manufacturers?  Ultimately, to curb the scourge of vi olence, we will have  to address  the  breakdown of the American family, our  value system, and how we educate our  young. We must fight crime by rec ognizing that our society has under gone  profound  economic  and  demo graphic change, and that our social and  educational  institutions haven't kept  pace. Unless we act swiftly, we jeopard ize America's place as a free and pros perous society and condemn much of a  new generation to lives of poverty, de spair, and violence.  In this year that we celebrate  the  200th anniversary of the signing of the  Bill of Rights, let us not dismiss this  Nation's freedoms, including the right  of law abiding citizens to keep and bear  firearms.  If we weaken one  of  the  amendments, the whole package is in  jeopardy. Passing feel-good legislation  at the expense of our Bill of Rights is  not something I can do--even in the  name of fighting crime.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the  rule and Mr. VOLKMER'S amendment.  ",1991
424,House,102,0.312,1342,18,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield my self 2 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to explain  again what full and fair means so we  get this clear. It seems to me one of  the pro bl ems with habeas corpus, if we  want  to make  it work,  is  to avoid  relitigating the same questions again  and again and ag~in.  Now, how do we do  that? Well, how  we do it is to give deference to the Fed eral courts to do what the State courts  have done  if  the State courts-and  those are the trial court, the appellate  court, and the State supreme court- have dealt with the law, with the facts,  and with procedure in a full and a fair  way. So if the State courts have han dled it properly, fully and fairly, then  the Federal court, when it moves over  on Federal habeas, gives deference to  courts' rulings rather than relitigating  them.  The people who oppose full and fair  want to relitigate the issues again and  again and again. That is wrong. That is  not reform. The Federal court looks at  full and fair. The Federal court makes  the determination whether  the State  court has fully and fairly dealt with  the law, the facts, and the procedure,  so they do not emasculate Federal ha beas corpus, but  they  let  the State  courts have credit for what they have  done fairly and fully. That is sensible  reform of habeas corpus. If you eschew  that and you want to relitigate those  issues, you may do so, but do not go  home and say you are for reform of the  criminal process; you are helping the  criminals, not the victims.  ",1991
425,House,102,-0.487,1342,18,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the passage of the 1991 omni bus crime bill.  We have a crisis in this country and  we have an opportunity today to solve  this problem.  H.R. 3371 is a tough anticrime bill. It  provides for increased penalties for the  use of a  firearm  in commission of a  drug-related crime, and tougher, fairer,  and more  timely  sentencing  proce dures.  The bill also authorizes funds for a  variety of crime prevention programs  at the State and local levels. The bill  further  seeks  increased oversight of  our police forces to stop patterns of un constitutional conduct or police bru tality. Make no mistake, it is tough.  The crime bill includes sections deal ing with  crimes  committed against  children, and doubles the penalties for  recurring sex offenders.  One of the provisions of the 1991 om nibus crime bill that is especially im portant to me and to the people I rep resent is the section relating to crimi nal street gang activity. I worked very  closely with Congressman MEL LEVINE  and Chairman CHARLES SCHUMER of the  Judiciary Committee to come up with  In  a bill that will send a clear message to  criminal street gang members: ""You do  the crime, you'll do the time!"" We have  to show these young people that crimi nal gang activity leads to one of two  places, either you end up in jail or you  end up in the morgue.  Ea.ch year more and more lives are  being lost in gang warfare. Even more  tragic are the many innocent lives sac rificed in this no-win si tua.tion. Every  day I pick up the paper or read a letter  from one of my constituents, detailing  the death of another bystander caught  in the crossfire between gangs. So far  this year, in Los Angeles County, there  have been over 840 drive-by shootings  according  to  the Los Angeles Police  Department.  Just in the past month, in my dis trict in California, a schoolbus was ri fled with bullets from a drive-by shoot ing and two girls inside the bus were  injured.  other  gang-related  shootings, 12-year-old Ricardo Escobar  died while  riding his bike near his  home after being shot in the head by a  gang member with an assault rifle, and  13-year-old Marco Velasquez was killed  after being shot in the back while try ing to run away from gang members.  In June of this year another con stituent of mine, 19-year-old Army Pvt.  Cesar Gardea, who had just come home  from serving his country in the Persian  Gulf, was  killed  in  a  gang-related,  drive-by shooting. He was shot at his  own homecoming party. It was his first  night home, and his last night home.  Cesar survived a foreign war, but was  killed by the one here, on  the home  front.  Mr. Chairman, gang violence is not  limited to California or New York. You  can pick up any paper and read a.bout  gang-related crimes in your own state.  The University of Chicago concluded  that criminal youth gangs are found in  almost all 50 states, including Alaska  and Hawaii, and in the District of Co lumbia and Puerto Rico. Two of the  more powerful street gangs, the Crips  and Bloods, have spread gang life and  violence to other parts of the country  in search of fresh drug trafficking mar kets.  Gangs have turned our neighborhoods  and streets into war zones. Before the  gulf war, the U.S. Army would send its  surgeons and medical teams to train in  hospital emergency rooms in Los Ange les, because there the doctors could get  24-hour-a-day experience  treating  the  kind of gunshot wounds normally seen  only in battle.  The streets of America shoilld not  have to be the training ground for com bat doctors. I am tired, and so are my  constituents, of these killings. Private  Gardea, Ricardo Escobar, and Marco  Velasquez all had meaningful lives, but  died meaningless deaths.  I know law enforcement is not the  complete  answer  in detering  crime,  that is why the passage of this crime  ",1991
426,House,102,-0.658,1394,18,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in  strong  support  of  the  Staggers  amendment. It would substitute life in  prison without possibility of release for  the death penalties included in the b111.  I support this substitute amendment,  and strongly oppose the death penalty  provisions  included in  the bill. Once  again, it looks like we are playing the  game of who can be tougher. How many  death penalty offenses can we dream up  so  that our death penalty  is bigger  than their death penalty.  Many of  these offenses will never  happen-attempting  to  kidnap  the  President, assassination of a Supreme  Court  Justice. Others,  however,  are  more  troubling. The bill includes the  death penalty for drive-by shootings. I  cannot imagine a Federal  interest in  these  shootings,  except  to make us  look tougher than the other guys.  Drug kingpins? There doesn't even  have to be a body, let alone a direct  connection to a homicide. This provi sion ts counterproductive. It w111 tie up  cases  for  years  on  constitutional  grounds and will block the extradi tton  of criminals to stand trial here. And as  anyone watching  the Noriega  trial  knows, drug kingpins don't get tough  sentences-they get witness  fees and  protection in exchange for testimony.  In short, Mr. Chairman, these death  penalty provisions have no place  in  this bill. By  including  them we are  playing  politics with  crime  tn  the  worst way.  Let me just make clear what all of us  already know about the death penalty.  The death penalty does not deter  crime. Anyone who argues that those  involved in drive-by shootings would be  dissuaded by the death penalty ignores  the constant threat of death and vio lence  that  these  people  live  under  every day.  The death penalty ts imposed in an  arbitrary manner, dependent on  the  prosecutor and frequently with racial  disparity.  It does not allow for error.  It is expensive and time consuming.  There are not rational arguments in  favor of the death penalty.  In sum,  the death penalty is unac ceptable in a civilized society. I urge  my colleagues to reject the death pen alty provisions in this b111 and to sup port the Staggers amendment.  0 1710  ",1991
427,House,102,-0.564,1394,18,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  today  in  strong support of the amendment offered by  the gentleman from West Virginia. In my more  than 25 years of public service as a district at torney, city councilman, and Member of Con gress  I have witnessed,  firsthand,  the dev astating spread of crime.  I understand  the  need  to deal aggressively with crime, and  I  understand the need to provide tough law en forcement protection.  The death penalty, however, is not the an swer. It does nothing to reduce crime; what it  does do,  is enable  its supporters  to sound  tough on crime while avoiding action on  the  causes of crime. If we are serious about re ducing crime,  then we must address the varied social and economic problems that are at  its root. By supporting  the Staggers amend ment we can act  tough while still showing  compassion and  respect  for  the dignity of  human life.  At a time when  the United States stands  near1y alone in the Western World in its use  of the death penalty, I am amazed that our de bate  is not over the elimination of the death  penalty, but  rather over  its expansion. H.R.  3371 would expand the death penalty  to 50  additional offenses. Do any of my colleagues  really believe that by expanding the number of  offenses punishable by death, crime will be re duced? By focusing so intensely on the death  penalty, our attention is diverted from the im portant issues which we must address.  The  Staggers  amendment  replaces  the  death penalty with a mandatory life sentence  without parole.  In addition,  it provides  for fi nancial  restitution  for the families of  the vic tims. This amendment is tough on criminals. It  allows us to put aside the death penalty rhet oric and show our respect  for the dignity of  human life.  Mr. Chairman,  it  is my strong belief  that  there is no place for capital punishment in a  democratic society.  I urge my colleagues  to  show respect for human  life and support the  Staggers amendment.  The CHAffiMAN.

We are  talking about people from all walks of  life.  Mr. Chairman, I met on Monday with  three such people. They had worked  about 90 years among the three in re tail sales, and one as an engineer. They  had  things  like  this  to say: ""I have  worked all my life,"" one said. ""When it  comes time to take back a little, there  is nothing there for me.""  Another said, ""When out of work, it  is not a recession, it is a depression.""  One of them, an engineer in his six ties, has been looking everywhere for  work. All he has been offered is to wash  windows. An engineer. He would do  that, if he could.  This step is long overdue. The delay  has been a disgrace. Talk about unfair ness, the greatest unfairness is to say  no to people out of work through no  fault of their own, saying let them eat  crumbs.  Mr. Chairman, let us pass this bill.  ",1991
433,House,102,-0.328,24,22,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Chairman, let me  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3575, the benefits  provided are very important to the peo ple of our Nation. For the people of  Maryland our unemployment rate is 50  percent higher than it was before this  recession. Over 40,000  people  in my  State have exhausted their State un employment benefits who will benefit  now  from H.R. 3575 by 13 additional  weeks of unemployment compensation.  Furthermore,  the  provisions  for  reachback to March 1 will apply to the  people of Maryland. It is not only im portant for the people who are unem ployed, who have been the hardest hit  by the recession, but for our economy  to get badly needed  funds  into our  economy.  Mr. Chairman, I am not happy with  the funding mechanism. There is $8 bil lion in a trust fund that I think should  be used during a  recessionary time. I  think we have added some additional  complications for U.S.  taxpayers. But  it is important to point out that this  bill will provide badly needed benefits.  Mr. Chairman,  this  is a  temporary  bill. The gentleman  from New York  [Mr. DOWNEY] pointed out on several  occasions this bill expires on July 4,  1992. We needed to look at a permanent  bill that provides relief during a reces sionary time with funds collected while  we have a rosy economy.

The  last great bill  that  ad dressed banking, and securities and in surance was the Glass-Steagall bill in  the 1930's. Much has happened  and  much has changed since the 1930's. This  was the year that we decided that, yes,  we needed comprehensive bank reform.  We  have had many, many  studies  that were brought before the Commit tee on Banking, Finance and Urban Af fairs and to this Congress as to why we  need  reform. We  tried valiantly, we  tried hard, for a comprehensive bank ing bill. Unfortunately it did not pass.  We  have  a  very  different  opinion  among Members of this Congress as to  what comprehensive bank reform is all  about.  0 1740  I am not dismayed that in 1 year we  were not able to accomplish something  that we tried to accomplish in, say, the  last 20 years. I am not dismayed at all.  But I think we have made a valiant at tempt. But let us not give up at this  point. Let us not take something that  is second best over something that is  the best we can get.  Mr. Chairman,  I say to my friends  that the Wylie en bloc amendment is  not the answer to our problems. There  is an answer out there. I feel that we  have the ability to work together and  accomplish  that goal of working  to gether and coming up with comprehen sive bank reform which will be modern  bank reform. I am not willing to sac rifice  something  that  is  less better  than what we can get.  Yes, I think we have come a long way  in  this debate we  have heard both  sides.  I  think we are better prepared  today  than ever before  to come  to gether. One  of our great Presidents  said, ""Let us reason together."" I think  we have laid the foundation for us to  come  together  and work. But  this  amendment tonight is not the answer,  and this is not the time to do it.  Haste does not make anything but  waste, and we are going to be wasting  the banking  industry  if we go  forth  with  this  bill  tonight.  I  urge my  friends, let us go back to the table. Let  us go back and reason  together. We  have time. Yes, we have to accommo date  the recapitalization part of  the  bill, and we have time to do it.  Mr. Chairman,  let me  say  to my  friends that there is nothing so great  as our service to the country. Even get ting out before Thanksgiving  is not  that great. Someone said we would be  here until Christmas. So be  it.

In a sense, National and Dulles Air ports have been victims of their own  success. Their main  terminals were  never intended to serve the number of  people visiting Washington today. The  ancillary facilities put into service to  cope with  the  increase  in passenger  traffic have helped, but National and  Dulles  have  become patchwork  air ports.  These two airports have always been  in a category of their own. Because  both National and Dulles began life as  federally owned and operated facilities,  the Congress has had a historical inter est  in  their well-being. That's why,  when the day-to-day operation of the  airports was turned over to local con trol in 1986, Congress created a Board  of Review to oversee the Metropolitan  Washington Airports Authority.  It's no secret that when the Airports  Authority assumed management con trol, a lot of people expected it to fall  on  its  face.  I  believe  that  the  Authority's achievements have been a  pleasant surprise to many, and its per formance has  just continued  to  im prove over time.  As part of its ongoing effort, the Air ports Authority has put  together a  comprehensive master plan  to  renew  ",1991

To be recognized as 1 of 1 0 teachers from  across the Nation in a leading publication like  this is certainly a great honor.  I know Mrs. Bleazey personally, and I would  like to commend her for her contribution to her  students, her community, and to the teaching  profession.  Good teachers serve this Nation in just as  vital a way as do members of our Armed  Forces or others who sometimes receive more  recognition.  I would like to call to the attention of my col leagues an article about Mrs. Bleazey which  was published recently in the Daily Times of  Maryville, TN.  KINDERGARTEN TEACHER GETS ""A""  (By Melanie Tucker)  In a day when home visits are virtually  nonexistent,  kindergarten  teacher  Pat  Bleazey still makes the rounds in the Lanier  Community, getting to know the families on  their grounds.  Bleazey has been an educator for the past  16 years and has made it her job to see that  she gets  to know  her  students' parents,  brothers and sisters, grandparents. She often  gets  introduced to  their pets and favorite  stuffed animals.  In the November issue of ""Better Homes  and Gardens,"" Bleazey was one of 10 teachers  across the United States included in an arti cle entitled,  ""10 Great Teachers And Why  They Get i)-'s.""  ""I like to see my students in the home en vironment and see how they relate to their  parents,"" Bleazey said. ""The line of commu nication  is opened up more on  their own  turf.""  ""Better Homes and Gardens""  contacted  Keith Geiger, president of the National Edu cation Association,  for names of  teachers  qualified to receive this recognition. Bleazey  said she was contacted last spring by  the  magazine and then recontacted and told she  would be included in the article.  Bleazey said she  is uneasy getting  this  much attention when  there are  so many  wonderful teachers that could have been in cluded. She is likewise uneasy about giving  her opinion on what a ""good teacher"" is, say ing she bases her teaching on caring for the  children.  ""You have  to care about the children,""  Bleazey said.

The Clerk read as follows:  H. RES. 201  Whereas the arts embody the soul of our  national heritage and successfully blend the  vast array of our Nation's diverse cultures  and experiences into a living representation  of our national identity;  Whereas since 1982 the Congressional High  School Art Competition has successfully dis played the art work of talented high school  students in the Capitol corridor, symbolizing  our Nation's youthful artistic energy and  passion;  Whereas  this  annual  event  focuses  the  House of Representatives' attention on  the  great reservoir of artistically-talented young  people  throughout  the United States, and  brings  together Members of Congress and  their younger constituents to share a deeper  appreciation of the importance of artistic ex pression;  Whereas this event captures the imagina tion and creativity of young Americans and  provides Members of Congress and the public  the opportunity to witness the contemporary  concerns of these young artists;  Whereas  this event symbolizes  the com bined efforts of art educators, Congressional  offices, local business, and most importantly  students and their families, in running a suc cessful art contest;  Whereas  this  competition  demonstrates  the importance of the arts in family life by  encouraging students and their families to  work together, and enabling family members  to participate in the opening ceremonies in  Washington, D.C.;  Whereas since 1982 more than 375,000 high  school students have participated  in over  2,500 locally-run competition, and for many  students this is their 1st opportunity to pub licly exhibit their work;  Whereas businesses work with Congres sional staff to enhance and promote the suc cess of local competitions, and in many cases  such businesses help to bring the winning  students with their parents to the Washing ton D.C. unveiling;  Whereas the winning art entries create a.  colorful panorama in the Capitol corridor for  Members of Congress, staff and thousands of  visitors,  illustrating our Nation's diversity  in a. building which is symbolic of our unity;  Whereas the support which students gain  through Congressional recognition and final  approval by the Architect of and Capitol and  renowned curators may encourage them, to  develop their talents and to pursue further  arts-related endeavors; and  Whereas  the Congressional Arts Caucus  highlights  the many  positive  and  edu cational aspects of the arts through the Con gressional High School Art Competition:  Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That is the sense of the House of  Representatives that the people of the Unit ed States should recognize--(1)  the  lOth anniversary of ""An Artistic  Discovery"",  the Congressional High School  Art Competition, and  (2) the success of such Competition in(A) encouraging the creative endeavors of  our Nation's young artists, and  (B)  forging strong working relationships  among  the Congress, businesses, and arts  community towards the ultimate goal of pro viding opportunities for high school students  to express their artistic talents.

444,House,102,0.398,505,22,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I  rise at this time in  support of  the conference  report  for  H.R. 2100,  the fiscal year 1992 Defense  authorization bill. In all candor, I am  delighted to do so.  Last year I opposed my own commit tee's conference  report  because  re peated abuses of the process had pre vented me from representing commit tee and House Republicans on the most  important  issues under consideration  by the conference. Had it not been for  this process problem, I could have sup ported the bill based on substance.  Our  committee's  consideration  of  H.R. 2100 over the past 11 months has  certainly not lacked controversy. We  are all coming to the realization that  dramatic decreases in defense spending  cause pain and thus, controversy. The  difference between this year and last,  however, was  in  the process used  to  construct  the bill  that  is before us  today.  As contrasted with last year,  there  actually was a discernable process this  year that was governed by discussion  and compromise. Accordingly, I would  like  to  thank Chairman ASPIN  for  working with committee Republicans  this year and allowing me to work with  the majority. Not only did it improve  the process, but I believe it also  im proved the bill. As a result, H.R. 2100 is  a consensus bill that Republicans were  able to influence and should be able to  support.  My support for the conference report  is also based on a number of outcomes  on important issues that I would like  to review briefly before yielding time  to my colleagues for their comments.  MISSILE DEFENSES  Our explicit commitment in bill lan guage  to deploy ground-based missile  defense by 1996, with a funding increase  of more than $1 billion over last year's  level, represents a watershed national  security decision. We may have finally  moved beyond a number of political  and psychological barriers in making  this decision.  It took the lessons of the war with  Iraq, Bush administration  initiatives,  and the Soviet Union's public willing ness to move beyond the increasingly  obsolescent ABM Treaty for Congress  to act. Yet we have acted decisively  and in a bipartisan manner to confront  the harsh realities and security chal lenges of the real world.  That the decision to deploy missile  defenses was  truly bipartisan  is cru cially important for  this program  to  move forward in the future. Although  funding  any major defense program  will  be  difficult  in  the budget-con strained years ahead,  it's clear  that  missile defenses have become Congress'  top defense program.  Mr. Speaker,  all  22 House Armed  Services Committee Republicans have  signed a brief policy statement on the  issue of missile defenses that I will in sert in the RECORD immediately follow ing my  remarks. We wholeheartedly  support  the  conference  outcome  on  missile defenses and will work to see  that Congress lives up to the commit ment it is making here today.  B-2  Contrary to the spin being put on the  B-2 compromise by the program's oppo nents, the B-2 is well funded at $4.3 bil lion, with $3.3 billion of the total com pletely unfenced. If people claim they  killed the B-2, then they've also got to  explain why they have agreed to spend  more than $4 billion on the coffin. A  more objective assessment is that the  conferees have agreed to consider pro curement of additional aircraft beyond  the existing 15 next year when we un derstand more about  the much pub licized radar cross section  test prob lem. The B-2 is far from dead.  CONVENTIONAL PROGRAMS  On conventional programs,  the con ferees attempted, with partial success,  to strike a balance between protecting  important  future modernization pro grams and preserving a warm produc tion base in the present. So we funded  future systems like the ATF, LH heli copter and the AX, but continued cur rent production lines such as the F-16,  AHIP and F/A-18.  In some instances, like the F-117, we  went too far. Reopening a mothballed  production  line  to build four aircraft  that the Department doesn't want and  didn't request for a cost of almost $600  million  is not smart business. If we  continue to ressurect dead programs or  to prop up dying programs, it will be come impossible to balance our prior ities in the future.  PERSONNEL MATTERS  Among  the most productive of all  conference outcomes occurred  in  the  personnel  area. HERB  BATEMAN will  provide more detail in a few minutes,  but the bottom line is that H.R. 2100  gives Secretary Cheney some of  the  tools he needs to manage the massive  ongoing DOD  build-down, while pro tecting people  and preserving  readi ness.

461,,102,-0.483,635,22,Mr. LEHMAN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, next  week we observe American Education Week.  As a  former high school  teacher, and as a  former member and chairman of  the Dade  County School Board, I have a keen apprecia tion of the fine teachers, administrators, volun teers, parents, and students who make public  education in this country work.  But there is another side to public education  that I wish to recognize today.  On  Saturday, November  23,  the Dade  County Coalition for Community Education will  gather  for  its  annual  awards  dinner. Mr.  Speaker, I know these people, and I can tell  you that I have never seen a more creative,  dedicated,  or  energetic  group  anywhere.  These people are truly ""doers.""  The idea of using public schools during non traditional times began during the Great De pression when an educator in Flint, Ml named  Frank J. Manley, with the help of wealthy in dustrialist Charles Stewart Mott, started using  public schools after school hours.  In Miami, we began using  the Flint model  during the 1960's. Now, community education  is common in school systems throughout the  country, and no wonder.  It makes a  lot of  sense to keep the schools open and  to use  them to the advantage of every citizen. What  is particularly attractive is that each of these  programs  is geared  to meet  the particular  needs and interests of the surrounding com munities.  During  the 1960's, as a member of  the  Dade County School Board, I helped to imple ment community education in our local school  system. As a member of the Education and  Labor Committee in the 1970's, I was proud to  play a role in the development of Federal leg islation which help foster the growth of com munity education programs.  Mr. Speaker, I salute the Dade County Coa lition for Community Education and the many  fine people who have made community edu cation in Dade County the success that it is.  I have every confidence that even greater suc cess is yet to come.  IN MEMORY OF CHRIS LINDBURG  HON. BUD SHUSTER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, November 18, 1991  ",1991
462,,102,0.416,635,22,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker,  in  life  there  are those rare people you come across who  make a difference  in your  life just by being  there.  One of those people was Chris Lindburg.  Chris began working for me in the fall of 1987.  32709  He worked on my staff for almost 3 years be fore cancer forced him to retire from a job he  told me so often that he loved. Chris passed  away on Friday, and he will be sorely missed  not only by me, but also by all of the people  who had the good fortune to know him.  It's difficult to put into words what was so  special about Chris. He was one of  those  unique individuals who spread cheer wherever  he went. If there was ever anyone who could  honestly be said to have a good nature, it was  Chris. Everyone who met him could not help  but like him. None of us could ever really say  why  it was we  liked him so much-it wasn't  just his smile, it wasn't just his jokes, it wasn't  just his warm nature.  It was the fact he was  Chris, and  that was all anyone needed  to  know.  One thing that sticks out about Chris is the  fact that he loved to help people. While some  dread constituent casework, Chris welcomed  it. There are countless people in the 9th Dis trict  of Pennsylvania who  benefitted  from  Chris' tireless work to resolve their problems.  Even after Chris left my office, he continued  his efforts to help others by volunteering at the  Red Cross until his condition worsened and he  had to be hospitalized.  That is what kind of person Chris was. His  life was an endless act of courage, struggling  to lead a normal life while his body conspired  against him. Chris' courage and good nature  spread to all those around him. His influence  is something that will stay with us forever.  Chris Lindburg was a strong and gracious  man who, with his passing, leaves behind his  wife Melissa, his  family,  and many, many  friends who are sad he is gone but very, very  happy he touched their lives.

REGARDING FORCED LABOR IN  CHINESE PRISONS  ",1991
465,House,102,-0.357,882,22,Mr. JONTZ.," Mr. Speaker, the hour is  late, but I rise this evening to speak  for. at least a few minutes on a subject  of concern to millions of Americans in  this country, and that is the future of  our ancient forests, particularly these  ancient forests  in  the Pacific North west.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be the  author of the Ancient Forest Protec tion Act and to be joined by 120 cospon sors, Members of this House, who share  the concern that we have about seeing  that these forests are left for the bene fit and well-being of the future genera tions as well as our own.  I  was  to  have  been  joined  this  evening by several of our colleagues to  speak in this special order about the  need to protect our ancient forests, but  the hour being late, they were unable  to attend.  Mr. Speaker,  two of my colleagues  who would have joined me this evening  are the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr.  VENTO], chairman of our Subcommittee  on National Parks and Public Lands in  the House Committee on Interior and  Insular Affairs, one of the subcommit tees with jurisdiction over this issue,  and  the gentleman  from Minnesota  [Mr. VENTO]  is the author of another  bill that would seek to protect our an cient forests. He has given this subject  a great deal of attention and has some  very thoughtful statements to make on  the subject.  Also the gentleman from Minnesota  [Mr. SIKORSKI] has taken a special in terest in the personnel in the agencies  of the Federal Government who are re sponsible for the management of these  forests, some of the problems they have  faced  because  of political  pressures  that have come from Washington.  Mr. Speaker,  let me make several  points about the great ancient forests  of our country. First of all, these for ests are extraordinarily valuable to the  American  people.  These  forests  of  course produce timber, which is part of  the reason that we have a controversy  over protecting the forests. But there  are many other values in these forests  as well.  Mr.  Speaker,  they  protect water sheds,  insuring quality water for  the  use of people in the cities and commu nities in the Pacific Northwest. They  provide wildlife habitat  for  a wide  range of species. They provide a num ber of scientific benefits to all of the  people of our country.  We have only recently become aware  of the extent to which these great for ests protect us from global warming by  serving as sinks for carbon. They also  serve very valuable purposes as con servators of biological diversity, which  is to say the diversity of life at the ge netic, the species, and community lev els.  We may  think of scientific values  like biological diversity as being extra neous, but in fact they have very im portant economic significance.  We could see  in centuries  to come  changes in climate in North America.  We may need  the genetic  resources  which now exist in these ancient for ests in order to be able to maintain in  other locations a viable forestry.  So these forests serve a variety of en vironmental, recreational, social, and  economic  values  that  are  extraor dinarily important to all the people of  our country.  Many people would say these forests  also serve an important spiritual value.  To go into one of these forests is to be  reminded of the beauty of God's cre ation, to be reminded that these living  trees have been in place there for hun dreds of years, a living link, if you will,  to the Middle Ages on our planet.  So there are many, many ways that  all the people of this country benefit  from the ancient forests in the Pacific  Northwest. At  the  same  time  that  these forests are extremely valuable,  and I would say are becoming more val uable every day, the ancient forests of  our country are also  threatened. Na tionwide of course most of the forests  of our country have been cut. Only 5  percent of  the native  forests of  the  United States from coast to coast re main.  0 2350  Mr. Speaker,  in  the Pacific North west less than 15 percent of the forests  are uncut. At one time there were some  30 million  acres  of ancient  forests  which stretched up the coast through  California into Oregon and Washington  State, and then further north into Can ada. Most of those have been cut, less  than 15 percent remain, and almost all  of what is left today that is true an cient forest is owned by us as the U.S.  citizens and taxpayers of this country.  It is Federal land under the ownership  and management of the U.S. Forest  Service or,  in some cases, under  the  Bureau of Land Management.  Many people in this country I think  believe mistakenly that, when a forest  is a national forest, that it is safe, that  it is not subject to being cut, but that  ",1991

In the Senate,  H.R. 1297 was referred to the Commerce  Committee. In an effort to spur Senate  action on H.R. 1297, I am offering this  amendment to H.R. 2130.  This deals with the problem of sew age  illegally  discharged  from  rec reational boats. Boaters need shoreside  facilities where they can properly dis pose of wastes  As my  colleagues will  recall,  the  Clean Vessel Act proposes to earmark a  portion of the money coastal States re ceive from  the sport fish restoration  account, so that they can build, ren ovate, and maintain pumpout stations  for boat toilets along their coasts.  This bill is in response to problems in  North Carolina with sewage  illegally  ",1991
470,House,102,0.443,1025,22,Mr. HASTERT.," Mr. Speaker, what  the gentleman is saying is those senior  citizens who are concerned about this  issue need to keep a close eye on Con gress  in  the next  couple  days  and  watch as  that vote  to  instruct con ferees. The parliamentary procedures  that may happen before or after are  certainly  the  votes  that  determine  whether we get this amendment,  the  Older Americans Freedom to Work Act,  on the Older Americans Act or not.

471,,102,0.091,1246,22,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing  legislation  to  reduce  the  influence of  Political Action Committees [PAC's] in Federal  elections and to restore the importance of indi viduals in campaigns.  Across  the Second District of Maine, and  across  the country,  the public has been ex pressing  their frustration with a campaign  fi nance system they see as putting special in terests in front of their own. They are demand ing, and  I hope Congress will be able to de liver, a comprehensive reform of this system.  PAC's have supplanted  individual contribu tions as  the dominant source of campaign  funds.  In 197 4 House candidates received 17  percent of  their  total  funding  from PAC's;  in  1988 that total had risen to 48 percent. During  that same time period individual contributions  declined  from 73 percent  to 46 percent.  In  order to address this trend effectively, my bill  would  reduce  the amount of money a PAC  could give a candidate from $5,000 to $1,000.  This would put the maximum PAC contribution  on par with  the maximum  individual contribu tion.  In order to encourage individuals to renew  their participation  in the political process, my  bill would provide a tax credit for contributions  up to $100 for individuals and $200 for those  filing a joint return. The tax credit applies to  contributions to House candidates running for  the seat in the district in which the individual  resides.  In order to offset the cost of this tax credit,  the bill  repeals  the alternative minimum  tax  preference granted for intangible drilling costs  for oil and. gas operations included in the Om nibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.  In  the 6 years prior to  the 1990 election,  House  incumbents raised seven  times more  from PAC's  than  the amount given  to chal lengers. Lowering  the amount of money a  PAC can contribute to a candidate should also  improve the competitiveness of House races.  To  further  reduce  the  role PAC's play  in  raising  funds,  the bill  I am  introducing today  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  prohibits bundling. Bundling is used by PAC's  to circumvent  the $5,000  limit by collecting  checks made out  to  the candidate and  for warding them under the PAC's letterhead.  This bill also prohibits leadership PAC's.  In  the 1988 election cycle, 40 Members of Con gress and  over half  the Presidential  can didates had personal PAC's.  Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution states  that the House ""* * * shall be composed of  Members chosen every second Year by  the  People of the several State,* * *"" Reforming  our campaign  finance system  to replace  the  emphasis of PAC participation with  individual  participation, will allow us to meet the original  intent of this provision.
