0,House,107,0.458,3,2002-01-24,Mr. KELLER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to announce the filing of the National Mentoring Act  legislation by myself, along with a broad group of bipartisan cosponsors. The mentor act would give tax credits to businesses that allow their employees 1 hour a week of paid time off to mentor children at risk of dropping out of school and getting involved with drugs. The reason for this bill is simple, to make it easier for mentoring organizations to recruit mentors. Why is this important? Well, there was a recent study completed of 1,000 young people on the waiting list at Big Brother-Big Sisters. The list was divided into two groups: one group got a mentor; the other group did not get a mentor. Eighteen months  later,  the children with mentors were 46 percent less likely to begin using illegal drugs, 27 percent less likely to begin using alcohol, 53 percent  less  likely to skip school, and 33 percent less likely to engage in violence. That is why this bill has been endorsed by every major mentoring organization in the United States, including Big Brothers-Big Sisters, America’s Promise, and the National Mentoring Partnership Act. I urge my colleagues today to call my office and sign up as cosponsors to this important legislation. f TREATMENT OF AFGHAN PRISONERS IN CUBA (Mr. DUNCAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2002
1,House,107,0.6,3,2002-01-24,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Speaker, I have heard and read that some people  in publications in Europe and some members of the European Union have been very critical of U.S. treatment of the Afghan prisoners in Cuba. I think they are scraping the bottom of the barrel in a vain attempt to make themselves feel superior to Americans. I wonder how they would feel or how they would respond if they had been attacked the way we were on September 11. No country on the face of the Earth, Mr. Speaker, has done as much. No nation has even come close to doing as much for other countries, as has the United States of America. These prisoners will live far better as prisoners of  the U.S. military  than they ever would have in the caves of Afghanistan. Even more importantly, Mr. Speaker, they will live far better as our prisoners than they deserve, after killing thousands of our citizens in one of the cruelest ways imaginable. f b1015 CONTINUED FAILURE OF THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS (Mr. GIBBONS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2002
2,House,107,0.484,3,2002-01-24,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker, imagine if you were participating in an Olympic event and you were winning the race and suddenly the Olympic Committee came along and changed the rules because they did not want you to win. You would be outraged. Well, yesterday the Nuclear Regulatory Commission notified Nevada of their plans to once again change the ground rules for judging Yucca Mountain. The NRC is proposing to eliminate rules governing what it calls the ‘‘unlikely event’’ of a volcanic eruption. The NRC staff believes that there is less than a 1-in-10 chance of an eruption occurring within 10,000 years. A less than 10 percent chance? What does that mean? Does the term ‘‘1-in-10’’ or ‘‘less than’’ equate to ‘‘sound science’’? There  is a better chance of Yucca Mountain exploding than there is of winning the lottery. We should ask the people of Africa. We should ask the people of Hawaii. We should ask the people of Mount Saint Helens in Oregon what they thought about that 1-in-10 chance. I continue my outrage at the entire Yucca Mountain project. But by telling Nevadans that they have a less than 1in-10  chance  that Yucca Mountain could explode is downright astonishing. The NRC should be ashamed of itself. It is time to put the safety of Nevadans and all Americans ahead of their own desire to win at any cost. f SCOTT GERMOSEN, A TRUE AMERICAN HERO (Mr. GRUCCI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2002
3,House,107,0.238,3,2002-01-24,Mr. GRUCCI.," Mr. Speaker, on January 9, America lost a true American hero, Staff Sergeant Scott Germosen. After graduating  from Centerreach High School in 1982, Scott answered the call to duty and enlisted in the Marine Corps. After serving our country, Scott and his  family moved  to California where he was exploring a career as a sheriff’s deputy. Like all of us, Scott was horrified by the attacks on America on September 11. Unfortunately, the tragedy was very close to home for Scott. Scott’s second cousin was aboard the first plane that hit the World Trade Center. Hearing this tragic news spurred Scott to re-enlist in the Marines and help defend our Nation from evil. While serving our country and fighting for freedom, Scott perished in the KC–130 tanker that crashed in Pakistan on January 9, 2001 while he was performing his duties as a loadmaster during missions in support of the War on Terrorism. Scott Germosen has made the ultimate sacrifice so that all of us can live under  the blanket of  freedom  that America provides. On behalf of  the First District of New York and the entire Nation, I thank Scott Germosen, a true American hero. Scott  is  survived  by  his mother Myrna Washington, his wife Jennifer, and his 22-month-old daughter Alyssa. I ask my colleagues to join me in praying for and in paying respect to Scott Germosen and his family. f ESTABLISHING  FIXED  INTEREST RATES FOR STUDENT AND PARENT BORROWERS ",2002

Mr. Speaker,  I am pleased to announce that the House has completed its legislative business for the week. The House will next meet for legislative business on Tuesday, January 29, at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and at 2 p.m. for legislative business. The House will consider a number of measures under suspension of the rules, a list of which will be distributed to Members’ offices tomorrow.

12,House,107,-0.266,17,2002-01-24,Mr. POMEROY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and I very much appreciate his ongoing leadership on budget issues. They are at the core. I have a chart which illustrates the point the gentleman was making about how did we get in this hole? We have to be candid about assessing what happened because that is how we are going to learn how to go forward. This part, looking out 10 years, is lost revenue due to the tax cut. So as we can see, the tax cut played a very major role in this sharp change in the fiscal fortune of our country. It certainly was not the only factor. The green shows the effect of the slowing economy. We slipped into a recession, and that has certainly made a bad situation worse. The blue and the purple underscore additional adjustments,  including  expenditures that will be made, not anticipated, in the budget forecast. Combine all of these and we see that the Republican tax cut was perhaps the largest driver in putting us back into deficits, but it has been joined by a number of other considerations as well. It just goes to prove the point, we do not bet the ranch on everything working out perfectly. The budget bill did, and things have not worked perfectly, and now we have deficits to work with as a result. I see that the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), my cochair of the Democratic Budget Group, has joined me on the floor. I do not think the body has a more astute student of the budget than the gentleman from North Carolina, and I yield to him for his comments at this time. ",2002
13,House,107,-0.341,17,2002-01-24,Mr. PRICE of North Carolina.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding. I want to commend the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr. HOEFFEL), one of our colleagues who is most attentive to the budget process, for his statement. And I certainly want to thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman  from North Dakota  (Mr. POMEROY), an outstanding member of the Committee on Ways and Means, with whom I cochair the Democratic Budget Group. We meet every Wednesday morning and go over the sometimes arcane budget figures that we are dealing with. Those figures now are coming to life as we understand how much things have changed in this past year and as we stop and see what these figures portend for our country’s fiscal solvency and the kinds of things we need to do over the next 10 years. b1230 These are figures we must attend to, and I commend my colleague for taking out this Special Order today to focus on our fiscal situation. A year ago we were looking at a unified budget surplus over the next 10 years of $5.6 trillion. Today that figure has been reduced to $1.6 trillion. I would just like to ask my colleague to elaborate on the fact that this is actually an optimistic figure, this $1.6 trillion. Is it not true that it does not include the likely extension of certain popular tax credits like the research and development tax credit, as well as the repair of the alternative minimum tax that we all know is going to have to take place unless many, many middle-income people are going to run up against that tax? It does not include the farm bill that is likely to pass in this Congress. It does not include the defense and homeland security requests that are going to be coming from the President and that we are going to want to support. None of that is included in this estimate. So when we say that the surplus is now only $1.6 trillion, that is actually an optimistic estimate. If we do all these things, then we are looking at a figure that is considerably lower. The figure that is now $1.6 trillion could go well under $1 trillion, something like $700 billion dollars or $800 billion. And natural disasters are not, I believe, in the mix either, the normal expenditures we make for recovery and relief after natural disasters. So the figure we are looking at is really a best-case scenario. Yet, how much worse it is than what we thought we were facing just a year ago! ",2002
14,House,107,-0.569,24,2002-01-24,Mr. OWENS.," Mr. Speaker, beginning the second half of our congressional session, there are a lot of items on our agenda. There is a great deal of talk about many issues, and I worry very much about the possibility that the American people will be confused if we let all of the various discussions of the various issues become a babble with no focus,  a  babble  which  does  not prioritize and show us what is most important and what are the key items that we should focus on. It is difficult to hold the attention of the constituents, it is difficult to hold the attention of the voters, and the voters need to know more than ever what is going on so they can make intelligent decisions and defend  their own interests and the interests of the country  when  the  election  comes around in November 2002. We have a lot of sensational, highlyvisible problems that are getting a lot of attention; but even that attention sometimes degenerates into a babble, and it becomes confusion, sometimes deliberately so. The Enron scandal is one of the big items that has a lot of media attention and a lot of discussion here in Congress. There are several committees investigating it, and I think Enron is one of those important things that we have to address. But as we address Enron, both the details of the Enron scandal, the Enron swindle, the conspiracy, the details are  important, but we also ought to look very closely at the implications of what is going on with Enron. What  are  the  implications  for  our budget. That is now a number one consideration. The President will give his State of the Union address next Tuesday. Shortly after that he will be releasing his VerDate 10-DEC-2001 03:09 Jan 25, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K24JA7.056 pfrm04 PsN: H24PT1 ",2002

16,Senate,107,0.342,45,2002-01-24,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, our status is, am I right, that we are on the Finance Committee bill, the tax bill before us? ",2002
17,Senate,107,-0.212,66,2002-01-24,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to include extension of expired agricultural disaster assistance programs  to  the economic  recovery bill. My amendment, cosponsored by Senator ENZI, provides $1.8 billion for the Crop Disaster Program for losses incurred in calendar year 2001. Further, it provides $500 million for the Livestock Assistance Program, $12 million of which will be directed to the American  Indian Livestock Feed Program. Extension of these agricultural disaster relief programs is necessary. Why do I say so? It is because of an unprecedented streak of poor weather and economic conditions continue to hamper the economic prospects for farmers and ranchers throughout our country. Farmers in parts of the South and northern-tier States have been particularly hard hit. Although some sectors and some regions have begun to recover, farmers’ overall earnings from their farming operations, not including government payments, are down sharply from the levels in the mid-1990s. The  current difficulties  could not come at a worse time. While struggling to survive three disastrous years, farmers are now faced with sharply escalating operating costs due  to higher energy and  fertilizer prices, and basically higher operating costs. According to the most recent projections provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,  total  farm  expenses were estimated to rise another $4.2 billion in 2001. This latest rise came on the heels of a nearly $10 billion  increase in total farm expenses in the preceding year, 2000. Caught between severe and erratic weather conditions and  rising operating costs, American agricultural producers have experienced a severe economic squeeze. The data kept by USDA’s Economic Research Service demonstrate that net farm business income was at a decadelow in 1999 and 2000. Thanks to a limited recovery in some sectors, USDA projects that farm business income will rise slightly in 2001. Still, unless government assistance is continued, net farm income in 2001 is actually projected to be  lower than farm income in those bad years of 1999 and 2000. Even in sectors in which economic conditions have been improving, such as livestock, poor grazing conditions have pushed many ranchers to feed heifers for slaughter rather than using them to rebuild their herds. Not surprisingly, 3 years of economic hardship have taken a toll on the farm economy. ERS  statistics  show  farm debt rising in the last 3 years at such a rapid rate, more than in the 1980s. In other words, farmers are borrowing to continue  their  operations. This  increased debt load adds further to farmers’ operating costs. In my home State of Montana, it is anticipated  that  40 percent of producers  seeking operating  loans  this year will be denied if we fail to provide this assistance in this amendment. Thus, if government efforts to support farm income are now curtailed— with weather  problems  continuing, costs rising, and no time to recover from the contraction in farm operating income since 1998—the economic  impact on rural America could be devastating. In a real sense, the economic problems that have afflicted the rest of the economy in recent months have been plaguing the farm economy for several years. A downturn in farm income does not just impact farmers; it wreaks havoc in the  rural  communities  that  depend upon them. Farmers in economic distress are not able to make their usual purchases of seed and fertilizer, not to mention food and clothing. This makes the agricultural sector— which is directly and indirectly responsible for nearly one-fifth of U.S. gross domestic  product—among  the most vulnerable sectors of the U.S. economy. To ensure that the stimulus plan also provides  benefits  to  agriculture-dependent economies in the South Midwest,  and northern-tier States, my amendment extends the disaster relief programs that have been critical to shoring up farm income over the last 3 years. This will  allow  farmers—and  the rural  economies  that  depend  upon them—to share the economic support provided to the rest of the economy in the  stimulus  plan  and make  real progress  in  recovering  from  the multiyear  downturn  they  are  now struggling through. Simply put, many rural economies did not fully participate in the growth in the 1990s. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, growth in many rural States, including Montana, Iowa, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana, and Mississippi has  lagged behind—in  some cases,  far behind—the national average. In the same vein, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over the last decade, job growth in rural areas has lagged far behind that in urban areas. Further, rural areas appear to have entered the current recession in late 2000, almost a year and a half ago. Rural America seems to be the first to suffer a recession and the last to recover. For this reason and so many more, this stimulus bill should include agricultural disaster assistance. ",2002
18,Senate,107,-0.421,73,2002-01-24,Mr. DAYTON.," Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of Senator BAUCUS’s amendment to provide disaster assistance to farmers. I begin by thanking my very distinguished colleague from Montana who has consistently championed  the need  to help farmers throughout the country who have crop losses due to natural disasters. I thank the Senator for his leadership and strongly support this amendment that will provide disaster assistance to farmers who need it and will be further devastated without it. American agriculture has been in a recession for the last several years; or even for some farmers, a depression. Last August,  the Minnesota Farm Service Agency calculated that Minnesota farmers had suffered $500 million in crop losses in the first half of 2001. Then in November of last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the largest monthly drop in commodity prices in USDA’s 91 years of recording that statistic. In a single month,  overall  commodity  prices plummeted nearly 10 percent nationwide. With prices that  low,  farmers have no ability to withstand additional losses that a disaster creates. At that time last November, the Senate Agriculture Committee was completing its markup of legislation that would provide desperately-needed assistance to farmers and producers. Amazingly, we spent  most  of  December  sitting through a filibuster of the farm bill. That  filibuster was harmful  to  all farmers—it was catastrophic to those who need disaster aid and whose farms may not survive without it. Senator BAUCUS’ amendment will provide this vital assistance before is too late. I urge my colleagues  to  support  this amendment. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. ",2002
19,Senate,107,0.192,80,2002-01-24,Mr. SMITH of Oregon.," Mr. President, this amendment is really very simple. It does address in a meaningful way the stimulus side of our effort. I think we are all deeply concerned when we go home and we meet the unemployed who need extensions on unemployment benefits and health care insurance benefits from COBRA. I would like to help. What they really need long term is a job. What we need to do is remember there is a supply side to this economic equation as well. We have to do something meaningful in order to help businesses retool, reinvest, restart, and reemploy the citizens of this country. There is a proposal—I believe well-intentioned—that  is  improving on the other side. Originally, it was a 10-percent depreciation bonus over 1 year’s time. Now it is up to 30 percent over 1 year’s time with eligibility. I believe 30 percent is the right number for this bonus depreciation, but as a person of business prior to politics I can tell you it takes more than what is remaining in the year of eligibility. We have already used up 4 months. By the time  the President might  see  this, there may be 5 months used up. Seven months to make a business plan in capital  equipment  in  order  to  restart plants  is  simply  inadequate  to  be meaningful to have the economic test that our country requires. My amendment will actually help stimulate the economy. We have heard this from experts such as Alan Greenspan, such as Secretary Rubin of the Clinton administration, and others who have said this is one meaningful thing you can do  that will actually help stimulate the economy in the short run and reemploy people quickly. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It is critical. Whether you are talking about the silicon forest of the high-tech industry in Oregon or the timber industry of the forests in Oregon, they need this bill. They need it desperately if we are serious about restarting plants and reemploying our people. I hope tomorrow morning when we vote on this there will be 60 colleagues and more who will understand that while we are going to do much on the demand side to help with unemployment benefits and to help with health the  Senator care benefits, we are also going to do something to help on the supply side and actually help to stimulate jobs and reemployment. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this amendment. ",2002
20,Senate,107,0.52,80,2002-01-24,Mr. NICKLES., Will  yield? ,2002
21,Senate,107,0.409,80,2002-01-24,Mr. ALLEN.," Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to increase the 30-percent bonus depreciation from 1 year to 3 years. The underlying proposal, while improvement  over  the  previous  one, which was only 10 percent, is still too short. It is not enough time to help revive the high-tech economy, and, indeed, our general economy to help create more jobs. If the underlying proposal were implemented,  the  bonus  depreciation would only  last until September of 2002, which is merely 8 months away. The amendment of the Senator from Oregon was passed by the House of Representatives and was supported by the Bush administration. The argument that the Senator from Oregon has made makes a great deal of sense. It will boost  investment.  It will boost growth in the high-tech sector in particular. Why does that matter? I was  just meeting with  high-tech  folks  from Redmond, WA, Silicon Valley in California, and here in Virginia. Whether in Oregon, or anywhere else, this proposal makes good sense. Senator Smith’s amendment  takes aim at the core problem of our slumping economy which is seeing a huge drop in investment, in equipment, and in machinery. Over 3 years, a 30-percent bonus depreciation would get the investment engine going and running strong again. It would lower the cost of new capital spending. It would provide a stimulus for a broad array of industries,  including  telecommunications, technology and others, including transportation. The  current  depreciation  schedule clearly has not kept up with our economy. It is especially harmful in this economic slowdown. Senator SMITH introduced this proposal on behalf of the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force late last year. Indeed, looking at the concept of the enhanced expensing as proposed by Senator SMITH for bonus depreciation, it would be highly beneficial to the high-tech community, the sector of our economy that has driven productivity growth and created millions of  jobs during the last decade. The information technology industry makes up only 8.2 percent of the U.S. economy. Yet it has accounted for almost 30 percent of the real gross domestic growth from 1994 to 2000. Much of this growth resulted from the increase in investment in hardware, software, networking, and communications systems. As the economic slowdown has persisted, decreasing IT investments have substantially weakened our American economic growth. During these uncertain economic times, as Senator SMITH stated, businesses have decreased motivation. They do not want to take those risks in buying new equipment and new systems  because  they  are worried about what the economy may do. The result, obviously, has an adverse impact on job opportunities for those who fabricate the chips, for those who assemble the computers, and for those who work on the programs and all the innovations and adaptations that improve our lives—whether it is in education or communication services and manufacturing. This amendment has a robust expensing provision.  I  think  it  can  turn around our bleak economic scenario. The enhanced expensing provision in this amendment, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor with Senator SMITH, has broad support. As  I noted previously,  the House passed it. This has the support of leading high-tech trade associations,  including AeA, CapNet, EIA, BSA, the Information Technology Association of America, the Information Technology Industry Council, and TechNet. We need to get into some details of the economy because that bolsters the argument about why we need to pass this amendment. Diminishing IT investments impact our economy.

22,Senate,107,-0.308,87,2002-01-24,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I rise today to express concern over the outcome of the presidential elections last month in Zambia. A number of African states will hold  important elections this year, the results of which could shape the governance and prosperity of the continent for years to come. Unfortunately, several troubling aspects of the Zambian elections demonstrate the need  for  a more  concerted  international effort to demand democratic accountability  and  transparency  in many African states. The Movement  for Multiparty Democracy’s candidate for President of Zambia, Levy Mwanawasa, was inaugurated on January 2 as the new President, after claiming a very narrow victory in general elections held on December 27. As the handpicked successor of  outgoing  president  Frederick Chiluba, Mwanawasa approached  the contest  from an advantaged  institutional position and ran against a divided opposition. But polls leading up to the election predicted that Anderson Mazoka, a prominent business executive, would win, or that the race would at least be exceptionally close. Unfortunately  election monitoring reports from the Carter Center, the European Union and national nongovernmental organizations suggest that the balloting may have been marred by fraud. There are credible reports of tabulation irregularities and voter intimidation.  Those  reports  corroborate claims made by the opposition parties themselves. The Carter Center  has issued a statement expressing serious concern over the reports of irregularities  in  the  tabulation process, although they have not been able to ",2002
23,Senate,107,-0.318,94,2002-01-24,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution calling for the creation of ‘‘National Importance of Health Care Coverage Month’’ to call attention to the need for information about health care coverage options. I am  joined  in this effort by Senator COLLINSof Maine. A person’s physical and mental wellbeing are fundamental to his or her ability to learn, to work, and to contribute  to our  society. For healthy communities, the health of our citizens is vital. It is a fact that people who have  health  insurance  have  better health; forty-four million Americans, however, do not enjoy the protection of health care coverage. This resolution calls  for the promotion of a multifaceted educational effort about the importance of health care coverage; to increase awareness of the many health care coverage options already available; and to inform those who are eligible for public insurance programs on ways to access those programs. This resolution alone will not provide insurance to the millions of Americans who need  it. However,  it will draw much-needed attention to an issue that touches every citizen in every state. ",2002
24,Senate,107,0.109,94,2002-01-24,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Oregon in submitting this concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress that health care coverage is of the utmost importance and that a National Importance of Health Care Coverage Month should be established to promote  awareness  and  education about the importance of health insurance coverage. One of my top priorities in the Senate has been to expand access to affordable health care  for all Americans. There still are far too many Americans without  health  insurance. An  estimated  42 million Americans do not have health care coverage,  including more than 150,000 people in Maine. The simple fact is that people with health  insurance are healthier  than those who are uninsured. People without health insurance are less likely to seek care when they need it, and to forgo services such as periodic checkups and preventive services. As a consequence, they are more likely to be hospitalized or require costly medical attention for conditions that could be preventable. Not only does this put the health of these individuals at greater risk, but it also puts additional pressures on our hospitals and emergency rooms, which already are financially challenged. Compared with people who have health coverage, uninsured adults are four times and uninsured children five times more likely to use the emergency room. The costs of care for these individuals are often absorbed by providers and passed on to the covered population through increased fees and insurance premiums. This is one of the reasons that the cost of health insurance has soared in recent years. In Maine, employers, and in particular  small employers, have faced premium increases of 15 to 30 percent or more. This is a remarkable contrast  to  the mid-to-late1990s, when health  insurance premiums rose  less than 3 percent, if at all. Clearly we must do more to make health insurance more available and affordable. Since most Americans  get  their health  insurance  through  the workplace, it is a common assumption that people without health  insurance are unemployed. The fact is, however, that most uninsured Americans are members of families with at least one fulltime worker. As many as 82 percent of Americans who do not have health insurance are in a family with a worker. In Maine, small business is not just a segment of the economy, it is the economy. I am therefore particularly concerned that uninsured, working Americans are most often employees of small businesses. Some 60 percent of uninsured workers are employed by small firms. Small businesses want to provide health insurance for their employees, but the cost is often just too high. This is why I have introduced legislation with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator LANDRIEU, to help small employers cope with rising costs. Our bill, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act, will provide new tax credits for small businesses to help make health insurance more affordable. It will encourage those small businesses that do not currently offer health insurance to do and will help businesses that do offer  insurance to continue coverage even in the face of rising costs. While costs are clearly an problem, knowledge should not be an additional barrier  to  health  insurance  access. Public education and awareness initiatives are also critical to the success of ",2002
25,,107,0.339,101,2002-01-24,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my immense gratitude to the academy nominating committee  that assists me in selecting the best and brightest young people  in central, southern and eastern Oregon for nominations to our nation’s military academies. As I’m sure my colleagues would agree, one of the greatest honors I have as a Member of Congress  is  the privilege of nominating outstanding young men and women from my district  to  the United States Military, Naval, Air Force, and Merchant Marine Academies. Not only do these prestigious institutions offer the finest education  in  the world, but  they also provide an avenue to one of the most honorable forms of public service available to our citizens: the opportunity to serve in the United States armed forces. Graduates of these institutions serve not only as the leaders of our nation’s military, but also in high positions of civic and social responsibility in later life. Mr. Speaker, given the tremendous investment our government makes in these young men and women and  the  faith  the nation places  in  them after  their graduation, nominating the most qualified candidates to America ’s military academies  is an  important  responsibility. For this reason, in the process of selecting nominees  I seek  the guidance of men and women whose patriotism, professionalism, and judgment are beyond reproach. I am immensely fortunate to have the assistance of a number of retired military officers in my district who personify these virtues. In  the process of selecting candidates  for nomination, I have called upon the expertise of the following outstanding retired military officers to assist me: The Oregon  2nd Congressional District Academy Nomination Committee: Major General David S. Trump, USAF (Ret.) Colonel Linda Sindt, USAF (Ret.) Colonel Thomas G. Foster, USA (Ret.) Captain Bud Hart, USN (Ret.) Captain Sam Edelstein, USN (Ret.) Colonel Norman Smedes, USAF (Ret.) Captain Robert J. Trott, USN (Ret.) Mr. Speaker,  these dedicated  individuals have served their fellow citizens selflessly in their careers as professional military officers, and their service to the nation continues in this new capacity. Drawing from their considerable experience, they assist me in selecting candidates who understand and appreciate  the gravity of  the pursuit  they are undertaking. The members of  the nominating committee spend countless hours  reviewing each candidate’s record and conducting extensive interviews to enable me to choose the best of the best. They are both thorough and demanding in ensuring  that  the  candidates  they  recommend bear the qualities that will be of value to the services they hope one day to join. At a time when our nation is being tested as it has never been tested before, we are more mindful than ever of the need to identify and invest in the future leaders of our nation ’s military, the men and women who safeguard the very mantle of freedom under which we rise and sleep. I am grateful to have the guidance of  these  experienced  officers who  have, through their own outstanding military careers, demonstrated the qualities we seek in academy nominees. Our country will reap the benefits of their service for many years to come. f EMERGENCY WORKER AND INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT OF 2002 HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL OFNEWYORK INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 24, 2002 ",2002
26,,107,-0.514,101,2002-01-24,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, we have all seen the press reports about how many of the employees of Enron lost virtually all of their retirement savings because of  the Enron collapse. While the retirement savings of the rank and file Enron employees were disappearing, the corporate insiders sold millions of dollars worth of their Enron stock. The corporate insiders were able  to  sell  their  stock even though  those  insiders continued  to promote Enron stock as a sound investment to the rank and file employees. In addition, Enron placed substantial  restrictions on  the ability of  the rank and  file employees  to sell  the Enron stock held in their retirement plan. The Republican  leadership has made  it clear that it is willing to act promptly, without hearings, when providing large benefits to corporations. This Congress enacted an airline bailout bill promptly without hearings while making promises to help airline workers later. The House of Representatives passed legislation  last year, without hearings,  that would have provided a cash payment  to Enron of over $250 million. The House passed legislation protecting the insurance companies from claims in future terrorist attacks, again without hearings and also with further promises to provide worker benefits later. Now,  I ask  the Republican  leadership  to permit prompt consideration of  legislation  to protect workers from another Enron-like incident. Workers should be entitled to the same consideration as large corporations. The bill  that  I am  introducing  today along with Minority Leader GEPHARDT and others contains two provisions that I believe can and should be enacted immediately. The bill does not pretend  to be  the  final answer  to  the issues raised by the Enron collapse. However, it will provide interim protection for workers. It ensures that the employees of a company will have the same ability to sell stock in company that  the corporate  insiders have.  It also will help ensure that companies provide workers and shareholders with accurate  information about  the  true  liabilities of  the company so that they can make informed decisions as to whether to hold or sell that company’s stock. Mr. Speaker,  I  fully support  investigations and hearings on the Enron situation. We need to fully understand what Enron did and how it was permitted to do it, in order to formulate a comprehensive legislative response. However the investigations, hearings, studies, and task forces should not be an excuse to delay immediate action designed to protect millions of employees as well as shareholders. I believe there is some risk that Enron and its accounting firm may have been successful in destroying documents necessary for the investigations. I would note that there is one set of documents that Enron and its accountants did not destroy, namely Enron’s  tax returns. The executives from Enron have stated that the destruction of documents was contrary to their express instructions. If those executives are serious in desiring a full investigation, laying out all facts available, then they should release immediately Enron’s tax returns for public examination. Those could be the only documents remaining that would fully disclose what happened to Enron and who is responsible. Mr. Speaker, this is not the last bill that I will introduce as a result of the issues arising from the Enron case. As we learn more about specific problems that should be addressed, I will urge my colleagues to consider additional proposals. For example, recently there have been press reports that Enron enhanced its guaranteed retirement benefits for its executive officers while it was reducing or eliminating guaranteed pension benefits for rank and file workers. There may be need for legislation to prevent such an abuse in the future. In addition, it  is clear  that certain areas  in our pension system need  to be addressed  to provide a greater level of retirement security to workers. Following is a brief description of the bill I am introducing today. SHORT-TERMWORKERPROTECTIONS Eron employees suffered  large  losses on their  investments  in Enron  stock because Enron placed restrictions on sales of its stock held by employees in section 401(k) plans. Indeed, during  the critical period within which Enron collapsed, it prohibited all sales of stock in its 401(k) plans. During  the early 1980s Congress enacted legislation  to  respond  to  certain  corporate transactions where  insiders  received  large payments, called  ‘golden parachutes.’ ’ They were called golden parachutes because they enabled the insiders to bail out with extraordinary sums of dollars, often leaving a weak or bankrupt company behind. The legislation imposed a 20 percent excise tax on those payments. My bill would extend the golden parachute excise tax to sales of corporate stock by corporate insiders during periods when rank and file employees of the company are not able to freely sell the company stock held their 401(k) accounts. This portion of the bill would be temporary (in effect for 6 months).

27,,107,-0.631,108,2002-01-24,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  in support of the ‘ ‘Next Step in Reforming Welfare Act’  for which I am an original cosponsor. In 1996, I vehemently opposed the ‘ ‘Temporary Assistance  for Needy Families Act,’ which changed our nation’s welfare system, because it removed an important safety net for the poor and the most vulnerable in our society. I still hold these views today. However, I support the ‘ ‘Next Step in Reforming Welfare Act’ because— unlike  the 1996  law— this new  legislation  improves our national safety net and actually helps the poor and most vulnerable in our society. This bill increases funding for TANF, redirects the goal of the program to that of poverty reduction, rewards work, provides new  funding  for work support programs, like child care, and encourages  states  to  better  assist  hard-to-serve TANF recipients. The ‘ ‘Next Step in Reforming Welfare Act’ increases the TANF block grant by inflation, and more than doubles child care funding so that more families are able to go to work. This  legislation appropriately  redirects  the goal of the TANF program to reducing poverty. This replaces the draconian idea that the purpose of welfare is to kick TANF recipients off the rolls as fast as possible. The bill accomplishes this by making child poverty reduction an explicit goal of TANF and by providing $150 million each year in incentive grants to states who reduce child poverty. Another important focus of this legislation is its commitment to increasing quality childcare to current and former TANF recipients. The bill triples the portion of the Child Care Development Block Grant available for this purpose. Additionally,  the bill  requires  that all TANF funding used for childcare only be used in facilities that meet state health and safety standards.  It also  increases  the age  for which childcare must be available for children from 6 to 13 years old. This bill directs resources  to TANF recipients who suffer  from disabilities, substance abuse, domestic violence, and  lack of proficiency in English. It requires states to assess and screen  recipients  to determine  if  they need rehabilitative or educational services to go to work. It also provides families in these situations a chance to get on their feet by allowing  rehabilitative services  to count as a work activity for six months. These changes in TANF are a first step toward improving our welfare system so that it truly helps poor working  families and gives them not  just a safety net, but also springboard out of poverty.  I hope  that my colleagues  in  the House will work with me  to make TANF a program we can all be proud of. f SALUTING FIRST LIEUTENANT JOHN P. PARKER HON. JAMES A. BARCIA OFMICHIGAN INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 24, 2002 ",2002
28,,107,-0.184,108,2002-01-24,Mr. BARCIA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to pay tribute to First Lieutenant John P. Parker upon his retirement as Commander of the Bay City Post of the Michigan State Police. John’s exemplary work ethic and can-do attitude have served as standards of optimism, hard work and  determination  for  his  fellow  officers, friends, neighbors and all who have come into contact with him during his 27-year career with the Michigan State Police and his more than eight years in charge of the Bay City post. As a law enforcement officer, devoted father and contributor to our community, John has always impressed others with his lead-by-example approach  to any venture he has undertaken. A Lansing native, John began his law enforcement career  in 1974 as a radio dispatcher in the Jackson post. After graduating from the police academy in 1977, John served briefly with the Bad Axe post as a trooper before being assigned  to  the Detroit Freeway post. He later worked in Lansing and Brighton. In 1992, John earned a promotion  to First Lieutenant and  took command of  the Sandusky Post, where he served for a year until his transfer to Bay City. When John took command of the Bay City post, he had his work cut out for him to restore morale and train a professional core of new  troopers  to bring  the post up  to  full strength. John modestly credits the sworn officers and civilian staff who have worked  for him with rebuilding the post, but he deserves praise for leading the effort. Today, John and those under his command can point proudly to having transformed the Bay City post into one of  the more widely  respected posts  in  the state. John’s strong sense of duty and superior managerial skills clearly sparked the engine that has driven the Bay City Post to be ranked among the best in the state. Never one to sit on the sidelines, John also found time to devote to civic, religious and fraternal organizations  to serve our community and his  fellow citizens. His participation  in these organizations, which include the Board of Director of the Bay County Crime Stoppers, the Tri-County Adjudication Program Board of Directors and Knights of Columbus Council 4232, have made a  real difference and he should be commended  for his  involvement. John’s wife, Kathy, and his four sons, John, Scott, Chris and Michael, also deserve high praise for their unselfish support of John in his career goals and his volunteer work. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing gratitude to First Lieutenant John P. Parker  for his distinguished service and in wishing him success in all future endeavors. John will no  longer carry a badge, but I am confident that the honor and integrity he displayed during his  tenure with the Michigan State Police will continue  to serve as evidence that he exemplifies the very best values of the men and women in law enforcement. f TRIBUTE TO COL.

29,,107,0.409,108,2002-01-24,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to congratulate Col. Edward Rice, Jr. on his promotion to Brigadier General. Col. Rice commands the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base in my home state of South Dakota, with 27 B– 1 bombers and more than 3,500 military and civilian members. A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1978, the Colonel is a command pilot with more than 3,600 flying hours in aircraft such as the B– 1B, B– 52 and B– 2. Throughout this distinguished career, Col. Rice has held numerous key operational and staff positions. Most recently, Col. Rice returned from commanding B– 1 and B– 52 operations during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The B– 1 bomber has been involved in every aspect of  the most precise,  intense bombing campaign in history, flattening terrorist targets and taking out Taliban strongholds. Col. Rice’s bombers were the key to winning in Afghanistan. Upon his return, Col. Rice stated, ‘ ‘All of us who wear the uniform understand we may be sent into combat. We all know that when duty calls, we’ ll stand and do what we’ve been trained to do.’  That spirit is what makes the U.S. military  the best  in  the world and Col. Rice one of its finest examples. Yesterday when  I spoke with Col. Rice,  I was  reminded again of what a quality  individual he is and what a tremendous asset he is to our country. I am proud of the important role he played  in directing missions  in  the skies above Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, for all the sophistication of these bombers, we know it is people like Col. Rice who truly help get the job done. I’m proud of how well he represents South Dakota. Mr. Speaker, I commend Col. Rice for his performance in Operation Enduring Freedom, thank him for his service and congratulate him on his promotion to Brigadier General. f INDIA’S REPUBLIC DAY, JANUARY 26, 2002 HON.

50,Senate,107,-0.374,25,2002-02-04,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I begin by thanking the nominees’ home State Senators for working with us on this nomination and by commending the majority leader and our assistant majority leader for bringing this matter to successful conclusion today. Callie Granade is the second nominee being considered from Alabama in the last several weeks and the second confirmed to fill an emergency vacancy. On November 6, the Senate confirmed Judge Karon Bowdre by a vote of 98 to 0 to a  longstanding vacancy on the Northern District of Alabama District Court. Today the Senate will take final action to fill a longstanding vacancy on the Southern District of Alabama District Court. This nomination was  received  on September 5 and reported favorably to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee just a few days before the Senate adjourned  last December.  It  is being taken up in the first days of our return. These Alabama district court vacancies have persisted for years while Senators were unable  to agree on acceptable nominees with the previous administration. Unlike the nomination of Ken Simon, which languished for more than 6 months in 2000 without a hearing, both Karon Bowdre and Callie Granade have been considered promptly. I congratulate the nominee and her family on her confirmation today. Confirmation of Ms. Granade will be the seventh confirmation filling a vacancy designated as a judicial emergency since I became chairman  last summer.  Unfortunately,  the White House has yet to work with homeState Senators to send nominees for an additional 15 judicial emergency vacancies and 31 federal trial court vacancies. With today’s confirmation, the Senate has  confirmed  three  additional judges since returning late last month. The Senate will have  confirmed  31 judges since the change  in majority last summer. Of course, I have yet to chair the Judiciary Committee for a full year; it has been barely 6 months. But the confirmations we have achieved in those 6 months are already comparable to the year-end totals for 1997, 1999 and 2000 and nearly twice as many as were confirmed under a Republican majority in the Senate in 1996. The 1996 session was the second year of the last Republican chairmanship. In that 1996 session, only 17 judges were confirmed all year and none were confirmed to the Court of Appeals—none. I expect and intend to work hard on additional judicial nominations through this session and to exceed the number of judges confirmed during the 1996 session. The Judiciary Committee held  its first hearing of the session on our second day  in session, January 24,  for Judge Michael Melloy, a nominee to the 8th Circuit from Iowa, and district court nominees  from Arizona,  Iowa, Texas, Louisiana and the District of Columbia, a total of six judicial nominations. I have set another hearing on the nomination of Judge Charles Pickering for the 5th Circuit for this Thursday, February 7, 2002. I am working to hold another confirmation hearing for judicial nominations, as well, before the end of February, even though it is a short month with a week’s recess. I noted on January 25 in my statement to the Senate that we inherited a frayed process and are working hard to repair the damage of the last several years. I have already laid out a constructive program of suggestions that would help in that effort and help return the confirmation process to one that is a cooperative, bipartisan effort. I have  included  suggestions  for  the White House, that it work with Democrats as well as Republicans, that it encourage rather than forestall the use of bipartisan selection commissions, and that it consider carefully the views of homeState Senators. This past summer, by the time I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Federal  court vacancies already topped 100 and were rising to 111. Since July, we have worked hard and the Senate has been diligent in considering and confirming 31 judges, thereby beginning the process of lowering the vacancies on our federal courts. Since I became chairman, 26 additional vacancies have arisen. Still, we have been able to outpace this high level of attrition and lower the vacancies to under 100. During the last 61⁄2years when a Republican majority controlled the process, the vacancies rose from 65 to over 100, an increase of almost 60 percent. By contrast, we are now working to keep  these numbers moving  in  the right directions. Our majority leader, with the help of the assistant majority leader, is clearing the calendar of judicial nominations and the Senate has proceeded  to vote on every one of them. This is one of the reforms that VerDate 11-MAY-2000 02:09 Feb 05, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G04FE6.047 pfrm03 PsN: S04PT1 ",2002

52,,107,-0.165,60,2002-02-04,Mr. ROEMER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 355, honoring the contributions of Catholic schools.  I am pleased  to have voted for this bipartisan resolution when it was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives on January 29, 2002. The successes of Catholic schools can be seen around the country and particularly in my home district. They traditionally have a stronger academic curriculum, greater parental  involvement,  and  few  disciplinary  problems. Catholic schools teach students not only of the importance of academic achievement, but also provide  them with a perspective on  life  that promotes  justice,  responsibility  and  social service. Moreover, catholic schools have considerable ethnic and racial diversity with 25 percent of school children enrolled in Catholic schools are minorities. More children in Catholic schools, go to college, and give back to the community through volunteer service. While we are honoring the achievements of Catholic schools, we must also  look at  the reasons that students in Catholic schools are succeeding at greater rates  than children  in public schools. Dr. Maureen Hallinan with the Institute of Educational Initiatives at the University of Notre Dame  is working  to do  just that. Dr. Hallinana is conducting a comparative analysis of public and non-public schools and their effects on student achievement. This research will identify the characteristics of those schools  that  successfully  promote  student achievement, especially  for at-risk students. The results will provide immediate and practical  input  for school personnel  in both  the public and private sector in helping them design and implement educational reforms to improve  the academic performance of all students. Mr. Speaker,  for  these reasons,  I support this important resolution and encourage catholic schools to continue contributing to the development of strong moral, intellectual and social values in America’s young people. THE INDEPENDENT INVESTMENT ADVISORS ACT OF 2002 HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS OFFLORIDA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 4, 2002 ",2002
53,,107,-0.565,60,2002-02-04,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to introduce the Independent Investment Advisors Act of 2002. The sudden and unexpected bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation has raised a multitude of questions and concerns regarding current auditor  independence  laws. Furthermore,  it highlighted the obvious conflict of interest that arises when an auditor has a financial interest in the company he or she is auditing. In November, 2001, days before  filing  for Chapter 11, Enron disclosed to the public that it had overstated its profits by more than $580 million since 1997. This means  that  for  five years, the Enron Corporation lied to its investors and employees about its earnings. At the same time, the company’s auditor, Arthur Andersen, entrusted with  the  responsibility of providing investors with an accurate and honest evaluation of Enron’s  financial situation, failed to expose Enron’s ongoing lies. Though Congressional and judicial investigations may yield otherwise, it is, nonetheless, fair to assume  that  the millions of dollars Enron was paying Arthur Andersen undoubtedly played a role  in  the  firm’s decision not  to expose Enron’s ongoing  lies.  In 2000 alone, Enron paid Arthur Andersen more  than $55 million for its audit work and consulting fees. The most stirring fact surrounding the investigation  of Arthur Andersen’s  failures with Enron  is  that concerns about auditor  independence is nothing new. In a 1984 opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court stated, ‘ It is . . . not enough that financial statements be accurate; the public must also perceive them as being accurate. Public faith in the reliability of a corporation’s financial statements depends upon the perception of  the outside auditor as an independent professional.’  Former Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Arthur Levitt, echoed the need for auditor independence during a Senate hearing on January 24, 2002. He noted,  ‘Any  reforms must recognize the importance of gatekeepers (auditors) in safeguarding the interests of investors and the fundamental need to preserve and enhance  these gatekeepers’  independence. ’ Using the model that Mr. Levitt proposed to a Congressional oversight committee in 2000, I come to the floor today to introduce the Independent Investment Advisors Act of 2002. My bill instructs the SEC to, within 60 days, revise current auditor independence laws to require that investment advisors (individuals or firms) provide full public disclosure of any financial ties to any company he, she, or it, is auditing. In addition,  it also bans auditors  from purchasing, selling, or engaging in any financial transactions with  respect  to  the  company being audited 30 days prior to and 30 days following  the  release of any  financial statement regarding that company. Mr. Speaker, as the American public continues  to deal with  the economic affects of September 11 and the ongoing recession, it is essential that Congress do everything it can to restore the public’s confidence in the ability of an auditor  to provide an  independent, accurate, and reliable evaluation of publicly owned enterprises. The Independent Investment Advisors Act of 2002  is a good start  in accomplishing  this difficult  task, and  I urge  the House to pass it quickly. f HONORING JEFFREY DONALD GWARTNEY HON.

Mr. Gwartney  has  served  on  the Chowchilla Chamber since 1998. Prior to taking office as President in 2001, Mr. Gwartney first served as the Vice President in 2000. Mr. Gwartney demonstrated his commitment to his community by  returning  to where he was raised to serve as a professional photographer. He participated in and studied photography and  journalism during his  years at Chowchilla Union High School and California State University, Fresno, and on into the business world. While his management positions in  the photo  labs of Wal-Mart  took him  to Southern California for a time, Mr. Gwartney moved back to Chowchilla at the earliest opportunity. Mr. Gwartney opened his own photography studio in Chowchilla in 1998. He continues to be actively  involved  in his community. His service on the Chowchilla Chamber of Commerce  is a  testament  to his professionalism and commitment  to  the community. Jeffrey Gwartney and his wife, Jennifer, are the proud parents of three sons, Jonathan, Jordan, and Joshua. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jeffrey  Gwartney,  for  his  contribution  to Chowchilla and the San Joaquin Valley. I invite my colleagues to join me in wishing him many more years of continued success. f FOXBORO HAILS PATRIOTS SUPER BOWL WIN HON.

56,House,107,-0.383,6,2002-02-13,Ms. RIVERS.," Mr. Chairman, the previous speaker mentioned the Constitution, and I think it is important that we collectively take a look at what constitutional case law tells us what Congress can do as it addresses campaign finance reform. Congress can prohibit the use of corporate treasury funds and union dues money in Federal elections. Congress can limit contributions to candidates, parties and political committees. Congress can pass laws to combat actual corruption and the appearance of corruption. Congress can require disclosure of the source and size of certain kinds of spending and most contributions. Congress can  regulate coordinated expenditures, though thwart attempts to circumvent existing election law. In short, constitutionally Congress has many tools available to it to regulate campaign finance reform. The Supreme Court has spoken on this issue. Shays-Meehan does no more than what the Supreme Court has already endorsed as tools for Congress to use. The Shays-Meehan bill is constitutional, and it is absolutely needed. I urge support. b1115 ",2002

58,House,107,-0.589,6,2002-02-13,Mr. LEWIS of Georgia.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Shays-Meehan bill. Now is the time for us to do what is right. It is time to remove the corrupting influence of soft money from the political process. It is time to open up the political process and let the average person come in and participate. It is time to let all of our citizens have an equal voice. We must pass Shays-Meehan to lessen the people’s growing cynicism. Soft money and big campaign contributions have polluted  the political process. When people give $50,000 or $100,000 to candidates,  they  expect  something, and, most of the time, they get something for it. We are sending the wrong message to the American people. It is time for us to enact real reform. It is time to restore the people’s faith in their government. This bill is good for America. It is not just good for the political parties, for Democrats and Republicans, it is good for our country. There is too much money in politics. Political candidates should not be up for  sale  to  the highest bidder. Too many of us spend too much of our time dialing for dollars. We should not be elected this way. This should not be the essence of our democracy. I did not march across the bridge at Selma on March 7, 1965, and almost lose my life to become part of a political system so corrupt that it pollutes the very idea of what we marched for. That is not why President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. Mr. Chairman, there is a better way. Shays-Meehan is a better way. It is not a cure-all. It is not a panacea. But it is a significant and extraordinary step toward cleaning up the process and fixing this broken system. We have a mandate. We have a mission. We have an obligation to do this on our watch, on our time. We must pass Shays-Meehan today. ",2002

60,House,107,-0.448,13,2002-02-13,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong  support of  the Shays-Meehan  substitute. This is historic legislation, one of the most important reform bills in a generation. I also wish to thank Mr. SHAYSand Mr. MEEHAN for their hard work and dedication to ensuring that we have a fair process and the opportunity to make meaningful reforms to our campaign finance laws this year. I also congratulate Mr. turner and the Blue Dogs on a successful discharge petition. Mr. Chairman,  the Republican and Democratic parties raised nearly half a billion dollars in soft money during the 1999– 2000 election cycle. Of  this amount, over 473 million was given  by  147  individuals  in  amounts  of $500,000 or more. This influx of unregulated soft money, no matter where it comes from, taints us all individually, and collectively works to increase the public’s cynicism and destroy faith in Congress. Today we have  the opportunity  to pass a complete ban on federal soft money and reign in sham issue ads. Shays-Meehan is the only bill before us today that will accomplish these goals. It is important to note that this bill also protects the ability of state and local parties to promote voter registration and get out the vote activities on election day, and assure the fullest possible participation in our democracy. I urge all Members  to support Shays-Meehan and vote down all poison pill amendments. ",2002
61,House,107,-0.416,13,2002-02-13,Mr. BORSKI.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of  the Shays-Meehan Campaign Finance Reform Act and urge my colleagues to vote against all ‘ ‘poison pill’  amendments that will be offered today. I am proud to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation, which represents the best,  real opportunity  to  reform our broken campaign finance system. The issue of campaign finance reform cuts to  the essence of democracy. Our unique American political system will not survive without the participation of the average American citizen. Unfortunately, more and more Americans are dropping out— with each election, fewer Americans are voting. They are doing so because they no longer believe that their vote matters. As  they see more and more money pouring  into campaigns,  they believe that  their  voice  is being drowned out by wealthy special interests. Despite the cynicism of the American public, Congress has failed to enact significant campaign finance reform legislation since 1974. In that year, in the wake of the Watergate Scandal, Congress imposed tough spending limits on direct, ‘ ‘hard money’  contributions to candidates. Unfortunately, no at that time forsaw how two loopholes in the law would lead to a gross corruption of our political system. The first loophole is ‘ ‘soft’  money— the unregulated and unlimited contributions  to  the political  parties  from  corporations,  labor unions, or wealthy  individuals.  ‘Soft ’  money allows wealthy special interests to skirt around ‘hard’  money limits and dump unlimited sums of money into a campaign. The unfolding Enron scandal provides a clear example of  the pernicious  influence of soft money. In the 2000 election cycle, Enron executives contributed $1.7 million— 70 percent of which came in the form of soft money. Most Americans see a clear  link between these contributions and Enron’s quest for special treatment by Congress. Clearly, the Enron scandal has eroded the public’s confidence in their government. Soft money is used to finance the second loophole in campaign finance law: sham issue advertisements. This  loophole allows special interests  to spend huge sums of money on campaign ads advocating either the defeat or election of a candidate. As long as these ads do not use the magic words ‘ ‘vote for’  or ‘ ‘vote against,’  they are deemed ‘ issue advocacy’ under current law and therefore not subject to campaign spending  limits or disclosure  requirements. During the 2000 elections, the television and radio airwaves were flooded with these sham issue ads— many of which were negative attack ads. Americans who see or hear these ads have no idea who pays for them because no disclosure is required. They drown out the voice of  the average American citizen, and even  sometimes  of  the  candidates  themselves. Without reform, we can certainly expect a huge increase in these sham issue ads. The Shays-Meehan bill begins  to  restore public confidence in our electoral system by closing these two egregious loopholes. The bill bans all contributions of soft money to federal campaigns. Specifically, it bans national party committees from soliciting, receiving, directing or spending soft money. Shays-Meehan also closes the ‘ issue advocacy’  loophole. It broadens the presently absurd definition of electioneering activity, or ‘express’  advocacy,  to  include any communication that refers, in support or opposition, to a candidate. This would not prevent public organizations from running advertisements, but would ensure that ads clearly designed to influence an election are regulated under federal law. We have laws clearly designed to regulate and disclose campaign donations and expenditures, and no one should be allowed to evade them. Shays-Meehan would ensure that everyone  involved  in  influencing  elections plays by the same rules. Opponents have argued  that  the ShaysMeehan bill undermines the First Amendment right of free speech. However, the Supreme Court has ruled  that Congress has a broad ability to protect the political process from corruption and  the appearance of corruption.  It has upheld as constitutional the ability to limit contributions by individuals and political committees to candidates. The Supreme Court has also clearly permitted Congress to distinguish between issue advocacy on the one hand, and electioneering or ‘ ‘express advocacy’  on the other. The Meehan-Shays proposal will not cure our campaign finance system of all it evils— and I certainly support more far reaching restrictions on campaign contributions and expenditures. However, the bill will take a modest but significant first step toward restoring integrity in our political system. It will limit the influence of wealthy special interests and help to restore the voice of average American citizens in our political process. In short, enactment of this legislation is essential to the survival of American democracy. ",2002
62,House,107,0.863,13,2002-02-13,Mr. PAUL.," Mr. Chairman, the Enron bankruptcy and the subsequent revelations regarding Enron’s political influence have once again brought campaign finance to the forefront of the congressional agenda. Ironically, many of the strongest proponents of campaign finance reform are among those who receive the largest donations  from special  interests seeking state  favors.  In  fact, some  legislators who were involved in the government-created savings and loan scandal of the late eighties and early nineties today pose as born again advocates of ‘ ‘good government’  via campaign finance reform! Mr. Chairman, this so-called ‘ reform’  legislation  is clearly unconstitutional. Many have pointed out that the First amendment unquestionably grants individuals and businesses the free and unfettered right to advertise, lobby, and contribute to politicians as they choose. Campaign  reform  legislation blows a huge hole in these First amendment protections by criminalizing criticism of elected officials. Thus, passage of this bill will import into American law  the  totalitarian concept  that government officials should be able to use their power to silence their critics. The case against  this provision was best stated by Herb Titus, one of America’s leading constitutional scholars, in his paper CampaignFinance Reform: A Constitutional Analysis: ‘ ‘At the heart of the guarantee of the freedom of speech is the prohibition against any law designed to protect the reputation of the government  to  the end  that  the people have confidence in their current governors. As seditious libel laws protecting the reputation of the government unconstitutionally abridge  the  freedom of speech, so also do campaign-finance reform laws.’ The damage  this bill does  to  the First amendment is certainly a sufficient reason to oppose it. However, as Professor Titus demonstrates in his analysis of the bill, the most important reason to oppose this bill is that the Constitution  does  not  grant Congress  the power to regulate campaigns. In fact, article II expressly authorizes  the  regulation of elections, so the omission of campaigns is glaring. This legislation thus represents an attempt by Congress to fix a problem created by excessive government intervention in the economy with another infringement on the people’s constitutional liberties. The real problem is not that government lacks power to control campaign  financing, but  that  the  federal government has excessive power over our economy and lives. It  is  the power of  the welfare-regulatory state which creates a tremendous incentive to protect one’s own interests by ‘ investing’  in politicians. Since the problem is not a lack of federal  laws, or  rules  regulating  campaign spending, more  laws won’t help. We hardly suffer from too much freedom. Any effort to solve the campaign finance problem with more laws will only make  things worse by  further undermining the principles of liberty and private property ownership.

I particularly commend Senator HARKIN for his leadership in including programs in this farm bill that will help farmers across the Nation,  including  those  in  the Northeast. I would like to take a few moments to speak about John Ogonowski, the courageous pilot of American Airlines Flight 11, which was hijacked by terrorists on September 11th and which crashed  into  the  first  tower of  the World Trade Center that day. At the time  of  his  tragic  death,  John Ogonowski had been working tirelessly to preserve 33 acres of land that had once been part of the Ogonowski farm in Dracut, MA. The Farmland Protection Program serves as a vehicle to help preserve farmland, and I hope that the funds from that program can be used to preserve the land that John cared so much about. I hope that we can make John’s dream come true. ",2002
67,Senate,107,-0.435,41,2002-02-13,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President,  I would like to clarify that it is the intent of this provision to encourage the development of innovative solutions to the nutrient pollution problem in the Chesapeake Bay. The principal focus of the program, as envisioned by Bay-area scientists and organizations, is to create new incentives for farmers to reduce the application of nitrogen by at least 15 percent below what is normally considered best practice and to provide financial protection in the event of reduced yields. In order to implement the provision, it is my expectation that the Risk Management Agency will make available the Nutrient BMP Insurance Endorsement that was approved by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation on December 12, 2001 in the states of the Chesapeake Bay  region, with  such modifications as necessary  to effectuate the purposes of this section.

68,Senate,107,0.415,41,2002-02-13,Mr. ROBERTS.," Mr. President, it is my understanding that the section on certification of third party technical providers allows the Secretary to certify  providers. The  legislative  language,  regarding  the certifying programs run by the United States Department of Agriculture is designed so that the USDA does not run the programs in a manner that directly or indirectly undermines the ability of private,  long-standing,  and  highly  regarded  certification  programs  like those operated by the Certified Crop Advisors and National Alliance of Independent Crop Consultants. The  intention of  the conservation title, and especially this section, as I understand  it, ensures that the Nation’s farmers and ranchers will be able to continue  to  receive high quality conservation technical assistance, and that there will be enough technical assistance  to allow  the complete and proper delivery of  the  conservation programs funded in the farm bill. In addition, it is my understanding that the Secretary of Agriculture will consult with and be advised by representatives  from  federal, state, and local agencies as well as representatives from the private and non-profit sectors on an Advisory Council. It is expected that in selecting representatives, the Secretary shall appoint representatives from the following groups: Natural Resources Conservation Service, Forest Service and Farm Service Agency, the National Association of Conservation Districts,  the Certified Crop Advisors, the National Association of State Foresters, the National Alliance of Independent Crop Consultants and the American Society of Agricultural  Engineers.  Together  with other appointed members of the Advisory Council, these representatives will advise the Secretary of the management of certification programs for the provision of  technical assistance by third party providers.

69,Senate,107,0.548,48,2002-02-13,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, today, the Senate voted 98 to 0, recorded vote No. 27,  in support of Senate amendment No. 2857 to S. 1731, the Agriculture, Conservation, and Rural Enhancement Act of 2001. This amendment contained sense-ofthe-Senate  language that  ‘‘no Social Security surplus should be used to pay to make [sic] currently scheduled tax cuts permanent or for wasteful spending.’’ I voted aye because I knew that a vote against  it would be construed wrongly as a statement in favor of dipping  into  the Social Security  trust fund. Factual inaccuracies in the amendment deserve to be noted. It states that ‘‘permanent extension of the inheritance tax repeal would cost, according to the administration’s estimate, approximately $104 billion over the next 10 years, all of which would further reduce the Social Security surplus.’’ This statement is factually incorrect. In fact, the confiscatory inheritance— or more accurately, the estate or death tax—will be repealed for 1 year in 2010. In 2011, the death tax is resurrected and at the potency of 2001 rates. I support making permanent the repeal of the death tax. This would in no way endanger the payment of future Social Security benefits. Over the next 10 years,  from 2003 through 2012, the President’s budget projects a baseline surplus of $463 billion. That amount does not include any Social Security  funds. A permanent death tax repeal is estimated to reduce Federal revenues by $104 billion over that time period. The resulting surplus, made up entirely of non-Social Security funds, would be $359 billion. To further illustrate the inaccuracy of the contention that permanent repeal would reduce the Social Security surplus by $104 billion, it is useful to look at the effect of permanence in 2011 and 2012. In 2011, the Federal Government is projected to generate a $199 billion surplus—a surplus that does not include any Social Security  funds. Permanently repealing the death tax would reduce Federal revenues by $25 billion in 2011, which is 12.5 percent of the projected surplus for that year. In 2012, the Federal Government is projected to generate a $395 billion surplus—a surplus that does not include any Social Security  funds. Permanently repealing the death tax would reduce federal revenues by $61 billion in 2012, which is 15.4 percent of the projected surplus for that year. The facts are clear. Making the death tax permanent will not deplete the Social Security surplus. Supporters of the continued  existence death  tax have long  underestimated  the  depth  of moral opposition to this ‘‘virtue tax’’ on our American families, small businesses, family farmers, and ranchers. Unfortunately,  the  death-tax  supporters are now resorting to outright misstatements about the ramifications of permanent repeal. They are attempting to convince the country that making the repeal of this tax permanent DOMENICI will jeopardize our seniors’ Social Security benefits. Not true. That is shameful and false, and a bipartisan majority of the Senate acknowledged  so—in  approving,  right after amendment 2857, my amendment to make repeal of the death tax permanent. By a vote of 56 to 42, the Senate memorialized its support for the following statement: ‘‘Therefore,  it  is the Sense of the Senate that the repeal of the estate tax should be made permanent by eliminating the sunset provision’s applicability to the estate tax.’’ ",2002
70,Senate,107,-0.256,48,2002-02-13,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President:  I  rise today in support of the farm bill and look forward to the House and Senate conferees working quickly to ensure that it is in place for the 2002 crop year. I also rise to explain my opposition to the amendment offered unsuccessfully  earlier  today  by  Senator regarding the dairy program included in the Senate version of the farm bill. This amendment would have replaced the dairy program that exists in the farm bill with a program that pays producers regardless of the actual market price of milk. Furthermore, the amendment failed to place a cap on the level of production eligible for a payment. The Senate version of the farm bill restores a much needed safety-net for farmers and ranchers throughout the country. This bill  rewrites  the  1996 farm bill which has left farmers vulnerable to the continued downward spiral of prices. Because of the 1996 bill’s deficiencies, Congress has had to approve billions of dollars in emergency assistance every year. This is not an effective or responsible or fair way to set the farm policy for our Nation, and I am pleased that the Senate has stepped up to the task of providing needed and honest reform. The Senate bill also provides significant new spending for conservation and nutrition programs. And it targets assistance where it is needed, the small family farm, by limiting Federal payments to $275,000 a year. All in all, the Senate bill is a comprehensive measure that will help farmers  in  Wisconsin  successfully weather volatile price fluctuations and other risks associated with farming. Of particular interest to my State is the  dairy  title  of  this  bill.  It  is counter-cyclical creating a price safety-net for dairy producers when milk prices  fall below the 5-year all-milk price or a $16.94 class  I price. The Domenici amendment would have made payments to producers regardless of market conditions.  I cannot support that. We should provide adequate relief to producers when prices decline, not simply pay  farmers  to over-produce and depress prices. Another key component of the dairy program  currently  in  the  Senate version of the farm bill is the limitations on payments.

72,Senate,107,-0.291,83,2002-02-13,Ms. CANTWELL.," Mr. President, I appreciate Senator DODD’s strong commitment to this legislation. Together with Senator MURRAYI also appreciate his efforts here today to work with us on language that preserves the ability of States like ours, that have high volumes of absentee and mail-in voters, to continue to use those mail in systems. This amendment adds to the voting system standards section of the legislation to make sure that the ability of voters to vote by mail-in and absentee ballot is not limited by our efforts to improve the ability of other voters to cast accurate ballots  in the polling place. This system is very important. The voters of my State are proud of this system and extremely committed to seeing it continue. In addition, I believe the voting by mail adequately protects against the types of problems encountered  in Florida  because  in these elections voters take their time in casting their votes and are able to consult instructions and other ballot information. Voters  in my State have made  it clear that they are willing to work with the system but want to make sure mail-in ballots and absentee ballots are preserved. This amendment preserves the ability to vote by mail while also setting forth new safeguards that will better inform voters how to correctly fill out their ballot and ensure their votes are counted. I thank the leaders of this legislation for their support for this amendment. I yield the floor. ",2002
73,Senate,107,-0.351,83,2002-02-13,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. President, I rise to speak on this legislation with which, as many of my colleagues know, I have been long involved. The legislation we consider today is one of the most important pieces of  legislation we will consider all year. Congress has a responsibility to ensure that every eligible American who goes to vote gets to vote and that every vote cast counts. What we have learned from the 2000 elections is that as strong as our democracy is, we have been lax in the upkeep of  the actual mechanism  that drives it, our voting systems. That is why we have come  together across party lines to pass this election reform legislation. I thank our chairman, Senator DODD, for his leadership in bringing this critical  legislation to the  floor. He has been tireless in his devotion to getting it done. I also commend the ranking member of the committee, Senator MCCONNELL, for his commitment to improving our Nation’s election systems as well. Senator MCCONNELLand I had introduced a bill that in many ways is part of this ultimate bill. I am proud to be part of the effort, along with Senators DODD and BONDand TORRICELLIand MCCAIN and DURBIN, to make this happen. The right to vote, as we all know, is at the very heart of our democracy. It is a right that, throughout our history, brave men and women have  risked their well-being, their very lives, to exercise. It was for the right to vote that American patriots fired the shots heard around  the world at Lexington and Concord, thereby initiating the Revolutionary War in 1775.

74,Senate,107,0.068,90,2002-02-13,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce, on behalf of Senator DURBINand myself, legislation entitled the  ‘‘Military Commission Procedures Act of 2002.’’ The President issued an order establishing generalized procedures for trying members  of  al-Qaida  and  the Taliban. It  is my view and Senator DURBIN’s view that Congress ought to consider what are the appropriate procedures  pursuant  to  our  authority under the Constitution, article I, section 8, which gives to the Congress the responsibility and authority ‘‘To define and punish  . . . Offenses against the Law of Nations.’’ We have already legislated in part, delegating to the President the authority to establish military tribunals ‘‘by regulations which shall, so far as he considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally  recognized  in  the  trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.’’ The President promulgated his order without  consultation with Congress. This legislation is a starting point for what we believe ought to be consideration by the Judiciary Committee. In the President’s order, there was a provision that there could be no appeal from any order of the military tribunal. But that, on its face, was inconsistent with the Constitution, which preserves the right of habeas corpus unless there is rebellion or invasion, neither of which had occurred here. The President’s order also allowed for conviction of a capital offense by a two-thirds vote, but  that  is  inconsistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and the  law does not allow a regulation to be inconsistent with that law. So Senator DURBIN and I have provided the modifications that two-thirds is acceptable generally. But if the sentence carries 10 years or more, it requires a three-fourths vote. And for the death penalty, it would require a unanimous vote. This legislation further provides for right to counsel consistent with the Uniform  Code  of Military  Justice, which would be either military counsel or could be private counsel. But that right is preserved. On one provision, we have provided that  there would be no  ‘‘Miranda’’ rights  for suspects who are  interrogated. I candidly concede that in abrogating ‘‘Miranda’’ rights, that will be a source of some contention, which can be the subject of hearings. But it is our view that we should not give al-Qaida or Taliban prisoners access to counsel before they are questioned, first, for the safety of the soldiers who are doing the questioning, and, second, because of  the  importance, potentially,  that eliciting information would stop further terrorist attacks. Of course, we could provide no ‘‘Miranda’’ warnings  in advance but not allow admissions to be used at trial, but it is our view, subject to hearings and  further consideration, that  ‘‘Miranda’’ rights ought not to be required. We have provided for an open trial unless there is classified information; and, if classified information is used, we have incorporated the provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996—a compromise worked out by Senator Simon and myself on the  floor—which provides for a summary to be given to the defendant and the commission, to be reviewed by the commission, to see if it is adequate  to protect  sources and methods of classified information and also adequate to inform the defendant of the evidence so that the defendant would have  substantially  the  same ability to make his defense as he would if the classified information was disclosed.

77,Senate,107,-0.367,20,2002-02-25,Mrs. CLINTON.," Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Americans who embody the extraordinary service and sacrifice that make our country great: the American Gold Star Mothers. Formed shortly after World War I, this organization has brought together mothers  who  lost  children  during World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Beirut, Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia and in other times and places where soldiers’ lives were lost in service of our country. The American Gold Star Mothers work to promote  the noble  ideals  for which their children  fought and died. The gold star they wear is a source of pride for their families and a symbol of the sacrifice they have endured so that our Nation might remain free. All of us who are parents know what it is like to live with the fear of losing a child, but only those who have suffered through such a loss can know just how very painful it is. Gold Star Mothers have endured such a burden and transformed their grief into an organization that serves not only the families of all who have lost loved ones in the military, but veterans everywhere, as well as our Nation as a whole. Their grace, dignity and patriotism represent the very best of America. I have had the honor of meeting with representatives of this wonderful organization to discuss their history and their work. Words alone cannot describe how much I admire their courage and resolve. We as a Nation have an obligation to them: not only to recognize their profound sacrifice and the bravery of their lost loved ones, but to give them support as they meet the challenges of life, challenges that I am sure would be easier to bear if their children were with them today. During  this extraordinary  time  in our history when, once again, American forces are overseas in battle, it is fitting that we pay tribute to the soldiers who fought for the cause of freedom and democracy in earlier conflicts and to the families who have given up so much in the name of these ideals. We must memorialize the losses that we, as a Nation, have  suffered and make clear that what counts in the long run is the quality and endurance of human spirit. Nowhere has it been given fuller flower than in our country. And in no organization can the power of the human spirit be seen more clearly than  in the American Gold Star Mothers. Although we can never alleviate the pain of losing a son or daughter, we can recognize the sacrifices these families have made and ensure that they suffer no economic hardship. That is why I am proud to cosponsor S. 129,  ‘‘Gold Star Parents Annuity Act,’’ which was introduced by my colleague, and an America hero, Senator MAXCLELANDof Georgia. This legislation would provide a monthly stipend to Gold Star Parents. It can make a big difference in the lives of families who are struggling to make ends meet. But, more important, it can itself be a powerful symbol of our Nation’s respect for the service and sacrifice of those who fought and died so that we might be free. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill, and in paying tribute to the American Gold Star Mothers.∑ VerDate 11-MAY-2000 01:32 Feb 26, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G25FE6.029 pfrm01 PsN: S25PT1 ",2002
78,,107,0.554,1,2002-03-05,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker,  our President often proudly uses a very enthusiastic phrase committing our Nation to better education for our young people, ‘‘Let us leave no child behind,’’ and rightly so. Children are the lifeblood of our Nation. But today, with all of the military commitments overseas, I propose another rallying cry, leave no veteran behind waiting to get a doctor’s appointment. Just as we must look ahead and nurture our children, we must look back in gratitude and take care of our veterans who have fought for freedom and democracy. Besides, investing in care for veterans is looking ahead, for timely veterans’ benefits can serve as a powerful incentive in steering young people towards armed services careers. Not a day goes by when I do not hear from a frustrated veteran who cannot get an appointment at a VA outpatient clinic or an inpatient VA bed. I suspect the same is true for most of my colleagues. For too long too few resources have been provided to the VA health care system, resulting in understaffed, underfunded facilities. Last week Salvatore Stanzione, Assistant Executive Director of the Disabled American Veterans  in Florida, presented to me some very disturbing trends. In my district and other parts of Florida, a wait of a year to see a primary care physician, and up  to  16 months to see a specialist, is not unusual. Last Wednesday, Commander-inChief James Goldsmith of the Veterans of Foreign Wars shared that there are 37,000 veterans waiting for medical appointments  in Florida.  Intolerably, veterans are kept waiting for the most routine appointments, like diabetes or high cholesterol monitoring. If managed on a timely basis, these conditions are more comfortable to the veteran and less expensive to the American taxpayer. Yesterday witnessed  the  bloodiest day of the Afghan War thus far. We mourn the nine American casualties of the downed Chinooks. In addition to those killed  in battle, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld reported that  ‘‘There have been a number of wounded.’’ Thankfully, he relayed that ‘‘close to half of those are already back in the battle, and of the remainder, relatively  few  have  life-threatening wounds.’’ Today we ask American sons and daughters to give their blood to advance  liberty and to halt terrorism, but when tomorrow comes, we show our veterans a chair  in the waiting room. Especially egregious is the long wait for those who served for a long period or sustained a service-connected disability. A Federal budget, just like that of a household or business, always faces difficult economic choices. But a household must first pay its creditors and buy grocery before it buys artwork and entertainment. This is the most basic necessity of obligation. Just  like a household, America ought to first meet its obligations to those whom it owes in exchange for their service. To exacerbate matters, the government seems to shut the door on other options  for health care accessibility. Alternatives have been proposed over the years on expanding VA health care options. We have  debated Medicare subvention to little avail. This Thursday,  the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and the Committee on Armed Services will again consider resource sharing between the two agencies. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from the First District of Florida (Mr. JEFFMILLER) knows this fight. He has not one single inpatient bed in his district. His veterans have to go to Biloxi, Mississippi,  for  hospitalization. Meanwhile, he has DOD facilities with available beds. Coordinating arrangements so that his veterans could use these DOD beds would solve this problem. Mr. Speaker, we are a wartime Congress, and the Nation is in an era of renewed appreciation of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. Defense briefs top the headlines, and the box office movies  feature current episodes on  the wars in Somalia and in Vietnam. Let us embrace this mood and opportunity and commit this Congress to providing the attention and  resources  to  the health care needs of those who have served.

79,House,107,0.559,8,2002-03-05,Mr. LINDER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, Jerry Solomon was my friend. He was my leader when I came here. He was the ranking Republican on the Committee on Rules. He was a tough partisan, but he was fair. Jerry served 20 years in this body before retiring and then dying shortly thereafter. He was born in 1930 in Florida and grew up in the northern regions of upstate New York. He attended St. Lawrence University and was a Marine through and  through. He  spent  81⁄2 years in active and reserve duty, and was one of the proud recipients of the Iron Mike Award given by Marines to Marines. He was married to Freda, a high school sweetheart and a sweetheart on her own. They have five children and six grandchildren. They had a marvelous relationship, where Jerry got all the credit and Freda did much of the work, much like, I am afraid to say, in my family. She was a marvelous partner for him and the two of them had a great relationship for many years. In 1995, Jerry became the chairman of the Committee on Rules, and I was given the opportunity to serve with him on the Committee on Rules. He was a strong leader for our cause and a fair one. He was tough and fair, and you cannot say much more about a politician than that. You appreciate their toughness, but you expect their fairness. He was outspoken on veterans issues. I recall one day him saying that he was the ranking member, and  if he had stayed back on the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, he would have been its chairman. And one day he  said he would  rather,  frankly,  serve as  the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Chair than the Committee on Rules Chair. He thought so much of our veterans, and he  fought  for  them  unstintingly through a 20-year career in this body. His proudest moment was  in  1988 when President Reagan signed into law ‘‘Solomon’s Bill’’ to elevate the Veterans Administration to a full cabinet level Department. This work won him wide praise from veterans groups over the years. Jerry was laid to rest with military honors this past year in Saratoga National Cemetery. He was the driving force behind the creation of that cemetery and helped secure the money to buy the land for the cemetery. In 1998, the gentleman  from New York  (Mr. MCNULTY) introduced a bill to name the Saratoga National Cemetery  in honor of Gerald Solomon. The bill had 88 cosponsors. However, some of the bureaucrats in the Department of Veterans Affairs were concerned because nothing like that had ever been done. After finding out, Jerry asked his colleague from New York to withdraw the bill because he did not want any controversy associated with the cemetery. On December  4,  2001,  this House passed a measure that did,  in  fact, name the national cemetery in Saratoga as the Gerald B.H. Solomon National Cemetery. It was signed into law on January 24, 2002. Those of us who watched him in his work as the chairman of the Committee on Rules recall him standing right at that microphone, with his big expanded file that said Solomon on the front, which  held  his whole world worth of information and detail on all the issues that he fought for and cared for through all the years. He was the Chair of the National Defense Task Force, he was a congressional adviser to the United Nations Session on Disarmament, he was a representative to the North Atlantic Assembly, Chair of the Political Foreign Affairs Committee, Chair of the House NATO Observer Group and the U.S. Task Force on POWs and MIAs. During the 1980s, Jerry was one of 13 House Members who served on President Reagan’s group of congressional advisers and four generals for foreign policy, national defense, and budgetary initiatives. I was privileged to introduce him at a breakfast one day, and those who knew him would appreciate when I said, ‘‘This man has devoted his life  to  insurance agents, milk producers, and Ronald Reagan, and not necessarily in that order.’’ He was a firm and staunch fighter for what he believed in. He could always be counted on. He was a great American, an important and dedicated member of this body, and I urge the passage of this resolution on his behalf. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2002
80,House,107,-0.396,15,2002-03-05,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Speaker, I take to the floor tonight to talk about President Bush’s proposed remedies on steel imports. Unfortunately, for those of us who represent iron ore miners in northern Minnesota and northern Michigan, the remedy proposed by the President today does little to help us. We must look back to December of last year in which the ITC, the International Trade Commission, by a six to nothing vote said  illegal steel, steel products, slab steel, was being dumped in this country to the great harm of the U.S. steel industry. With slab steel, that replaces iron ore pellets. In order to make steel, we need a raw product like iron ore pellets or slab steel. In order to corner the market, foreign countries have been dumping slab steel  in  this country at exorbitant amounts since 1998. Every time slab steel comes into our country, it hurts our iron ore miners. In fact, up in my district, the Empire Mine has just shut down. Over 800 workers have been laid off and all the managerial and administrative people have been laid off. So we were hoping today that President Bush would give us a strong steel remedy. We asked for 40 percent over 4 years, as allowable under U.S. law. Although the report was put forth today, and some in the media have called the tariff and quota on imported steel a compromise, I believe the iron ore industry may have been  sacrificed  in making that compromise. We in the iron ore industry have basically been sold out. The  ITC,  the  International Trade Commission, caught nations cheating under import pricing; and as I said earlier, by a six to nothing vote, they agreed those imports were hurting the domestic steel and the iron ore industry. If we take a look at what the President did today, he said we will allow 5.4 million tons of imported slabs to come into the United States, but we will not count Mexico or Canadian slab steel coming into the United States. So basically, we are at about 7 million tons a year. That is exactly what they are importing right now. So therefore, the remedy does nothing for those of us who have been harmed over the last 4 years by illegal imports. Because this import level of 7 million for slab steel has already caused mines to shut down and layoffs in northern Michigan and elsewhere, we have really won nothing with the President’s proposed remedy. If we take a look at it, Mexico has been used more than once by countries throughout  the world as an  export platform. By that I mean to get around the President’s proposals  today, his remedies today, other countries can export their product to Mexico, and then from Mexico  it will come  into  the United States. Mexico, as I said earlier, the President made an exemption for them as to steel products. Therefore, any country who wants to get around the new trade remedies proposed by the President will just ship their product to Mexico, it suddenly becomes a Mexican product, and  it comes  into the United States, it comes into the United States as not being part of the quota put forth by the Bush administration. If we take a look at it, and in fact, one of the recent articles that appeared right after the President made his recommendation was from the California Steel  Institute. They said,  ‘‘We are pleased that the President recognized that slabs are different from finished products and excluded slab from the tariff measure  imposed  on  finished steel products.’’ Those who use slabs already recognize that the President did nothing to stop or stem the tide of illegal  slabs  into  this country. The vice-chair of the ITC was quoted today in explaining their treatment of slab, and said that it wanted ‘‘to avoid causing harm to domestic steel producers that have legitimate needs to continue to  import  slabs.’’  The  vice-chair, Deanna Okun, added that a tariff on slab ‘‘would have a potentially severe impact on the members of the domestic industry that need a reliable source of slab.’’ Reliable source. The iron ore industry in my district has been there for over 150 years. One cannot get much more reliable than men and women going day in and day out, working in the iron ore mines for 150 years to provide America with the basic raw material it needs to produce steel, being iron ore pellets. The California Steel Institute went on to say, ‘‘We fought hard to convince the U.S. Government to treat slabs separately from finished steel. As a raw material that is virtually nonexistent in the U.S. market, slab is fundamentally different from finished steel products such as hot bands and plate.’’ Yes, it is different, because those of us in this country use iron ore as opposed to cheap imported slabs. I  should note  that  the California Steel Institute that I have been commenting on here tonight, 50 percent is owned by CBRD, a Brazilian iron ore company, and the other 50 percent is owned by a Japanese  company. So while California steel  industries are talking about how they have no remedy or how the slab remedy proposed by the President does not hurt them, they are already foreign owned. They will use Mexico as an export platform, and they will just sidestep these proposed remedies. The California  steel  industry and others who have used slab steel realize that the President’s remedy is nothing, and slab was not hurt. In fact, they are pleased with the remedy the President put forth. We in the iron ore industry and those who represent iron ore miners are not pleased. Iron mines are as reliable as the day is long. The miners have been there for us through all the world wars. They are loyal, hard-working Americans; and now they have just basically been exported out of  this country. I previously passed an amendment last  year,  a  ‘‘melted  and  poured’’ amendment, which basically says that any steel used in the United States defense industry must be from steel that is melted and poured here in the United States. I will be offering this amendment again in the next 30 to 60 days on the  supplemental appropriation bill; and every possible piece of legislation that it is germane to, I will be offering this amendment. I and others who represent iron ore miners will not give up, we will not sell out, we will not be shortchanged, and we will not shortchange our miners. We plan to be here day in and day out to continue to stand up for our iron ore miners. f OIL DEPENDENCE IS MAGNET FOR CONFLICT ",2002
81,House,107,-0.35,15,2002-03-05,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr.  Speaker,  our thoughts and prayers this evening are with the men and women in our Armed Forces who serve America’s cause on the front lines in Afghanistan, fighting one front in the war against terrorism. We await their prompt return, and we extend our deepest sympathies to the families of our fallen soldiers. As we prosecute the war against terrorism, we must take affirmative steps as a Nation to drain the swamp of hatred and violence in central Asia and the Middle East, in Indonesia, Africa, and Central America. But the real dimension of our mission must be clear. Even as our troops carry out their dangerous assignments in the four corners of our world, the Bush administration is pushing a plan for $98 million in outlays for military equipment to protect not democratic values, but an oil pipeline in Colombia. This aspect of the Bush administration foreign policy should serve to focus our attention on the urgent need for the United States to wean itself from a dangerous addiction to foreign oil. In fact, that historic addiction to Saudi oil, to Kuwaiti oil, to Iraqi oil, to Colombian oil, to Nigerian oil, lies on the basis of the repressive regimes whose dissidents strike out now against our country. It is an addiction that distorts our foreign policy, that drains our national wealth and demands treatment. The treatment on the home front for that oil addiction  is  restoring  fuel independence, energy independence for America again, and one of the most promising sources is biofuels. I would  like  to  submit  for  the RECORDthis evening a simply magnificent article  in  foreign affairs called ‘‘The New Petroleum,’’ written by a Member of the other body, RICHARDG. and  former CIA Director R.

The chart may be sitting too low to see because it is way down on the chart. I want to make sure that those who are following this debate with rapt attention notice that on the amount we hope to glean from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, even if we voted today to start it, we will not see the first barrel of oil coming out of there until 2009. Look at how little comes out. This larger amount is what we can achieve with efficiency. This smaller amount is what we are debating in a wilderness and refuge area. We should make this commitment part of our energy policy. Why do we have to turn to an area which we declared, as part of our national policy, would remain a wilderness as God created it, bring in the trucks and all of the pipelines and everything that is necessary, and risk the loss of wildlife and changing the face of that area forever, when, in fact, if we take a responsible course on vehicle fuel efficiency, as well as industrial and home efficiency, the savings far outweigh what we could possibly glean from this Arctic National Wildlife Refuge?

Because current energy supplies are relatively high and gasoline prices are relatively low, there are those that may want to postpone  the  difficult  decisions  required by comprehensive action. I rise today to remind my colleagues of our energy history and that, to avoid repeating the energy crises of the past, we need to act now. A quick review of just the last four years reveals the breadth of the energy issues that we must address. At the end of 1998, oil prices were so  low they threatened the viability of the domestic oil industry; in the spring of 1999, they soared to record  levels.

88,Senate,107,0.623,141,2002-03-05,Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.," Mr. President,  together with my  friend from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, and my friend from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD, I am introducing the Corps of Engineers Modernization and Improvement Act of 2002.  ‘‘Corps Reform’’, as  it  is  frequently billed, has been the subject of much heated debate over the last two years. In fact, the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 included a provision on independent peer review, requested by Senator FEINGOLD. Since that time, it has become clear to me that we need to aggressively address a broad range of issue endemic in the Corps. That is why I am before you today, introducing this bill. The Corps has been the subject of ‘‘the Fleecing of America’’ too many times. My primary goal is to ensure that Federal taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, on sound investments that are in the national interest. Our bill achieves this goal by addressing the mammoth backlog of projects that plagues the Corps; changing the cost-benefit ratio that a project must meet in order to be economically justified; updating of  the Principles and  Guidelines;  instituting  independent  review  of  certain  projects; amending some of the cost-share requirements; and limiting the waivers of non-Federal cost-shares often granted to communities. It has been projected that there is currently a construction backlog of well  over  $40  billion  in  authorized projects, with annual appropriations for the construction account of the civil works mission averaging around $1.8 billion. As such, the majority of the projects in the backlog will never see a Federal dime. While a great number of these projects are meritorious and deserve funding, others are not in the Corps mission, are no longer economically justified, or violate non-Federal cost-share requirements. Our bill would require the Corps to provide a list of projects in the backlog, categorizing each project as ‘‘active,’’  ‘‘deferred,’’  ‘‘inactive.’’ There would be a deauthorization mechanism, more stringent than current law, for projects that have never received construction funds, for projects that have been  suspended, and  for  those  that don’t pass economic muster. In addition, there are projects  ‘‘on the books’’ that are more than 25 years old, which have never received construction funds. These projects should be deauthorized immediately. The Environment  and Public Works Committee can authorize a restudy if any of these projects are thought to have modern benefits and meet the requisite standards. Currently, projects are only required to meet a 1:1 cost-benefit ratio. I find this appalling. No one would invest in the stock market at such a return. According to the Taxpayers for Common Sense,  36 percent of  the  310 major projects  authorized  since  1986 have been authorized with a benefit-to-cost ratio of less than 1.5. Construction of these projects would cost more than $7 billion. Especially  in these times of war and deficit  spending,  taxpayers cannot afford, nor should be asked to fund such projects. My bill would require that projects return benefits that are one and a half times the project costs, a vast improvement over current practice. My friends, do not fear deauthorization. It is a cleansing process, getting the inactive projects off the books will only serve to better the chances of completed  funding  for those projects that remain. I would also  like to highlight the independent  review provision  in my bill. WRDA 2000 required the National Academy of Sciences to issue a report making recommendations on the effectiveness of  independent peer review. Many will ask, why not wait until the Academy’s report is issued before addressing  this  issue  in  legislation.  I would like to explain to my colleagues, if the Academy makes recommendations that differ from what I have included in this bill, I am open to making refinements as this bill moves through the legislative process. But I wanted to include a provision on independent review to highlight the importance of the issue, as well as my belief that such review will help restore integrity to the Corps and its study processes. Let me say a word about cost-shares. I think it is important that a non-Federal sponsor partner with the Federal Government  in  the advancement of Corps of Engineers projects. The landmark WRDA 1986 established most of the modern cost-share formulas. But some of these cost share arrangements could be stronger. For example, the benefits realized by beach replenishment projects are highly localized. The non-Federal  interests should thus be responsible for a larger portion of the replenishment costs. I also believe that there should be a financial incentive, in the form of a better cost share, for non-structural flood damage reduction projects. This only seems logical from a financial sense, as well as an environmental standpoint. And as for the costs associated with the Inland Waterways system, IWS, there should be a distinction between those segments of the System that carry most of the traffic and those that are underutilized. Approximately 30 percent of the Operations and Maintenance funds are devoted to segments of the IWS that realize a mere 3 percent of the traffic. My bill attempts to address this issue by reformulating how O&M costs are paid. I say to my friends, my intention here is not to beat up on the Corps of Engineers. As the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I have a great deal of respect for the Chief of Engineers and  the Assistant Secretary of  the Army for Civil Works. This bill should not be interpreted as a statement on their effectiveness. I merely want to implement mechanisms to make the Agency more fiscally responsible. The taxpayers deserve our attention to this matter. I realize that many of my distinguished colleagues will oppose our efforts to  improve and modernize the Corps of Engineers. I daresay, part of the problem is that any meaningful reform of the Corps will require a reform of the practices of Congress, as well. If your project is meritorious, if it has local support and adheres to cost-sharing  requirements  and  cost-benefit ratio, if your project is in the Corps mission, you need not worry. This bill is about clearing the way for projects that warrant  the  taxpayers’  investment. As for where we go from here, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will hold a hearing on the issue of Corps Reform in the upcoming months. I expect this bill to be part of the debate of the hearing. Average Americans toil all day long, and some, all night, trying to make meager ends meet. How can  I  look these Americans in the eye and say, your tax dollars pay to maintain a waterway that sees two barges a year or to replenish the sand on a beach where the median home price is $1.5 million? Taxpayers’ hard-earned money should not be devoted to pouring sand on the beaches of the wealthy. Taxpayer dollars should be spent more wisely than to maintain deadbeat waterways. Particularly  during  this  time  of  beltcinching, we should show more fiscal restraint! I would like to quote another Mr. Smith, that is, Mr. Smith of Maine, who served on the House Committee of Ways and Means in the days before this country was embroiled in Civil War. Mr. Smith, in a Report of the Ways and Means Committee dated February 10, 1836 wisely counseled:  ‘‘Heedless and useless or unavailable expenditure of the public treasury are alike to be avoided in all legislation.’’ He further noted: ‘‘Every Government . . . is susceptible of acquiring habits of lavish expenditure and extravagance in its operations.’’ Every Government ‘‘requires constant watching to preserve its own purity.’’ Well, folks, I am here to say, our  government’s  practices  are not pure. But there is something that we can do about it. Corps Reform. It’s going to be an uphill battle, but it’s a start. I challenge, not  just my  fiscally  conservative friends, but all my colleagues, to put aside their parochial interests for the general good of the taxpayers’ hardearned money. As we move forward, please understand that I am open to suggestions as to how to improve upon the ideas embodied in this bill. I want to work together with my colleagues to make ",2002
89,,107,0.516,155,2002-03-05,Mr. HOEKSTRA.," Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased  to  introduce  the  ‘Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2002’ ’ to reauthorize the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), the Adoption Opportunities program, the Abandoned Infants Act, and the Family Violence  Prevention  and  Treatment  Act (FVPSA). According to recent statistics, almost 3 million  reports of possible  child maltreatment were made to child welfare agencies in 1999. Approximately 60 percent of  these  reports were investigated and 826,000 children were estimated  to have been victims of abuse or neglect in 1999. While the overall number represents a continuation of a downward trend since 1993, the long-term  trend  in child abuse reporting has been one of substantial growth, with the number of maltreatment reports more than quadrupling since 1976. However,  it should be noted that increased reporting of abuse and neglect does not necessarily mean an equivalent increase in substantiated cases of abuse and neglect. While the proportion of child maltreatment reports  that are substantiated has grown smaller over  time,  the number of reported child abuse cases is likely higher due to improved surveillance mechanisms. Despite progress made  in  promoting  child  abuse awareness and  the endless efforts made  to prevent child abuse and neglect, much more work is needed. In addition, family violence continues to be the most common, yet least reported crime in our nation. Approximately 95 percent of family violence victims are women, and  it  is estimated that every 11 seconds a woman is battered in the United States. It is also estimated that 70 percent of men who abuse their wives also abuse  their children, and children  from abusive homes are at greater risk of alcohol or drug abuse and juvenile delinquency. Mr. Speaker,  the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2002 continues to provide important federal resources for identifying and addressing the issues of child abuse and neglect and family violence, and to support effective methods of prevention and  treatment.  It also  continues  local  projects  with  demonstrated value in eliminating barriers to permanent  adoption  and  addressing  the  circumstances that often lead to infant abandonment. This  legislation emphasizes  the prevention of child abuse and neglect and family violence before it occurs. It promotes partnerships between child protective services and private and community-based organizations to ensure that services are more effectively provided, and supports public education on child abuse and neglect by strengthening the public’s understanding of the role of child protective services and appropriate methods  for public reporting of suspected  incidents of child maltreatment. This legislation also fosters cooperation between parents and child protective services workers by requiring case workers to inform parents of the their rights and the allegations made against them. Further, this legislation is designed to improve the training, recruitment and retention of individuals providing services to children and ensures the appropriate supervision of these individuals. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to back this  important  legislation  that  supports  improved services for children and families. f ON THE  INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘‘INSIDER  STOCK  SALES  EMPLOYEE NOTIFICATION ACT’’ HON.

90,House,107,-0.416,2,2002-03-12,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge a debate about the budget and Social  Security.  Tomorrow  Republicans mark up their budget in committee. Next week they put it on the floor  for consideration. Their budget will reveal the following facts: Republicans spent $4 trillion in surplus funds. They created deficits as far as the eye can see. They drained $2 trillion from Social  Security,  breaking  promises made  repeatedly  to  safeguard  these funds. Their policies reversed 8 years of progress. Their budgets brought a historic  reversal  that  impacts people’s lives. Fifteen months ago, unemployment was under 4 percent. We were having serious discussions about what we were going to do with this huge and mounting surplus. How much should we save for Social Security? How much should we  put  into Medicare? How much should we invest in a prescription drug program? Should we put more money in  education? Should we pay down more debt? And there were many who said that we could do all of it because the surplus was so enormous. So where are we today, March 12, 2002? We are not discussing what to do with the surplus. The surplus is just about gone. Today we are having that tired, troubled discussion we had for much of the last 20 years: What are we going to do about the deficit? How are we going to save Social Security? What are we going to do to save Medicare? And how are we going to take care of health insurance for the unemployed? This  is a Republican budget  that breaks promises made over and over in the last 3 years to protect Social Security.  It  fails  to  keep  our  intergenerational  contract  and  commitment. It threatens the retirement security of millions of baby boomers. In the aftermath of Enron, it is the height of irresponsibility. Five times, Republicans put bills on this  floor to create Social Security lock boxes. They voted five times to make the trust fund for Social Security inviolate. They voted five times to save Social Security first. Yet, they put forward a budget that jeopardizes Social  Security  just  as  the  baby boomers are about  to  retire. Their budget spends the Medicare surplus in each of the next 10 years. It makes a meaningful Medicare prescription drug program  impossible.  It  reduces  our commitment to public education, and it cuts programs promoting clean air and water that makes a difference in children’s lives. This is not a debate in the end about the budget. It is a debate about integrity, and it is a debate about responsibility. It is a debate about the values we want guiding our budget decisions. What are our values? In this budget, our values call for keeping our commitments by saving Social Security first. Our values call for adding a real prescription benefit to Medicare, where it belongs. Our values call for making every public school a great and successful public school. Our values call for paying the Federal debt down. Our values call for cutting taxes in order to promote  long-term economic growth and opportunity. I will never forget 1993. We balanced the budget. We made tough choices because we believed in opportunity, responsibility, and community. We put that plan together using the right values. So I urge Republicans, let us pass a budget that invests in national security, homeland defense, education, prescription drugs and our environment, and keeps Social Security sound and puts the Nation back on the path to fiscal health. Let us have an economic growth summit to reach the goals we all share. Let us get about keeping our commitments. Let us get about saving Social Security first and doing it beginning today. f SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY ",2002
91,House,107,-0.454,2,2002-03-12,Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.," Mr. Speaker, clearly, this administration and the Congress have done a good job at tackling the issue of terrorism, but there are many other important issues which need our attention, and one of these is Social Security. Last May, this administration was giving us a different message on Social Security. We were told we could have a tax cut, save the Social Security surpluses, pay down the debt, and fund other  urgent  national  priorities. Today, we are in a far different situation. We are not saving any of the surpluses; in fact, we are spending them. Mr. Speaker, $1.5 trillion over 10 years of Social Security surpluses are going to be spent under the current budget plans. We are not paying down the debt. We are, in fact, increasing the debt, unlike the predictions that were made. Plans are under way to increase the national debt ceiling, so we are headed into more debt, rather than as it was promised earlier we were going to be out of debt in 10 years. Why is the erasing the debt important? It is important because by paying down debt, we are freeing up resources to help save Social Security. At points in our history in dealing with this debt, 25 cents of every tax dollar that comes in has been spent on just servicing the debt. So if we lower that debt amount, that 25 cents, then we are freeing up resources, current resources that are coming in to protect Social Security. That means we are going to have Social Security there for the long term. Last year, all of us repeatedly promised to protect the Social Security and Medicare trust fund surpluses and promoted a series of lock box proposals as evidence of their commitment. Now, however, this administration’s budget diverts $1.5 trillion of the Social Security Trust Fund surpluses for day-today  government  operations  for  the next 10 years and beyond. b1245 Even taking the administration’s optimistic numbers at face value, according to the CBO this administration’s budget spends hundreds of billions of dollars from the Social Security trust fund. Moreover, the Social Security surpluses  that  the budget depletes are needed to finance the benefits promised under  existing  law.  Strengthening these programs to prepare for the baby boom’s retirement or adding even the administration’s  inadequate prescription drug benefit  requires  resources outside of these surpluses. Since the budget does not provide such resources, these programs will  require benefit cuts or even more borrowing to remain sound for the long term, as noted in the recent report of the President’s hand-picked Social Security Commission. The administration proposes a budget with a $1.5 trillion on-budget deficit over the next 10 years. Two weeks ago, the Congressional Budget Office confirmed that the enacted tax cut was the largest single factor in the $4 trillion deterioration of the budget. Now, the administration proposes to undermine the fiscal outlook with about an additional  $600 billion  in  tax  cuts. Every penny of these additional tax cuts comes out of Social Security and Medicare trust fund surpluses. In addition to this assault on the Social Security surplus, the Social Security Commission marks further danger to this highly successful program. To nobody’s surprise, the commission is a strong advocate to create individually controlled, voluntary personal retirement accounts. I supported the establishment of USA accounts, which would exist as a separate retirement vehicle outside of Social Security and would include Federal matching  funds  to  encourage Americans to save. However, this administration’s plan, through this commission, would divert $1 trillion out of the Social Security system and into private accounts. This will double Social Security’s shortfall and deplete VerDate 11-MAY-2000 00:13 Mar 13, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K12MR7.003 pfrm02 PsN: H12PT1 ",2002

93,House,107,0.39,9,2002-03-12,Ms. HART.," Mr. Speaker, I rise also in support of the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act. The law would require that babies born alive be  treated as babies.  It seems simple. I agree with the gentleman that should be the way it is today. But, unfortunately, our society has blurred this issue and some have made it, one, an issue of the parents’ interest, or in this case, lack of interest in a newborn. Babies now born at 23 weeks generally  survive. Some born even earlier have survived. Some critics of the legislation argue it is not necessary because what was alleged by one of our witnesses and several others that we have spoken with does not happen. b1430 It currently does happen. It clearly does happen. We would not be dealing with this issue if it did not happen. Ms. Stanek was just one of the individuals we  spoke with  through  the committee. She brought with her other people who had also witnessed  this type of action in a hospital, no less; a place where people go to receive care. Unfortunately, babies involved in induced-labor abortions were left to die, even though those children were born alive. It is every instance that will be covered, however. A child born alive, whether the labor is induced or not, should be treated as a child. It seems like it should not be necessary for us to make this law. However, it was stated earlier today that viable, healthy infants are being permitted to die according to those of us who support this legislation. If we remove  those  adjectives,  viable  and healthy, that seems to except that infants who maybe are not healthy are being left to die. Is it okay for us to allow unhealthy or maybe even unviable infants to be left to die on a cold shelf abandoned in some kind of cart in a hospital? It is not. This society must stand up  for those who are the weakest. It is our responsibility as Members of the House to do so. That is why we support the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it as well. ",2002
94,House,107,-0.521,9,2002-03-12,Mrs. JONES of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to oppose H.R. 2175, the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2001. Many  individuals who support a woman’s right  to choose have argued  that  this bill  is harmless because  it restates existing  law.  I oppose  this bill because  it mischaracterizes current abortion  rights  law and may create confusion  among  physicians who  provide emergency care  to pregnant women. Concerns have been raised that H.R. 2175 would obligate physicians  to provide care beyond recognized standards, and that failure to adhere would raise the issue of liability. More importantly, I oppose this bill because it is yet another attempt  to chip away at a woman’s right to choose. Pro-life advocates have opposed and attempted to erode reproductive rights in a number of ways: by imposing waiting periods, by denying women  information about  their own health  choices,  by  restricting  or  removing funding for contraception and family planning efforts, and at the most radical by terrorizing physicians and clinic workers. The current Administration has signaled its intent to pursue this line of advocacy. In April 2001 the Bush Administration proposed  to remove contraceptive coverage  for federal employees. Only a groundwell of opposition restored this benefit, which the Office of Management and Budget found added nothing to the cost of federal health benefits. Again in 2002, the Bush Administration has proposed to end contraceptive coverage for federal employees, even  though ending such coverage would violate Title VII, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination  in  the workplace.  In addition, the Administration has proposed cutting Title X funding family planning programs that provide critical family planning and related health services to millions of low-income families. Make no mistake—advocating on behalf of women’s health care and reproductive rights entails stating the core issue of reproductive rights: Who gets to decide? Who decides what a woman does with her own body? Access to birth control and abortion is part of the larger struggle for access to health care for all women. In 1973 the Supreme Court legalized abortion. Yet  today, 20% of women who want to have an abortion cannot obtain one. Lack of  funding,  restrictive  legislation, and campaigns of terror and harassment by the  antiabortion movement  have  severely eroded abortion rights. While public attention has  focused on restrictions of women’s choices through legislation and  judicial decisions, abortion services have been undermined  in more basic ways. Through harassment and violence directed at doctors and other health care providers, as well as medical schools and hospitals, antichoice  forces  have  discouraged  both  the teaching and provision of abortions. As a result, abortion services have been eliminated in large parts of the country and a critical shortage of abortion providers and services has developed. As with all other attacks on access to abortion, these restrictions have the greatest impact on  low-income women, rural women, and women of color. A number of solutions support reproductive rights: for medical Opposing hospital mergers with  institutions that prohibit reproductive health services; Developing the role of non-physician clinicians as women’s healthcare providers, including  nurses, midwives,  nurse  practitioners, and physicians assistants in abortion; Increasing abortion training  residents; Increasing  awareness  of  reproductive choice and abortion access as a public health issue and encouraging research in the field; Creating innovative public education campaigns; Publishing  directories  of  reproductive health and abortion providers  in English, Spanish, and other languages where women lack access to information and health services; Creating coalitions of like-minded organizations which have an interest in women’s reproductive health and abortion, such as: American Civil Liberties Union, NARAL, NOW, National Lawyer’s Guild, National Women’s Law Center, and numerous health care providers and unaffiliated activists. In the 1986 case Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Justice Harry Blackmun stated  ‘Few decisions are more personal and intimate, more properly private, or more basic to individual dignity and autonomy, than a woman ’s decision whether to end her pregnancy. A woman’s  right  to make that choice freely is fundamental.’ The  terrorist events of 2001  focused our country on fundamental values such as freedom, commitment, and tolerance. Bills such as the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2001 ultimately seek to curtail the freedom of choice held dear by the majority of the American public. We cannot afford  to  ignore challenges which seek to restrict the freedom of women to control their reproductive capacity, their decision to bear children, and the shape of their destiny. ",2002

96,House,107,0.162,23,2002-03-12,Mrs. ROUKEMA.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in strong opposition to H.R. 1885 and its provision to extend Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. I support the foundation of H.R. 1885. It is designed to reform and enhance border security and visa screening procedures. As we mark the six-month anniversary of the attack on America, we need to take these important steps to bolster homeland security and protect our citizens and institutions. That’s why I am outraged that this Administration  and  this Congressional  Leadership would support inserting the Section 245i extension  into  this bill.  In my opinion,  the  two major provisions of H.R. 1885 work at dangerous cross-purposes. While the border security and visa screening reforms will enhance homeland security,  the 245(i) extension will actually jeopardize homeland security by subjecting illegal aliens to a just cursory domestic police record check before allowing them permanent  legal residence here. The extension also rewards individuals who have already violated our U.S. law. This extension is wrong, dangerously wrong, for important reasons: It allows hundreds of  thousands of  illegal aliens  to  stay  permanently without  going through face-to-face interviews in our embassies abroad, conducted  in  their native  languages. It entices millions more foreign nationals to enter the country without screening in hopes that  they,  too, will be  rewarded  for  their lawbreaking. It  increases  permanent U.S.  population growth by creating a new tidal wave of amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants and the enticement for millions more to move to the U.S. Finally, I am deeply concerned that Section 245(i) places the responsibility for background checks with the INS, an agency that has been justifiably criticized  for  its  lack of effectiveness— ineptitude  that has been highlighted since 9– 11. Consular officers  in embassies overseas, not the INS, should have the responsibility to conduct background checks. They are  the ones with the expertise in the language and procedures of the countries in which they are stationed, as well as  longstanding  relationships with police officials in the home country. Consular officials are the ones who develop hands-on knowledge of local customs, including  criminal enterprises and  terror groups. That ’s precisely why  they are stationed  incountry. They are more prepared and better positioned than INS officials here in the United States  to screen potential  immigrants effectively. Mr. Speaker, we are a country of laws. One of the shining principles of our democracy is equal justice under the law. In this context, we cannot choose which laws we will obey and which ones we will ignore. Extension of 245(i) will send the message around the globe that the United States tolerates and,  indeed, encourages  individuals  to break our immigration laws. By effectively rewarding  individuals who either entered  the country illegally or overstayed their legal welcome, we are harming  thousands of  immigrants who played by  the rules every year. They  followed our procedures. They waited patiently  in  their home countries  for entry visas. Today’s debate  tells  them  they were naı¨ve and stupid to wait. Frankly, I am shocked and appalled that this debate is taking place. Just yesterday, this nation paused to mark the six-month anniversary of  the attack on America. Many of my colleagues attended solemn ceremonies in New York, at  the Pentagon, at  the White House and in Pennsylvania. And how does this House mark the anniversary? By debating a bill that promotes illegal behavior in our immigration policy and, in the process, leaves our nation vulnerable to potential terror attack. If September 11th  taught us anything,  it taught us that no threat to American security can be taken lightly any longer. The Administration, the Congress, the courts, the states, law enforcement,  the American people must work  together  to ensure our national safety. Passage of this extension has the potential to increase the threat to that safety by allowing criminals,  ranging  from  drug  pushers  to thieves  to murderers  to suicide bombers,  to remain in America legally. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the bill on  the  floor  today  is an amended version of H.R. 1885, which is a bill to extend Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Section 245(i) of  the  Immigration and Nationality Act permits certain undocumented immigrants in the U.S. to adjust their status and become lawful permanent residents. More specifically, section 245(i) allows persons—who qualify  for an  immigrant visa by having a close  relative or employer petition filed on  their behalf, but entered without  inspection or otherwise violated their status and thus are ineligible to apply for adjustment of status in the United States—to apply if they pay a $1,000 penalty. Not only must an undocumented immigrant be eligible for an immigrant visa and have a visa  immediately available  to him or her  in order to make use of section 245(i), but the person can also not be barred by some other provision of  the  Immigration and Nationality Act. Without section 245(i), most undocumented immigrants who are otherwise eligible for an immigrant visa would be required to leave the United States in order to adjust their status. This would subject them to the long bars to their admissibility. Furthermore, it is important to note that Section 245(i) does not protect an undocumented  immigrant  from deportation  if the alien is encountered by authorities prior to his or her visa becoming available; section 245(i) is simply a device that an immigrant can use at  the  time of his or her adjustment  to avoid having to go back to his or her home country to pick up his or her visa. Section 245(i) was first enacted in 1994 for a  three year period.  It was  reauthorized  in 1996, and again in 1997. The reauthorization in 1997 required that only those who had filed applications or petitions for an immigrant visa by January 1998 could make use of it. The 106th Congress extended the filing deadline to April 30, 2001, requiring at that time that applicants be in the United States prior to December 21, 2000. However, after Congress extended the filing deadline to April 30, 2001, the regulations for section 245(i) were only introduced on March 26, 2001—giving people a month to find out about the law as well as take action and file petitions or applications before  the April 30, 2001 filing deadline. In addition to the short amount of time in which people had access to the regulations, massive misinformation about section 245(i) had been spread —starting out with a widespread belief  that 245(i) was a general amnesty, which it was not. As was estimated, thousands of people who were expected to benefit did not have enough time to file the proper petition or application. Many of those who waited in lines at INS offices nationwide never made it to the front of the line. And many people were turned away because  they were not prepared  to  file  the correct application or petition, because of a lack of accurate  information. Others  tried  to seek  legal counsel  in  time but were unsuccessful due to attorneys having been booked for appointments due  to  the  flood of people seeking help. The Senate amended H.R. 1885 in an attempt to address the unfair situation caused by the regulations being published so close to the April 30, 2001. The amended H.R. 1885, extends section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act until November 30, 2002, or 120 days after the promulgation of final or interim final regulations implementing the bill, whichever occurs earlier. It requires, as well, that the relationship giving rise to the petitions (i.e., marriage) be entered into by August 15, 2001. So the familial relationship must have existed by August 15, 2001, or the application for labor certification that is the basis of such petition for classification was  filed  before August  15, 2001. Although I recognize the importance of the compromise legislation and the fact that it will benefit many people,  the House  is about  to pass a section 245(i) extension that is not the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 02:03 Mar 13, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A12MR7.011 pfrm02 PsN: H12PT1 ",2002
97,House,107,-0.386,30,2002-03-12,Mrs. MALONEY of New York.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 339, and to honor the Census Bureau and the thousand’s of dedicated employees. The employees of our federal statistical system labor day in and out to provide the information necessary to govern our country and manage our economy. Businesses use federal data to locate plants and retail outlets. Local governments used federal data to comply with regulations and  to plan  for  the  future. Few people stop to wonder how all of those numbers are out our finger tips at a moments notice. There are eleven major statistical agencies in  the  federal government:  the Bureau of Labor Statistics; the Bureau of Economic Statistics; the Bureau of Transportation Statistics; the U.S. Census Bureau; the National Center for Education Statistics;  the Statistics of  Income at  the  IRS;  the Energy  Information Agency; the Bureau of Justice Statistics; the National Agricultural Statistical Service and the Economic Research Service with the Department of Agriculture; and the National Center for Health Statistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics and  the U.S. Census Bureau are  the two  largest agencies when you exclude  the decennial census. The decennial census is the largest single activity undertaken by a statistical agency. The census is a management challenge that few agencies, statistical or otherwise, could accomplish. In the year of the census, the Census Bureau opens and closes over 500 offices. The agency goes from a staff of 7 to 10 thousand, to 500,000 and back again in a period  of  about  three months. That means 500,000 people must be hired. Thousand more must be  recruited and  interviewed.  In addition to hiring and training staff, the census requires the management of multiple contracts each of which is measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Then, of course, the data must be tabulated and prepared for the President— all within a year. That would be a major accomplishment for any agency. However,  that  is only one of many census performed by  the Census Bureau. Furthermore, censuses are not their only line of business. The Census Bureau collects data for a number of other agencies within the federal government. To list all of the accomplishments of the employees at  the Census Bureau would  take more time that both sides have today. Suffice it  to say, as a country we are  fortunate  to have a statistical agency staffed with professionals who produce daily,  the  information necessary  to guide public policy. We salute those employees  today as we celebrate  the 100th anniversary of the Census Bureau. ",2002

99,House,107,-0.402,37,2002-03-12,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, let me say in the beginning that myself and other Democrats over the last week, and certainly over the next few weeks, will take to the  floor repeatedly to bring up the issue of the Social Security trust fund, and our concern that the President and the Republican leadership  in the House are very determined to push for changes in Social Security that would lead to privatization, and at the same time, the budget that the Republican leadership will bring up to the floor, I understand it will be coming up as early as next week, unfortunately goes into deficit and effectively spends the Social Security trust fund, once again, we have not had this for a couple of years, in order to pay for current expenses. The Republican proposal to privatize Social Security, as well as the proposal to spend the Social Security trust fund for basically ongoing government operations unrelated to a retirement benefit, both of these proposals by the Republican leadership in the House and by the President, will undermine Social Security and make it more difficult  for Social Security to remain solvent, and basically shorten the time before we face a crisis in Social Security when benefits will be cut or will no longer be available. That is the concern that I and other Democrats have, and we will be speaking out against it because we believe very strongly that none of these things should happen, that we should not privatize Social Security and  that we should not be spending the Social Security trust fund to pay for ongoing expenses. Let me start, Mr. Speaker, by pointing out that Social Security is probably the most successful social program the Federal Government has ever implemented. It provides an unparalleled safety net for the vast majority of America’s seniors. For two-thirds of the elderly, Social Security  is their major source of income. For one-third of the elderly, Social Security is virtually their only source of income. And for these reasons, and a great many others, we must do everything in our power to protect and strengthen the existing Social Security program for the short and the long term. Mr. Speaker, I gathered some information that gives us some idea about the importance of the Social Security program and also how successful it is, how unique it is, and I wanted to go through a little of that, if I could, in a little detail, not a great deal of detail. Why  is Social Security  important? As I said, it is the single largest source of retirement  income  in the United States. For six in ten seniors, Social Security provides half or more of their total income. Among elderly widows, Social Security provides nearly threequarters of their income, on average. And four in ten widows rely on Social Security to provide 90 percent or more of their income. But it is not just a retirement income program. About 30 percent of Social Security beneficiaries receive disability or survivor benefits. We tend to forget that. We tend to think it is only a program for seniors. For a 27-year-old worker with a spouse and two children, Social Security provides the equivalent of a $403,000 life insurance policy or a $353,000 disability insurance policy. The vast majority of workers would be unable  to  obtain  similar  coverage through the private market. Social Security is also family insurance. It provides benefits for elderly widows and young parents who have lost a spouse. It provides a dependable monthly income to children who have lost a parent to death or disability. It even pays benefits to those who become severely disabled as children and remain dependent, as adults, on a parent who receives Social Security. Now, a lot of people, and I find this to be often true about some of my Republican  colleagues,  they will  say, Well, Social Security is just another government program, it is a waste of money, it is not administered well. We hear these kinds of criticisms. The reality is very different. There is no government program that is more successful than Social Security. b2000 It is the single most effective antipoverty program. Its benefits lift over 11 million  seniors  out  of  poverty. Thanks to Social Security, the poverty rate of elderly persons is only 8 percent. Without it, nearly half of retirees would live in poverty. That was the case before we set it up. More than half of the people over 65 lived in poverty before Social Security came on board. Over the course of its 67-year history, Congress has prudently managed the Social Security program. Each year the Social Security board of trustees issues a  report  showing  short-range and long-range 75-year projections of the income and costs of the system. Congress uses these projections to balance the promise to pay future benefits against workers’ desire and ability to pay for them, and it has adjusted the program periodically in light of changing economic and demographic conditions. So we have had to change it, but we have always changed it in a positive way. Finally, I would stress that Social Security  is  administered  very  efficiently. Only one penny of every dollar Social Security spends is for administration. The rest goes directly to beneficiaries in their monthly checks. Let me say just a few more things about the uniqueness of Social Security. It is nearly universal. Over 95 percent of all workers are covered by it. In contrast, less than 50 percent of workers have employer pension coverage on their jobs. It is also totally portable. It goes with a worker from job to job. Traditionally, private sector pension plans lose value if a worker changes a job. It is also, and this is very important, a defined benefit. That is, its benefits are determined according to the level of a worker’s earnings and years of work. So this type of pension system provides income continuity in retirement by replacing a fixed percentage of a worker’s preretirement earnings. Benefits are paid as long as the worker and his or her spouse lives and the monthly VerDate 11-MAY-2000 04:14 Mar 13, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K12MR7.066 pfrm02 PsN: H12PT1 ",2002

They are  great examples of team spirit and cooperation: the Santa Clara University  women’s soccer team and the Stanford  University women’s volleyball team.  The Santa Clara University women’s  soccer team won the 2001 NCAA College  Cup Championship this past fall. The  team won  its  first national title  in  their fifth trip to the College Cup, and  this is the first outright NCAA championship in the school’s history.  The members of the 2001 Santa Clara  University women’s soccer team are:  Holly Azevedo; Jessica Ballweg; Emma  Borst; Lana Bowen;  Jaclyn Campi;  Kristi Candau; Ynez Carrasco; Kerry  Cathcart;  Devvyn  Hawkins;  Bree  Horvath; Anna Kraus; Leslie Osborne;  Erin Pearson; Chardonnay Poole; Erin  Sharpe;  Katie  Sheppard;  Danielle  Slaton;  Alyssa  Sobolik;  Taline  Tahmassian; Allie Teague; Aly Wagner;  and Veronica Zepeda.  I congratulate the team and their  head coach, Jerry Smith.  The  Stanford University women’s  volleyball team won the 2001 NCAA National Championship this past fall. The  team won its fifth national championship, which is a record.  The members of the 2001 Stanford  University women’s  volleyball  team  are: Michelle Chambers; Tara Conrad;  Sara Dukes; Leahi Hall; Jennifer Harvey; Jennifer Hucke; Ashley Ivy; Emily  Lawrence; Robyn Lewis; Sara McGee;  Ogonna Nnamani; Anna Robinson; Sara  Sandrik; and Logan Tom.  I congratulate the team and their  head coach, John Dunning.  Both teams are an inspiration to all,  especially to young women and girls  who are themselves members of sports  teams. I wish all the team members the  best in whatever road they find themselves on after this great accomplishment.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by his secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting a withdrawal and  sundry nominations which were  referred  to  the Committee on Armed  Services.

A message from the President of  the United States, transmitting, pursuant to  law, the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and  the Government of Australia on Social Security; to the Committee on Finance.  To the Congress of the United States:  Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the  Social Security Act, as amended by the  Social Security Amendments of 1977  (Public Law 95–216, 42 U.S.C. 433(e)(1)),  I transmit herewith the Agreement Between the Government of the United  States of America and the Government  of Australia on Social Security, which  consists of two separate instruments: a  principal agreement and an administrative arrangement along with a paragraph-by-paragraph  explanation  of  each provision. The Agreement was  signed at Canberra on September 27,  2001.  The United States-Australia Agreement is similar in objective to the social  security agreements already  in  force with Austria, Belgium, Canada,  Chile,  Finland,  France,  Germany,  Greece, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and  the United Kingdom. Such bilateral  agreements provide for limited coordination between the United States and  foreign  social  security  systems  to  eliminate dual social security coverage  and taxation, and to help prevent the  lost benefit protection that can occur  when workers divide their careers between  two  countries.  The  United  States-Australia Agreement  contains  all provisions mandated by section 233  and other provisions that I deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of section 233, pursuant to section 233(c)(4).  I also transmit for the information of  the Congress a report prepared by the  Social  Security Administration  explaining the key points of the Agreement. Annexed to this report is the report required by section 233(e)(1) of the  Social Security Act, a report on the effect of the Agreement on income and  expenditures of the U.S. Social Security program and the number of individuals affected by the Agreement. The  Department of State and the Social Security  Administration  have  recommended the Agreement and related  documents to me.  I commend the United States-Australia Social Security Agreement and  related documents.  THEWHITEHOUSE, March 12, 2002.  GEORGEW. BUSH.

Res. 368, commending the great work  that  the Pentagon  renovation program and its contractors have accomplished  in  swiftly  repairing  the Pentagon after the devastating attack of September 11, 2001. I thank our distinguished  colleague,  the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. FOLEY),  for sponsoring this resolution. Shortly after the tragic event of September 11, I led a small delegation to visit the Pentagon. The devastation was truly appalling, and I was sure that a lengthy period would be required to repair such extensive damage. Of course, I am glad to report that I was wrong. The dedication and superhuman efforts of the Pentagon renovation program office and its contractors have defied all predictions in their ability to work miracles. The removal of the debris and restoration of the damaged area aptly called the Phoenix Project has amazed the world in the speed of its operation. The damaged wedge had been virtually renovated as part of the ongoing project to refurbish the Pentagon before the plane struck last September. Determined to finish the job and have people back at their desk by September 11 of this year, the dedicated team of government and  contract  employees went into immediate action. Work on the crash site was conducted around the clock for three months and is now down to a mere 20 hours a day. I understand that workers had to be forced to take time off for Christmas and have protested the cessation of the 24-hour day operations. The pace and skill of this reconstruction effort is truly a masterpiece of American ingenuity and effort and is a positive reaction to the evil of September 11 of last year. b1445 Mr. Speaker, all involved in this extraordinary effort deserve our deepest gratitude. Finally, Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities, I pay close attention  to  military  construction projects. I have never seen one proceed at this pace and sincerely hope that there is never a reason to proceed at this pace again. But  these  intrepid souls have shown the world what American spirit and resolve are all about. Many have worked on this project and they are heroes, in my mind. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that Members will all support H. Res. 368, but, Mr. Speaker, let me just commend the gentleman from Florida (Mr. FOLEY) for his great efforts in bringing this resolution to us. It is something that I think is very worthwhile for us to note here in an official way today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2002
108,House,107,-0.432,12,2002-03-19,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 368, introduced by my  colleague,  the  gentleman  from Florida (Mr. FOLEY), as indicated by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SAXTON), and endorsed by numerous other Members of the House. The resolution  commends  the  outstanding progress made thus  far by the Pentagon Renovation Program and its contractors in reconstructing the section of the Pentagon damaged by the terrorist attack. On September 11, 2001, Mr. Speaker, our Nation suffered  four unprovoked terrorist attacks, three of which found their aim in two of our most powerful symbols of strength and democracy. Two days after the attacks, the Army asked the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SAXTON), myself, and several other Members  involved  in  the  Subcommittee on Military Construction to visit the Pentagon site and survey the damage sustained there. Like the rest of  the American  public, we were stunned by the gash in what had previously seemed to be the impenetrable exterior of the Pentagon. What really caught our attention, though, was the work already under way. A small city of support was buzzing on the lawn. Firefighters were still battling flare-ups and hot spots, and military and civilian personnel were securing  the  building  and  sifting through the debris. No one was waiting to be told what to do. They were just doing what they knew needed to be done. The Pentagon Renovation Program has exceeded every expectation. The American public realized the significance of healing this visible wound as soon  as  possible,  and  the Phoenix Project has made it a reality. Government and contract personnel put their shoulders to the wheel, at times laboring around the clock, to tear down the most severely damaged sections and to rebuild it from the ground up. Demolition was  supposed  to  take  7 or  8 months, Mr. Speaker. The team completed it in 1 month and 1 day. That is the power of American resolve. I have the utmost confidence that the Renovation Program will meet its ultimate goal to have people back at their  desks  by September  10,  2002. There could be no greater tribute to those who lost their lives than to know that the men and women of the Department of Defense are once again doing the business of the country from their proper Pentagon offices. Mr. Speaker,  let  us  honor  these Americans, public workers and private citizens, willing to dedicate themselves to the rebuilding of our national morale. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2002
109,House,107,0.311,12,2002-03-19,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and, thus, giving me the opportunity to praise  so many  fabulous  and  phenomenal workers at the Pentagon. I would first like to thank the gentleman  from Arizona  (Mr. STUMP), Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, for expediting this important resolution. The Committee worked especially quickly with the staff  from the Pentagon to move this resolution forward, House Resolution  368,  for which I know all of us are grateful. Within 48 hours, 70-plus colleagues on both sides of the aisle quickly joined me in saluting the men and women at the Pentagon. Mr. Speaker, anyone who has driven by the Pentagon recently has been a firsthand witness to the amazing determination and depth of the American spirit. That spirit is embodied in all the workers who are resurrecting the Pentagon in a reconstruction project aptly named Project Phoenix. Just 6 short months ago, terrorists attempted to attack and raze a symbol of America. They  found  they  could  barely scratch the surface. From  the  individuals who  immediately responded to the attack delivering triage, to the many people affected by the explosion, to the ongoing efforts of Project Phoenix, America’s resolve and strength are clear and evident. Anyone who has seen the Pentagon lately has seen a miracle of reconstruction, and behind that miracle are all the workers who have clearly taken hold of this project, showing the world that what evil tries to destroy can be rebuilt stronger, bigger, and better. It is as clear as the Pentagon itself that these workers are adding more than bricks and mortar to this cherished building; they are leaving an imprint of their dedication that rose from the ashes of September 11. Starting almost  immediately after  the attack, workers labored 24 hours a day to clear the area of over 400,000 square feet of debris, a project they completed amazingly  in only a  little more  than  1 month. They are now 6 weeks ahead of schedule, with an ever-visible goal in site. Above the construction site on the building is a clock counting down to September 11, 2002. The workers made a commitment  that  they would have Pentagon employees working back at their desks in the outer ring of the Pentagon by September 11, 2002. And as that clock counts down, it is a constant reminder of the importance of this work.

110,House,107,0.231,19,2002-03-19,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as I conclude our debate here today, I want to thank my colleagues on  the committee and  subcommittee  for  their  support  in attempting to craft important reauthorization legislation that makes some reforms that I think are necessary. These reforms, and many others, are always resisted by the executive branch; but it is our responsibility as Congress, as authorizers, to in fact do what is appropriate  to make  sure  the  programs work, that they serve their original purposes or such new purposes as the Congress assigns. b1545 I want to particularly thank the gentlewoman  from  New  York  (Mrs. MALONEY) for her very constructive approach  to  the committee’s deliberations and her continued support for the Export-Import Bank. I would say to the ranking members of  the  committee  and  the  subcommittee, I have confidence we can work together to put together a structured rule that will provide an opportunity to debate the crucial amendments that were offered, but not successfully, at the subcommittee or committee level, and still avoid some of the things that would be very much contrary to the national interest. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the legislation. ",2002
111,House,107,0.382,19,2002-03-19,Mr. OXLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong support of  this measure and encourage my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of extending the authorization of the Export-Import for an additional thirty days while the details of the full authorization are finalized. The Financial Service Committee has been working diligently to bring this authorization to completion, however; the events of September 11 and the anthrax contamination on Capitol Hill have delayed the process considerably. The full reauthorization makes  several  strong  improvements to the Ex-Im charter, which will enable it to deliver more U.S. goods to foreign customers. We are currently in negotiations with the Department of  the Treasury  to  finalize some technical concerns with the full reauthorization and expect to have resolution of these issues soon. This thirty day extension of Ex-Im’s authorization will enable the Bank to continue its important work  of  encouraging U.S.  exports overseas and promoting U.S.  jobs. Ex-Im plays a key role in leveling the playing field between U.S. and  foreign based exporters. Without the activities of Ex-Im, U.S. exporters would be at a distinct disadvantage against foreign exporters who receive subsidies from their foreign export credit agencies. With the help of Ex-Im  loans,  insurance and guarantees, U.S. exporters can counter export credits offered to foreign competitors and reach critical overseas markets. Ex-Im helps  increase the number of U.S. exports,  it encourages trade and it helps sustain U.S. jobs. Without  this extension, Ex-Im will have  to wind up its current outstanding business and will not be able  to make any new commitments  for  the export of U.S. manufactured goods. This will have a negative effect on jobs and will  inhibit our economic  recovery at a time when we are working to emerge from a period of high unemployment and low growth. Passage of this measure is critical to the U.S. economy, to U.S. workers and to U.S. manufacturers. In a perfect marketplace there would be no need for export credit agencies, however; the realities of today’s international trading system demand  that Ex-Im operate aggressively  to support  the sale of U.S. products abroad. Every major actor in international trade utilizes an export credit agency similar to the Ex-Im Bank  to promote  its  trade  initiatives. Ex-Im keeps U.S. exporters competitive, without  it foreign manufacturers would be able to enter VerDate 11-MAY-2000 03:55 Mar 20, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K19MR7.043 pfrm04 PsN: H19PT1 ’ ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ’ ‘ ’ ",2002

113,House,107,-0.509,26,2002-03-19,Mr. NADLER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remaining time. I am glad here we are finally today, two days after the benefits ran out in New York, two days before they run out  in Virginia. Unfortunately,  this bill is not as the bill Senator CLINTON originally passed in the Senate, as the bill that almost passed here by unanimous consent last December but arrived a few minutes too late from the Senate, and as the bill that I sponsored that was reported out of the committee unanimously about 3 weeks ago did, all of those bills said a 26-week extension. Unfortunately, this bill only says 13week  extension. Unfortunately,  this also means that the Senate is going to have to take time presumably next week or later this week to change its bill to match our 13 weeks before it goes to the President, and there will be at least a week interruption in benefits because we delayed in doing our job in getting this bill to the floor. As I said before, we are not talking here about 39 weeks of benefits for individuals, but of 39 weeks of eligibility for the program from the date the disaster was declared. Most people did not start getting DUA right away. It took the  bureaucracy  some  time.  They started getting it in November or December, which means they are getting it for less than 26 weeks and with this bill for less than 39 weeks. We will probably have to, in light of how difficult it is for some people who were thrown out of work specifically by the attack on our country, we will probably have to be back here extending it for another 13 weeks later. I am appreciative of the work especially of the gentleman from New York (Mr. QUINN) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. HOSTETTLER) and of others and of the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. OBERSTAR), who helped get this bill to the floor; and I am hopeful that we will pass this bill today so that the interruption in benefits for the people in New York and in Virginia who were victimized by the attack directly will be as short as possible, and I extend my appreciation to all of them. And I urge approval of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ",2002
114,House,107,0.402,33,2002-03-19,Mr. GALLEGLY.," Mr. Speaker, since regaining  its  independence  in 1991, Ukraine’s democracy has made significant progress but has not been without its difficult periods. Nowhere has the integrity of the country’s political system been more challenged than in its electoral process. On March 31, Ukraine will hold its third election for parliament. This election will be a critical test of the strength of Ukraine’s evolving democracy and its new election laws. Given the importance of a strong and stable Ukraine in the region, the importance of our relations with Ukraine and our keen interest in Ukraine’s continued emergence as a responsible, democratic member of the international community, we are naturally interested in the electoral process as well as progress  the country has made  in  the areas of human rights, rule of law, freedom of expression and the strength of its democratic institutions. In this context, the United States Congress, through H. Res. 339, expresses its interest in, and concerns  for, a genuinely  free and  fair parliamentary election process which enables all  the various political parties and election blocs to compete on a level playing field; allows the voters to acquire objective information about  the political candidates; and expects all parties  to  the election  to observe their own laws. Historically, since 1991, elections in Ukraine have been marred by problems such as intimidation  of  journalists  and  opposition  candidates; denial of access to the media; unbalanced news coverage; abuse of power and political position by government officials; and the illegal use of public funds. Today, we have received reports from Ukraine that the current election period has been beset by similar allegations of individuals or groups illegally trying to influence the outcome of the elections. This is not to say that the overall electoral process is seriously flawed. The Ukraine parliament has passed a positive new election law. What H. Res. 339 does say, however, is that the reported abuses of the election law have to be stopped, that the government has the  responsibility  to enforce  its election  law fairly, and that every effort must be taken to JOSEPH HOEFFEL reCHRISTOPHER ensure that a free, fair and transparent election take place on March 31. This  resolution we are considering  today does represent a genuine concern that the reported activities of some could cast a negative cloud over  these elections and  the entire democratic process in Ukraine. The authors of  this Resolution are  to be congratulated  for bringing  these problems  to our attention, and we hope the resolution is seen in a positive and constructive way inside Ukraine. By addressing these concerns, Ukraine can only be better off and  its democracy made stronger I urge passage of  this  resolution and  serve the balance of my time. ",2002
115,House,107,-0.465,33,2002-03-19,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be  joined by my colleagues, Representatives  and  SMITH, in offering this important resolution. H. Res. 339 urges the Government of Ukraine to ensure a democratic,  transparent, and  fair election process  leading up  to  its March 31 parliamentary elections. Just over 10 years after gaining  its  independence  from  the  Soviet  bloc, Ukraine stands at a crossroads. On Sunday, March 31, Ukraine will hold its third parliamentary elections since becoming independent. It is widely believed that the outcome of the parliamentary elections will determine whether Ukraine continues to pursue democratic reforms, or experiences further political turmoil. As a founding member and Co-chair of the Congressional  Ukrainian  Caucus,  I  have watched  the growth of  this new nation with keen  interest. Their path  to democratization has not been easy. More troubling, however, has been a series of scandals involving government corruption over the past 2 years. In April 2001, I was troubled to learn about the Ukrainian Parliament’s vote to remove reformminded Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko. This change in government came in the midst of the ongoing political turmoil resulting from allegations over the involvement of President Leonid Kuchma in the case of murdered journalist Heorhiy Gongadze. Meanwhile, reports of government corruption and harassment of the media have  raised concerns about  the Ukrainian government’s commitment to democratic principles. I have spoken out for a more democratic Ukraine and expressed my continued concern about the lack of progress in the Gongadze case and recent political instability. According  to  the Organization  for Security and Cooperation  in Europe Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights’ final report on Ukraine’s most recent national election,  the presidential election of 1999 was marred by violations of Ukrainian election law and  failed  to meet a significant number of OSCE election commitments. There  is now concern that the 2002 parliamentary elections will be compromised by similar violations. Recent reports on the 2002 parliamentary elections released by the Committee on Voters of Ukraine (CVU), a leading Ukrainian watchdog group on elections, have cited numerous violations in the campaign process. The intent of this resolution is to make the Government of Ukraine aware  that  the U.S. Congress is monitoring the conduct of the parliamentary election process closely, and will not just be focusing on Election Day results. My  resolution  urges  the Government  of Ukraine to enforce impartially the new election law signed by President Kuchma in October. The resolution also urges the Government of Ukraine  to meet  its commitments on democratic elections and address issues identified by the OSCE in its final report on the 1999 elections, such as state  interference  in  the campaign and pressure on the media. Finally, the resolution calls upon the Government of Ukraine  to allow both domestic and  international election monitors access to the parliamentary election process. It is my hope that this resolution will send a clear message to the Government of Ukraine that the U.S. Congress will not simply rubber stamp  funding  requests  for Ukraine without also considering the serious issues involved in Ukraine’s democratic development.  In particular, the conduct of the 2002 parliamentary elections will have a major impact on funding considerations when Members of Congress are again confronted with the task of blancing their support  for  the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship with Ukraine’s progress in making democratic reforms. I urge my colleagues  to vote  for H. Res. 339, and  I encourage  the Government of Ukraine to conduct a democratic, transparent, and  fair parliamentary election process on March 31. ",2002

The real issue, of course, that is perhaps annoying to them, I think, or at least discomforting to them, and the one that was never referenced, but is the one accurate representation of the budget resolution that the majority party will offer tomorrow, is that it is balanced. That is to say, this budget resolution will set out for the Congress of the United States and for the American people a budget that will spend no more money than we will take in.

120,House,107,0.019,54,2002-03-19,Mr. STENHOLM.," Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for taking the time tonight to permit us again to discuss in what we hope are very rational, simpleto-understand terms what we are proposing. About a year ago we stood on this floor in opposition to the budget that ultimately passed. We are in the minority. When you are in the minority you usually lose. But we also stood on the floor and offered some comments and some suggestions that we thought made a little bit of common sense. That projected surplus that everybody was talking about was projected. It was a guesstimate. It was an estimate. It was not necessarily real. It was not necessarily unreal. But we thought the conservative thing to do with  our  economic  game  plan  for America was simply to take half of it and pay down the national debt. We were ridiculed by some saying that we were going to pay down the debt too fast. Others suggested that it was the people’s money and,  therefore, we are going to give it back to them. Very popular suggestion. Some of us were also reminding people that it was the people’s debt. Again, we were told do not worry about it. The national debt, the debt ceiling, is not going to have to be increased for 7 years. And we said, we hope you are right. We hope that these estimates are right. But just in case there may be an emergency, and we were not prophetic, no one could have foreseen September 11, 2001, but it happened. We did not believe necessarily the stock market was going to go up forever. We have always recognized that there are going to be ups and downs; and we had just come through 8 years, the longest single economic expansion in the history of our country doing whatever we were doing until the 1990s, which happened to be beginning to balance the Federal budget. And I give credit to my friends on the other side for being a part of that. And that is what we are here tonight saying, look at some of the things we did and said in the last 6 or 8 years and try to be a little bit consistent. What we are suggesting is that some of the same things that occurred in 1996 in which the majority party, the same folks that are in control tonight, demanded that ‘‘The President of the United States and the Congress shall enact legislation in the first session of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced budget not later than the fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.’’ What an irony. Here we are, March 19, 2002, recognizing that the balanced budgets that we have achieved over the last 2 or 3 years are now out the window as  far as the eye can see. The President’s budget that he submitted to the Congress does not balance without using Social Security for the next 10 years. We Blue Dogs are suggesting that is irresponsible budgeting;  that we,  in fact, are not unreasonable to ask the leadership of this body in the budget tomorrow and in the actions coming up to submit a plan that will balance the Federal budget by 2007 without using Social Security trust funds. That is all that we ask. Some of us have been here and voted consistently for these type of budgets. That is what I hope to do again tomorrow. But tonight we are calling attention to the fact that we believe it is irresponsible to ask the Congress to borrow $750 billion without a plan of how we are going to get our budget back in balance, other than the plan that we are now under which, by their own administration, does not balance until, well, it does not.

121,Senate,107,0.014,103,2002-03-19,Mr. JEFFORDS.," On September 19, shortly after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, James Woolsey, former Director of the CIA, ADM Thomas H. Moorer, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Robert C. McFarlane, former National Security Adviser to President Reagan, sent a letter urging in the strongest possible terms that we must take immediate action to address our energy security. One portion of the letter reads: Americans are aware of the enormous and complicated task ahead in dealing with the consequences  of  the  unprecedented  September  11  attack  against  our  nation. . . .There are actions that can and must be taken now. One of these critical issues is to advance America’s energy security. . . .We urge the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to immediately adopt the renewable portfolio standard. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join with me in heeding this advice from the great leaders of our Nation who know best why we should do this.

123,Senate,107,0.439,131,2002-03-19,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman LEAHY in sponsoring S. 2031, a bill that will protect intellectual property rights fully and  fairly  by  complying with  the Court’s  new  constitutional  requirements. This bill builds upon the same common-sense goals as  the  statutes that Senator HATCHchampioned a decade ago. I would like to commend both members for their outstanding leadership in this area. My hope is that S. 2031 will finally bring closure to our efforts in trying to clarify a complex and difficult issue for both Congress and the Courts. There are two sides to this issue and both are compelling. For  individuals and companies who make the investment and take the risk in creating new products and services, their property rights are at stake when a state infringes upon their  intellectual property. States on the other hand also want  to  protect  their  sovereignty under the Constitution and want to assert their intellectual property rights especially  in the context of private/ public partnerships where ownership issues may be in doubt, creating the prospect for protracted litigation. That is why this inherent conflict demands congressional action. With the arrival of the digital revolution where exact copies and reproductions can be made without limitations, this is an important economic issue for individuals and companies trying to compete in the marketplace. The question  is how to fashion a legislative remedy in light of recent Supreme Court decisions that struck down previous attempts to bring clarity to the issue. I believe the Leahy/Brownback bill is a  reasonable  compromise  solution without running afoul of the constitutional  issues highlighted by the Supreme Court in Seminole Tribe and the Florida Pre-paid cases. S. 2031 presents States with a choice. It  creates  reasonable  incentives  for States to waive their sovereign immunity  in  intellectual  property  cases. States that choose not to waive their immunity within 2 years after enactment would continue to enjoy many of the benefits in the intellectual property marketplace. However,  like private parties that sue States  for  infringement, States  that  sue private parties  for  infringement will not be able to recover any money damages unless they waive their immunity from liability in intellectual property cases. All other remedial actions will continue to be available to State litigants. As Chairman LEAHY previously observed, this  is clearly constitutional and avoids the concerns raised by the Courts with regard to past statutes addressing this matter. Under the Constitution’s Article  I spending power, Congress can attach limited conditions to a State’s receipt of Federal funds. Similarly, it would seem to me that a State’s receipt of Federal intellectual property protection under Article I’s intellectual property power can similarly  be  conditioned. Especially  in light of the commercial implications of this bill, it seems reasonable to expect that a condition to respect the rights of others  is a necessary and  logical complement to obtaining the full protections of  the Federal  intellectual property rights. I would also add that a recent GAO study initiated by Senator HATCHwhen he chaired the Judiciary Committee confirmed the lack of alternatives or remedies against State infringers. I would also like to add that this matter has repercussions which extend far beyond the domestic realm. The United States is one of the leading proponents for the enforcement of intellectual property rights throughout the world. That’s why we cannot afford to be inconsistent in our own observance of  intellectual  property  rights. Through  international  agreements such as TRIPs and NAFTA, the United States has vigorously challenged international institutions and other nations to adopt and enforce more extensive intellectual property laws. When States assert sovereign immunity for the purpose of  infringing upon  intellectual property rights, it damages the credibility of the United States internationally, and could possibly even lead to violations of our treaty obligations. Any decrease in the level of enforcement of  intellectual property rights around the world  is  likely to harm American businesses, because of our VerDate 11-MAY-2000 03:11 Mar 20, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A19MR6.054 pfrm02 PsN: S19PT1 ",2002

Matthew Croft of Waterford has just been named on of Michigan’s top two honorees in the 2002 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on  the most  impressive student volunteers in each State, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Matthew will be honored today with a ceremony to be held at his school. Matthew  is being honored  for developing and  implementing a program  to buy bicycle safety helmets  for needy  first and secondgrade children. As an eighth grader at Marist Academy, Matthew belongs to a group called STAND or Students Taking a New Direction. This  group was  organized  to  leadership through doing for others and learning to make healthy choices. After reading an article that stated only 20 percent of bike riders in Michigan wore helmets, Matthew decided  to  take action. He approached his fellow students in STAND and persuaded them to help correct this problem. Matthew helped organize several fundraisers, he obtained matching funds from AAA, and he approached retailers in the area to get a discount on the cost of the helmets. Once the helmets were purchased, Matthew was one of four presenters explaining to the elementary students that it is ‘ ‘cool’  to wear helmets. The students at Whitmer Resource Center in Pontiac responded enthusiastically. Through Matthew efforts more young children in Pontiac are practicing bicycle safety and wearing headgear that may save their lives. Matthew should be extremely pleased to be singled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. He is an example of the important role young Americans play in our communities. I ask the House of Representatives to join me in commending Matthew, his fellow students and faculty at Marist Academy and their families for making this a better world. f PRESIDENTIAL AWARDS FOR EXCELLENCE  IN  MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE TEACHING HON.

In addition to founding several photography organizations and serving as an active or honorary member of countless others, Mr. Campbell is a  tireless  resource  for  the  young photographers with whom he enjoys sharing his knowledge. Mr. Campbell, now retired, was a lifelong government employee at the Quabbin Reservoir. He has been a champion for keeping that magnificent body of water untouched by development. On March 29, 2002 The Valley Portfolio, a community photographic  resource center  in Springfield, MA will present to Mr. Campbell a lifetime achievement award at a reception. On this day, members of our community will gather to celebrate his contributions and accomplishments. Mr. Campbell’s awards and citations could fill a gallery. He may be the only photographer ever to receive four awards from the Photographic Society of America: (1) the Buxton Award (1958) as  the world’s  leading exhibitor of nature prints  that year,  (2)  the Stuyvescent Peabody Award (1972) as  the PSA member who has contributed the most to pictorial photography,’  (3) the Victor H. Scales award  (1973)  for  ‘diligent and meritorious service  to photography and  the Society and especially for his untiring efforts to teach and interest young people in photography and the arts,’  and (4) the Appreciation Award (1981), the Society’s highest award and the only one selected by its officers. Mr. Campbell’s organizational skills are legendary among those who have served alongside him  in  the various clubs and organizations he  founded  to which he belonged.  In 1967 he originated Focus: Outdoors, an annual three-day environmental conference that drew as many as 1,000 participants. Mr. Campbell was named an honorary member of the New England Camera Club Council  in 1968, that organization’s highest award. As president of the New England Camera Club Council he  took a sleepy organization with only 13 member clubs and increased that number to 83, increased the council’s treasury from less than $25 to more than $7,000, and created a weekend conference at the University of Massachusetts that grew from 300 to 2,000 participants in five years. Most recently, Mr. Campbell began the Pioneer Valley Photographic Artists, a group of talented photographers committed to elevating photography’s role as a fine art. Mr. Campbell’s skills also extend to the mechanical side of photography. He invented the Vis-0-Tray slide storage and editing system in the 1960s  to  facilitate organizing slides  for presentations. To photograph water skiers, he created a special platform on the towboat that has  since  been  copied  by  other  photographers. Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Les Campbell for his creative and positive influence on  the art of photography  in our community. BENJAMINA.

129,,107,0.043,152,2002-03-19,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to inform my colleagues of  the success of  the Gilman  International Scholarship Program established  to benefit low income college students receiving benefits in its first year of operation. Our Scholarship Program sponsored by the United States Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and administered by Institute of International Education, encourages American students  to study abroad by providing specified grants. This is an opportunity to gain knowledge and experience first hand that they may not have otherwise due to the costs. In  the  2001– 2002  academic  year  302 awards were made  to students  from among 2,771 applicants  from 44 states plus Puerto Rico. The awards were split with 68 percent going to semester long programs, 24 percent to academic year programs, and 8 percent to quarter and other programs. These numbers by themselves are impressive, however, when they are combined with the number of states and institutions represented it gets even better. These students  represent 172 different colleges, universities, and community colleges. I am proud that this Scholarship Program has reached such a broad cross-section of eligible students. Moreover, it is gratifying that 32 percent of that cross-section represents minority students. Our Scholarship Program  is placing students in countries other than the more traditional Western Europe states. I am happy to note that only 41 percent of our students have studied in Western Europe. Asia and Oceania drew 28 percent of our participants and  the Western Hemisphere drew 17 percent. The remaining 14 percent chose either Africa, Eastern Europe,  the Middle East, or had a program that allowed them to travel to multiple regions. It is gratifying that with the world opening to them these participants chose to take advantage of  it and study  in every  region available to them. The idea of an open world also carries over  to  the  fields of study represented. There are 41 different  fields  represented between the 4 different programs offered. The I.I.E and State Department have admirably implemented this program, and the reward is with the number of students seeking to participate. With such  interest,  I hope our scholarship will continue  to grow  to provide more students with this excellent opportunity. Asian or Pacific Islander: 12%. Black/Non-Hispanic: 11%. Hispanic: 8%.

130,,107,-0.448,152,2002-03-19,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I want to pay tribute to the skill, tenacity, and leadership of our colleague and my friend, Rep. LOISCAPPS. I have served with many fine people over the course of my career  in  the House of Representatives and she is among the best. She fights every day for the people of her district, and for causes that affect virtually every member of our society. She does this with great skill and even greater courage. I have come to admire  her  strength,  compassion,  commitment, and drive. It is with great respect and affection that I request that a copy of her recent remarks to the American Medical Association be  included  in  the Record.  I  recommend that all of my colleagues read them with great care. STATEMENT OFREP. LOISCAPPS, AMERICAN MEDICALASSOCIATIONCONFERENCE, MARCH 10, 2002 OPENING Thank you very much for inviting me here to speak today. It is an honor to spend some time with my colleagues in health care. I have been asked to speak to you about the Democratic Party’s agenda on health care. But I am not sure there should be a separate ‘‘Democratic’’ or ‘‘Republican’’ agenda on health. Though politics often suffuses the debate about health care, we should not come at this issue from a political perspective.

131,House,107,0.496,9,2002-04-09,Mr. HANSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 3958 provides a mechanism for the settlement of claims between the U.S. Department of Interior and the State of Utah regarding portions of the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge located on the north shore of the Great Salt Lake and authorizes a reimbursement to the State of $15 million for the lands, oil, gas and mineral rights within the refuge. The Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge was created in 1928 by Congress. Today,  the  refuge consists of  74,000 acres. Of these acres, the State of Utah claims 18,000 acres below the meander line of the Great Salt Lake as State sovereign lands. For nearly 75 years, the State and Federal governments have disputed the ownership of these lands. A 1976 Supreme Court decision, Utah v. United States, quieted title to the bed of the Great Salt Lake up to and  including the surveyed meander line, excepting the refuge from the decision. On September 28, 2001, negotiations between the Fish and Wildlife Service and the State resulted in a settlement agreement to be signed by the Secretary and by  the Governor of  the State. The  settlement agreement  is conditional upon congressional authorization and appropriation of required funds as well as State legislative approval. The 2002 Utah legislature approved the necessary measures. H.R. 3958 fulfills congressional action necessary for the Secretary of Interior to sign the final agreement. To assure that reimbursement moneys from the settlement are used to benefit wildlife, this bill requires the State to place two-thirds of the funds in a permanent  interest-bearing account  to  fund wetland and wildlife habitat projects in the State of Utah in perpetuity. The remaining one-third of the funds will be used for trail and stream enhancement.  In  return,  the State will drop its claim to the disputed portion of the refuge. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3958. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2002
132,House,107,0.375,37,2002-04-09,Mr. PORTMAN.," Madam Speaker, I rise this evening in strong support of this  legislation. It  is good commonsense legislation that will help protect taxpayers. This is a busy week for a lot of Americans. Millions of us are filing our tax returns, trying to get them in by April 15. This is time for us to provide a little bit of help. In 1998, this Congress passed historic legislation to restructure and reform the IRS and included over 50 new taxpayer rights and substantial reforms to the way the IRS operates. This legislation tonight, I think, builds on those efforts; and I commend the chairman and the gentleman from New York (Mr. HOUGHTON) for bringing it forward. Madam Speaker, tax records do contain sensitive and personal  information; and no one, not even the employees of the IRS, should be allowed to see them without a legitimate reason. This legislation makes  it very clear that there will be stiff penalties for IRS employees who explore taxpayers’ records without proper authorization. It also encourages broader use of electronic filing. This is extremely important. The IRS is able to process tax returns in a much more timely fashion with electronic means. It is also less expensive for the IRS; and, therefore, the taxpayers save money. And electronic returns have been shown to be more accurate. There are fewer IRS errors, and this is great news for taxpayers. We want to encourage it, and so will extend the filing deadline until April 30 for those willing to file electronically. The legislation we are debating today also adds some commonsense reform to IRS penalties. The gentleman  from New York (Mr. HOUGHTON) talked about these  earlier. Many  individuals and companies make innocent mistakes on their tax returns and are then hit with outrageous  fines and penalties. This bill allows the IRS to waive unfair penalties for taxpayers with good records who have made honest mistakes. The bill is good news for low-income taxpayers.  It  substantially  increases the funding available for low-income taxpayer  clinics. This  is  something that we put in place with the restructuring reform act, the thought being that when low-income individuals are involved with disputes with the IRS, they need a little help, and these clinics have proven to be very successful in helping taxpayers who do not have the means to be able to deal with the IRS when disputes arise. I commend the chairman for bringing it forward and providing funding for it. There are a lot of other important things  that  this  legislation  accomplishes. We have heard from the other side of the aisle about the section 527 provisions. As I see it, these are also sensible changes. The changes in section 527 are in keeping with what our original intent was in Congress in passing 527 reforms. This relates strictly to those organizations and entities that only deal with State and local issues. All it says is that we should not have burdensome and duplicative filing requirements at the Federal level where there is a State filing. This State filing has to be substantially similar, and any time there is any Federal involvement in any way, taxpayers have to file at the Federal level. Madam Speaker, I do not see the loophole here. I think the legislation we have on the bill this evening  is going  to help  taxpayers.  It makes sense. It is the kind of stuff we ought to be doing as we approach April 15 to help Americans with  their dealings with the IRS. ",2002
133,House,107,-0.514,37,2002-04-09,Mr. RANGEL.," Madam Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, we are not going to hear  too much debate because  the method selected by the leadership to bring this bill to the floor actually restricts debate. I know that the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means says that most of us have restricted our understanding of the bill to tax press releases and do not have a clear understanding of the legislation. I have to admit that the chairman is one of the brightest people that we have in the House, if not in the Congress; but the gentleman does not have a reputation of supporting campaign finance reform; and the Members who think they understand it, like the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MEEHAN) and  the gentleman  from Connecticut (Mr. SHAYS), and like the editorial writers of all of our major newspapers that fought hard for campaign finance reform, while not nearly as bright as the chairman, believe it is a flaw and believe it is a loophole. So even a little compassion, even if we do not have debate, can go a long way. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI), the minority whip. ",2002
134,House,107,-0.491,37,2002-04-09,Ms. PELOSI.," Madam  Speaker,  I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I associate myself with his very eloquent remarks about the stealth nature  in which this bill  is being brought to the floor of the House. Stealth  is a good word  for  it. It  is about abuses of stealth PACs, which this bill would reinstitute. Less than 2 weeks after President Bush signed a historic campaign  finance reform bill into law, the Republican leadership once again wants to weaken one of its primary provisions. The New York Times calls this bill a travesty, and a travesty  it  is. Two years ago this House voted, under the leadership of our distinguished ranking member, the gentleman from New York (Mr. RANGEL),  and  a  hard-working member of the committee whose leadership was essential to this, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT), to require  that  political  organizations which are exempt from taxation under section 527 of the IRS Code to disclose their contributions and expenditures. One would think this would have been made to order for the Republicans who have argued over time that we did not need campaign finance reform, all we needed was disclosure. And now this bill foils attempts at disclosure. b2000 This when it was passed was a major campaign  finance  reform  initiative adopted after abuses by the stealth PACs which ran attack ads under the tax-exempt section of the code without meaningful disclosure. This proposal tonight would allow individuals to hide behind groups to influence the political system without disclosing who they are or where they got their money. The notion that this is simply an attempt to get rid of duplicative reporting requirements was shown to be a farce when the Republicans would not  allow  a  proposed Democratic  amendment  that would have eliminated duplication but still ensures that there would be full disclosure. Instead, this bill opens up new loopholes in the 527 reporting requirement and creates potential for abuse. It is clearly an attempt by opponents of campaign finance reform to begin to erode the excellent provisions of the Shays-Meehan bill. I urge my colleagues to reject this travesty and seriously object to the manner  in which this bill was railroaded to the floor. This body spent a good deal of time focusing on campaign finance reform. We had to take extraordinary measures to get the bill heard on the floor of this Congress with a  discharge  petition. The  bill  has passed both Houses, it has been signed by the President of the United States, and it is being undermined by the proposal that the Republicans are putting on the floor today. I urge our colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ ",2002
135,House,107,0.371,37,2002-04-09,Mr. THOMAS.," Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman  from  Arizona  (Mr. HAYWORTH), a member of  the  committee. ",2002
136,House,107,0.559,37,2002-04-09,Mr. HAYWORTH.," Madam Speaker, I listened with great  interest  to my friend, the distinguished minority whip from the State of California, and listened to her say vote ‘‘no’’ on this. Understand that a ‘‘no’’ vote means a lack of real reform where it counts: to allow people to pay penalties to the IRS in a reasonable and rational way; to allow ",2002
137,House,107,-0.324,51,2002-04-09,Mr. DEUTSCH.," I would like to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. ROTHMAN, who is viewed by his colleagues as an expert in this area and has been very influential. ",2002
138,House,107,0.54,51,2002-04-09,Mr. KINGSTON.,"  If  the gentleman will yield, before the gentleman from New York Mr. WEINER leaves, I wanted to make a point that as long ago as July 15, 2001, the Jerusalem Post reported that there were four summer camps currently training 8- to 12-yearolds  for suicide bombings going on. That is exactly what you are saying, just calling the kids to arms right now against Israel. Summer camps training 8- to 12-year-olds for suicide bombing visions. ",2002
139,House,107,-0.408,51,2002-04-09,Mr. WEINER.," If the gentleman will yield further briefly, also one has to wonder why it is when there are these stages of violence put on by the Palestinians, why there are always children at the front lines? It is because, simply put, children are being used as the stones of war. In a very cynical campaign to persuade us that children are being put in harm’s way, they are. They are being put in harm’s way by mothers and fathers who are being told by their leaders that is the pathway to peace. ",2002
140,Senate,107,-0.205,72,2002-04-09,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, it is  with profound pride—and I suppose I  should add provincial pleasure—that I  join Senator DODDand all of our colleagues from Connecticut in the House  of Representatives in introducing this  resolution, which  is  the  legislative  equivalent of wagging our tails and  howling  like huskies at the Capitol  dome.  We are very proud to salute the 2002  national champion University of Connecticut women’s Huskies basketball  team, who, on March 31, capped a 39-to-  0 season—a perfect season—the ninth  undefeated run in the whole history of  college basketball, with a victory over  Oklahoma in the title game. I suppose  we should pay some respect and give  some sense of congratulations, even in  defeat, to our former colleague, David  Boren, who is now the president of the  University of Oklahoma.  This fantastic season leads me to repeat a pressing question that opponents of the UConn women’s basketball  team must have been asking all year,  which is: Who let the Huskies out? I  think the answer might be the great  Coach Geno Auriemma and his superb  staff, who not only coached but led, inspired,  and mentored  this  extraordinary group of women to this extraordinary season. This marks the third  time that UConn women have  leapt  above the rim of college basketball and  the first time in NCAA history that  any school has gone unbeaten on two  separate occasions.  Mr. President, you may remember—  and I certainly do—a similar swell of  pride when Rebecca Lobo and Jenn  Rizzotti and company ran the table on  the way to the national championship  in 1995. For years to come, student athletes around the Nation will be striving  to approach the perfection of this program, and we in Connecticut are so  proud of it.  As Senator DODD indicated, five of  these great basketball players won All-  American notice. They poured in more  points than any other team in the Nation and racked up an NCAA record average margin of victory of more than 35  points a game—a remarkable achievement.  But the true measure of the team, as  Senator DODD indicated, can’t be distilled in numbers or records. You have  to look at the humans involved. The  legendary Geno Auriemma, one of the  winningest coaches in college basketball history, once again brought together a great group of talented and  hard-working young women and  imbued that team not just with the skills  but with the team spirit and the togetherness that we saw on the court  perfectly and gracefully executed time  and time again.  Senator DODD referred to the  four  seniors who are legendary and will remain legendary in Connecticut for a  long time to come: Sue Bird, Asjha  Jones, Tamika Williams,  and Swin  Cash; and a great sophomore sensation,  Diana  Taurasi.  They  became  an  unstoppable combination.  I will  say  with pride that the surge of success is  starting to feel happily familiar to us,  and we are very grateful for that. Over  the last 4 years, the UConn women’s  team has gone 136 and 9, made three  Final Four appearances, and claimed  four Big East tournament titles in 4  years, along with the Huskies men’s  basketball  team,  which  this  year  earned its 15th consecutive trip to national post-season play on the way to  the Elite Eight. The two make a truly  triumphant tandem, that Huskies men  or women have now won the national  college  basketball  championship  in  1995, 1999, 2000, and 2002.  This is a great program, and we owe  a particular thanks and expression of  pride to the athletic director of the  University of Connecticut, Lou Perkins, to coaches Geno Auriemma and  Jim Calhoun, and to all their staffs.  Mr. President,  this may give you  some small sense of why Connecticut  residents are as loyal to our Huskies as  huskies are to their owners. We love  the way this team came to play. We  love the way they brought out the best  in our State. If I may say so, as Americans, every day we pledge allegiance to  the red, white, and blue; but during  basketball season in Connecticut, we  have a special place in our hearts for  the white and blue alone. We are proud  that the rest of the Nation is catching  on. A record crowd of nearly 30,000 fans  turned out at the Alamodome in San  Antonio to watch the Huskies win the  national title. That growing popularity  is helping women’s college basketball  ascend to truly new heights.  I am proud to join with Senator DODD  and our colleagues in the House in introducing this resolution and in congratulating  the UConn  players  and  coaches on their singular accomplishment and asking the Senate to do the  same. We are filled with pride over the  honor  the Huskies have brought  to  Connecticut.  Two years ago, when Senator DODD  and I were here and I was honored to  give  a  similar  speech  saluting  the  UConn men’s Huskies, I closed with the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  20:23 Jan 09, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€2SENATE\S09AP2.REC S09AP2 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2002

143,Senate,107,-0.239,93,2002-04-09,Mrs. CARNAHAN.," Madam President,  last week, as people of many  faiths  celebrated holy days of peace, our television screens were filled with visions  of horror. Young Palestinian men and  women, strapping explosives to their  bodies and detonating themselves  in  crowds of Israeli civilians, destroyed  dozens of lives and with them exploded  the hopes and dreams for a peaceful  resolution of the Middle East crisis.  The words used to acclaim these acts  are deeply troubling. The murderous  bomber who killed celebrants at the  Passover meal was deemed ‘‘a glorious  martyr.’’ Such a proclamation  is a  cruel hoax, perpetrated by those dedicated to the destruction of the Jewish  state. It comes from those who have  never admitted  in  their hearts—and  will never admit that Israel has the  right to exist within secure and peaceful borders.  They unleash their hate under the  banner of such groups as Hamas, and  Hezbollah, the Fatah and the Al Asqa  Mosque Martyrs’ Brigade.  Unfortunately, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, is  unwilling or unable  to prevent  the  wave of assaults against Israeli civilians. For far too many years he has  talked the talk of peace; but he has  never walked the walk for peace.  When it has served his interest to  speak of reconciliation, of compromise,  of security for Israel—he has done so.  But days, or even hours, later when  speaking to his people, or the Arab  world, he uses  language  that urges  armed struggle, a war of  liberation,  and a return to conquered lands.

144,Senate,107,-0.03,100,2002-04-09,Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.," Madam  President, while I was home  in Nebraska, a great Nebraska citizen passed  away. Loral Johnson was a newspaper  publisher  in  southwestern Nebraska  and a pillar of his community.  He began working in the newspaper  business at age 9 as a ‘‘printer’s devil.’’  He started at the Imperial Republican  newspaper as a linotype operator following graduation from high school in  1952. He purchased the paper with his  wife, Elna, in 1968.  Loral Johnson was well respected and  known by his colleagues as an innovative newspaperman. Johnson’s editorial  pages were often positive and progressive, calling on community members to  move forward and always striving to  make Imperial a better place for current and future generations. He was inducted into the Nebraska Journalism  Hall of Fame and was named a master-  editor publisher, the highest award of  the Nebraska Press Association. Johnson’s  Imperial Republican was  also  among the first weekly papers to print  on an offset press and to use computers.  However, Loral Johnson will be remembered as  far more  than  just a  newspaper publisher. He was also a key  leader  in  his  community  and  his  church. He was a member of the school  board for 28 years, a co-founder and  board member of  the  local nursing  home for 33 years, and secretary for the  Imperial Planning Commission for 21  years. His important contributions to  education and health care will be remembered for many years to come.  While we will miss Loral Johnson  greatly, it is comforting to know that  his two daughters and a son-in-law are  continuing the tradition of excellent  journalism in Imperial. His family and  the devotion to community that he has  passed on to them and so many others  are his greatest legacy.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO RAY BURKE  ∑",2002

The association has displayed tireless commitment and dedication to the Hispanic business community. The association grew out of a task force of Hispanic business owners in 1981 and was incorporated as a non-profit organization  in 1983. The motivation to create the association came from a core of Hispanic business owners who were alarmed over the low participation  in  the private and public sector. Functioning through its 15-member voluntary board and network of supporters, the association has successfully worked to advocate the economic development and expansion of Hispanic businesses. By advocating consistently for the needs of the Hispanic business community and assisting other organizations with much needed services,  the Hispanic Business Association: Hispanic Chamber of Commerce for Ohio, has served as an invaluable resource. It has sponsored and co-sponsored various events, featuring many distinguished speakers, such as the Mayor of the City of Cleveland, the National Director of Minority Business Development Agency, and the State Director of Equal Opportunity. In addition the association annually sponsors the ‘ ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ Awards Banquet, recognizing Hispanic entrepreneurs who, despite  the odds, have succeeded in business and participated in community development. My fellow colleagues, the Hispanic Business Association: Hispanic Chamber of Commerce for Ohio deserves  the highest praise  for  its dedication to advancing the needs of the Hispanic Business Community.  I commend  this long standing organization. f HONORING VIDA EN EL VALLE HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH OFCALIFORNIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, April 9, 2002 ",2002
146,,107,-0.658,135,2002-04-09,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the ‘ ‘Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability, Act of 2002,’ legislation  that imposes tough criminal and civil penalties on corporate wrongdoers and helps protect employees and shareholders against future acts of corporate  fraud.  I am  joined by Minority Leader GEPHARDTalong with Representatives Jr.  (IL), FRANK, JACKSON LEE, BERMAN, WATERS, LAFALCE, ENGEL, DINGELL,  JACKSON,  CHRISTENSEN, DAVIS (IL), CUMMINGS, SANDERS, SOLIS,  CLAYTON,  BROWN LYNCH, HOEFFEL, GUTIERREZ, and SCHAKOWSKY. (FL),  As you know, the past several months have revealed widespread  incidences of corporate fraud and abuse committed by Enron and its advisers. With each passing day, a new revelation concerning the dissemination of misinformation, evidence shredding, obstruction of justice, and insider trading has been unveiled. And, as more companies file for bankruptcy, I am convinced that we may very well learn of additional instances of fraud occurring across corporate America. One step we can take to prevent corporate wrongdoers  from preying on  innocent  investors and employees is to enact legislation that increases  the penalties  that companies  face for engaging in such rapacious acts. The bill that  I am  introducing,  the  ‘Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002’ , does just that. Among other things, it creates a new 10-year  felony  for defrauding shareholders of publicly-traded companies; clarifies current criminal laws relating to the destruction or fabrication of evidence, including the shredding of  financial and audit records; provides whistleblower protection to employees of publicly-traded companies, similar  to  those currently available to many government employees; and establishes a new bureau within the Department of Justice to prosecute crimes involving securities and pension fraud. In the wake of the Enron debacle, I believe the time is now ripe to protect American investors once again. The Enron case has established beyond a shadow of a doubt that white collar  fraud can be  incredibly damaging,  in many cases wiping away  life savings and costing innocent Americans billions of dollars of their hard earned money. There can be no conceivable justification for shielding corporate wrongdoers from criminal prosecution for their outrageous behavior. I am hopeful that Congress can move quickly to enact this worthwhile and timely legislation. The  following  is a section-by-section analysis of the bill: Section 1. Title. ‘‘Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act.’’ Section 2. Criminal Penalties for Altering, Destroying, or Failing to Maintain Documents—provides two new criminal statutes which would clarify and plug holes in the current criminal  laws relating to the destruction or fabrication of evidence, including  the  shredding of  financial and audit records. Currently, those provisions are a patchwork which have been interpreted in often limited ways in federal court. For instance, certain of  the current provisions make it a crime to persuade another person to destroy documents, but not a crime to actually destroy the same documents yourself. Other provisions have been narrowly interpreted by courts,  including  the Supreme Court in United States v. Aquillar, 115 S. Ct. 593 (1995), to apply only to situations where the obstruction of justice can be closely tied to a pending judicial proceeding. First, this section would create a new 5 year felony which could be effectively used in a wide array of cases where a person destroys or creates evidence with the specific intent to obstruct a  federal agency or a criminal investigation. Second, the section creates another 5 year felony which applies specifically to the willful failure to preserve audit papers of companies that issue securities. Section 3. Criminal Penalties for Defrauding Shareholders of Publicly Traded Companies—creates a new 10 year felony for defrauding  shareholders  of  publicly  traded companies. The provision would supplement the patchwork of existing technical securities law violations with a more general and less technical provision, comparable to the bank fraud and health care fraud statutes. The provision would be more accessible to investigators and prosecutors and would provide needed enforcement flexibility and, in the context of publicly traded companies, protection against all the types schemes and frauds which inventive criminals may devise in the future. Section 4. Review of Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Obstruction of Justice and Extensive Criminal Fraud—requires the United States Sentencing Commission  (‘‘Commission’’) to consider enhancing criminal penalties in cases involving the actual destruction or fabrication of evidence or in fraud cases in which a large number of victims are injured or when the injury to the victims is particularly grave—i.e. they face financial ruin. This provision first requires the Commission to consider sentencing enhancements in obstruction of justice cases where physical evidence was actually destroyed. The provision, in subsections (3) and (4), also requires the Commission to consider sentencing enhancements for fraud cases which are particularly extensive or serious. Specifically, once there are more than 50 victims, the current guidelines do not require any further enhancement of the sentence, so that a case with 51 victims may be treated the same as a case with 5,000 victims. In addition, current guidelines allow only very limited consideration of the extent of financial devastation that a fraud offense causes to private victims. This section corrects both these problems. Section 5. Debts Non-dischargeable if Incurred  in Violation  of Securities Fraud Laws—amends the federal bankruptcy code to make judgments and settlements arising from state and federal securities law violations brought by state or federal regulators and private  individuals non dischargeable. Current bankruptcy law may permit wrongdoers to discharge their obligations under court judgments or settlements based on securities fraud and securities law violations. This loophole in the law should be closed to help defrauded investors recoup their losses and  to hold accountable  those who perpetrate securities fraud. Section 6. Increased Protection of Employees’ Wages Under Chapter 11 Proceedings— increases the amount in unsecured claims (wages,  commissions,  etc.)  an  individual could claim in bankruptcy proceedings from $4,300 to $10,000. This change would aid employees who are usually only paid their priority wage claims early in the case. The rest of the employee’s wage claim is a general unsecured debt and may not be paid except on a pro rata basis at the end of the case, which could be several years later. In the Enron case, employees were paid only their priority wage claims while certain individuals were given generous  ‘‘retention bonuses.’’ This change would make it possible for the court in similar cases to provide a more realistic buffer to employees who have been laid off or who have not been paid in the period leading up to the bankruptcy. Section 7. Statute of Limitations for Securities Fraud—sets the statute of limitations in private securities fraud cases to the earlier of 5 years after the date of the fraud or three years after the fraud was discovered. The current statute of limitations for private securities fraud cases is the earlier of three years from the date of the fraud or one year from the date of discovery. In the Enron state pension  fund  litigation, the current short statute of limitations has forced some states to forgo claims against Enron based on securities fraud in 1997 and 1998. Victims of securities fraud should have a reasonable time to discover the facts underlying the fraud. The Supreme Court, in Lampf v. Gilbertson, 501 U.S. 350 (1991), endorsed the current short statute of limitations for securities fraud in a 5–4 decision. Justices O’Connor and Kennedy wrote in their dissent in the Lampf decision:  ‘‘By adopting a  3-year period of repose, the Court makes a §10(b) action all but a dead letter for injured investors who by no conceivable standard of  fairness or practicality can be expected to file suit within three years after the violation occurred. In so doing, the Court also turns its back on the almost uniform rule rejecting short periods of repose for fraud-based actions.’’ VerDate 11<MAY>2000 06:37 Apr 10, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K09AP8.003 pfrm04 PsN: E09PT1 ’   ‘ ’ ",2002

I’m pleased to note that  two very distinguished members of  the Ways and Means Committee, Congressman BILLJEFFERSONand Congressman RONLEWIS have agreed to join me in introducing this important legislation. Too many small businesses  lose valuable time  each  day  attending  to  administrative headaches. Likewise, many of  those same small businesses are unable to provide benefits to their employees due to their size. In recent years, the employee leasing industry has evolved to provide cost effective administrative payroll/tax services and health and retirement benefits to small businesses and their full-time employees. The bill I’m introducing will clarify the  status  of  employee-leasing  companies ability to provide these services. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation and taking a stand to help America’s small business owners and employees. f INTRODUCTION OF THE WORKING TOWARD INDEPENDENCE ACT OF 2002 HON.

How long can we allow this bloodbath to continue? How long will we have to witness Israeli families blown apart by maniacal, suicidal murderers; Palestinian children lying dead on the street; young Israeli men and women buried alive in collapsed buildings; or Palestinian families huddling inside their homes, terrified to step out even to buy food? The latest news of more people— human beings with friends  and  family— who  have  been  killed today is heartbreaking. The Israeli and Palestinian people are on a downward spiral, heading quickly  toward  that state of nature conceived by Thomas Hobbes, where Palestinian and Israeli children born into the world can expect only one thing: a life that is ‘ ‘nasty, brutish, and short.’  This situation is an outrage.

150,,107,-0.267,4,2002-04-15,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President,  last week a number of pharmaceutical companies announced a new program by which some Medicare enrollees, particularly those at the  lower  income levels, will be able to access prescription drugs at a lower price. Let me compliment them for that. These companies are certainly moving  in  the right  direction  by  recognizing  that price is a very serious problem for a lot of Americans with respect to prescription drugs. The companies that founded Together Rx are Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, GlaxoSmithKline,  Johnson & Johnson,  and  Novartis  Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Pfizer and Eli Lilly have separate programs that they have already announced. I think it is a step forward, and I compliment these companies. We have much more to do, but having been very critical of the prescription drug manufacturers for price increases, let me say thanks for these programs because they will benefit a good number of lower income senior citizens. However, let me describe one of the problems that still exists. This chart is of a Washington Post article,  from within the last month,  ‘‘Prescription Drug Spending Rises 17 Percent in the Last Year.’’ There have been doubledigit  increases year after year after year after year for prescription drugs. ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

154,House,107,0.351,8,2002-04-25,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the underlying bill that this rule offers for consideration, the Barbara Jordan  Immigration Reform and Accountability Act. I appreciate the work of the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Rules to bring a bill to the floor, but I think this effort falls seriously short of the real reform that is needed. Unfortunately, the bill that we have before us today simply rearranges the boxes  on  the  existing  organization chart of the INS. It separates two divergent functions within the INS, immigration service and benefits. But it does not do much more than already exists. Instead of having the two functions joined at the top by the INS Commissioner who reports to the Attorney General, they are joined at the top by an Associate Attorney General who reports to the Attorney General. My colleagues may be interested in knowing that on November 4 of last year, the Attorney General and the INS  Commissioner  announced  that under their own reorganization plan, ‘‘clear and separate chains of command for the agency’s service function and enforcement function are created.’’ So, this bill would add nothing to what has already been done administratively. The bill also purports to give each function its own budget and its own dedicated employees. As a member of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary that has responsibility for the INS and Department of Justice budget, I can tell my colleagues that for some time now we have already separated the budget of the service and the enforcement functions of the INS. So nothing new is accomplished here, either. It is no surprise that the Department of Justice is now supporting this bill because it does not impose any changes on them. The only difference that I can see  is that we will change the INS Commissioner’s title to Associate Attorney General. The same people at the INS will be doing the same things they are doing today and the same things they were doing prior to September 11. What would have been different  if this proposed bill had been law prior to September 11? The same people will be patrolling our borders and reporting to the same sector chiefs. The same people will be issuing visas and adjudicating immigration claims. But to implement the supposed reform is going to cost the American taxpayers an additional $1.1 billion. Why? Because it would eliminate $1 billion of revenues  that  immigrants  pay now through fees that are used for border enforcement or drug interdiction. We would have to replace it with general revenue funds. Mr. Speaker, the irony today is that there is a proposal for real INS reform. It was submitted to Congress 5 years ago. It was the recommendation of the commission chaired by the late Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. I would have liked to offer the commission’s recommendation as an amendment, but this rule does not permit that. The commission’s proposal has been vetted and studied for years, 5 years by the commission and at  least 5-years that it has been before Congress. These recommendations,  my  amendment, would fundamentally restructure INS by recognizing three core immigration functions and rationalizing them into three specific departments with expertise in these areas. Let me read just a couple of excerpts from a letter written by Robert Hill and Bruce Morrison, a Republican and Democrat, who cochaired the Jordan Commission Working Group on Structural Reform of the INS: ‘‘Coordination of functions would be better under H.R. 4108,’’ that was the bill I have introduced that now I propose to offer as an amendment. ‘‘Coordination of functions would be better under H.R. 4108 than under the Judiciary Committee bill. Under the committee bill, administration of immigration benefits would continue to be split between Justice, Labor, and State, as under current law. All the fragmentation found by the commission would continue. Your bill addresses this problem with its consolidation of benefits adjudication in the State Department . . .’’ Quoting  further,  ‘‘Immigration  law enforcement belongs in the Justice Department . . . The Justice Department is the wrong place for adjudicating immigration benefits.’’ Mr. Speaker, I would place  in the RECORDat this point the rest of this letter. APRIL18, 2002. Hon. JIMKOLBE, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN KOLBE: As  former members of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform (the ‘‘Jordan Commission’’), we are writing to express our views on the INS Reorganization Act of 2002 (H.R. 4108), which you introduced on April 9, 2002. We understand that your bill encompasses the Jordan Commission’s recommendations for comprehensive restructuring of responsibility for immigration  functions within the government. We also understand that you may seek to offer your bill as a substitute for the wellintentioned, but more limited reforms contained in H.R. 3231 reported by the House Judiciary Committee. In this context, we offer some suggestions on why the more complete separation of agency responsibilities reflected by your bill received support from the Commission. We continue to believe that this more fundamental reform is far preferable. From 1992 to 1997, we served together as members of the Jordan Commission and cochaired its working group on management reform, which developed the recommendations on restructuring reported to Congress on September 30, 1997. We come from opposite ends of the political spectrum. Bob Hill served as an appointee of President Reagan in the White House, the State Department and the Justice Department. Bruce Morrison was a Democratic Member of Congress and served  in the Clinton Administration. We have both had  extensive  experience  representing clients in immigration matters. On this issue, our experience leads us to consensus, much as it did for the diverse membership of the Commission. The Jordan Commission reached its recommendation for restructuring after years of extensive investigation. We held more than 40 public hearings, consultations and roundtable discussions with government officials and outside experts, as well as recent immigrants and refugees themselves.  In every forum there was serious, ongoing discussion of the problems confronting the government agencies responsible  for administering the immigration system as well as those confronting  the  individuals,  employers,  and practitioners subjected to it. Based on this input, we set criteria for evaluating competing  restructuring proposals. These  included: (1) consolidation and streamlining of government operations; (2) unambiguous allocation of responsibility and accountability for core functions; (3) effective separation of law enforcement and benefits adjudication; (4)  maximum  utilization  of  existing strengths and elimination of weaknesses or redundancies; and (5) enhancement of policy formulation, implementation and coordination. Immigration law enforcement belongs in the Justice Department. Everyone agrees that the enforcement of our  immigration laws—at the border and within the country— should be handled by a separate bureau within the Justice Department. We all seek to have this enforcement carried out with the kind of professional standards and effectiveness we have long associated with the Criminal Division, the U.S. Attorneys, and the FBI. INS enforcement activities, while given high priority within the agency, have never had the status within Justice that comes to other  law  enforcement  functions.  This should change. The Justice Department is the wrong place for adjudicating immigration benefits. The main distinction between the Committee bill and yours is the placement of the second major INS function—adjudication of benefit applications. The Commission  considered and rejected the idea of keeping this function in the Justice Department. Although initially Justice was viewed by most members as the presumptive choice, they were ultimately persuaded otherwise. The reasons were the fundamental objection to locating the enforcement and benefits functions in one agency, and that the Justice Department did not have the capacity to take on the State Department’s international visa functions. Some argued that the two functions are complementary and must be coordinated by a single government official. But we saw that as little different from the INS structure that has so clearly failed. Instead we concluded  that  the very qualities of approach and status that make Justice the ",2002
155,House,107,0.332,15,2002-04-25,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his comment. This is a day that I have long waited for as have many others in this body and, more  importantly,  around  the country, and I am very pleased and honored to support the Barbara Jordan bill. This has been a long, long road, but with the  leadership of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER), we have come together and crafted I think an excellent bill worthy of this Chamber’s support. And I deeply appreciate  the  time,  the effort,  the dedication to this cause that the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER) has invested in bringing this legislation forward. He should be commended by all of us. This bill differs a little from the reform bill that I had pending for a few years along with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. REYES) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH), but it is a good bill. It goes, I think, 90 percent of the way that we need to go. Mr. Chairman, the bill before the House is an essential piece of legislation. It will bring some accountability to this  immigration system, and reforming and reorganizing the INS has been an  issue near and dear to my heart as well as many others. Having taken on  the  chore myself  several years ago in the appropriations subcommittee that funds the INS on which I have served some 19 years, including 6 as chairman, we have all seen firsthand the harm this agency has caused to our citizens because of its dysfunction and ineptitude. We have seen it on the enforcement side where tens of thousands of illegal aliens storm our borders every year, and we have seen it on the service side where backlogs and mismanagement have left legitimate applicants waiting in line for years. I believe there is no greater privilege that this Nation can bestow on anyone than American citizenship, but unfortunately too many applicants have been let down by this system. Simply put, and I have said it a hundred times, the INS is the worst-run agency in the United States Government. Its missions are inherently conflicted. On the one hand, they are to punish those who violate the law, but on the other hand they are supposed to help people achieve  the  rights and privileges  that  our  country  affords them. In many cases, we are talking about the same people. This causes confusion, frustration, not only among the rank-and-file employees, but the immigrants themselves. It may be Congress’ ultimate failure in creating such a convoluted system, but we stand here before the House today, determined to fix it once and for all. The answer is not more money. We have poured money on this agency and agreed to its pleas and justifications. The INS budget has grown over 300 percent in just the last 8 years, from a level of $1.58 billion in 1994 to today’s level of $5.5 billion. In fact, the INS account now consumes over 23 percent of the entire Department of Justice budget. The answer is not more staffing for border control. We have increased border patrol agents dramatically, from 3,900 in 1993 to over 10,000 authorized positions today, and despite our generosity, INS over the years failed to completely hire  the  full number of agents funded by the Congress, diverting the money to other things. Simply put, INS has been unable to effectively control the borders and has no strategy to remove people who overstay their limited visas. The only answer to this agency, I have come to conclude, is to simply abolish it, dismantle,  start  over,  and  this  bill achieves that by separating these conflicted missions of the INS. The new Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service and the new Bureau of Immigration Enforcement will keep to their tasks and focus solely on their respective specialties, ultimately providing for the common good of the Nation. And, as has been said, a new Associate Attorney General will be created, giving  immigration affairs the full credit and importance it deserves within the Justice hierarchy. This legislation will help secure the homeland and bring sanity to our immigration system. The legacy left behind by INS is not a  pretty  picture:  8 million  illegal aliens, some 40 percent, 2.8 million, being  illegal  overstays  of  certified visas that came here legally; a backlog of 5 million unadjudicated petitions for immigration benefits. The citizenship U.S.A. debacle where thousands of individuals with criminal records were naturalized as citizens because the INS told the FBI we do not need the background checks, we will just go ahead and make them citizens.

156,House,107,0.425,22,2002-04-25,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Chairman,  the Barbara Jordan INS Immigration Reform and Accountability Act, which is supported by the Administration, provides a long-awaited solution to the problems within the INS. At the end of 2001, the INS had a backlog of 4.9 million applications and petitions. With those numbers, no one should be surprised at the  recent mishandling of  terrorist visas.  In fact, if the INS had been following their own policies, Mohammed Atta would have never been allowed even to enter the United States. For years  INS officials have promised reform— but have given us only talk with no action. This bill will provide  that much-needed action. H.R. 3231 will abolish the INS and replace it with two agencies— one to handle security and one to handle services. This will not only give  immigration security  the attention  it deserves, but also will  improve  the quality of services provided to immigrants. No longer will we hear of cases where an immigrant waited in line for 2 days to get a form and was never told that they could obtain it by simply calling a 1–800 number. No longer will we  have  student  visas  approved  six months after  the  fact  for  the very  terrorists who attacked our nation. No  longer will we have criminal aliens mistakenly or intentionally released. We must act before it’s too late. Ensuring we have an effective  immigration system  is vital to our homeland defense. We must pass this bill today. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. ",2002
157,House,107,0.348,22,2002-04-25,Mr. CALVERT.," Mr. Chairman,  I commend Judiciary Committee Chairman JAMESSENSENBRENNERand Ranking Member JOHNCONYERS for their work on bringing this important bipartisan legislation, H.R. 3231— The Barbara Jordan  Immigration Reform and Accountability Act of 2002— to the House floor for consideration. H.R. 3231 creates a new immigration system. It ensures that terrorist and illegal immigrants are kept out of our country. For  too long our immigration system has been stuck in the dark ages allowing illegal immigrants and terrorists to slip silently into our nation. H.R. 3231 recognizes this and requires that Internet-based  technologies be  implemented  to track  immigration  applications— technologies that can alert Americans now, not later when it’s already to late, about illegal and terrorists threats to our liberties and homeland security. Mr. Chairman, Americans have trusted and been patient with INS for far too long as they have attempted numerous internal reorganizations— reorganizations that have obviously not worked. INS’s present mission to both administer  immigration benefits and enforce  immigration  law  is blatantly at odds with each other. Therefore, today we vote today to abolish the  Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to recognize what Americans have already concluded— that American’s immigration system needs a clear chain of command coupled with greater accountability. America demands an immigration system that secures our homeland by keeping  illegal  immigrants and  terrorists out, while offering an efficient process for those legal immigrants coming to America to start a better life. H.R. 3231 secures our American principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. ",2002

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)  is charged with enforcing  immigration laws, such as deporting criminal or  illegal aliens. It is also charged with processing those who lawfully immigrate to our country to partake of the American dream. These conflicting missions under one government agency have resulted in confusion and inefficiency. In my home town of Omaha, Nebraska, for example, there is widespread frustration with the  Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). People must wait in long lines for hours on end to be served, and then wait months or even years for their applications to be processed. Last year alone, the Nebraska INS received more than fourteen thousand new immigration applications. At the end of the year it was running a backlog of almost seven hundred cases. With only three employees working  four days a week,  the service problems have not been adequately resolved. Border and immigration security is of paramount  importance as we  find, arrest, and ",2002

It is a pleasure to join in a bipartisan opposition  to  this  Lofgren-Cannon amendment. The INS does not need a blank check from this Congress. If my colleagues look at the record of the INS, it has shown a total inability to successfully  implement  information technology advancements. The Inspector General at the Department of Justice  said  that  the  INS ‘‘made huge  investments  in automation technology and information systems that have yielded questionable results,’’ and continues ‘‘to spend hundreds of millions of dollars’’ on information technology  initiatives  ‘‘without being able  to explain how  the money was spent or what was accomplished.’’ This amendment would waive the requirement for full and open competition on information technology products and services for the INS through 2004. The INS would be able to purchase a multimillion-dollar computer technology improvement without any requirement for competitive bids or review under existing law. There are six exceptions already in law that would allow them to avoid the requirement of open  competition  if they saw fit to do so; things like a national  security  requirement; maybe there is only one responsible bidder. The law provides for unusual and compelling circumstances that would do harm to the government as an exception. And, finally, if the head of the INS determines that it is in the public interest to avoid competition, all they have to do is notify Congress 30 days before they award the contract to give us the opportunity to express our concern. This amendment is totally unnecessary. We have streamlined many of our procurement practices over  the  last decade, and we are now reading news reports  that  tell us we may have streamlined them too much. In one recent story, Charles Tiefter, the University of Baltimore professor who spent a decade here working as a House lawyer, said, ‘‘Scandals are coming,’’ referring to the procurement practices of the Federal Government. Now is not the time to give a blank check to the INS, and I hope my colleagues will join us in bipartisan opposition to this amendment. ",2002

164,House,107,-0.438,50,2002-04-25,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 15th annual National Minority Cancer Awareness Week, to highlight and bring attention to the cancer care needs of socioeconomically disadvantaged  and medically underserved communities. I come to the floor today to recognize the American  Cancer  Society,  the Intercultural Cancer Council, and the National Center  for Minority Health and Disparities at the National Institutes of Health  for  their continued work to increase the awareness of cancer  and  reduce  health  disparities among minorities. While there has been a decline in cancer mortality since 1991, cancer still is the second leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 555,500 deaths each year. That is more than 1,500 deaths a day. But what is most disheartening and most disturbing is that minority and medically underserved populations continue  to bear a startling disproportionate share of the Nation’s cancer burden. According to the American Cancer Society, African American men and women have a cancer death rate of about 33 percent higher than whites. Among women younger than 50 years of age, African Americans are more likely to develop breast cancer than whites. Prostate cancer will claim the lives of more than twice as many African American men as men of other racial and ethnic groups. African Americans are at a significantly higher risk of death from intrauterine and bladder cancers. Hispanic women have nearly twice the rates of cervical cancer than non-Hispanic white women. Hispanics are less likely than other minorities to have a regular source of health care, visited a physician in the past year, and received a routine physical examination. Native American women with breast cancer have the lowest 5-year survival rate of any United States racial/ethnic group. And native Hawaiian women have the highest incidence and mortality rates of endometrial cancers of all United States women. There is something equally as important as statistics, and that is the question, why our cancer rates are disproportionately high among minorities. According to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on April 23 of this year, higher cancer rates in minorities seem to stem from difference in treatment, not biological or genetic differences. I say to my colleagues, to be truly effective in eradicating all types of cancer, the Federal health agenda must address  low-income minorities  and medically underserved populations.  I think Congress can be instrumental in helping to accomplish this goal in this country. In fact, at my request during the 106th Congress, the Committee on Government Reform held a hearing that afforded us the opportunity to engage in a more exhaustive investigation of the disparities in cancer treatments of minorities. This hearing was a positive first step in addressing the issue of disparities and cancer treatment  of minorities  in  the United States. In  keeping with  this  point, Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago the Congressional Black  Caucus  Health  Braintrust, chaired by the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Mrs. CHRISTENSEN), met to discuss a report which had been requested by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. JACKSON) and others, from the Institute of Medicine and that report was titled  ‘‘Unequal  Treatment:  Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care.’’ This report concluded that Americans of color tend to receive  lowerquality health care than do whites; and these disparities contribute  to high death rates of African Americans from cancer, heart disease, diabetes, HIV/ AIDS, and other life-endangering conditions. The American Cancer Society, health care providers, community organizations, and State and local agencies and many other participants agree that we need to do more; that there needs to be more cooperation between the Department of Health and Human Services, local and State health agencies, medical schools, businesses, et cetera, to address the disparities  in minorities health care treatment but especially for life-endangering illnesses like cancer. Let us recognize the National Minority Cancer Week as an opportunity to increase awareness in the knowledge of cancer detection treatment and risk through, among other things, target outreach programs to minorities and other underserved communities. f ",2002
165,House,107,0.533,50,2002-04-25,Mr. NORWOOD.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to spend a moment on the floor of the House this afternoon dealing with an issue that passed this House by voice vote overwhelmingly during the discussion on the agricultural bill earlier this session. We now have in conference the ag bill that seems to be moving  forward. I have grave concerns in one particular area, Mr. Speaker, that I am going to be working over the course of the next few days to seek clarification because I want to make sure that the intent of the House and the Senate are preserved in the final form that comes out of conference. Mr. Speaker, there has been a practice of cockfighting, game hens, that has been tolerated by this Congress even though  it  is now  illegal  in 47 States. The public long ago has come to the point that this practice is inherently inhuman and barbaric. b1545 The handlers of these fighting birds drug the animals to heighten their aggression and to clot the blood. They affix knives or ice picks like gaffs to their legs and place them into a pit to fight until one of them is dead, all for amusement and illegal gambling. Mr. Speaker, this barbaric practice is slowly being made illegal around the country. It is currently legal in only three States. The  problem  is  that under current law it is still legal to transport  these  birds  from  States where it is illegal to States that it is legal, and this loophole is exploited to allow people to maintain, to train, and it facilitates illegal game bird fighting. Last October, my colleague, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TANCREDO), and I offered two amendments to the farm bill that would close these loopholes and strengthen the penalty for violations  of  animal  fighting  laws. These  two amendments were passed overwhelmingly by this body by voice vote, adopted in identical form in the Senate. This, in fact, should not even be a conference  item.  Identical  language was adopted by both the House and the Senate. The  intent of both Chambers was to close the loophole, ban foreign export of fighting animals, and increase the penalty. According to the House Agriculture Committee’s Web  site, a conference committee is permitted to deal only with matters in disagreement between the House and the Senate. It may not change language that both have previously approved. ",2002

The vote by the Senate is on a motion to table the amendment. I believe that Senator CARPERshould be given a straight up-or-down vote on his amendment, and for that reason, I shall vote against the motion to table. ",2002
169,Senate,107,-0.446,113,2002-04-25,Mr. CORZINE.," Mr. President, we want to make sure in this compromise amendment that the perfect not be the enemy of the good. This is not everything anyone would want, but we have struck a compromise with voluntary reporting requirements and database buildup and recognition of actions by industry to control CO2. We will look at it in 5 years. If the threshold is not met, mandatory requirements will come into play. This  is an outstanding  compromise where people worked very hard on a complex issue to get to a bipartisan middle ground. I hope we will all support it. ",2002
170,Senate,107,0.344,113,2002-04-25,Mr. HAGEL.," Mr. President, with the adoption of this amendment, the Senate has affirmed  its commitment to dealing with the reporting of greenhouse gases in a voluntary, incentivebased manner. This amendment provides for a voluntary registry for the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Under this type of provision, industries will have an opportunity to record reductions made  in their emissions and receive credit for those reductions. The legislative record should clearly note that the provisions creating the mandatory  reporting  of  greenhouse gases originally contained in the underlying legislation will no longer take effect unless  the voluntary  registry does not achieve a critical mass of participation.  If  the voluntary  registry system generates sufficient participation, the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions will never take effect. This amendment is not without problems, nor do I believe it is the best way to achieve robust participation  in a voluntary registry. It contains several impediments that should be addressed in conference. The memorandum of agreement does not clearly spell out the roles of the various federal agencies in the execution of the duties proscribed. This is particularly  troublesome  for  a  voluntary registry. Those entities wishing to participate need the greatest clarity and certainty  in order to have the greatest incentive to participate. Lack of certainty creates a disincentive and should be addressed in conference. There are onerous civil penalties contained is this amendment that should be removed. Greater baseline protection needs to be provided to ensure entities participating gain the rightful recognition for their efforts. Furthermore, I hope the conference will address the fundamental question of whether any ‘‘trigger’’ is necessary. The mandatory  reporting  of  greenhouse gas emissions has no true purpose. We already garner information on the totality of U.S. emissions through annual inventories established within and reported by the Energy Information Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. The only purpose for the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions is to create the mechanism for the regulation of carbon dioxide. This option has been dismissed by the current Administration, and I would hope the final legislation does not create a mechanism to help bring this about in the future. Numerous other options  for structuring  a  voluntary  greenhouse  gas emissions registry were discussed during the discourse on Title XI of this legislation. Senator VOINOVICHand I offered an amendment on April 18, 2002. It would have established a new and enhanced national greenhouse gas registry to record and recognize voluntary gas  emisof  greenhouse  reductions  sions. That  registry was  supported by a wide cross-section of American industry, the very entities who would be participating in such a registry. I have included a copy of an April 16 letter sent to all Senators and ask unanimous consent  that  it  be  printed  in  the RECORD immediately following my remarks. ",2002

173,Senate,107,-0.25,162,2002-04-25,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, today, I proudly join with Senator KERRY to introduce the Native American Small Business Development Act of 2002. This important  legislation  is designed  to help American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to overcome barriers which  inhibit business development and job creation. We greatly appreciate  the  support  of  the  distinguished Senators who join us in sponsoring the  legislation  including Senators CANTWELL, WELLSTONE, DASCHLE, BAUCUS, INOUYE, BINGAMAN, STABENOW, and CLINTON.  I  encourage my  colleagues to support this critical legislation. The communities served by this initiative represent some of the most traditionally isolated, disadvantaged, and underserved populations in our country. Despite the unique and persistent challenges to business development in these areas, many of the supportive services the Federal Government provides to entrepreneurs are not available in these distressed regions. The Native American Small Business Development Act endeavors to develop and  disseminate  culturally  tailored business assistance to assure Native American businesses may secure and sustain long-term success. Among the achievements included in the bill is the establishment of a statutory office within the U.S. Small Business Administration to focus on concerns specific to Native American populations. The Office of Native American Affairs will serve as an advocate in the SBA for the interests of Native Americans.  In  addition  to  administering the Native American Development Program, the Assistant Administrator will consult with Tribal Colleges, Tribal Governments, Alaska Native Corporations and Native Hawaiian Organizations to enhance the development and implementation of culturally specific  approaches  to  support  the growth and prosperity of Native American small businesses. Furthermore, the Act creates the Native American Development Program to provide necessary business development assistance. These  services are vital to establish and support small businesses.

177,House,107,-0.658,223,2002-05-01,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER), for coming here to make I think important improvements and to make recommendations that  I think we will take to heart in considering where we go in terms of family abuse, violence against women, which has been gaining increasing bipartisan support in both bodies.  I am very pleased with the work of the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE), who brings this motion to instruct before us. Mr. Speaker, remember that it was the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGHTER) who has tried to give statutory  foundation  to  the  Violence Against Women Office, and it was our colleague, the gentlewoman from Wisconsin  (Ms. BALDWIN), on  the Committee on the Judiciary whose amendment was accepted and is now a subject of us instructing our conferees how to move. It is clear from this discussion that there  is bipartisan support. We still have a long way to go. But in Michigan, in Detroit, we are getting ready for our second metropolitan area town hall meeting which will be at Greater Grace Church at the end of this month. The  first one held over a year ago brought together for the first time police, prosecutors, social workers, victims, family, clergy, lawyers and community people who were really inspired by the Federal involvement in this. What we are simply doing here today is letting our conferees know that this office should be as strong and as independent as they can make it because they have been working with the U.S. Attorneys, they have been training the judges and  the prosecutors and  the members of the private bar, they have been working with  Immigration and Naturalization Service. So this is a huge step forward. I am very pleased to be associated with it. Obviously, the only direction we can go now, and we are deciding this, I think, as we gain more experience with the office itself, what we are trying to make sure is that we do not have an office that is just a grant agency. We want to be able to distribute grants where they are appropriate, but also it has to be a policy mechanism that advises the administration and the Congress alike. I thank all the Members on the floor that have spoken in support of this. ",2002
178,House,107,-0.262,223,2002-05-01,Ms. HARMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me time and commend on a bipartisan basis the efforts of those on the floor right now to help battered women. The Violence Against Women Act was a promise by Congress to make America and the home a safer place for women. This act promised to finally treat domestic violence like the crime that it is, to improve law enforcement, to make streets safer for women, and to vigorously prosecute perpetrators. It promised more counseling and more shelters to provide a safe haven  for abused women. But, Mr. Speaker, underfunding and neglect have made this promise halffilled at best. The Violence Against Women Office cannot lead our Nation’s efforts to serve victims of domestic violence if it is merely a check-writing organization. It needs strong statutory authority and adequate staff to do its job. The Violence Against Women Office is essential to the Government’s role in preventing violence, but private industry must also play a vital role. Mr. Speaker, let me give you one example. One year ago, Harman International lost a 26-year employee who was brutally attacked and killed by her estranged husband. In response, Harman  International worked with  the Family Violence Prevention Fund to develop a comprehensive domestic violence prevention policy and to educate its employees about domestic violence. Harman  International’s policy states that domestic violence is not tolerated, and provides employees flexibility to take time off to handle the legal and mental consequences of domestic violence. The program protects those employees and helps the company by recognizing that the work of a victim of domestic violence suffers as she suffers. But as Harman International was developing this policy, it discovered that few other companies have similar policies and programs. Mr. Speaker, we need to work across the board to prevent domestic violence in both public and private sectors. I commend  successful efforts  to date, like those of Rainbow Services, Ltd., a haven  for  battered women  in San Pedro, California, and I commend companies like Harman International. Mr. Speaker,  I encourage my colleagues to vote for this important motion. ",2002

180,House,107,0.505,237,2002-05-01,Mr. SMITH of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, I see also that this is a problem of the survival of the future of farm programs. With all of this publicity that is going out, and it does not matter what paper we pick up, they now realize that there is a loophole; and the Environmental Working Group has passed out the information that a lot of these big corporate-type farms are getting a lot of the money. I think that is going to come back to hurt the average family farm in terms of the kind of programs that we can offer here in Washington, D.C., because it is bad publicity, so a lot of people start thinking, well,  farmers are already rich. They are getting these million-dollar payments. The fact is exactly as the gentleman suggests, that in our efforts to appease these  large,  influential  farms,  these large landowners, the large grain and cotton dealers, we have come up with a program that allows those big farmers the incentive to have unlimited production, overproduction, really, if you will. That means that the prices are going to go down for everybody else, with more pressure on those farmers. When push comes to shove  in the next 10 or 15 years, when we are looking at the survival of Social Security and the survival of Medicare, and we say, well, are we going to have to cut off some of the farm programs because a lot of people in America say we are giving too much money to these rich farmers  anyway, what  do Members think is going to happen? What is going to happen is we are going to cut down on farm programs. At that time, probably we will cut down on the big, large million-dollar payments to the big farmers, too. But probably it is going to jeopardize the effectiveness of the farm programs for the survival of the agriculture industry in the United States. That is one of my main concerns. ",2002
181,House,107,0.638,244,2002-05-01,Mr. SCHAFFER.," We had something like the Florida plan in the draft of the President’s bill as it was introduced last year, and it got stripped out right at the first committee hearing. It did not last very long. That is, frankly, why we are here now, because since the choice elements were stripped out of the President’s bill, something the President wanted, we have been working with the White House and have spoken directly with the President; and he has committed to making sure that a choice element, a tax credit provision, becomes law and becomes a high priority in this Congress. But I would  like to ask the gentleman from Michigan to comment, if he would, on just this notion of choice. The gentleman from Florida indicated very clearly the experience we have seen in several other States through the research of the Committee on Education and the Workforce is that public schools, government-owned schools are really not threatened by choice. That is where we find the greatest resistance up  front, because there are people who think if we allow this system to have some kind of alternative funding structure, that all the people who are employed at any of these levels are somehow going to lose their jobs,  if we can,  instead, adopt  the model on that chart, of direct contributions to education and more of a market approach. But what we found is very different. These people do not lose their jobs; they just get better at it. ",2002
182,House,107,0.516,244,2002-05-01,Mr. HOEKSTRA.,"  I thank my colleague for yielding. Let me give an example in Michigan. In Michigan, we passed a proposal called Proposal A. What Proposal A did is it led towards equalized funding so that if you are a student in Highland, Michigan, or Detroit, or whatever, you are going to get relatively the same amount of money per student enrolled. That has been very, very positive because we had great discrepancies between one school district versus another. So we have narrowed that gap. One of the sides effects of that has been that the public school administrators have now kind of, I like to call it, become Beggars de Lansing. If they get some special needs in their community or whatever, they no longer have that direct connection to the taxpayer and to the parents in their community that says, hey, we have a special need and we need some extra money for the next 3 to 5 years for an English as a second language program, or we really want to keep this school open. They cannot do it anymore. They have to go to the State legislature. And the State legislature does not really understand that community. What tax credits will now do, the money that will be there with the taxpayer, that is new money going in to education, money not being invested in education today; and that will help our public schools as well to be able to go into their community and say we have this special need; we want to do this, and the folks at the State capital do not have the latitude or the flexibility to give us this money. Will you give us that money? And if they have built up a credible relationship and they are well  respected  in  their  community, they can expect an infusion of additional money  to meet  some of  the needs that they may have. b1730 I think the gentleman is absolutely right that the case in Florida is that this raises all of education. It raises public education and provides them an important link back into their community. It can raise private and parochial education, and that is what we are trying to do here. I talked to kids from Hudsonville, Michigan,  and  I  have three children, and I am very selfish. When those kids come out of college and high school, I want them to have the best education of any kids in the world. I want that to be available to every kid in America. I do not care if the kids in Japan match our kids’ education. I hope they do. We want good educational opportunities for all of our kids around the world, but the one thing that I will not accept is that our kids will come out of our educational system with a second-rate education, that they will be second, third, fourth or fifth to kids somewhere else in the world because that means that the jobs that they will have, the life-style that they will have, and the opportunities that they will have will become diminished. We need to make sure that every single one of our kids gets the best education in the world. This is one other step, and combining it with accountability and with more money going into education and then raising every type of education, private, parochial and public, to raise education.

Fifty-eight  credit unions,  credit union associations, and credit union leagues sponsored this Washington, DC institution,  which coincides with the annual spring  rites of the tidal basin cherry blossoms. This is the first year that Credit  Unions have sponsored the race.  I want to commend the over 7,032 finishers, and especially the over 3,500  registered runners who were member of  credit unions. A  special congratulations to Public Health Service Federal  Credit Union  for winning the credit  union team competition. Additionally,  I am proud of 350 plus credit union employees who arrived at the race in the  chilly, pre-dawn hours to serve as volunteers helping administer the race. It  was  also  great  to  see Health  and  Human  Services  Secretary  Tommy  Thompson participate.  The Cherry Blossom Run has taken  place during the spring blooming of  Washington’s historic cherry trees for  30 years. Starting out as a small family  event with 141 finishers it is now a  world-class event that includes some of  the world’s foremost long distance runners. I want to congratulate this year’s  winners: Men’s,  Rueben  Cheruiyot,  47:12; Women’s, Luminita Talpos, 52:50.  This year, in conjunction with the  race, credit unions raised over $60,000  for the Children’s Miracle Network and  donations  are  still  being  collected.

188,Senate,107,0.356,43,2002-05-13,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Mr. President, I  rise today with Senator FEINSTEINand  50 of my colleagues to submit a resolution to honor the service and professionalism of the men and women in the  United States who serve as flight attendants.  A career as a  flight attendant requires  a  deep  commitment.  Their  schedules are unpredictable, their work  hours are long and intense, and the nature of the job causes long absences  from  the  company  of  family  and  friends. Not too many years ago, a  flight  attendant,  or  ‘‘stewardess’’,  could be fired for getting married or  becoming  pregnant.  Happily,  those  dark ages are over, thanks to the sacrifices made by generations of flight  attendants who have served all of us.  Today’s flight attendants are dedicated men and women who are charged  with many important responsibilities.  Of course, they serve  food and beverages  to passengers under cramped  and difficult conditions. They also assist children traveling alone, as well as  elderly and disabled passengers. When  requires, they administer first aid, including CPR and artificial respiration.  Most of all, they are responsible for the  safety and security of the passengers  from the time the aircraft pulls away  from the gate, and they are on duty  until the plane arrives at its destination.  On September 11, terrorism struck  the United States as hijacked aircraft  were used as massive weapons of destruction. Despite being trained merely  to comply with the hijackers’ demands  and to calm the passengers, many went  above and beyond these limitations and  displayed  great  courage. Using  cell  phones to relay information to ground  crews, crews aboard American Airlines  Flights 11 and 77 and United Airlines  Flights 93 and 175 assisted law enforcement officials  in  identifying the hijackers and assessing the nature of the  threats. Despite the ultimate loss of  their lives, the crews of these flights  took heroic steps trying to thwart the  terrorists’  intentions  and  prevented  further destruction. It is humbling to  realize that many of our lives, as well  as our beloved Capitol building, may  have been saved by the sacrifices of the  crew of flight 93.  On October  1, another potentially  disastrous event was averted on American Airlines Flight 1238 traveling from  Los Angeles to Chicago, when a passenger attempted to break through the  cockpit door to attack the flight crew.  The cabin crew helped stop the attempt  and ingeniously placed serving carts to  secure the cockpit.  On December 28, 2001, quick thinking  flight attendants made the difference  on American Airlines Flight  63  en  route from Paris to Miami, when Richard Reid, an accused al Qaeda-trained  terrorist, attempted to light a powerful  explosive concealed  in his shoes. An  alert flight attendant led the rest of  the cabin crew in a successful struggle  to prevent a devastating  explosion.  Reid was restrained and ultimately arrested, but not before several flight attendants were injured in the battle to  subdue Reid.  I encourage flight attendants to continue to provide America’s travelers  with the service and security we need  to revive our aviation industry. I urge  my Senate colleagues to join with me  in  saluting and honoring America’s  flight attendants and by passing this  resolution.  f  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND  PROPOSED  SA 3402.

Pat was born in St. Bernard, Ohio on June 9, 1932. She grew up during the Great Depression in the town of Woodlawn, attended Woodlawn Elementary, and then went on to Reading High School. Without a doubt, Pat has lived an active and full life over the past 70 years. Following high  school, Pat married and started a  family. She stayed home with her children  for 12 years before going back  to work for the next 40 plus years. Pat has always been very dedicated to our community. Among her work and activities, Pat was a member of the Order of the Eastern Star for over 30 years, serving as Worthy Matron (President)  in 1970 and again  in 1972. Pat also wrote  the Reading Social News, a column which appeared in the Valley Courier for 19 years. For the past 9 years, she has served as Clerk of Council  for  the Reading City Council. Pat also has been a member of the Reading Republican Club since 1989. She was President of the Club in 1992. In 1995, she was the Reading Republican of the Year. Other activities  include her past volunteer work at Hilltop School, where she taught disadvantaged kindergarteners  in  the Early  I.D. program, and her service as a liturgist at St. John United Church of Christ. Pat has a great sense of humor, and 5 children, 11 grandchildren, 2 great grandchildren and, in her words, ‘ two really spoiled dogs.’ She is a wonderful person, and her beloved Reading, Ohio is fortunate to have her. All of us in the Cincinnati area recognize Pat’s outstanding service and contributions to our community. f AIR TRAFFIC RETIREMENT REFORM ACT OF 2002 HON. JAMES L. OBERSTAR OFMINNESOTA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 16, 2002 ",2002
191,,107,-0.553,44,2002-05-17,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to introduce the Air Traffic Retirement Reform Act of 2002. This legislation will grant air traffic controllers, and more specifically air  traffic controller supervisors, the same treatment that federal  firefighters and  law enforcement officers (LEOs) receive under  the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and  the Federal Employment Retirement System (FERS). Both the CSRS and the FERS provide early retirement  benefits  and  require mandatory separation  for safety-related occupations,  including federal firefighters, LEOs and air traffic controllers. Under both CSRS and FERS, firefighters/LEOs and controllers are eligible  for retirement after 25 years of service or after becoming 50 years old and completing 20 years of service. Additionally, the annuities for firefighters, LEOs and controllers are higher than ordinary federal employees under CSRS and FERS. However, the current definition of an air traffic controller in both CSRS and FERS is limited to people who are actively engaged in directing air  traffic or  their  immediate supervisors. As a result, air traffic controllers who are promoted  to staff specialists or second level managers before they are eligible to retire lose all benefits currently guaranteed controllers under CSRS and FERS. Yet,  firefighters and LEOs that are promoted to management positions do not need  to make a similar sacrifice. The Air Traffic Retirement Reform Act of 2002 amends the CSRS and FERS to provide a more expansive two-tier definition of air traffic controllers. The new definition will include both employees covered under  the current definition of air traffic controllers and second level supervisors. Second  level supervisors would be eligible for the same retirement benefits available to line-controllers. The Air Traffic Retirement Reform Act of 2002 provides fairness and parity, between air traffic controllers and other federal safety professionals. f THE  FEDERAL  LAW  ENFORCEMENT PAY EQUITY AND REFORM ACT OF 2002 HON. MIKE ROGERS OFMICHIGAN INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 16, 2002 ",2002
192,,107,0.4,44,2002-05-17,Mr. ROGERS of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today, during National Law Enforcement Memorial Week, to introduce the Federal Law Enforcement Pay Equity and Reform Act of 2002. Mr. Speaker, this week in our nation’s capital and around America, a variety of events are being held to honor law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of duty and those who continue  to serve. The very real dangers  faced by  the dedicated men and women who protect us every day was brought home as never before last September 11. While we cannot  turn back  the clock and undo what was done, we can and must do everything within our power  to ensure  that  it never happens again. And  it  is our  law enforcement officers, and, in particular, our federal  law  enforcement  agencies,  that  are charged with that paramount mission. The bill I am  introducing  today will help accomplish this goal by enhancing and modernizing  the compensation system for our nation’s federal law enforcement officers.

193,,107,-0.092,51,2002-05-17,Mr. SHOWS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing National Police Week. On September 11th, and the days that followed, the images of our police officers and firefighters rushing towards the toppling World Trade Center towers, as others fled for their lives, remained a constant image on our television screens. As hundreds of these valiant men and women perished on that terrible day, I was reminded of the thousands of police officers in Mississippi and across our nation, who each day put their lives in danger in the interest of our nation’s welfare. It is important that we take opportunities to commend our officers and their equally brave families for their commitment to public safety. I was proud  that President Bush visited  the United States Capitol yesterday to attend the 21st annual National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service to honor and remember the 230 law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of duty last year. This week I have thought a lot about Officer Ron Jones, of the Prentiss Police Department in Jeff Davis County, which is also my home county. Officer Jones lost his life the day after Christmas  last year, while participating  in a drug raid to halt the flow of narcotics into a city of only 1500 people. Ron Jones was a four year veteran K–9 officer who  loved his job. He had a great role model. His father is the Police Chief of the same Police Department. And this family, who has devoted their life to fighting crime, and improving the very community they’ve grown up in, has now lost one of their own. This is a tragedy in itself. But the heartbreaking truth is that this happens in communities across our great nation every week of the year. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully request that my colleagues join me in paying tribute to the legions of heroes-our police officers— who serve our country with faith, diligence and honor. We should mourn the thousands of lives unjustly lost, and honor those officers who continue to serve. f TRIBUTE TO JERRY REIMANN HON. FRED UPTON OFMICHIGAN INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 16, 2002 ",2002
194,,107,0.339,51,2002-05-17,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker, Jerry Relmann is retiring after 36 years of service to the Berrien County Intermediate School District in Southwest Michigan. His commitment  to kids and their education will not be forgotten. Jerry has been an invaluable colleague in helping craft education policy and ensuring that our kids receive a quality education. Jerry began his career in 1966 as a school psychologist  for  the Berrien County  Intermediate School District. Dedicated, principled, and hard-working, Jerry’s  love  for education led him to embrace a career within Michigan’s public school system. Jerry has held a number of posts within the Berrien County ISD, including Director of Special Education and his current position as Superintendent. Under his administration, students of Berrien County have thrived. We owe him a  tremendous debt of gratitude. I would like to personally extend my regards to Jerry for his counsel on the reauthorization of  the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as well as his commitment to special education  funding  for Michigan’s children. Jerry was able to bring to the table a local perspective during this debate over federal education initiatives.  I will  truly miss working with  this great individual. Good luck and God Bless. f TRIBUTE TO MR. RICHARD ‘‘DICK’’ W.  DILLON  OF  HUTCHINSON, KANSAS HON. JERRY MORAN OFKANSAS INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 16, 2002 ",2002
195,,107,0.414,51,2002-05-17,Mr. MORAN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who affected the lives of many people  in Kansas and across the country. This month we honor the life of Mr. Richard ‘ ‘Dick’  Dillon of Hutchinson, Kansas. Dick fulfilled many important roles in his life— each of them with integrity, passion and enthusiasm. Dick  proudly  served  his  country  in  the United States Air Force for two stints, culminating in active duty service during the Korean War. Dick’s dedication to his hometown was unsurpassed. Throughout his life, he took a lead role in making certain his community of Hutchinson was progressive  in pursuits of education, culture and other quality of life issues. His leadership and service on the board of directors for the community foundation, school district,  hospital  and  church were  always marked with trademark humor and a keen emphasis on questioning and listening. Dick was, by every account, a successful businessman. Along with his brother, Ray ‘Ace’  Dillon, Jr., and his cousin, Paul, Dick worked to develop Dillons Stores— his father’s grocery business— into a nationwide retailer. It later became part of  the Kroger Company family. Those whom he  interacted with  for over 40 years wholeheartedly agree on the impact of his vision and dedication to the business. His colleagues summed up their goodbye this way: ‘ ‘Dick was short on ceremony and long on giving credit to others. He helped us all walk a little taller.’  I can think of no finer compliment. Most important to Dick was his family. Over the course of 50 years, he and his wife, Carolyn, raised three sons, Brad, Reed and Steve, to love and attention  and devoted endless  their six grandchildren. Dick fulfilled many important roles in his life, and in each of those roles made his community, state and nation a better place. I join his many  friends and admirers  in extending my deepest sympathies to Carolyn and her family during their time of loss. f PAYING TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM T. WARD, III HON. SCOTT McINNIS OFCOLORADO INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 16, 2002 Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor I take this opportunity to recognize William T. Ward, III as an exceptional individual whose contributions to the University of Southern Colorado have helped shape a positive future  for  the University and  its students. On June 28th, William, known as Bill, will retire, leaving behind a legacy of accomplishments. It is with great pleasure that I applaud an individual who has selflessly committed his time and energy to the betterment of his community. Bill and his family have lived in Pueblo since 1946 and their hard work helped build and uphold the principles and values of the Pueblo community. Because of Bill’s devotion and dedication, it is fitting that he was elected as the President of the CSU Alumni in 1973. In 1986 he pursued a real estate career, and he ends his duties with dignity and integrity by retiring from his current position as the Director of Development and Alumni Relations at the University of Southern Colorado. Mr. Speaker, today we honor an individual who closes a chapter on a very  fruitful and successful career. I commend the hard work and dedication Bill has provided to the association, and I am confident his experience and wisdom will benefit all of his future endeavors. Bill has been a model community member, and that is why I bring forth his accomplishments before this body of Congress and the nation. Bill’s hard work is greatly appreciated and we salute his diligence to his community. f CONGRATULATIONS TO ST. JOHN’S UNIVERSITY MEN’S GOLF TEAM HON. MARK R.

As a St. John’s alum, I take special pride in paying tribute to Coach Bob Alpers and the players on this year’s team: Sammy Schmitz, Farmington; Nathan Proshek, New Prague; Paul Ponath, St. Cloud; Josh Sherlin, Glenwood; Ben Goodman, Stillwater. This year’s  team  is currently ranked 13th nationally  and won  their  third-consecutive MIAC title.

199,House,107,-0.362,4,2002-05-24,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to oppose this undemocratic rule, and I  stand here today to honor our troops  who are putting their lives on the line  to defend our freedom and our way of  life. We Democrats support funding the  war on terrorism and homeland security, and if Republicans gave us a clean  bill to fund just these efforts, we would  have a unified House; a unified House.  But instead of supporting our troops,  Republicans are playing politics, the  very worst type of politics, with the futures of the very people who are protecting us. And yes, there is an emergency here, and that is the $750 billion  debt we are placing on America’s children, seniors, families, and veterans.  Yes, I stand here today to honor our  troops who are on the front line for  freedom and those who have fought in  the past to secure the  freedoms we  enjoy. But this House has a responsibility to protect these American heroes, and that is what we intend to do.  That is why we Democrats are trying  to do everything in our power to prevent Republicans from mortgaging the  future of our fighting men and women  by saddling them with a debt that will  take generations to pay off, a debt that  will raid Social Security and Medicare.  If my colleagues believe in this debt  limit increase, if they believe in unbridled credit card spending, then vote for  it and let those of us who oppose it  vote against it and let the American  people see who stands on what side.  Yes, our troops are defending our  freedom, and freedom is about openness  and democracy and responsibility, little of which we are seeing from the Republican side today. Democracy is not  about martial  law.  If you want  to  honor our troops, then do not saddle  them and their families with a mountain of debt. You want to honor our  veterans, then do not threaten their  Social Security and do not seek cover  behind the bravery and valor of our  troops to hide your own lack of conviction. Give us a vote up or down on how  high America’s debt will be and let us  see where the people will stand.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the $750 billion you have saddled on America’s future. b0130  ",2002
200,House,107,-0.265,4,2002-05-24,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I have a  problem here with the 16-hour delay.  This  supplemental has  been  sitting  here for 2 months, and we got it up, and  we complain about 16 hours’ delay?  The thing that worries me as much  as anything is we have a shortfall on  the National Guard of $1.8 billion. We  have those National Guard deployed.  We have  78,000 National Guard deployed  throughout  the country, National Guard and Reserve.  We have taken the money out of  that. The committee put it back in.  The chairman of the committee could  only squeeze back in $800 million. We  are now short almost $1 billion for the  National Guard. I am talking about the  bill actually says we have to cut people  on active duty by 14,000 people in order  to make up for the shortfall.  Now, we say, okay, we are only talking here, or we are finagling around  here in order to get through so we have  enough money. But it sends a terrible  signal to the troops that we do not  have confidence and we are going to  cut. In other words, when we vote for  this rule, we have eliminated $800 million. We have not funded, I should say,  $1.8 billion to take care of people who  are on active duty.  The National Guard called and they  were bananas about the fact that we  were cutting the National Guard by  $1.8 billion. We did the best we could  do, and we put half the money back in.  I am sure between the chairman, the  ranking member, the chairmen of both  committees, the ranking members, we  will get that money back.  But the difficulty is that here we are  to get through this thing, to get it over  to the Senate, and we are actually voting to cut back on troops that are on  active duty right now. Then we get  criticized for 16 hours’ debate, as if we  are unpatriotic.  I have been here 16 hours listening to  all this rhetoric about how unpatriotic  people are. This is not what this is all  about. This  is about money  for the  troops.  The second thing, we have almost  8,000 employees  in western Pennsylvania for USAir. I talked to the chairman about it; I talked to the chairman  of the Republican political campaign.  He has as much interest as I do, and  the  gentleman  from Virginia  (Mr.  MORAN) has as much interest as I do.  We are talking about real people.  We met today with the chairman of  USAir. He is going to go bankrupt if  this is not settled. Again, what have we  done? We have taken money, or we put  a limitation on the money. We thought  we solved the problem, so USAir went  to the banks. The banks said, no, this  does not solve the problem. We will not  be able to lend them money. So here we  are tonight passing legislation which  will mean that USAir could go bankrupt tomorrow or the next day.  I am sure if the chairman calls them  tomorrow and says, look, we are going  to straighten this out in conference,  the problem  is the Senate has gone  home and they have passed the same  legislation. The exact same wording in  the legislation says that there is a restriction, and the banks will not lend  them the money.  So we have a real problem here, for  those of us who represent USAir. They  have  lost  tremendous  amounts  of  money in this latest disaster that we  had. They shut down National for a  long period of time. We restricted the  flights all through the United States.  We passed originally, when the height  of this disaster occurred, we passed all  kinds of money and said, this money is  going to be available. All at once we  put a restriction on when they can  apply for a loan. It is disconcerting.  The other thing we have done, when  we talk about delaying a supplemental,  the military has a difficult time. The  chairman of the  full committee can  tell us this. Every time we delay a supplemental, it means they have to take  VerDate May 14 2002  01:52 May 25, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K24MY7.008 pfrm15 PsN: H24PT1 ",2002

CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH OFNEWJERSEY INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 23, 2002 ",2002
204,,107,0.16,53,2002-05-24,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to  inform my colleagues about a very special event  that will  take place  this Monday, May 27th, Memorial Day, in Cooperstown, New York.  In a special ceremony, on the day  in which we honor America’s  fallen heroes,  the National Baseball Hall of Fame will take time out to honor the 64 members of Baseball’s Hall of Fame who served honorably in our nation’s armed forces. Mr. Speaker, as a nation, we remember and honor  the dedicated service of all veterans who have worn  the uniform of  the United States, including those without the famous sobriquets or the notoriety of our baseball legends. As a fan and amateur player, I have long cherished baseball and those who played the game. As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs of the United States House of Representatives, I have the privilege of working every day on behalf of America’s veterans. That is why I am so pleased that the Hall of Fame has chosen to hold this remembrance. During a special ceremony on Monday at Cooperstown, a plaque will be erected in the Hall of Fame Gallery  to permanently honor these veterans who earned baseball’s highest recognition. In announcing  this event, Dale Petroskey, president of  the National Baseball Hall of Fame, explained its purpose: ‘Since the first pitch was thrown, baseball history has been  intertwined with American history . . . during World War II, some 95 percent of all major leaguers registered for active duty, including its biggest stars. Hall of Fame members who put themselves in harm’s way and sacrificed some of their most productive baseball years join a special category we call true national heroes. This plaque represents their sacrifice and bravery and reminds us of all Americans who have fought— and are continuing to fight— for freedom.’ Mr. Speaker, among the 64 veterans being honored this coming Monday are five veterans of World War  II who will be  in attendance: Warren Spahn, Bobby Doerr, Bob Feller, Ralph Kiner, and Phil Rizzuto. Warren Spahn, of Buffalo, New York, was elected  to  the Hall of Fame  in 1973. A  left handed batter and pitcher for the Boston-Milwaukee Braves, Mr. Spahn had 363 career wins,  led  the National League  in wins eight times, and was awarded the Cy Young award in 1957 as baseball’s most outstanding pitcher. In his 21-year long career, he was voted an all-star 14  times, pitched  two no-hitters, and holds the National League record for total number of innings pitched. Mr. Spahn missed the 1943, 1944, and 1945 major league seasons while serving courageously in the United States Army. During his  service, he was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star. Bobby Doerr, known as ‘ the silent captain of the Red Sox’ , played second base for Boston. He held the American League record for handling 414 plays without errors and was also a prominent leader among second basemen in double plays, putouts, and assists. Following his service in the United States Army, Mr. Doerr returned to baseball in 1946, leading the Red Sox to the World Series where he batted a remarkable .406. Bob Feller of  the Cleveland  Indians was known as ‘ ‘Rapid Robert’  during his 18 years of professional baseball.  In 1940, Mr. Feller led the American League with 27 games won, a 2.61 earned  run average, 261 strikeouts, and 31 complete games. Despite the loss of four years in his career due to his time spent serving his country in World War II, Mr. Feller had 2,581 strikeouts and pitched three no-hitters. During his service in the United States Navy, Mr. Feller was awarded five campaign ribbons studded with eight battle stars. Ralph Kiner played  for  the Pittsburgh Pirates, debuting in 1946 after his service with the United States Navy. In his 10-year career, Mr. Kiner had 369 homeruns and averaged 7.1 homeruns per 100 at-bats, which places him directly behind Babe Ruth,  the all-time leader in this statistical category. In 1951, Mr. Kiner led the National League with a .452 onbase percentage and a .627 slugging percentage. Elected into the Hall of Fame in 1975, Mr. Kiner was known as a  true powerhitter who envisioned a home  run each  time he stepped up to the plate. Following his playing career, he became an announcer for the New York Mets, where he has  remained  for 40 years, still hosting a popular post-game show called ‘ ‘Kiner ’s Corner.’ And finally, Phil Rizzuto, of Brooklyn, New York, played for the Yankees for 13 seasons. Known as ‘ ‘The Scooter’ , Rizzuto was a slick fielding shortstop and incredible base runner who ended his baseball career with a  .273 batting average. He was named an All-Star five  times and was  the American League’s Most Valuable Player in 1950. As a member of the United States Navy, Phil Rizzuto fought in World War II for three years and missed the 1943, 1944 and 1945 seasons. As you can see, Mr. Speaker, these gentlemen were  extraordinary  ball  players who earned the title of American heroes on the diamond. More  importantly,  they were soldiers, sailors and marine, audacious and bravehearted, who answered  their country’s call. Like  the other 59 members of  the Hall of Fame, including one Civil War veteran, they interrupted successful careers  to defend  the freedom and liberties that each of us are privileged to enjoy today. On a day when we celebrate the heroism and honor the memory of millions of men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country, I am pleased to see that these Hall of Famers also honored  for  their service. It is both fitting and appropriate to pay homage  to  these special veterans who answered  the call  to duty when  their nation needed them. Mr. Speaker,  I call on all Americans who cherish  liberty and  freedom  to  join us  this VerDate 11<MAY>2000 03:06 May 25, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A23MY8.033 pfrm04 PsN: E24PT1 ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ’ ’ ’ ",2002
205,,107,-0.333,60,2002-05-24,Mr. BALDACCI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reintroduce  the Safe and Fair Enforcement and Recall for Meat and Poultry Act— to help strengthen the protection of meat and poultry across the United States. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee,  I have  long been concerned about the safety of our nation’s  food and water supplies. My SAFER Meat and Poultry Act would expedite the removal of potentially  contaminated products from store shelves and provide greater enforcement authority to protect public health. This bill calls for more consistent and vigilant  implementation of  the USDA’s Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) program. The legislation will strengthen government accountability and expedite the removal of potentially harmful meat and poultry  from store shelves. Recent reports suggest that USDA properly inspects meat-processing facilities on a daily basis less than 40 percent of the time. Further, a number of plants may have never been tested. I am pleased that the Bioterrorism legislation passed earlier this week will help to alleviate some of USDA’s problems with funding plant inspections. However, this bill to provide greater disclosure of contaminants, increased penalties for knowingly distributing  tainted products, and greater authority for the Agriculture Secretary to move swiftly against facilities found to be producing harmful meat and poultry products will  lead  to a healthier and safer American food supply. Furthermore, my bill will help alert Americans  to  the seriousness of  food bome contamination, which  is estimated  to cause approximately 75 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths per year. Mr. Speaker, given the new and emerging threats to public health and our national security, we must be vigilant in safeguarding our national food supply. I am pleased to be reintroducing this important  legislation, and  I strongly urge my colleagues to support it. thers, sons, mothers, daughters, aunts and uncles. Some died while performing heroic acts, but most were just ordinary people who perished during a brutal act of war. So this year, as we remember our war heroes, let us say a prayer for our newest casualties. Let us make room  in our hearts  for these new recruits  to  the battle  for  freedom and peace. But make no mistake; it will be the military that will shoulder the responsibility of trying to protect us against another attack. It will be our uniformed  troops who will serve  in distant lands, who will miss  their children’s graduations and birthdays, who will not be home for Christmas. And, as in the past, they will go into harm’s way unafraid and with the determination that draws strength from those who fought and died before them. I thank you for your service to our country and to your fellow comrades, especially those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. I thank you for the leadership you have shown as you have lived your lives as stalwart soldiers in America’s  role as  freedom’s beacon. The young men and women serving today are fighting a new kind of war. But it will take the same type of soldier America has always produced— a soldier,  like you, who  is willing  to put aside self interests for the good of the country. A soldier, like those we honor today, who is willing to die for those ideals. Thank you  for all  that you have done  for your country and for the memory of those who are no longer with us. f f A MEMORIAL  DAY MESSAGE—A TRIBUTE TO OUR BRAVE SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN HON.

206,,107,0.333,60,2002-05-24,Mr. CRENSHAW.," Mr. Speaker, I wanted to share some  thoughts with you  today as  the nation pauses to honor the men and women who fought and died to preserve our freedom. It is an especially meaningful Memorial Day as we so  recently were  reminded of  the great country  that we  live  in and  the burden  that goes with protecting our freedoms. Today, our military is fighting a new kind of war. A war not against a country but against an ideology that would try to destroy the liberties that we have come to enjoy. It is a war fought differently. It is a war fought with new technology in a land that is very old world. It is a war that has Forward Air Controllers riding horseback and calling  in strikes  from  laptop computers. It is a war being fought from our ships stationed 700 miles from targets. It is a war that utilizes B– 52s for precision targeting, but it is also a war that calls for our troops to go from cave to cave to seek out the enemy. It is a war whose enemy is difficult to identify. It may be a different kind of war, but war always brings casualties— and this war is no exception. September 11, 2001, gave us a wake-up call on our own soil not felt since Pearl Harbor. This time the victims were not just sailors and other military personnel. This time the victims were secretaries, clerks, stockbrokers, office workers, and, lots and lots of firefighters. These victims, like our military troops, were faESSAY CONTEST WINNERS HON. HENRY J.

207,,107,0.312,60,2002-05-24,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, every year in my district, I ask students in grades 8th and 12th to participate in an essay contest. This year’s contest focused on the events of September 11, 2001, and how they shaped our Nation. Specifically, this year’s essay question was as follows:  ‘September 11, 2001, was a shock felt around  the world. Our country was attacked by suicidal, fanatic terrorists. It must be our resolve  to protect America. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. How can our government protect us at home and abroad?’ I am pleased that so many students chose to enter  this essay  contest. Unfortunately, however,  there can only be one winner  in each group: 8th grade and 12th grade. This year’s 8th grade winner was Melissa DeLeo from Chicago. She attends Mary, Seat of Wisdom School in Park Ridge, IL. The 12th grade winner was Karen Differ from Niles, IL. She attends Maine Township High School South in Park Ridge, IL. Ms. DeLeo’s untitled essay is as follows: I have been taught that America stands for freedom, equality, liberty and justice for all. I believe this even now more than ever before. This is our America, the America that many men and women fought for, the America that is the land of opportunities and my America, the America where I have the opportunity to write this essay with my right of freedom of speech.

208,,107,0.435,67,2002-05-24,Mr. SOUDER.," Mr. Speaker, Windsong Pictures,  Inc., an  independent, nonprofit motion picture company based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, is holding its Third Annual International Windsong Film Festival. The Windsong Film Festival, which this year is  featuring 25 award-winning  independent motion pictures, is unique among film festivals because it specializes not only in showcasing professional  independent  filmmakers  and films, but also in working with students of all ages who are  interested  in  film production. This year the festival will show several motion pictures created by students at Elmhurst High School in Fort Wayne, which is also hosting the  festival. College  students will also be showing their work. Holding this festival is a tremendous privilege for Elmhurst. It gives the school national attention while giving students there a rare opportunity to explore the world of filmmaking. It reminds us that even with the financial pressures  that  are  bearing  on Elmhurst— and many other schools— it  is  important  to keep fine arts education a part of our children’s education. This film festival, and the tremendous film program at Elmhurst, is due in no small part to Michael Floyd. Floyd is executive producer of the festival and, perhaps more importantly, the  leader of Elmhurst Cinema Productions, the club that allows so many students the opportunity to make their own movies. In addition to showcasing student work, the festival this year includes special screenings of professionally-produced  independent movies for students, who after watching the films will be able to talk to the directors and ask them questions about their experiences in creating  the  films. Also  this year, 32 student groups— from elementary age  through high school— will  receive awards and prizes  for their own student productions. You don’t have to be in Hollywood to make movies. As a matter of fact, you don’t even have  to wait until you graduate  from high school. I am proud of our students and our community  for holding  this  festival and displaying once again Fort Wayne’s thriving arts community. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ OFNEWJERSEY INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 23, 2002 ",2002
209,,107,-0.396,67,2002-05-24,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the procedure used by the majority to consider and pass the Prescription Drug User Fee Act also known as PDUFA. Yesterday we passed the conference report on bioterrorism almost unanimously. to have a comI voted for it. However, I did so over my unhappiness with the procedure used to consider PDUFA. Through PDUFA,  the drug  industry pays fees to the Food and Drug Administration for timely review of drugs and biological agents. We have heard a  lot about how PDUFA works, but at what cost? What have we sacrificed? What we have sacrificed under PDUFA is honesty,  accuracy,  and  informative  labels. These are the duties and responsibilities that affect every American consumer. Therefore, we must be very careful to make sure that we do not compromise safety or effectiveness that the American public has come to expect. The FDA reached this agreement in closeddoor negotiations with the very industry they are supposed to regulate! I have many concerns with PDUFA, but  I was not able to address them because we in Congress were not allowed to bring these concerns to the floor for a full and open public debate. We weren’t even allowed  mittee markup on it. Well, for the record my concerns are as follows. First of all, the FDA is financially dependent upon an  industry  it  regulates, and because under the new agreement user fees are dramatically increased, dependence will grow dramatically. Instead of using  industry  funds, Congress should appropriate enough money to ensure FDA’s regulatory authority is completely independent, above reproach, and free of undue pressure from the drug industry. Second, it is more than clear that the approval of a drug or device based on relatively short-term information does not always give us complete information about a drug. The number of drugs pulled off the market in the last 4 years is 12. Now,  I agree  that 3 were pre-PDUFA but that leaves 9 drugs that raced through an accelerated PDUFA approval process with  incomplete information. This brings me to my third point. Phase IV studies, also known as post-marketing  surveillance, are nightmarishly  inadequate and neglected to a shameful extent by both the FDA and the drug manufacturers. The 1997 reauthorization of PDUFA— called PDUFA 2— ordered a study  from FDA  that would summarize how well the industry complied over the past 5 years with mandates to do phase IV studies. The results of this study show the vast majority of drug companies do not do their mandated post-marketing surveillance studies. Now I understand PDUFA 3 comes a long way towards addressing major concerns with post-marketing surveillance, but without any enforcement, there will be no post-marketing surveillance, as we saw in PDUFA 2. So I suggest that we put civil monetary penalties pegged to the sales of drugs as one option that we should consider. Another area of concern is the ability of the drug manufacturers to game the system. While awaiting requested and required information from a manufacturer, FDA should be able  to  ‘stop  the clock’  on  the  time constraints PDUFA imposes. Due to extremely tight decision deadlines in PDUFA, manufacturers know they can delay their response to FDA’s requests for information long enough so FDA is forced to make a VerDate 11<MAY>2000 03:06 May 25, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A23MY8.080 pfrm04 PsN: E24PT1 ‘ ’ ",2002
210,,107,0.129,74,2002-05-24,Mr. SHAYS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Supplemental Appropriations Act. Congresswoman ROSADELAUROand I would have offered an amendment to reclassify the hospitals  in Connecticut’s  Fairfield  and New Haven Counties into the New York City Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Unfortunately, we were not able to offer this amendment, but I hope in the future we will be able to address this issue. Fairfield County borders the New York state line and  is only 30 miles  from Manhattan. There are six hospitals in the county, four of which have been periodically reclassified on a temporary basis into the New York MSA. Despite paying wages which are only 10 percent less than the wages paid by hospitals in the New York MSA, Fairfield County’s wage index is 17 percent less than the New York MSA. The Fairfield County hospitals need to be on a level playing field with the New York hospitals  to be able  to attract and  retain highlyskilled clinical staff. Fairfield County  is widely  recognized as being part of the New York Metropolitan Area geographically, economically and socially.  In fact,  the Census Bureau  counts  Fairfield County in the same Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area  (CMSA) as New York City. This determination is based on population figures, commuting patterns, employment data, and the overall economic and social integration of the surrounding areas with the City. In fact,  fully 11 percent of Stamford Hospital’s labor pool resides in New York. In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank, the Department of Labor, and  the Bureau of Transportation Statistics all  include Fairfield County with New York City for statistical purposes. A letter from Rae Rosen of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York states, ‘ ‘A significant portion of Fairfield County commutes to New York City where a significant portion of the county’s income is earned.’ The National Association of Realtors groups Fairfield County housing prices with other New York metropolitan area housing prices because the markets are similar in many ways and provide the housing for the greater New York metropolitan area labor market. Mr. Chairman, by not  reclassifying  these hospitals,  they are being penalized  for efficiency. They have gone  to great  lengths  to control costs, especially personnel costs by revamping their labor skill mix. However, rather than be rewarded for these cost-containment measures, Stamford, Norwalk and Bridgeport are penalized by the Medicare reclassification thresholds. The six hospitals in Fairfield County are the type of hospital that Congress intended to help when it created the geographic reclassification process. Mr. Chairman, I support this legislation and I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it. f 2002 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FURTHER RECOVERY FROM AND RESPONSE TO TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES SPEECHOF HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY OFNEWYORK INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 23, 2002 The House  in Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 4775) making supplemental appropriations for further recovery from and response to terrorist attacks on the United States for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for other purposes. ",2002
211,,107,-0.386,74,2002-05-24,Mrs. MALONEY of New York.," Mr. Chairman, I rise to strike the requisite number of words. Support  from Congress and  the President has been essential in recent months in working to secure New York’s recovery after 9/11. The significant funds committed from Congress and  the President are deeply appreciated by those in New York who were so personally affected by catastrophic terrorism. But simply appropriating aid has proven far different than actually delivering these funds in a timely manner to the people who really need help in New York. Sadly, Mr. Chairman,  the agency charged with the disbursement of these funds FEMA— has on several occasions refused to help or stalled in helping specific people and institutions in New York, from the public school system, to utilities and private universities, to the VerDate 11<MAY>2000 03:06 May 25, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A24MY8.017 pfrm04 PsN: E24PT1 ’ ",2002
212,House,107,0.739,18,2002-06-04,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  support of H.R. 4823. I am glad that we are  moving forward to make permanent the provisions in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief  Reconciliation Act.  The Holocaust was one of the worst atrocities committed by man against man. This simple provision will exclude compensatory payments made  to victims and  their heirs  from  taxation. Given the fact that an entire generation was nearly wiped out and that those who  survived will never fully recover from the emotional horrors of the Holocaust, this is a small  way of compensating the victims. The current  tax provisions are due to, ‘ ‘sunset,’  or expire  on December 31, 2010. This instability makes  it difficult for Holocaust victims and their families to plan their financial futures.  I find it deplorable to think that the Federal  Government would seek to profit from restitution payments that are meant to compensate  Holocaust victims and  their  families. These  people have suffered enough. They must not  be subjected to legislation that would rob them  of over one-third of their rightful compensation.  Mr. Speaker, my brother-in-law and best  friend, Andy Ross, survived the Holocaust. He  was imprisoned in Belsen concentration camp  until being freed by the Allied Forces. I’m not  certain if he’s eligible for compensation under  the agreements worked out  in Europe, and  quite frankly, that doesn’t really matter. What  does matter is that while there is absolutely  nothing we can do to ever erase the horrors  of  the Holocaust  that are  imbedded  in  the  minds and hearts of those, like Andy, who survived  this  tragedy, we can avoid making  it  worse by taxing their compensation.  The thought of us promoting such a scheme  as  taxing  these payments makes me absolutely ill.  Today, we are making a decision that might  very well be  the model  for other nations.  Therefore, I urge you, to be a role model and  vote in favor of H.R. 4823  ",2002

216,House,107,0.323,46,2002-06-04,Mrs. BIGGERT.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today in support of H.R. 3983, the Maritime  Transportation Antiterrorism Act.  I also rise to thank Chairman YOUNG, Coast  Guard  and Maritime  Transportation  Subcommittee Chairman LOBIONDO, and the subcommittee staff for all heir hard work on this  bill.  In June of 2001, they agreed to work with  the U.S. Coast Guard, the State of Illinois, the  City of Chicago, and me on the project to improve safety and security along Chicago’s  lakefront. Needless  to say,  this project became significantly more  important after  the  events of September 11th.  Thanks to the committee’s cooperation and  assistance, this bill authorizes funding for the  construction of a Marine Safety Station on  Chicago’s lakefront.  This new Chicago Safety Station will house  resources and personnel of  the U.S. Coast  Guard, the Chicago Marine Police, and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources Conservation Police. With Coast Guard, state, and  city resources stretched thin by the need for  heighted security  in Chicago and other U.S.  ports, this project will signficantly improve public safety and law enforcement efforts in one  of the busiest recreational areas in the country.  On behalf of the City of Chicago, the State  of Illinois, and all of us who enjoy Chicago’s  lakefront, I again want to thank the Chairman  for working with me to bring this project to fruition. ",2002
217,House,107,-0.292,46,2002-06-04,Mr. BENTSEN.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today in support of H.R. 3983, the Maritime  Transportation Antiterrorism Act of 2002.  I  commend  the work of  the House Transportation Committee on port security, but I also  want to clearly state that much more remains  to be done to secure our coastal areas from  maritime threats. As a representative of a district that includes parts of the Port of Houston,  the nation’s 2nd largest port, I am proud that  this House has set aside jurisdictional squabbles and is taking this important action.  First, H.R. 3983 directs the Department of  Transportation  to  conduct  security assessments at every one of the nation’s 361 seaports. The legislation authorizes $225 million  in grants through 2005 to enhance port security. I would note that the Senate has passed  port security  legislation with a $1.1 billion  grant program, and  I support  increasing  the  House  number  significantly  in  conference  committee.  Central to H.R. 3983 is the provision directing the newly created Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) to develop an identification and screening system for maritime cargo  entering the United States. Currently the official papers accompanying cargo manifests are  rampantly inaccurate, and I believe Congress  needs to remain vigilant after the passage of  this legislation to ensure that the TSA does, in  fact, develop an effective system. Interests do  exist that desire the least amount of accountability for international cargo, and they must  not be allowed to derail TSA’s regulatory action directed by this legislation.  In the end, I do not believe that it makes  much difference whether the development of a  cargo container tracking system is undertaken  by TSA or the Customs Service, but it does  make a difference if those who are more concerned with jurisdiction and turf are allowed to  dominate the process at the expense of those  who are singly committed to long-overdue security improvements at our nation’s extremely  busy international ports. I understand that the  conference committee on port security legislation (H.R. 398/S. 1214) will be  the decisive  forum for this issue, and I urge all future conferees not  to delay Congressional action on  port security action any longer. If House and  Senate committee  jurisdictional disputes are  allowed to delay maritime terrorism preparedness legislation, it will be a low point in Congressional behavior post-September 11th.  In addition to potential TSA and Customs involvement in new port security measures, this  legislation also contains new port security initiatives for the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), an  admirable security  force  that  I have worked  closely with on a number of security issues in  my district pre- and post-September 11th.  I  strongly support the provisions of H.R. 3983  establishing USCG anti-terrorism  teams and  ‘sea marshals,’  both of which will act as preventive and first response forces for maritime  security. Provisions establishing port employee  identification  requirements  for  secure  port  areas  and  improved  passenger  and  crew  manifest notification are also vitally important.  I am pleased that H.R. 3983 authorizes $5.9  billion for the USCG, over $800 million more  than requested by the Administration in March,  as a result of these new tasks and responsibilities  the American people are entrusting  to  their Coast Guard.  Despite the port security progress promised  by H.R. 3983, much work will still remain. The  security assessments at 361 seaports will certainly uncover a myriad of unanticipated, but  glaring needs around the country. The House  bill is providing merely $623,000 in grant authority per port, whereas the Senate bill provides a healthier, but still  likely  inadequate  $3,047,000 in grant authority per port.  As an example of how expensive this undertaking will be, mobile cargo container scanners cost roughly $1 million. Only the larger  18 ports in America currently have these devices and most of these ports only have one.  In addition to a lack of screening equipment is  a  lack of Customs personnel necessary  to  thoroughly examine incoming cargo manifests  for high-risk shipments and man  the equipment to scan the cargo. Our port security gap  is as simple as not enough equipment, men,  and inspections. Improving this security situation will cost a large amount of money, probably even more than the $1.1 billion authorized in the Senate-passed legislation.  I applaud all those that have worked hard  on port security legislation this year, especially  the USCG, Customs,  local  law enforcement,  and Port of Houston Authority personnel on  active security duty in the Houston-Galveston  area. I also encourage TSA, Customs, USCG  to set aside any disputes and work together  for the imperative common good of port security. However, Congress and  the American  people must not forget that much remains to  be done. I implore future Congresses to continue to revisit the issue of maritime security to  see  that Congressional  improvements, once  enacted, are made, and  that any new necessary improvements are vigorously pursued.  I thank the Speaker, and urge my colleagues  to support H.R. 3983.  ",2002

METROPOLITAN  AREA  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. LUGAR,  Mr. SMITHof Oregon, Mrs. BOXER, Mr.  DODD, and Mrs. MURRAY) submitted the  following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:  S. RES. 280  Whereas food insecurity and hunger are a  fact of life for millions of low-income Americans and can produce physical, mental, and  social impairments;  Whereas recent census data show that almost 13,000,000 children in the United States  live in families experiencing hunger or food  insecurity;  Whereas the problem of hunger and food  insecurity can be found in rural, suburban,  and urban America, touching nearly every  American community;  Whereas although substantial progress has  been made in reducing the incidence of hunger and food insecurity in the United States,  certain groups, including the working poor,  the elderly, homeless people, children, migrant workers, and Native Americans remain  vulnerable to hunger and the negative effects  of food deprivation;  Whereas the people of the United States  have a long tradition of providing food assistance to hungry people through acts of  private generosity and public support programs;  Whereas the United States Government,  through Federal  food assistance programs  like the Federal Food Stamp Program, child  nutrition programs, and food donation programs, provides essential nutrition support  to millions of low-income people;  Whereas there is a growing awareness of  the important public and private partnership  role  that  community-based organizations,  institutions of faith, and charities provide in  assisting hungry and food insecure people;  Whereas more than 50,000  local community-based organizations rely on the support  and efforts of more than 1,000,000 volunteers  to provide food assistance and services to  millions of vulnerable people;  Whereas a diverse group of organizations,  including America’s Second Harvest,  the  United States Conference of Mayors, and  other organizations have documented substantial increases in requests for emergency  food assistance over the past year; and  Whereas all Americans can help participate in hunger relief efforts in their communities by donating food and money, by volunteering, and by supporting public policies  aimed at reducing hunger: Now, therefore, be  it  Resolved, That the Senate—  (1) designates June 5, 2002, as  Hunger Awareness Day’’;  (2) requests that the President  issue a  proclamation calling upon the people of the  United States to observe ‘‘National Hunger  Awareness Day’’—  ‘‘National  VerDate Mar 15 2010  20:13 Jan 09, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€2SENATE\S04JN2.REC S04JN2 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2002
224,,107,0.335,151,2002-06-04,Mrs. NORTHUP.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and honor a very brave young man from my district in Kentucky. Mr. Justin Wells  is a hero  in  the  truest sense of  the word. While driving home from the hardware store, Justin and his father came upon a near fatal car accident. Taking the first aid kit from his father’s trunk, Justin rushed to help the injured man, who was bleeding profusely and whose  leg had been pinned down by  the steering wheel of the car. Holding a compression bandage to the man’s wounds while trying to keep the victim calm, Justin used the skills he had gained as both a Medical Trainer at St. Xavier High School and as a First Aid Instructor for Boy Scout Troop 380 to attend to the  injuries. Justin was not deterred by  the danger of the situation, or the possibility of an electric  fire  from  the sparks emanating  from the dashboard. Instead, he courageously tended to the injured man until the rescue squad arrived. It is my great honor to pay tribute to Justin Wells, and to thank him for his courage, resourcefulness, and desire  to help  those  in need. Justin is a very special young man, and I hardily applaud his commitment to his fellow citizens, even in the face of danger. His actions show that one person can make a great difference. Again, I offer my congratulations to Justin for his courage and good will. HONORING ELNER G. OVERDEER HON. GEORGE W. GEKAS OFPENNSYLVANIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 4, 2002 ",2002
225,,107,0.426,151,2002-06-04,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to congratulate Elner G. Overdeer who was honored as the winner of the 2002 Dauphin County Senior EXPO Outstanding Senior Award. She has dedicated her life to the service of others and for this she must be both appreciated and congratulated. Ms. Overdeer clearly demonstrates a spirit of unconditional giving through her many initiatives that have benefited our community. She is a sterling example of kindness and integrity. Throughout the years she has been affiliated with a number of charitable and selfless organizations. These include the Middletown Historical Restoration Commission where she has served on the board since 1980, the Middletown Historical Society, the Regent of Swatara Pine-Ford Chapter of  the Daughters of  the American Revolution,  the Middletown Senior Citizens Center, the Middletown Area Alumni Association,  the Presbyterian Congregational Church where she has served as an ordained ruling elder, and the Middletown Borough Authority where she has been the secretary for the past thirteen years. It is with great honor, Mr. Speaker, that I call on all Members to join me in congratulating and  thanking Elner G. Overdeer. Her years of service to the community have benefited many people  in more ways  than  these mere words can express.

226,House,107,0.655,4,2002-06-11,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker, like many Americans, I learned last week of the President’s intention to create for the first time since the 1970s a Cabinetlevel Department  of  the  executive branch; and  like most Americans,  I support the idea of a Department of Homeland Security, bringing together various and diverse elements of our investigative  branches,  of  our counterterrorism branches and, more importantly, border security, to create a leaner, more efficient means of protecting our citizens than we have under current and, in many ways, antiquated structures in the executive branch. While I support the reorganization of government, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against big government and the growth in government, Mr. Speaker, that has been the natural antecedent  to  emergencies  and  crises throughout American history. The Bible tells us that there is nothing new under the sun; what has been before will be again, in the book of ‘‘Ecclesiastes.’’ And  as  I  see  these events unfold and I see our President beginning to call for the largest potential expansion in the executive branch in my lifetime, I cannot help but feel that what has been before is about to come again if we, who believe in limited government and personal responsibility, do not exercise the franchise of our vote and our conviction in this institution. The  idea  that  the  unrestrained growth of government is a natural antecedent to emergencies was, to be perfectly honest, first posited in a book titled ‘‘Crisis and Leviathan,’’ by a little-known  professor  named  Robert Higgs, 1987, first published. Very simple thesis in this book.

227,House,107,-0.487,11,2002-06-11,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, Antonio Meucci was born in Florence, Italy in 1808. He was fond of chemistry and at the age of 17 conceived an  improved powerful propeller to be used in fireworks, so powerful that his little rockets lost control, caused damage to properties in the vicinity. This was the beginning of a life filled with experiments and discoveries. Meucci spent the first 27 years of his life in Florence, Italy, 15 years in Havana, Cuba, and 39 years in Clifton, New York. While in Havana, Meucci discovered  the  latest discoveries  in electricity,  electrochemistry  and electrotherapy in his laboratory which was next  to his apartment.  In  1865 Meucci wrote, ‘‘At Havana, by means of some little experiments, I came to discover  that  with  an  instrument placed at the ear and with the aid of electricity and a metallic wire, the exact word could be transmitted holding the conductor in the mouth . . . ’’. Meucci  had  discovered  electrical speech transmission. Meucci and his wife, Esther, moved to New York in 1850 where he established a very successful candle business. However, in 1854, his wife aggravated her rheumatoid arthritis to the point where she could seldom leave her bedroom in the third floor of the house. Esther’s  illness stimulated the resuming of Meucci’s speaking telegraph, as it allowed her to communicate with him and others  from her bedroom. Meucci established a  telephone  link from Esther’s room to the basement as well as to a larger laboratory in the yard. To call attention, a mechanical call bell was used, its wires running parallel to those of the telephone. Only one instrument was used at each end, that was alternately brought to the ear or mouth of the user. Meucci received little credit for the invention he later called the teletrofono. This resolution recognizes his work, the importance of his efforts, and I am pleased to not only support it, but I also want to commend the gentleman for bringing it to the attention of all of the Members of this House and to the American people. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2002
228,House,107,0.426,11,2002-06-11,Mr. FOSSELLA.," Mr.  Speaker,  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time. I thank Members on both sides, the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. DAVIS), as well as the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. PASCRELL)  for supporting this resolution. Mr. Speaker, it is my strong belief that Italian Americans have contributed greatly to the United States and continue to contribute proudly as well. We know Columbus discovered America. Two Italians signed the Declaration of  Independence. Enrico Fermi split the atom, and Captain Don Gentile, the fighting ace, was described by General Dwight Eisenhower as a ‘‘oneman force.’’ He, like so many other Italian-Americans, did and were willing to give their life in defense of freedom and liberty and supporting these great United States. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to spend a few minutes  today  to honor an  Italian American and  former Staten  Island resident who is often overlooked, as announced already, and his name was Antonio Meucci. The 19th century was a time of great technological innovation, as its birth heralded the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. However, unlike the century just ended and the new one we are beginning to explore, the roughand-tumble of our young Nation had yet to develop information exchange to the extent we enjoy today.

229,House,107,-0.484,18,2002-06-11,Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania.," I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I urge the passage of this bill which honors one of the  legends of South Philadelphia, William A Cibotti. I am pleased that the post office at 925 Dickinson Street  in Philadelphia,  in South Philadelphia, will be known as the William A. Cibotti Post Office Building. Mr. Cibotti was born in Philadelphia, the son of Italian immigrants. A leader in South Philadelphia’s civic life for many years, Mr. Cibotti was chosen by his neighbors to serve as an elected magistrate from 1952 to 1966. In that year he was elected Philadelphia city councilman for the Second District in the city of Philadelphia, a position his daughter,  Council  President  Anna Cibotti Verna, continues to hold. Councilman Cibotti received a great many  distinctions  during his  illustrious career, including the decoration of Cavaliere of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity,  conferred by  the government of the Italian Republic. Philadelphia lost Councilman Cibotti in 1975, but his legacy lives on as a true servant of the people. As a testimony to that, his daughter, Anna Cibotti Verna, has continued his history of service  as  the  Second  District’s councilperson and as our council president. I know that she is proud of her father and all he has accomplished. But I also know that he is even prouder of her as he looks down on all that she has achieved. Anna Verna is without question one of the  finest, classiest people I know, in or out of government. Hopefully she will continue to serve for many years in that capacity. I would like to thank Chairman BURTONand Ranking Member WAXMANof the Committee on Government Reform as well as Chairman WELDONand Ranking Member DAVISand their staffs for all their hard work on this bill. I again join my colleague in thanking the leadership in the Democratic and the Republican Party for bringing these bills to the floor for passage. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ",2002

I also want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KIRK). I want to thank him for his rather extraordinary work along the North Korean-Chinese border. To my knowledge, he is one of the few non-North Koreans who has managed to travel into North Korea and because of his extensive interviews of starving men and destitute women and orphaned children across North Korea and  in northern China, we know a great deal more about the crisis there.

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  just a  few months ago  in Houston, Texas, Enron  filed  bankruptcy. Hours after the bankruptcy filing occurred, 5,000 fellow Houstonians, many of whom were my constituents, were fired, terminated, with no relief and no benefits. Today, Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  very pleased to announce that a tentative settlement has been agreed to, yet to be approved by the court, to provide the  ex-Enron  employees with  their needed and with their deserved and with their old severance pay. Let me acknowledge the work of the AFL–CIO and Rainbow/PUSH Coalition and Reverend Jesse Jackson, working in a collaborative effort to encourage the employees not to be silent. We made history today, Mr. Speaker. For the  first time  in a bankruptcy court proceeding, unsecured creditors were able to receive funding before any proceedings were to go  forth. These employees, who  basically  have  no standing in a bankruptcy proceeding, now with  the  creditors’  committee, now with the lawyers, now with Enron as it presently stands, have agreed to provide this severance pay. I think this is a historic day. But it gives the Congress the opportunity to change the Bankruptcy Code, and the bankruptcy laws as well, to ensure that employees who are victimized and not at fault will have the opportunity to receive their benefits. I look forward to this Congress acting immediately. I would like to thank the minority  leader,  the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. GEPHARDT), and, of course, the leader of the other body for their help. minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

233,House,107,-0.349,123,2002-06-11,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Speaker, the administration decided last week to privatize our air traffic controllers by executive order. So why are we spending millions on transportation security, federalizing baggage screeners, if we are going to commit ourselves to unsafe air travel? Our Nation’s  air  travel  problems were on the ground with the security screeners, not in the air with the traffic controllers. Why are we penalizing them? These men and women  take pride every day in keeping their fellow citizens safe as they travel America’s skies. On September  11,  the  controllers landed 5,000 planes in less than 2 hours without an operational error. My question is, Where is the problem? Why are we privatizing it? The President’s recent steps toward privatizing air controllers is a step towards disaster, and I state, towards disaster, literally. On September 11, we quickly  realized  that using  private companies to handle airport security was a mistake. We federalized airport security because private contractors could not do the job. Why would we lock the windows, only to open the doors to potential disaster? Privatizing has proven to be a mistake in most prominent nations. I say this is wrong. Let us not privatize our system. Let us allow the controllers to do the job, to keep our airlines safe. f PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION (Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2002
234,House,107,-0.582,123,2002-06-11,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker,  this morning I, along with 30 other Members of the House, filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court to block the President from withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. The President, by withdrawing from this particular treaty, insists that he has the authority to terminate any treaty and can do so without the consent of Congress. But according to article VI, clause 2 of the Constitution, treaties constitute the supreme law of the land and the President does not have the authority to repeal laws. Article  I,  section  1 empowers  the Congress to create laws and charges the President only with carrying out these laws. Thus, the President’s termination of the ABM Treaty represents an unconstitutional repeal of a  law duly enacted by Congress. The world’s geopolitical trash bin is already  littered with  treaties  and agreements unilaterally discarded by the United States under this administration. It is critical that we reassert congressional authority and end this pattern. f f PRIVATIZATION OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS (Mr. BACA asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL PRIVATIZATION (Mr. BROWN of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2002
235,House,107,-0.438,123,2002-06-11,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, the U.S. air traffic control system is the largest and most complex in the world, and it is the safest. President Bush  issued an executive order  last week stripping aircraft traffic control of its inherently governmental designation. This is the first step in his plan to privatize our air traffic control system. Privatization  has  failed  in  other countries. Canada’s air traffic controllers face 6-day work weeks, mandatory overtime and a contract that expired in March. Air traffic controllers on September 11 landed 5,000 planes in the span of 2 hours without an operational error. Yet President Bush wants to privatize the air traffic control system. He wants to privatize Social Security; that will not work. He wants to privatize Medicare; that will not work. Now he wants to privatize our air traffic control system, and that will not work. Air traffic controllers should remain under  the direct  supervision of  the FAA, which  is doing a good  job to maintain the necessary levels of training, of personnel, and of common experience. f REPORT  ON  RESOLUTION  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

236,House,107,-0.25,130,2002-06-11,Mr. SANDLIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight. And the Democrats rise tonight, to stress the importance of maintaining a Federal commitment to support Amtrak. I, along with 150 of our colleagues,  support  providing  Amtrak with the $1.2 billion it needs to maintain its current success on into 2003. A working national passenger rail network is essential for east Texas and America, but the Federal Government must provide resources for capital improvements if Amtrak is to continue to service the Nation at affordable, competitive rates. According to Amtrak, without this funding Amtrak will be forced to eliminate nearly all long-distance passenger trains by October 2002, which would be disastrous  for  rural America. Rural America and east Texas support a national rail service. We do not approve of shutting down rural routes while funding only a northeast corridor commuter route. Under Amtrak’s proposal, service between Boston and Washington will remain, while lines like the Texas Eagle route will be shut down  if Congress fails to provide sufficient resources for fiscal year 2003. Amtrak’s long-distance passenger line provides critical transportation options for rural areas like east Texas, allowing rural residents as great an access to transportation as residents of fully urbanized areas. In many cases, Amtrak’s Texas Eagle is the only means east Texans have to travel  long distances.  If Amtrak  is forced to close its long distance lines, the main links between Texas and cities would be  severed,  crippling  the local economy and retarding rural development in my district and across the Nation. Mr. Speaker, the people of east Texas use and support Amtrak. Ridership of the Texas Eagle line and revenue from the Texas Eagle line has increased by 9 percent since January, 2001, exceeding budget projections. b2000 These  positive  developments  have been achieved through bold steps taken by the people of East Texas to do everything in their power to keep the Texas Eagle  line  running and bold steps from Amtrak to reduce its management to maximize efficiency. In March, Amtrak announced that its CEO and president George Warrington was resigning to move on to another project after raising Amtrak’s revenues to a record $2.1 billion for the 2001 fiscal year. Capitalizing on this vacancy as a new opportunity, Amtrak’s board hired David Gunn to continue improving Amtrak’s record. This new administration lead by Mr. Gunn is making radical changes to increase its ridership and revenues to achieve fiscal responsibility in a common sense way. Mr. Gunn has wide experience with the commuter rail  industry both  in America and in Canada serving as the president of the New York City Transit Agency from 1984 to 1990 and the chief general manager of the Toronto Transit Commission from 1995 to 1999. He carries with him an exceptional international reputation based on his ability to unite labor, business, local communities and governments to successfully  improve  financial stability and plan for the future. With this strong track record, Mr. Gunn brings to Amtrak the ability to overcome its financial  difficulties  through  progressive policies and realistic plans for the future. Just yesterday, Amtrak’s governing board approved changes to consolidate authority  and  remove  unnecessary oversight. These measures include cutting the number of vice president titles from 84 to approximately 20, clearly assigning the authority over cars and locomotives to five people when 16 currently  share  the  responsibility, and consolidating Amtrak’s  three  operating divisions and its mail and express business  into  the  company  headquarters  in Washington.  The  new streamlined  chain of  command will vastly  improve  Amtrak’s  decision making and efficiency. But any attempts to solve Amtrak’s crisis will be for naught without  strong Congressional support to match Amtrak’s bold new policies. Now, Amtrak’s opponents argue that the Federal Government has bailed out Amtrak before to no effect, and that private passenger lines are the only solution. Not so. In 1997, Congress reauthorized Amtrak for 5 years at $5.2 billion. However, only $2.7 billion was actually appropriated, barely 52 percent of the money. This does not constitute a bail out. In fact, this latest figure is only the continuation of a decades old pattern of underfunding Amtrak while at the same time demanding that it become profitable. In essence, under the guise of supporting Amtrak, Congress has instead set it up for failure, providing Amtrak with just enough money to survive another year but not giving it the capital to develop necessary infrastructure projects that could make it self sufficient by 2001. No other publicly  funded transportation system in America, much less a comparable national passenger rail system in the world has succeeded without significant public capital  investment to modernize systems, enhance security and fund long distance service. In fact, no private passenger line could succeed  under  those  same  circumstances. Privatization of long distance passenger service would be tantamount to termination of long distance passenger rail service. It would result in the loss of rail service in many rural communities and would result in the lay off of many, many dedicated Amtrak employees. Only short distance commuter routes would remain. The people of East Texas need and deserve access to a national rail network as much if not more so than communities in  the Northeastern United States. They do not need a multitude of new rail bureaucracies without adequate resources. Importantly, if Amtrak is to be reduced to servicing the Northeast corridor alone, as a  regional  transportation network, it should operate without Federal support. With proper funding Amtrak can succeed. H.R. 4545 will provide that funding. With $1.9 billion Amtrak can make necessary changes. America and East Texas deserve a strong passenger rail system and I will continue to fight for Amtrak. f The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. JEFFMILLERof Florida).

237,House,107,0.285,144,2002-06-11,Mr. FLETCHER.," Mr. Speaker, again I thank the gentleman for joining us tonight, and as he  said,  two critical things, immediate help, help now. If we, as we did a couple of years ago, pass a bill out of the House here, we sent that over to the Senate. The Senate did not act on it. Let us hope it is different this year as we look over the next few weeks of passing a bill out here and sending it over to the other body, but I do thank him for joining us tonight and  thank him  for all  the work, for all the citizens, not only in the State of Connecticut, but all over the country. Let me just say a few things and close out this evening and remark on this. We said no senior should have to choose between food and medicine, and yet that is happening in this country, and  yet  we  are  undoubtedly  the wealthiest Nation in the world’s history. We have developed a tremendous amount of health care technology, including wonderful new medications, prescription drugs that help prevent disease. We now have medications that prevent hardening of the arteries, that reduce the rates of heart attacks and strokes. We have medications that certainly allow  senior  citizens  to  live more comfortably. We have medications that treat and sometimes even cure cancer. That would have been just unimaginable a few years and decades ago, but oftentimes our seniors are having to choose between the food that gives them that comfort, that quality of life and even assures them of prolonged life, and the medicine, having to choose between food and medicine. So we want to stop that. We have a good plan, and let me just review a little thing on that. First off, it fully subsidizes premium and cost-sharing up to 150 percent of the poverty level. That means those ladies that are on low income and those senior gentlemen that are on low income do not have to worry about that problem, as we have shown, choosing between food and medicine. It also provides a subsidy that  is phased out between 150 and 175 percent. This is a coverage in Medicare, and it is important to understand that. It is also important to understand that people have a choice. There are several plans to choose from, so that they can get the medication that they need. It is not just a single formulary that may restrict someone or make it very, very difficult for them to get the particular medicine that they can tolerate and that treats their particular condition the best. It brings immediate relief of up to 30 percent cost reduction.  It helps not only that, but there are a few other things I want to review as we close out. It protects  improvements  in Medicare to help reduce adverse drug interactions, provides  for electronic prescribing  to minimize medical errors which the complexity of medicine now certainly is needed to incorporate all the technology that we have to ensure that we reduce the medical errors to as little as few as possible. It allows pharmacy therapy management for chronic conditions, and I think disease management  is part of this prescription drug plan that is very critical as we look to not only just treat the acute problems of our seniors but make sure we manage  their  condition  to give them the best quality of life, again to help them with their retirement security, to secure their health for as long as possible. So as I close we have a plan that we will be rolling out soon to provide immediate relief that is available for all seniors that will ensure no one has to choose between food and medicine, that will also provide choice and freedom. It will also make sure that those people that have drug costs that become quite expensive, that they are not going to go bankrupt because of runaway drug costs. b2215 Mr. Speaker, it is an excellent plan. I certainly hope that we can get bipartisan support for this plan as we bring it to the House floor. As I mentioned a year and a half ago, we passed a good prescription drug bill out of this House. I think we have made marked  improvements on  the plan. I want to share, Mr. Speaker, this plan is not only a plan that we have worked on this year, it is the culmination of several years of work. What we found is that I think we can get a greater participation in the way this is structured; and again, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that 95 percent of the seniors will sign up for this, this voluntary program, because the benefits are so structured and so good and so attractive that they felt like seniors would sign up for this, and because it is available for all seniors. Again, it provides them with the ability to keep the plan that they have. If they have a retirement plan, and it provides prescription drug  coverage, this does not impede their ability to keep that plan. It also, again through better negotiating power, gives them an immediate 30 percent estimated in their cost. We have a great disparity in this country in the fact that most people who are working can walk into a pharmacy and they can get prescription drugs at a markedly reduced cost because they have an insurance plan that negotiates the cost of those drugs and gets a reduced cost, but our seniors do not have that. They pay a substantially higher price when they walk in to buy their prescription drugs. Why, unless they have  some  sort of plan other  than Medicare, they do not get the benefit, the negotiating power, to reduce the cost. This plan brings that power to every senior that takes advantage of this plan. I  just wanted  to  share  those  few things, and let seniors know that not only providing this plan for the reasons we have mentioned because of the necessity of improving certainly retirement security and the security of our seniors’ health, but it is a matter of equity. Medicare provides for acute care, and will provide, for example, bypass surgery  for someone who needs surgery, but it will not provide the prescription  drugs  for hypertension  or lowering  cholesterol  that  are  necessary. f EDUCATION TAX CREDITS The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. KELLER).

238,House,107,0.749,151,2002-06-11,Mr. SHADEGG.,"  I  think  the  gentleman said it well. The key is, this is not a replacement for the current system. People in the current system and believers in it should not feel threatened by it. What it is, is a chance to add resources to the current system. It is a chance to make it even stronger. It is a chance to put more dollars behind education. It is a chance to get people more involved in the education of their children. It is a chance to get around the bureaucracy and have the accountability run directly to people in their own neighborhoods. It is indeed for that reason I think a win-win that should not threaten the education establishment and should encourage them. So  I compliment the gentleman  and my  colleague  from Michigan for their very hard work on this project. ",2002

240,Senate,107,0.446,200,2002-06-11,Mr. THOMAS.," Mr. President, I rise  today to say good-bye to a good friend  who has worked with me for over 10  years.  Dan Kunsman has been my Communications Director for the last eight  years, adding to some 3 years of assisting me on the House side when I was  the lone congressman from Wyoming.  Also a native son of Wyoming, his work  for me and the great State extends  deeply into the heart and soul of the  West and will continue long into the  future.  Dan  joined my office  in  the U.S.  House of Representatives in 1991 right  out of school. Dan did a great job for  me and was promoted to Communications Director when I was elected to  the U.S. Senate in 1994.  Dan has not only been valuable in  Washington, he was also a crucial part  of  three,  statewide, victorious campaigns. He also took time from our efforts on sabbatical to assist with the  success of my good  friend and colleague, Senator ENZI, on his  initial  election effort in 1996.  We’re part of a team, my staff and I.  Along with my wife, Susan, we  feel  strongly bound to service for the people of Wyoming. As we say in the West,  Dan’s a good hand. That’s a high compliment. It means that he’s part of the  team, reliable in a storm or any circumstance. In the House, Senate and  on the campaign trail, Dan has proved  to be one of the brightest and most effective public policy communicators  and political strategists in Wyoming  and Washington.  Dan has decided  to  join Brimmer  Communications and will lead a new  Washington, DC office for the public relations  firm based  in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming. While it’s always hard to see  good people move on, in this case, I’m  glad Dan plans to go to a strong firm  at home and stay close to Wyoming  people.  I’m not always the best at saying  good-bye. I don’t like to say it. So I’ll  just say see you, and I hope that’s true.  I’ll look forward to it.  To our friend, Dan, I wish him and  his wife, Isabel, the best of luck, and I  know the Senate does as well.∑  f  COMMEMORATION OF KING  KAMEHAMEHA I  ∑",2002
241,Senate,107,-0.419,200,2002-06-11,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President,  I rise  today in commemoration of the birthday of Hawaii’s  first monarch, King  Kamehameha I. More than two centuries since his birth, Kamehameha is  a legendary, indeed, mythical figure renown worldwide  for his bravery and  martial brilliance. He commands the  respect of Hawaii’s people for his wise  and  just  leadership, and his accomplishments continue to influence and  govern Hawaii today.  Historically, Kamehameha is notable  because of his brilliance as a military  strategist and political leader. Kamehameha adapted Western  innovation,  weaponry, and science to gain a decisive advantage in his drive to unify the  Hawaiian Islands. For Native Hawaiians and the people of Hawaii, Kamehameha is beloved for his concern and attention to the well-being of his subjects and for his commitment to do  what was just and right for the people.  Kamehameha’s wisdom, even more  than his strength, stature, and daring,  is his greatest and most enduring legacy for Hawaii’s indigenous peoples—  the Native Hawaiians, the people of Hawaii,  and  all  students  of  history.  Mamalohoe, the Law of the Splintered  Paddle, is the most prominent example  of Kamehameha as a wise and  just  leader. Mamalahoe  is Hawaii’s  first  Bill of Rights protecting the common  people from assault, and it is still part  of our State’s constitution.  One hundred and ninety years ago, in  the summer of 1812, Kamehameha returned to the Kona Coast. Having unified the islands and established peace  and stability, Kamehameha worked to  build prosperity for his people by increasing agricultural production and  foreign trade.  The first observance of a day honoring King Kamehameha was  proclaimed by King Kamehameha V on  June 11, 1872, in the Kingdom of Hawaii. It remains an annual holiday in  the State of Hawaii. This year marks  the 130th anniversary of the only holiday in the United States created to  honor a once-reigning monarch in the  only state that was once a kingdom,  the State of Hawaii.∑  f  MISSION OF PEACE HOUSING  COUNSELING AGENCY  ∑",2002

No American  men’s national team has ever reached  this point nor achieved such success.  Last night, our guys convincingly defeated their arch rival and fellow North  Americans, Mexico, 2–0. Mexico also  had a remarkable run through group  play,  emerging  undefeated,  that  is  until last night.  Coach Arena, once again, put a team  on the field that played with conviction  and with  class. While Mexico  dominated possession, our team was  opportunistic scoring on all  its best  chances. Goalkeeper Brad Friedel was  once again outstanding, as was overall  team defense.  Next up, Friday morning, 7:30 a.m.  Eastern Standard Time, mighty Germany, a team that is, again, one of the  favorites. France, Argentina, Portugal,  and now Mexico have gone home and  our team is still playing. Can Germany  be next? Join a billion other people for  breakfast in Korea.

275,,107,-0.288,65,2002-06-17,Mr. ETHERIDGE.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to one of North Carolina’s favorite sons, Colonel Wiley Edwin ‘ ‘Bud’  Andrews, upon his retirement  from  the North Carolina National Guard. Theodore  Roosevelt,  our  President and a member of  Guard, once said: nation’s  25th the National It is not the critic who counts . . . The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust; sweat and blood; who strives valiantly . . . who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause; who . . . knows in the end the triumph of higher achievement. For thirty-two years and five months Colonel Andrews has actually been in that arena, Mr. Speaker, as he has served in our nation’s military. As a member of  the National Guard, Colonel Andrews has participated in a number of important emergency response efforts and has  helped  spread  and  foster  democracy through his work in the former Soviet Republic of Moldova. Since he joined the National Guard at the age of 20, Colonel Andrews has become a decorated and experienced guard member. He began his military career as a Medical Platoon Leader and quickly rose through the ranks to be a Finance Maintenance Battalion Commander and  finally serving as Deputy Commander of the United States Property and Fiscal Office.  Indeed, Colonel Andrews  has served his state and nation with distinction and devotion  through  two deployments  to South Korea and by negotiating  the Memorandum of Understanding with Moldova. In addition  to his many awards and accomplishments, he is also a graduate of the prestigious U.S. Army War College. Now, at the close of his military career, Colonel Andrews is truly an example of  the  triumph of higher achievement.’ In his retirement, Colonel Andrews will not step out of the arena of which President Roosevelt so eloquently spoke. Bud  is, and will continue  to be, an  integral part of Johnston County and the town of Smithfield where he lives. After rising to the rank of Eagle Scout and his graduation from Campbell University, Bud became President of the Capital City Jaycees in Raleigh. In Johnston County, Bud became a State Vice President for Community Affairs of the North Carolina Jaycees and a Jaycee International Senator. Bud has further served his community as President of  the Johnston  County  Young  Democrats,  the Downtown Smithfield Development corporation, and the Greater Smithfield-Selma Chamber of Commerce. Bud has also had a successful career as a Vice President and Commercial Banker for the First Bank and Trust Company. Currently, he is serving as Chairman of the Johnston County Tourism Authority. Clearly, Bud’s ‘ ‘great enthusiasm’  for community service has yielded great  results  for Johnston County and the town of Smithfield. Mr. Speaker, the National Guard is one of the most respected and reliable military forces in the world, and Colonel Bud Andrews has been a vital part of the North Carolina Guard’s success. On behalf of a grateful state, and nation, I thank him for his selfless service to his country, and wish him all the best in his future endeavors. May God’s strength, peace, and joy be with him always. f COMMEMORATING AND ACKNOWLEDGING DEDICATION AND SACRIFICE  MADE  BY  MEN  AND WOMEN KILLED  OR DISABLED WHILE SERVING AS PEACE OFFICERS SPEECHOF HON.

I would like to commend the Oak Ridge High School Student Council  in Oak Ridge, Tennessee for their plan to do just that. Since September 17th,  they have been working tirelessly to earn support for their plan to purchase all of  the scrap steel  from  the World Trade Center rubble and fashion it into memorial displays for every cooperating high school  in America. Their proposal also suggests  that a plaque would be affixed  to  the steel describing the events in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania as a visible reminder of that dreadful moment in our history. Students at ORHS, along with  their Student Council Advisor Kenneth Senter, have received the endorsement of their school leaders, their city leaders, and their state legislature. Over one hundred students have helped raise money, write letters, and propose memorial designs. Their next step  is  to build  the sanction of their local government by starting a charitable fund that will pursue national contributions and cooperation.

I join my colleague, the  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr. HASTINGS), in this great honor. Dr. Paul is a third generation Floridian. He was born in Miami, Florida, in 1946; and he is a graduate of Miami Senior High School and the University of Florida. Go Gators. He is a true spiritual leader rooted in Florida. An accomplished  trombone player, Reverend Paul played with the Savannah Symphony Orchestra for a number of years before attending the Asbury Theological  Seminary  in Wilmore, Kentucky, where he earned his master of divinity degree and doctor of divinity. After 10 years in Kentucky, Dr. Paul again regained his senses and returned to Florida where he has served churches in Eustic, Groveland, Clewiston and Lake City. I know the community in Clewiston was very sad to see Reverend Paul head to Lake City, but one community’s loss is another’s gain; and I am sure he will have the same  impact  in Lake City that he had for us in Clewiston. f STEP AHEAD FARMWORKER RECOGNIZING THE  TO  SUCCESS  YOUTH PROGRAM (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

281,House,107,0.4,8,2002-06-26,Mr. ROGERS of Michigan.," Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding me the time, and I want to commend him on his work and his leadership on this issue, and I have to tell him, as an agent who worked in the field, next to the PATRIOT Act and I think at equal stature is this bill. I think the bill is that important to the future security of the United States of America. I want to again applaud him from every agent in the field who is struggling to make a difference today. This bill will make a difference for the safety and security of this Nation. I want to tell this story. We often forget, and sometimes in this town we are so quick to find a villain we forget about finding the solution. Over time what we have done to the agents in the field was, and we would hear the arguments, well, they are not cooperating because one agency thinks they are better than the other. Simply not so. When we were agents, there are barriers that were put in place that prohibited us from communicating information to local law enforcement officials. I had a case as a new agent where I was able to work a State police officer undercover into a group of self-proclaimed anarchists who were going to do some damage by building bombs and delivering these bombs to kill Federal judges in institutions owned and operated by the Central Intelligence Agency. Here is the dichotomy we got into. Because of the information we were developing in this case, we were not allowed by law, by rule, to share some of the information that we were developing with the very agent who was risking his life from the State police to go undercover to help us solve it. We had meetings with general counsel and a room full of lawyers trying to figure out if this was the right thing and what information could we or should we, and we always erred on the side of caution, saying we better not share that information. This bill helps eliminate those very ridiculous rules that for years put fear in the agents who are trying to do the right thing. That is why this bill is so important.  It will  empower  agents there through their own good judgment and common sense to deliver the information that they need and they know they need to deliver to our local law enforcement, our local sheriff offices, our  local State  police  institutions, other Federal agencies. This bill will make  that difference and will  take down the fear that these agents have of losing their  jobs or worse,  in some cases  losing  everything  they  have through civil liability. This  bill  is  that  important, Mr. Chairman, and I, again, I cannot tell my colleague, from the agents that I have talked to, how important this bill is and what freeing ability this is going to have to them to in a responsible way communicate the kinds of information that is going to make it safer for firefighters and EMT folks out there, for emergency  room workers who  are going to deal with some of these tragedies, for every level of law enforcement in this country. This is that last bastion, that last hurdle that is going to stop us from doing good things. Had this bill been in place, we could have shared a lot of information with the State police and maybe even broadened our net a little bit and protected him to a degree that we really were not allowed under the law to do when I was an FBI agent. Again, I would hope that this body would have quick action on this bill and stand up and salute the work of all, from  the minority  to  the majority party, who worked so hard on this bill to make a difference for this country and the agents that are doing the work. b1115 ",2002

This is important for our rural and urban communities that want to partake in preventing terrorism in the future, and so I rise in strong support of this legislation and want to thank the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, the gentleman from Wisconsin and  the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS), and particularly the gentleman from New York (Mr. WEINER), for their support in helping improve the legislation as well. My reading of this legislation, Mr. Chairman, reveals that it is quite simple and quite productive  in what  it does. It says to the President of the United States that he must help us devise a  system  to  share  information from the Federal, national, level with our local communities. We have seen some of the problems in communication between the FBI and the CIA, between national and  local field offices, and this will help change the culture and deal with the hurdles and some of the barriers that have been put up in the past to make this system work better in the future. We also see that the President has two steps that he can take in devising this system: one is to declassify information, to declassify this information and, therefore, make it more shareable, if that is a word, a better sharing system with the  local community; secondly, is to provide clearances for the local community so that they can get this information, glean from it, get it out, and hopefully prevent the next terrorist act from happening. I think this is very important, very intelligent; and I think the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CHAMBLISS) and the gentlewoman  from  California  (Ms. HARMAN) have really come up with a good system to provide a way to fill in some of the gaps and the seams and the holes that exist in the current system. I do want to say that I think this legislation also answers two  important questions for the future. One is we have a lot of information out there. How do we make this information knowledge? How do we provide this information so it is actionable for our local communities rather than simply a color code of red or yellow? How does this information get translated into actionable information that helps the local community move forward to prevent terrorist activity? The second question is how do we devise this system for the homeland security department to actually implement this in the future? The more information we get out there on these merging questions,  the  integration questions, the  intelligence and analytical questions for the homeland security department, the more we have to move intelligently and wisely to get  it right, rather than simply moving to get it done by September 11. This is a very, very big question for us in the future, and I hope that this VerDate 11-MAY-2000 03:37 Jun 27, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K26JN7.019 pfrm12 PsN: H26PT1 ",2002
283,House,107,0.349,22,2002-06-26,Mr. REYNOLDS.," Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 450 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: H. RES. 450 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution the bill (H.R. 3009) to extend the Andean Trade Preference Act, to grant additional trade benefits under that Act, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, be, and the same is hereby, taken from the Speaker’s table to the end that the Senate amendment thereto be, and the same is hereby, agreed to with the amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying  this  resolution. The House shall be considered to have insisted on its amendment to the Senate amendment and requested  a  conference with  the Senate thereon. The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. LAHOOD).

284,House,107,-0.402,29,2002-06-26,Mr. DOGGETT.," Mr. Speaker, a vote for this rule damages our environment. I am all for trade, but trading clean water for sour, pure air for fouled, open justice for star chamber proceedings, that is not a good trade. Free trade is not ‘‘free’’ when it comes at the expense of such imperatives. My concern about the failed Chapter 11 NAFTA model that this proposal endorses is similar to my concern about the mismanaging of  this  fast  track trade debate. Both result from a secret, closed-door process, both ignore the Sierra Club, Consumers Union and others concerned with our sovereignty, our environment, and our health and safety; and both relegate important decisions to a self-selected few, although the burden will be borne by many. They violate the whole spirit of our Texas open-government laws. We could use a little Texas sunshine in on our trade policy. The only  thing  transparent about this fast track process is the heavyhanded, insular way that it has been handled by the Chairman since day one. A ‘‘no’’ vote is a vote for openness, a vote for the democratic process, and for our environment. ",2002
285,House,107,-0.402,29,2002-06-26,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate  the gentleman yielding me this time. In response to the previous gentleman’s remark, I would suggest that the bottom line is jobs. This rule is about jobs; and as far as I am concerned, it represents bad policy for America, it represents bad policy for people in this country who still make a living wage, and it is very bad and horrific policy for all of the people who are going to lose their jobs because of the attempt to give any administration this type of trade authority. One of the fatal flaws is not allowing us  consideration  of  provisions  that might undermine and weaken our trade remedy  laws that are on the books today. That includes industries in the United States that used to make and may still make some pencils, may grow garlic, may make  cement  clinkers, may produce petroleum wax candles. There are 265 industries and growers who have sought relief for these important protections. This is about jobs. It is about the 210 people who have no work at Calumet Steel in Chicago Heights, Illinois, because of illegal trade that takes place. ",2002
286,House,107,-0.353,29,2002-06-26,Mr. LYNCH.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today in opposition to this rule, which would try to silence the voices on both sides of the aisle who oppose this fast track legislation. Mr. Speaker, this rule, as well as the whole fast track procedure, takes Congress out of the equation, takes Congress out of the debate and, by doing so, also takes the American people out of the debate. Fast track is nothing more than a silent auction, a silent auction of American jobs, so I am not surprised that the Republican leadership wants this rule. This is not something that they would do in the light of day and with open and honest debate. There was an interesting story in the Washington Post last week where the companies that actually went down to Mexico and  ran out on  the United States are now leaving Mexico and the maquilladoras for Asian countries because the Mexican workers have had the audacity to ask for $5 an hour in wages. This is a race to the bottom. This should not happen. We should be protecting American jobs. ",2002
287,House,107,0.855,99,2002-06-26,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Speaker, as I stand here today, my home State of Arizona is burning. We have lost now nearly 400,000 acres to fire. That is more than 500 square miles. Colorado is burning as well. We  have  lost  a  tremendous amount of forest just this year, and we have got to do something about it. We should not be surprised at the losses so far to fire. Our forests have been choked with underbrush and excess trees for years now; and whenever we try to go in and thin and manage our forests, we are blocked by radical environmentalists who  file  lawsuits, who create such uncertainty with the Forest Service that nobody can go in and thin our forests like they should. One of the groups that is blocking us from going into forests and thinning is a group called Forest Guardians, one of these  radical  environmental  groups. They were interviewed in the East Valley Tribune in Arizona yesterday, and in the paper it says, Forest Guardians oppose using any forest thinning that might benefit commercial logging companies. If one uses the words thinning and/or they use the word forest and commercial in the same sentence, it seems they sue before one can finish the sentence. They simply oppose anything that benefits commercial companies, which means that to go in and thin the forest it is all on the public treasury. It  is estimated that  it would cost them $35 billion to go in and thin our forest properly,  to prepare  them  to make sure that we do not have the devastating crown fires that are killing trees and everything, wildlife, whatever stands in their way, but we can cannot do it with the public treasury. We have to allow people to go in, but of course they oppose that. Going on, it says, and hear what the Forest Guardians are suggesting: Instead, small numbers of small trees should  be  removed  by  crews using solar-powered chain saws to ensure the work does not affect air quality in the forest. Solar-powered  chain  saws.  I know my way around a hardware store pretty well, although  I have never stumbled into the solar-powered chain saw aisle. It is simply laughable, if it were not so horrifying, that we are being held up by such groups that have such outlandish ideas. I do not know what is next, trained beavers? Are we supposed to round up the animals of the forest, Mr. Deer and Mr. Bear, and convince them to get a forest council together to help us replant? We need to remind the radical environmentalists that Ferngully was a cartoon. We have serious problems here in our forests. They demand serious solutions, serious debate, serious answers, and we are getting solar-powered chain saws? We have got to rethink what we are doing. Our State  is burning. Colorado  is burning. There are some 3 million acres of Ponderosa pine forest in Arizona. We stand a chance of losing most of that over the next year or two. It is a tinderbox unless we get in, and we cannot afford to wait another 4 or 5 years until we wade through all the lawsuits to allow private interests in to thin forests. We have got to move ahead, and I plead  with  those  serious  environmentalists who want to protect habitat for endangered species, who want to have beautiful forest land, to join with us and create a balance as we are getting serious about the issue, instead of throwing up  roadblocks and  talking about solar-powered chain saws and the like. f ",2002
288,House,107,-0.464,106,2002-06-26,Ms. CARSON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to join my colleagues in urging quick support for Amtrak to avert its collapse. The United States is not unlike any industrialized Nation in the world that has a need for quality rail passenger service, and America is not unlike any other industrialized Nation that is required to undergird financially its passenger rail service. The President and  lawmakers, the United States Congress, must come together quickly to prevent the economic and human hardship that would result from an Amtrak shutdown. That hardship would  be  suffered  by Amtrak workers and their families. It would be most harsh, and the damage to our economy would be a calamity. We have heard over and over and over, Mr. Speaker, in these Chambers during this Congress how imperative it is to provide an economic stimulus for corporate America to ensure the continuation of jobs and to provide employment  for  unemployed  workers across this country. Yet we are here tonight begging and pleading with the powers  that be  to  support Amtrak, which indeed needs economic stimulus for the benefit of the continuation of employment of America’s citizens, the citizens who have worked  long and hard over the years to do a good job and have done a good job, and they have taken care of their families and they have been taxpayers across this country. Recently, Amtrak CEO David Gunn said if Amtrak did not receive a $200 million loan immediately that it would have  to begin  shutting down operations. Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we build a world-class passenger rail system in the United States. We cannot wait for highways and airports to become so overwhelmed that they too can no longer operate, and we cannot continue to hold the millions of Americans who rely on passenger service in limbo while we refuse to provide Amtrak with adequate funding. We must also engage in long-term planning to address  future  passenger  transportation growth and  show  some  forethought in crafting transportation solutions, not wait  for this  impending crisis to turn into an outright disaster. Following  the  terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the aftermath which followed, we found that we were vulnerable in our society and in our economy  when  our  transportation choices were limited and our mobility severely diminished. After the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights following the terrorist attacks, travelers turned to Amtrak. The ridership of Amtrak has skyrocketed. Revenues have risen up to 20 percent, and the ridership has increased over 8.2 percent. This shows that Amtrak does work and that it will continue to work if the United States Congress and the President  is  about  the  business  of quickly responding to the needs of Amtrak, not unlike the way that it did for our airline industry when we provided a $5 billion grant to that industry and $10 billion additional resources in the event that our airline services decided that additional resources were needed to be guaranteed by this country. Mr.  Speaker,  I would  encourage Members of Congress and the administration as well to act quickly, not politically, but quickly, for the benefit of the families who rely on us as Members of Congress and who rely on the support that we have already shown that we provide for other entities in our Nation so that we can go forward. We cannot afford the luxury of being a superpower in our mind and not allowing America to, in reality, be one by having a first-class passenger rail system. It is up to us, Mr. Speaker, to sustain Amtrak. f b1915 HISTORICAL OVERVIEW The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. KERNS). Under a previous order of the House,  the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) is recognized for 5 minutes. ",2002
289,House,107,-0.304,113,2002-06-26,Mrs. THURMAN.,"  Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I want to get back to that issue, because I want to talk about an amendment that we offered to try to bring the cost down. But at this time I would like to take the opportunity to invite the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE), a valued Member of this body, who has been actively involved in this issue and who I think has some information that we might have skipped over. So I would like to invite her into this discussion. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman  from Florida  (Mrs. THURMAN), and might  I acknowledge my other  colleagues,  the  gentlewoman from California and, of course, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. BROWN) for their leadership, and particularly the areas of expertise that they all generate. I thought it would be helpful, as I was  listening  to my  colleagues,  to come to the floor and share some of the messages and the concerns that I bring back from Texas, but also the history of the Medicare legislation that many of my colleagues are familiar with. I would like to, as I show them some very  important  facts  in pictures tonight, I would like to hold up a picture of President Johnson signing this legislation in 1965. If we were to track the aging of America, we would determine that post-1965 our senior citizens have lived longer because of the implementation of Medicare. And what we talk about tonight is the component that will add to the life of seniors today who are losing ground because so many of them now do not have a prescription drug benefit. That is what we are talking about with the Democratic plan, a benefit. That  is quite  the contrary from a voluntary optional program which an individual can choose to participate in. Now, many of my friends have said, and as many of my colleagues know, particularly  the  gentlewoman  from Florida (Mrs. THURMAN), we have been on this issue now for at least, I guess in our life, two or three terms, but 6 years or more, and some even longer; and for many times during that time frame, we budgeted  very  responsibly, meaning Democrats, in preparing ourselves for the expenditure. In fact, I want to cite for the record that last year, March 2001, we had about $5.6 trillion in our surplus. We were prepared for what this might cost. I listened to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. BROWN) discussing her grandmother, and I took a tour of my senior citizen centers and asked couples and singles how many of them are cutting their prescription drugs, and hands went up; and how many of them are not taking the drugs or not taking them in the right amount, and hands went up. There, right in front of my eyes, was  the undermining of  their health. In addition, about 2 years or so ago, I was running around my district in a panic because my seniors were  in a panic. We were trying to answer concerns, because what had happened in Texas was that HMOs had shut their doors,  literally shut their doors. We had seniors in Harris County who had become  reliably  comfortable  with HMOs, between 3 and 4 million people. Many of us, elected persons and others, begged HMOs either to come back or to stay. I remember us getting into negotiations where we asked if they could stay an extra 90 days. My senior citizens know what I am talking about. Their HMOs shut down on them. My fear with the Republican plan, this plan that is a card or some kind of membership, is that when we get to a point and we find that it is not profitable, and when I say ‘‘we’’ I mean those who are engaged  in this plan, when they find it is not profitable, am I to expect that those pharmaceuticals will shut their plan down? So I wanted to show another picture to say why this can be done and why it is imperative that we do this. Because imagine becoming dependent on this voluntary card, imagine seniors having accepted  it,  having  become  comfortable with  it, that  is,  if  it even works, and they get a few dollars off from  it, and they hold this card  in their hand and, all of a sudden there is some analyst  locked up  in a  room somewhere in corporate headquarters that says, you know what, they are not making any money  in Jacksonville, they are not making any money near Orlando or Houston, Texas, so shut it down. Then I have got thousands of seniors without the ability to secure their medicine. I want the American public to understand that this is a well thought-out process; and we believe, many of us, that when we look responsibly at the tax cut, and I know there are many shades to the tax cut, but if we look responsibly, and we are talking about that major one that really just focused in on 1 percent of the population, there were other side-bar tax cuts, but it is that big one, and we believe when we look at that seriously we can find 64 percent of the people that would not be opposed to rolling back the tax cut that Congress passed  last year and using that money to provide a prescription drug benefit under Medicare for seniors. So this dialogue tonight, and I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for it, this dialogue tonight is not reckless, it is not an attempt to use what we do not have. It is, frankly, a recognition of really the concern we all have. And I want to be responsible, but sometimes I visit my seniors and there is panic. And I use that word only because I have seen it, the panic they might face by going one more month, one more day without a real drug benefit. b2015 Mr. Speaker, I simply say in closing that  I know the other body  is discussing this issue. We have to recognize the other body. Why pass legislation in the House that has absolutely limited chance in a compromise effort in the other body? We are trying to get legislation that is realistic and will answer the concerns of all seniors. I am disappointed that we cannot come to a conclusion on something that deals realistically with a guaranteed benefit, and I might say protection of our rural hospitals and urban hospitals, taking care of some of the formula problems that we have, there seems to be no reason why we cannot do this. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. THURMAN) for her leadership. I smile because lawyers have more than one closing, but this is a closing. Women, I have been hearing this all day  long, have a greater use and/or need for Medicare drug benefit, not diminishing the men, but we are finding out that many older women are living longer, and we are going to help with research to help men, living as widows without income, they are really suffering. I think we can do better. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 03:04 Jun 27, 2002 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00113 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K26JN7.154 pfrm12 PsN: H26PT1 ",2002
290,Senate,107,0.508,141,2002-06-26,Mr. ENSIGN.," Madam President, we  will save rebutting the comments of  our colleague from Nevada for another  time. We do want to talk about the  Yucca Mountain project this morning,  but I want to talk about the procedure  in the Senate on which people have  been focusing.  In the modern history of the Senate,  nobody other than the majority leader  or his designee has successfully offered  a motion to proceed. That being said,  supporters of Yucca Mountain claim  that breaking tradition would be alright because the process outlined in  the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is supposedly unique.  The procedure in the Nuclear Waste  Policy Act is not unique, nor is it required—it is merely permitted. There  are many  statutes containing expedited procedures. When the Congress  has determined that it is appropriate  to override the traditional power of the  majority leader to schedule the floor,  it has drafted legislation like the War  Powers Act which does so.  The War Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1544 et  seq.) states:  Any joint resolution or bill so reported  (from Committee) shall become the pending  business of the House in question (in the case  of the Senate the time for debate shall be  equally divided between the proponents and  the opponents), and shall be voted on within  three calendar days thereafter, unless such  House shall otherwise determine by yeas and  nays.  Unlike this War Powers provision,  there is no requirement in the Nuclear  Waste Policy Act that Congress take  any action with regard to the Nuclear  Waste Policy Act resolution. Congress  in the past has used a variety of techniques to expedite privileged business,  and in the case of the Nuclear Waste  Policy Act did not choose to use some  of the more time-sensitive techniques.  Indeed, the 1982 act anticipates that a  vote on the Yucca Mountain resolution  might not occur—that  it might be  blocked. If the deadline passes, then  the statute giving the State of Nevada  a veto will have been carried out. That  was part of the 1982 compromise.  It is true that an expedited procedure  was put into law, pursuant to the rulemaking power of the Congress, as Congress has put in law many expedited  procedures. But no one other than the  majority  leader or his designee has  ever moved successfully to go to any  resolution, or bill, which has expedited  procedures written into law. Any successful attempt to do that now would  change forever the way that the Senate  sets its agenda.  The junior Senator from Alaska stated that he does ‘‘not know that it really matters very much’’ who makes the  motion to proceed to the Yucca Mountain resolution.  I say that it does matter. It matters  very much. It is the Senate rules that  allow any Senator to move to proceed  to a matter, or to force a vote on the  motion to proceed, but it is now a well-  established practice that the Senate  will only proceed to a matter the majority leader wishes to call up, and that  the Senate has not proceeded to any  matter that the majority leader has declined to call up for decades past. It is  the proposed change in this practice  that is a direct challenge to the role of  any majority leader.  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act does  not make the resolution the pending  business of the Senate, even though  some  laws—such as the War Powers  Resolution—do take away the prerogative of the majority leader by making  a resolution the pending business without any motion to proceed being required. Had the Senate wished to do  that in this case, it could have followed  the language of the War Powers Resolution.  If a Senator other than the majority  leader feels he or she has the right to  call up privileged matters without deferring to the majority leader, then the  Senate will have undergone a dramatic  sea change in the way it operates.  The procedures in the Nuclear Waste  Policy Act were put in place pursuant  to the rulemaking power of the Senate,  and they have no higher standing because they are written into law. There  is no more  fundamental prerogative  that attaches to the majority leader  than the right to set the Senate agenda.  I hope my colleagues on this side of  the aisle will think long and hard before they challenge the historic role of  the majority leader. The traditions of  this  institution  deserve  to  be  protected.  Madam President, in the coming days  leading up to the vote, we will be laying out some of the things my colleague from Nebraska has asked.

295,House,107,-0.41,32,2002-07-09,Mr. CROWLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  in  support of my  resolution, H. Res. 393, which calls on European  governments  to address  the  rise of  anti-Semitism  throughout  the  continent of Europe. I introduced this bill  because I am concerned that Europe is  on the verge of another Kristalnacht.  Anti-Semitism,  accompanied  by,  in  many cases by violence, is at the highest levels since the horrors of World  War II. According to the British Daily  Telegraph, more  than  2,000 anti-Semitic incidents were reported throughout the European Union in the last 10  months, more than 18 every single day.  As I have listened very intently to  my good friend from New Jersey who  just came back from Europe and talking about the rise of anti-Semitism,  not only in Europe, but in the United  States and Canada, it is ugly wherever  it raises its head.  We must keep in mind, we do not  share a similar history when it comes  to dealing with the issue of anti-Semitism. We all know what the history of  Europe has been.  Among the most recent incidents on  March 30, two yeshiva students from  New Jersey were brutally beaten on  the streets of Berlin in an anti-Semitic  attack.  On April 11, 15 hooded attackers assaulted a Jewish teenage soccer team  in Bondy, France, with  sticks  and  metal bars while yelling anti-Semitic  remarks.  On April 27, a synagogue in a London  suburb was desecrated by vandals, who  painted swastikas on the walls and destroyed religious articles.  Two  synagogues  in Belgium were  firebombed earlier this year.  Also in Belgium, two Hasidic Jews in  Antwerp were attacked ferociously as a  chorus of teenage attackers spat on  them, chanting ‘‘dirty Jew’’ and praising Hitler. One of the two men had just  emerged from the hospital a few days  later when his 10-year-old daughter was  also attacked by assailants chanting a  chorus of anti-Semitic remarks. The  girl now walks to and from school with  an escort.  Anti-Semitism is clearly on the rise.  The French government reported 320  anti-Semitic incidents in 2001, almost  one per day. But this year French Jewish organizations reported over 300 incidents in the month of April alone.  Jewish cemeteries have been vandalized, a kosher butcher shop near Toulouse was  the  target of a drive-by  shooting, and the Or Aviv Synagogue  in Marseille was burned to the ground  by arsonists during the Passover holiday.  Not  every  European  government  faces a rash of anti-Semitism. Norway,  for example, has experienced few hate  crimes directed at Jews, and Prime  Minister Bondevik made it clear his  government will  forcefully prosecute  any anti-Semitic attacks.  Other governments have taken only  minor steps to address anti-Semitism.  France, for example, has increased the  police presence at major Jewish sites  in the aftermath of several attacks.  They just this week established a 24hour hotline for the Jewish community, and they have also appointed a liaison between the French government  and the French Jewish community.  But such steps are few and far between, and, in my opinion, do not go  far  enough.  European  governments  have done little to punish the perpetrators of such attacks, or, more importantly, they have done little to foster  an atmosphere in which Jews and other  minority groups can live free from harassment as normal members of their  societies.  Indeed, several senior European officials have made their anti-Semitism  clear and demonstrated that their bigotry affects government policies. Extremist xenophobes like Haider in Austria and Le Pen in France have made  hatred and  intolerance  the basis of  their party’s political platforms. Le  Pen made it into a runoff race for the  presidency of France. While he did not  win, his base of support in France remains strong.  France no longer appears to be guided  by  the  1789 Declaration  of  the  Rights  of Man,  the  foundation  for  French democracy, which called  for  equal rights  for all. Daniel Bernard,  the French ambassador in London, recently referred to Israel with an obscenity when he attributed all  the  troubles in the Middle East to Israel.  When his remarks were reported in the  press, Ambassador Bernard refused to  apologize and the foreign ministry refused to censure him.  Bernard’s remarks, made at a fashionable dinner party in London, demonstrate that the World Jewish Congress was correct when it asserted that  anti-Semitism is no longer considered  unacceptable in European polite society. European governments must demonstrate that such attitudes are simply  not acceptable.  In the years before World War II, the  fabric of European society was torn  apart by the official anti-Semitism of  Nazi Germany and its puppet governments in France, Austria, Poland and  elsewhere. b1445  Now, more than 60 years later, European governments are once again doing  little to discourage intolerance and hatred directed at Jews and other minority groups. When their rights are trampled upon, European governments must  step up and act in order to protect all  citizens. The failure to properly condemn and control these attacks makes  the governments of Europe complicit  in them.  Before I close, I would like to thank  a number of groups for their work in  support of this resolution, particularly  the  Orthodox Union,  the National  Council of Soviet Jewry, NORPAC, and  Harriet Mandel and her colleagues in  the  Jewish  Community  Relations  Council of New York.  I would also like to thank the ranking member and the chairman of the  committee, as well as the chair of the  subcommittee, who waived the rules to  allow this to come to the floor.  I want to thank the Speaker of the  House for bringing this important resolution to us today.

296,House,107,0.316,39,2002-07-09,Mr. RAMSTAD.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the distinguished chairman for yielding me the time.  Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support  of  this  important motion  which I offered with my good friend,  the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  LANGEVIN), the cochair of the House  Disabilities Caucus,  and  I want  to  thank him for his leadership on these  issues, as well as the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. NEY).  The right to vote, Mr. Speaker, is the  most basic and fundamental right we  have as Americans, and despite the importance of this constitutionally important and constitutionally protected  right, every election there are millions  of citizens with disabilities who find it  difficult,  if not  impossible,  to  cast  their ballot.  Across the country, thousands of visually impaired people, voters, are unable to cast a secret vote, a right afforded to every other American, because of their inability to read the ballot visually.  This motion to instruct asks the conferees to include language passed by  the Senate that requires every polling  place to offer at least one voting machine equipped for individuals with disabilities. That is the least we can do,  Mr. Speaker, to provide access to voting for every American, every citizen.  This motion is about fairness, and  people with disabilities deserve equal  access to voting. Over the years, Congress has worked hard to ensure that  every person’s voice is heard regardless  of race, religion or ethnic background.  It is long past time that we provide the  same opportunity to individuals with  disabilities.  This motion is very timely. We have  just returned from celebrating the 4th  of July, the birth of our great Nation.  We have the opportunity today, Mr.  Speaker, to ensure that the vision of  our Founding Fathers is realized, that  every American has an equal opportunity to vote.  I urge Members to vote yes for this  important motion, and again, I thank  the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  for his  leadership on this  important issue. ",2002
297,House,107,0.409,46,2002-07-09,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak this  afternoon to some issues that are important to my State.  In the last week I have had the opportunity to travel the State of South  Dakota and witness  some enormous  devastation that our State has experienced as a result of drought. It was announced yesterday that the month of  June was the driest in the 114-year history of our State. In western South Dakota we have farmers and ranchers who  are experiencing tremendous economic  impacts, losing, having to sell and liquidate their herds. We need a solution.  I will continue to prevail upon this  body, upon my colleagues here, as I  have already, to provide assistance to  our farmers and ranchers who are so  desperately in need of help this year.  In my judgment, the drought we are  experiencing in South Dakota is not  unlike many of the other natural disasters that affect other parts of this  country, and it demands that this Congress and the people of this country  step up and support those in my State  who are suffering so desperately this  year.  I  also  had  the  opportunity, Mr.  Speaker, to witness firsthand some of  the devastation that resulted as a result of the Grizzly Gulch fire, fire that  ravaged about 11,000 acres of South Dakota this last week. Fortunately, it is  under control; it is being contained.  For that, we owe an incredible debt of  gratitude to the extraordinary effort  that was made by  fire  fighters all  across South Dakota, volunteers who  came and joined the Federal fire fighters who were doing such a great job of  controlling, containing that blaze.  It came very, very close, right down  to the city’s edge, the city of Deadwood  and other communities that would be  impacted. It burned a number of structures and homes, but it did not come  into the community as a result of the  extraordinary efforts; and for that, I  give  the  fire  fighters of my State,  many of them volunteers from across  our State, great credit for the tremendous work that they did in controlling  that blaze.  The people of my State have pulled  together as they do in times of adversity to address this tragedy.

298,Senate,107,0.146,88,2002-07-09,Mr. MILLER.," Madam President,  I  ask unanimous consent  the pending  amendment be temporarily set aside so  I be allowed to offer an amendment.  ",2002
299,,107,0.494,123,2002-07-09,Mr. CRAIG.," Let me also talk about  one other issue that we discussed when  we talk about the capacity of Yucca  Mountain and,  therefore,  that  there  will always be waste out there somewhere in these temporary repositories  at these nuclear reactors generating  our commercial power.  Yes, there will be temporary storage  for periods of cooling pretransportation. There would be anyway under any  circumstance. But what we are talking  about—and the Senator from Nevada  showed a dip—is that you can just double the numbers at each one of those, if  you want. And doubling the numbers,  in my opinion, does have a risk factor,  certainly a management factor.  What is most important is that many  of these temporary repositories were licensed under State authority for a certain volume. To exceed that means you  have to go back to the same State authority that was granted 15 or 20 years  ago, versus today, and the politics have  changed a great deal, and we know  that, because those States were led to  believe that the Federal Government  would react responsibly in building a  permanent  repository and  the  temporary facility would be just that—it  would not become a permanent facility. Therefore, it would be a point to  cool and a point to transfer. That is  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD—SENATE July 9, 2002  what  those  temporary  repositories  were always intended to be.  So this really was the hand-in-glove  scenario. Do not suggest that one goes  without the other at all because they  were licensed not for permanency but  for temporary status while the Federal  Government moved through that time  of establishing a permanent repository.  In that context, when we talk about  the 70,000 ton cap at Yucca Mountain  as a statutory limitation, it may be  statutory but it is not physical. We do  not know what the physical capability  of Yucca Mountain beyond 70,000 tons  would be. It could be increased over  time 30 years out if, in fact, all of the  geology and everything else met the  standards that the scientists, through  the licensing process, had established.  Twenty years  from now,  30 years  from now, I will not be here. I doubt  that the junior Senator from Nevada  will be here. But on another day and in  another  place,  and  if  that  science  meets those standards, and it is strong  and stable, and the world’s perspective  has shifted, then, remember, we are  dealing with a statutory cap, not a  physical  limitation, as  it relates to  Yucca Mountain.  The reason the statutory cap was put  in place originally was because we were  looking at other repository locations  in Vermont, in Washington State, and  other places at the time. That is why  there was a cap put in place.  I know Senators Cantwell and Jeffords and Wellstone have talked about  the limitations and, therefore, the argument  that  temporary  repositories  would still have material in them. Remember, of course, any of us who legislate know that a statutory cap is one  that could be changed if the politics  and/or  the  science would  argue  a  change were there to do so. So let us  not, in any way, fall prey to that argument of limitation.  In that context, let me suggest that  limitation is, in part, tied to the geology of Yucca Mountain. I cannot tell  you that I was there at the beginning,  but I was there during the legislative  time when we were looking at a variety  of locations for repositories. I had examined them all as a legislator. I read  all of the preliminary geologic surveys.  It was determined at that time, in  the mid-1980s,  that Yucca Mountain  was, by far, the site that appeared to  be the most desirable other than, if you  will,  the  large  granite  deposits  in  Vermont.  Granite has a unique shielding capability, and it is possible to assume that  you could put repositories deep into  the granite of Vermont and it would be  an ideal situation. But our country did  not go there. Our country decided not  to have multiple repositories, but a  single one, largely because of the politics of it.  Governor Guinn, in his arguments of  vetoing it, suggested that Yucca Mountain is unsuitable for a permanent repository because it is at the center of  volcanic  activity,  earthquake  vault  zones, and rapid ground water flow. In  other words, that is the geology of the  mountain, as spoken to by the Governor of Nevada.  Secretary  Abraham  has  asserted  Yucca Mountain is geologically stable  and experiences  little ground water  flow or rainfall.  The U.S. Geological Survey agrees,  stating that the arid climate and low  probability  of  repository-piercing  earthquakes or volcanic activity support  the  recommendation  of Yucca  Mountain.  The Nuclear Waste Technical Review  Board also concurred, stating:  No individual technical or scientific factor  has been identified that would automatically  eliminate Yucca Mountain  from consideration at this point.  That is a quote directly from the report by the technical review group.  Based on these factors, the Energy  Committee, on which I serve, examined  it and determined that it was fair that  we bring this issue to the floor in the  form of a resolution and allow ourselves to go to the next step.  And oh, by the way, the U.S. Geological Survey agrees with us. The Governor asserted  that  the geology of  Yucca Mountain is so bad that DOE has  given up on geologic isolation of waste  in favor of manmade barriers. In other  words, the original concept was to create a facility so deep in the Earth that  the Earth itself would create the natural barriers, and that you would not  need to build a barrier within a barrier,  in other words, a manmade barrier.  Secretary Abraham points out that a  balance of both natural and engineered  barriers has always been planned for  the repository.  Existing geologic barriers are likely  sufficient to prevent waste from reaching ground water, but the engineered  barriers provide additional protection.  Do you remember what we did a couple years ago? Because we wanted to  make sure we did it right, because we  wanted to address the arguments that  were being made, we put EPA into the  mix and we extended the idea of engineering out into the future a facility  that would withstand 10,000 years of  any kind of threat. That is when the  barrier within the barrier concept really began to develop.  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the Secretary to consider engineered barriers when making this recommendation to the President.  Long before the Governor got into  the argument, and long before the Governor  tried  to  find arguments  that  would fit his political need, we had already thought of that. It was in the  1982 act. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, not the committee or the Senate, must ultimately decide if the barriers are sufficient to prevent the seepage of radionuclides. The committee  agreed with Secretary Abraham’s conclusion that the consideration of man-  made barriers is appropriate.  The Governor  claims  that DOE’s  computer models are unable to adequately  predict  emission  rates  for  VerDate Mar 15 2010  20:24 Jan 09, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€2SENATE\S09JY2.REC S09JY2 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2002

301,,107,-0.53,165,2002-07-09,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to today to recognize the Madison Civics Club. For 90 years,  the Madison Civics Club has brought world  leaders,  illuminating  thinkers and  local innovators to the citizens of Madison. The club began in 1912 through the tireless efforts of five charter members. These five had just spent several grueling, and unsuccessful, months trying to convince members  of  the Wisconsin  Legislature  to adopt women’s suffrage. The founding members— Georgia  Lloyd  Jones,  Alice  Bleyer, Edna Chynoweth, Lucille McCarthy and Mary B. Orvis— decided to gather for lunch, review their mistakes, seek strength and  lick  their wounds generally.’  From that effort, the club was born. Its goal was, and remains to this day, developing a civic conscience  through being informed on local and foreign affairs. The Madison Civics Club has flourished. Its members  number more  than  800.  It  has hosted such world leaders as Winston Churchill, Nelson Rockefeller and Eleanor Roosevelt. The Madison Civics Club brought those who have mastered the arts to Madison, including Carl Sandburg, Arthur C. Clarke and Peter Bogdanovich. Amelia Earhart, Bella Abzug and Alex Haley are just some of the inspirational individuals who have illuminated Madison ’s citizens. Those that shape the message of our mass media,  including David Broder, Ray Suarez and Hedrick Smith, have been a part of Madison Civics Club history. Prominent citizens,  including  those on  the faculty of the world-class institution, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, also have addressed Madison’s local concerns. The 2002– 03 season shares the hallmark of again promising an engaging and  thoughtful series of speakers. The theme, as determined by the 2002– 03 chair Lynn Stathas, is ‘ ‘The American Dream.’  Speakers  include: Harry Wu, Chinese dissident and human rights activist; Judith Miller, an author and Pulitzer-Prize winning correspondent at the New York Times who is considered an expert on terrorism and was in fact the target of one of the heinous and infamous anthrax letters that were mailed in 2001; Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice Shirley S.

302,,107,-0.353,172,2002-07-09,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, I opposed  the Republican prescription drug bill. And not only the bill, but the process by which we considered it. Since being elected  to Congress  in 1998, not a day has gone by without my hearing from a senior who is struggling to pay for prescription drugs. I’ve told the story of the woman from Westminster, CO who has to visit the food bank once a week so that she can afford her prescription drugs. I’ve  told  the story of another woman who plays her own version of the lottery. She puts all of her bills in a fish bowl, draws one bill, and the one she draws is the one she puts off paying so that she can buy the drugs her doctor tells her she has to take. And I’ve told the story of Juanita Johns, a constituent who kept  the  thermostat  in her home at 60 degrees so she could pay her drug bills. That is until she sold her house and moved in with her son in order to afford her medicines. Juanita is not with us anymore. Unfortunately, these women are not alone. Over one-third of Medicare beneficiaries have no drug coverage. Medicare does not cover outpatient prescription drug costs. Many seniors turn to supplemental plans for drug coverage, but  these plans often are expensive and have high deductibles or low benefits. No senior should be faced with the choice of buying food, paying the electric bill or buying critical life saving medicines. We have an obligation to our Nation’s seniors to provide them with the lifesaving treatments they need and deserve. Last month, we had the opportunity to do something about it. But the Republican leadership  insisted on pushing  through a proposal that subsidizes insurance companies and drug companies  instead of helping seniors. Their bill does nothing  to guarantee coverage  for seniors.  It has a gap  in coverage  that will leave Medicare beneficiaries 100% financially liable for thousands of dollars in drug costs, covers only 6% of Medicare beneficiaries, and does nothing to lower the price of prescription drugs. Instead, their bill gives $310 billion to insurance companies  to encourage  them  to offer  stand-alone  prescription  drug  plans, something  that  the  insurance  companies themselves say will not work. If this bill becomes law, and if past is prologue, we will  have  insurance  companies knocking on our door in the not too distant future  telling us  that  they don’t have enough money to provide these plans, and that they need more.  It’s  just  like what  is happening with  Medicare+Choice.  Several  insurance companies promised seniors affordable health care, took their premiums and then dumped them a year later. And now many seniors are scrambling to find a new doctor. Now, I support the increase in payments for providers, which are  included  in  the Republican bill. As a matter of fact, I am cosponsoring  legislation  to  increase physician payments and to change the formula upon which those  payments  are  based.  I  support  increased payments  to our Nation’s hospitals, and I’ve joined with several of my colleagues asking the leadership of this body to address Medicare HMO payment issues. But in a cynical political move, the authors of this bill attached these provider payments to their prescription drug bill to force us to vote against them. So I am going on the record today to say that my vote against this bill should not be construed as a vote against provider payments. And my vote against this bill should not be construed as a vote against prescription drugs for seniors.  I support  the Democratic plan, which is a defined benefit under Medicare. It has a guaranteed premium, a guaranteed copayment, guaranteed coverage, and is available to all those seniors who need it. It doesn’t have any gaps in coverage, and it has no gimmicks. That’s what our seniors deserve. But the Republican leadership wouldn’t even let us bring our bill  to  the  floor  for debate. They wouldn’t even let us offer amendments to their bill. Why not? If it was so bad, they could have just voted it down. But they knew that our plan was better and if it were put up against  the Republican plan,  it would have prevailed. Instead, they took a ‘ ‘my way or the highway’  approach. On the day of the vote, many members took to the floor of the House to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. ‘ . . .one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.’ Where is the indivisibility? Where is the liberty in this rule? Where is the justice in this rule? In this debate? In this bill? We should set a better example  for other governments around the world. This is not the way democracy works. Mr. Speaker,  the great civil  rights worker Fannie Lou Hamer once said, ‘ I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired.’  So am I, and so are the millions of seniors who can’t afford the drugs their doctors tell them they have to take. The number of seniors in this Nation will double over  the next  twenty years, and at  that time, their voices and actions will be stronger than  the  insurance companies and  the drug manufacturers. I just hope we don’t have to wait that long. I could not support the rule or the bill.

303,House,107,0.411,4,2002-07-17,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr.  Speaker, most of us Republicans and Democrats come to the House to pass legislation and to help the American people.  I heard a minute ago from one of the Members that the accounting bill that we passed on this floor was a sham. Well, I want to inform my colleagues that 118 Democrats voted for that. Only 40 Democrats, from the leadership, primarily, voted against it. Instead of helping the American people in a time of crisis, when the markets are bad and people are losing confidence, the Democrat leadership, once again, is playing partisan election year politics. They also say that tax relief is only for the rich. Well, listen to the facts, as stated by Alan Greenspan yesterday. Tax relief stopped the recession. It also put this economy back on a positive note. Yet my friends on the other side, the Democratic leadership, would rather say that the tax break was for the rich. This  is partisan election year rhetoric. Mr. Speaker, we are here to pass legislation, not to  jam  it up,  like the other body, which is holding 54 of our bills. f CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY (Mr. CARDIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2002
304,House,107,0.513,4,2002-07-17,Mr. SULLIVAN.," Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. Since this has happened, I have received hundreds of calls from seniors thanking me for voting for this very important measure. A significant number of seniors in the First District of Oklahoma are forced to  live on a  fixed budget. In order to live within their means, some skip a meal, some turn off their air conditioners, and some only take half the prescriptions that have been prescribed to them, to save. It is a simple fact that seniors need permanent prescription drug benefit from this Congress. But simple is not always synonymous with easy, especially when politics are involved. The House has passed a good bill, and I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to follow the House’s lead. Our bill was based on simple, common  sense principles. They are: To lower the cost of prescription drugs now and in the future; guarantee all seniors  prescription  drug  coverage under Medicare;  improve Medicare with more choices and more savings; and strengthen Medicare for the future. Our seniors need a prescription drug benefit this year. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will follow suit. f ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. STEARNS). The Chair would remind all Members giving 1-minute speeches that they cannot urge the other body to take action. f ENERGY INDEPENDENCE (Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2002
305,House,107,0.493,4,2002-07-17,Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland.," Mr. Speaker, increasing our energy independence is absolutely vital to ensuring America’s national security. Americans  are  5  percent  of  the world’s population. We use 25 percent of the world’s oil production, and yet we produce 30 percent of the world’s output of goods and services. We are the most energy-efficient and productive Nation on earth, but America has only 2 percent of the world’s known oil reserves. In pumping that 2 percent, we meet only  44 percent of America’s needs. America must import nearly 60 percent of our oil, up from 32 percent in 1992 and 34 percent during the last Arab oil embargo. Americans must pay billions of dollars to unstable or hostile regimes,  such  as Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, for the oil we need to run our economy and our military. Every year since 1970, with only a tiny blip from Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay, oil production in the United States has gone down, and experts agree it will continue to go down. That is why conservation, efficiency, and alternative and renewable forms of energy are critically important parts of a balanced, comprehensive national energy strategy. f JOURNAL ",2002

307,House,107,-0.312,25,2002-07-17,Mr. DICKS.," Mr. Chairman, I think we made some progress here today. I want to make  sure  there  is clear understanding that the committee, this committee has been one of the strongest advocates  for Native Americans. We have increased every year that I have been on this committee; we have had added money for Native Americans. This  is not an effort by the committee to do something to harm the tribes that are affected here. What we are trying to do is to get them money in a reasonable period of time without decimating the interior appropriations bill every single year. I want that $143 million to be used for other programs that will help Native Americans. I do not want to waste $1 billion in going out and trying to do accounting that is not going to give us the information pre-1985. I have talked to the chairman and the staff. We are prepared to work with the authorizers on language that would deal with the pre-1985 period between now and the conference committee and maybe we can put together a package as the gentleman from California (Mr. has  laid  out  previously, which  I  think makes  some sense, so that we can move expeditiously on the period between 2000 and 1985; and then we craft an approach for a settlement of some sort pre-1985 so that we move the game forward, get this thing moving in the right direction so that the tribes will get some money. To  do  just  historical  accounting every single year and let this litigation fester is not accomplishing anything to help the tribes. They are not going to get the money. It is going to be years and years and years before this will be resolved. It will go through litigation. It will go to the circuit court of appeals. It will go to the United States Supreme Court. We need to work out a settlement; and this amendment was offered in the spirit of trying to break this logjam, trying to move this thing forward. I would like to see the authorizers agree with us today that we should GEORGEMILLER)  work together collectively to try to come up with some pre-1985 language. The chairman and his people are willing to work with us on this, and I think we could make some very significant progress and move this thing forward. ",2002
308,House,107,0.284,32,2002-07-17,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield myself 1 minute. What the gentleman said is not accurate. My good friend from Illinois said it is to eliminate, and that is not true. There is nothing in the bill that says that, and it is not fair to go down to the well of the House and say something that is not in the bill. That is not fair. I would urge the gentleman from Illinois, my friend, to read what it says. It does not say that. I have a Boston Globe piece right here, Mr. Chairman. It said the plight of the native Americans is the unemployment rate, which is 43 percent. We argue in this body over is it going to go to 4 to 5 to 6 percent for non-Native Americans. Forty-three percent, says the Boston Globe. Employed, but living below poverty, 33 percent. I stand corrected; I just said it was 26 percent. It is 33 percent. Suicide rate for ages 15 to 24, the flower of the youth, 37.15 percent. We have to look at that. We have to look at that. So what the gentleman says, and he is a good friend, it is not to eliminate; it is to look at other ways in addition. We do not say that. Lastly, with regard to diabetes, my figure was too low; it is 9 percent. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. SHAYS). ",2002
309,House,107,-0.4,46,2002-07-17,Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice my strong support for this amendment  to  the FY03  Interior Appropriations bill (H.R. 5093), which would reaffirm our commitment to enriching the education of our children.  The Slaughter-Dicks-Horn-Johnson amendment would  increase  funding  for  the National Endowment for the Humanities by $5 million and  the National Endowment  for  the Arts by $10 million. These small increases in funding will have a tremendous impact on the quality of education for all children. As a member of  the Congressional Arts Caucus and a  former  teacher,  I understand the importance of the arts and humanities in our education system. More than two-thirds of our Nation’s K– 12 curriculum is dedicated to the humanities. As the largest supporter of the humanities in the country, the Federal Government,  through  the NEH, provides access  to high-quality  educational  programs  and  resources  through grants  to non-profit cultural institutions  such as museums, universities, and State humanities councils. These grants strengthen  teaching,  facilitate  research, and provide opportunities for lifelong learning. It is incumbent upon  the Federal Government  to maintain its commitment to the humanities if we are to maintain a high level of excellence in our public schools. The arts create an environment of creativity, expression, and  success  for  children. The NEA nurtures  the growth and artistic excellence of  thousands of arts organizations all over  the country by making  the performing, visual, literary, media and folk arts available to millions of Americans. Programs, such as the Arts Learning grants, support projects for children and youth, in school and outside the regular school day and year,  in pre-K  through grade 12 and in youth arts areas. This project, which partners public education and nonprofit arts organizations, helps to contribute to the incredible economic success of the arts industry. The  nonprofit  arts  industry  generates $36.8 billion annually in economic activity and supports 1.3 million jobs. In my district, the Connecticut’s Commission on the Arts uses NEA funding to support its Higher Order Thinking  (HOT) Schools Program. The HOT Schools Program is designed to  transform entire school communities. The arts, especially writing, play a central role in this change process. School culture  focuses on student needs and celebrates each child’s accomplishments by sharing  them with  the larger school community. The program began in 1994 with only six schools and has grown to  include  over  twenty-four  schools  from across Connecticut involving over 5,000 students and 500 educators. In recent years, funding for the NEA and the NEH has been slashed— leaving many arts and cultural programs scrambling for funding. For example, in my state of Connecticut, Federal grants dropped from $10 million in 1994 to an average of only $3 million. Such reductions serve as an  impediment  to accessing and unearthing the country’s rich cultural and educational  infrastructure.  The modest  increases proposed  in  this amendment would help  to close  the gap created by  revenue shortfalls in many states. The Slaughter-Dicks-Horn-Johnson amendment will serve to only improve the NEA and the NEH. With additional funding, we will be able  to preserve programs already  in place like the HOT Schools Program, and build upon their  successes  to  create  new  programs, which will enhance the education of more children. The NEA and the NEH are integral to our children’s educational development. The NEA and the NEH have already suffered from cuts and reductions over the years. It is time to reinvest in these extremely successful agencies and provide America’s children with a complete cultural and artistic education. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this amendment. ",2002
310,House,107,-0.353,46,2002-07-17,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise today in support of the Slaughter-DicksHorn-Johnson Amendment to the Department of Interior Appropriations bill to increase funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment  for  the Humanities by fifteen million dollars. The value of supporting the arts is widely accepted. Art provides a venue for expression and understanding of human  thought and emotion. Educators have argued that there are many educational benefits to students enrolled in the arts. Some institutions looking to bridge the gap of understanding between different cultures use art as a universal means of communicating concerns and developing understanding. The National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities consistently work to give artists across the country the opportunity  to participate  in  the arts.  In fact, forty percent of the money allocated to the national endowment is transferred directly to states so that they are able to fund local programs. In Colorado, money from the National Endowment of the Arts is used to fund the Arts and Education Learning Network which teaches arts organizations how to work with schools, and the Online Poetry Project to help schools address poetry related questions on standardized CSAP exams. The bulk of funding requested in the amendment will go to the Challenge America Program that works to start arts and humanities programs in communities that have yet to receive funding from the Endowment. Along with  the  immeasurable value of  the contribution of the arts and the humanities as an expression of our culture and of the individual, the arts have proven to have a quantifiable value as well. A study recently conducted by an economist at the University of Georgia of ninety-one communities nationwide showed that communities  that spend money on  the arts, make money from the arts. One of  the communities  in  the study was Boulder, CO. It was calculated that just over nineteen million dollars  in spending by  the nonprofit arts  industry  in Boulder generated over thirteen million dollars in revenue and income  for Boulder businesses, residents and local government, and supported five hundred and ninety-four full time jobs. The arts and humanities bring money and jobs to communities in today’s difficult economic environment. This amendment would allocate necessary funding to a grossly underfunded national arts ‘ ’ ",2002
311,House,107,0.428,53,2002-07-17,Mr. WAMP.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman’s amendment on behalf of the committee. This agreement that we have on NEA is long-standing, it is bipartisan, it is very delicate, and conservatives and liberals and moderates have come together on this in the past. Obviously, the amendment that  just passed  increasing NEA  funding makes  this amendment somewhat problematic for some on this side. I have to also say, as a member of the subcommittee for 6 years, we have seen tremendous  improvement. Under Bill Ivey’s  leadership, the NEA  is much more accountable, much more responsive, and much more efficient. I know he is no longer there, but it is a muchimproved  organization. The  funding levels have been agreed to. This bill is a careful balance. On virtually every item in the bill we have had to work through a compromise so that we could report the bill out with comity and cooperation for the good of the country. This agreement, at approximately $100 million for the NEA, is a carefully crafted bill. This amendment cuts that in half, which obviously would create the inability to ever pass this bill, to ever conference this bill with the Senate, to ever finally arrive at an agreement here. So we respectfully oppose the amendment and ask the entire body to vote against the amendment. ",2002
312,House,107,-0.395,67,2002-07-17,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman  from Oregon  for yielding time to me and for his work on this very important matter. Mr. Chairman,  this amendment  is good for agriculture, it is good for waterfowl, it is good for the fishing industry, and it is good for the families in the Klamath Basin, the north coast of California, and the coast of Oregon. In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt established our country’s first waterfowl refuge in the Klamath and Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge. b1645 These are among the most important refuges in our country and they are the most important refuges in California. It is the largest staging area for waterfowl in the entire Pacific flyway. It also has the greatest concentration of wintering bald eagles  in the United States. As was pointed out earlier, these are the only refuges in the country that allow commercial lease land farming. They farm over 20,000 acres of farmland. Many of the crops are waterconsumptive and chemically intensive. The area is an area of very little waterfall. The average is less than that of some parts of Arizona where they have next to nothing. There are about 100,000 acre-feet of water that are overallocated  in the basin; and this, Mr. Chairman, coupled with a multiyear drought, has hurt farmers, it hurts fish, and it hurts waterfall. The area of the headwaters of the Klamath River, which was  the number one salmon river in the Lower 48 States. Today’s water shortages and intensive chemicals have greatly diminished the fish and the economy of the coastal communities of Northern California and some parts of Oregon. In 1988, sports and commercial fishing  in  the Pacific  region generated over $1.2 billion to our regional economy. Today’s salmon fishing between Fort Bragg, California and my district and Coos Bay, Oregon has been all but shut down for the last 10 years. Klamath River salmon are 1 percent of their historical population, and  the coast families in California and Oregon have lost over 72,000 family wage jobs. We must address the water problems of the Klamath Basin. We have got to do it soon. This amendment, I believe, is a very important first step in doing that. The amendment will limit the crops grown on about 2,000 acres of the refuge that is leased to farming. That is 17 leases and, remember, they farm 2,000 acres of lease  farming there. The crops that will be grown on those 17 leases, on those 2,000 acres, will be less waterconsumptive. They will rely  less on chemicals and they will provide some very needed food to waterfowl. We are talking about going from row crops and alfalfa to potatoes to cereal grain to crops that are beneficial to the important wildlife that fly through the entire Pacific flyway. And most important and against what some of the critics of this amendment will say is that it still allows families in the area to farm. These areas will not go out of farming production. They will continue to be farmed. There are just going to be restrictions on what can be farmed in this area, restrictions that will be good for the coastal communities, good for the farming communities, good for the Native American community, good for fish, good for wildlife and good for waterfowl. This is an important solution to the Klamath Basin water problem and it will help immensely with the downturn in the economy for the aforementioned reasons, and I would urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this initiative, and do so knowing this can be good for fish, good for waterfowl and good for people. I thank the gentleman from Oregon again. ",2002
313,House,107,0.339,67,2002-07-17,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon.," Mr. Chairman, I am dismayed that my colleague from Portland has chosen to attack farming the Klamath Basin with this reckless and harmful amendment. By doing so, we are kicking the very farmers in the stomach just when they have been begun to recover from the last attack that this government hit them with. You remember, these are the men and women of the Klamath Basin who had their irrigation water cut off to them last year. They could not raise their  crops  and  then  the National Academy of Science has found the government’s decision  to  cut off  their water  could not  be  backed up  by science. In short, the Federal Government got it wrong, terribly wrong. What makes this amendment especially troubling is that it flies in the face of science and could hurt the farmers, the economy, the community and the very species that it is supposed to be introduced to protect. Mr. Chairman, it is our responsibility to see that this Congress does not get it wrong again and do even more damage in the Klamath Basin, damage not only to the farmers who lease the lands on the refuges but also damage the wildlife, the waterfowl and refuges. The  proponents make  two  arguments: That growing row crops and alfalfa are incompatible with the refuges and the pesticides are adversely affecting the environment of the refuges. First, growing row crops is not only compatible with the refuges, but is also a practice that benefits the soil by improving its fertility as crops are rotated. This practice is as old as farming in America. The increased fertility of the soil in turn benefits the cereal grains that represent more than 75 percent of  the acreage  in  the  refuges which are then eaten by various species. Mr.  Chairman,  activities  on  the Klamath and Tule Lake Refuges are governed by several Federal laws, including the 1964 Kuchel Act, which restricts row crops on the refuges to no ",2002
314,House,107,0.423,74,2002-07-17,Mr. BAKER.," I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, this is a very important matter that the House must consider this evening and I do appreciate the recommendations  the gentleman has made in his motion to instruct. All of those issues will certainly be the subject of conversation during the course of this important conference. I am surprised that the motion to instruct did not include the specific directions to adopt the provisions contained in the Senate-passed bill, the Sarbanes bill, since it has been viewed by so many as being the answer to the problem. But as is always the case, no legislative product is the perfect answer for all issues. I respectfully suggest that the Sarbanes bill is no different. There is work to do. For example, the Sarbanes bill does not make provision with regard to realtime material  fact disclosure. What does that mean? That means if the corporate manager knows  it and  it  is something  that  affects  shareholder value and he does not report it until the  90-day quarterly earnings  statement, you have terrific volatility in the markets and prices go up and down. We unfortunately are seeing that to great extreme today. That is why companies all too often file what they call pro forma returns. They get something out early that is not really a total disclosure, but  it  is something to help defuse the volatility of the quarterly earnings report. Real-time material disclosure says if you know it, you got to tell it. If you know it and you do not tell it, that is a criminal penalty. If you did not know it but should have, that is a civil penalty. We want to talk about what realtime material fact disclosure means. That will be the subject of the conference, because that is in the Housepassed bill. But what has not been in either bill, and unfortunately I did not see in the motion to instruct, is to do something  to actually help  the defrauded investor. It troubles me to get home in the evening, turn on the TV and see some millionaire in Mississippi with an $18 million mansion who has run a corporation into the ground and we cannot get the house because he built  it with  shareholder-defrauded funds. We want to include a fair fund that says within the SEC all fines, all penalties, everything that is disgorged, that means taken back from the guys who have gotten ill-gotten gains, put it into an account and then let the SEC be bound to distribute 90 percent or more of it to the defrauded investor. With all due respect, we are not into a transfer of wealth. We do not want to take corporate wealth and give it to trial lawyer wealth by simply creating new causes of action while the shareholder sits on the sidelines and watches assets be spent in the courts while the fellow is down in the Caribbean enjoying a $150-million-a-year lifestyle. We need to fix that, and we are going to. In  summary,  the gentleman  from California (Mr. COX) talked about the fact  that  the House-passed criminal penalties for inappropriate conduct are twice what are now suggested by the motion to instruct. If you want to be tough on criminals, if you want to get the money back and you want to give information to investors, please defeat this motion to instruct. ",2002

317,Senate,107,0.331,109,2002-07-17,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. President, I have  enjoyed being here this morning and  hearing the debate. When I came to the  Senate, I was interested in health care,  anxious to do what I could to improve  health care in this country, and recognized rather quickly that one of the  major things that has happened in this  country  is that technology has  long  since outstripped, overcome, and  ignored legislation.  I tell town meetings, among people  who talk to me about Medicare, Medicare is the best Blue Cross Blue Shield  fee-for-service indemnity plan that we  could devise  in the 1960s,  frozen  in  time. Legislation does not allow flexibility; legislation freezes things. And  we have a Medicare system that, frankly, makes little or no sense in the face  of the way we practice medicine today.  In the 1960s, when Blue Cross Blue  Shield laid down their fee-for-indemnity plan, which Congress basically  embraced and froze in legislation, prescription drugs didn’t make much of an  impact. The big financial challenge in  those days was the cost of going to the  hospital. So a plan was frozen in place  that said, We will reimburse you for  going to the hospital and, today, 40  years later, the way Medicare is structured doesn’t make any sense. People  take pills rather than having an operation, but the pills, even though they  are many times cheaper than the operation, are not reimbursed, whereas the  operation would be.  There is a disincentive to practice intelligent medicine under Medicare. So  to suggest that any rational individual  looking at our present health care system does not support a prescription  drug solution to our present dilemma  is to misstate the facts. Everybody who  looks at  this, who has any understanding of the system, is in favor of a  prescription drug benefit for Medicare.  All right. We are all in favor. Let’s do  it. It is a little like someone having a  medical condition back in the 1700s and  turning to a physician and saying: We  are all in favor of medical assistance,  let’s do it. And then the physician, acting on the conventional wisdom of the  time, says: Bring in some more leeches,  because  that  is  the accepted  technology.  Unfortunately,  that point of view  would cause someone who had greater  knowledge to say: Don’t seek medical  assistance under this circumstance. Do  something different.  Oh, no, we have to act quickly, and  the prescribed method is to bring in  some more leeches. So let’s act quickly  on this. The prescribed method is to  simply attach a prescription drug benefit to the existing Medicare system  and not pay much attention to any of  the side effects.  I was here in 1993 when we debated  health care almost exclusively on this  floor. It was the raging issue through  the end of 1993 and through almost all  of 1994. I was here when the effort to  reform our health care system died on  this floor. A lot of people think it was  voted down. It was not voted down. It  simply died of its own weight.  George Mitchell, who was the majority leader at the time, despairing of the  committee’s not being able to produce  a bill that might pass, took the whole  process into his office and he produced,  without any committee background,  the Mitchell bill.  I was part of the effort to defeat the  Mitchell bill. We met twice a day in  Senator Dole’s conference room. We  met under the leadership of the thenranking member of the Senate Finance  Committee, Senator Packwood  from  Oregon, who  understood  this  issue  about as well as anybody, and we laid  out the traps that we were setting for  Senator Mitchell.

318,Senate,107,0.091,123,2002-07-17,Ms. SNOWE.," It is a bipartisan amendment. It is a very important amendment—one that addresses a  part of that which we are here to consider on the floor of the Senate on the  issue of prescription drugs.  Let me describe what the problems  are. One, we don’t have a prescription  drug benefit in the Medicare Program,  and we need to change that. We need to  add a prescription drug benefit to the  Medicare Program. Why do we need to  do that? Because when Medicare was  created, many of the lifesaving miracle  drugs that exist now that allow senior  citizens to live a longer and healthier  life did not exist. So Medicare was basically  an  opportunity  to  provide  health insurance coverage for doctors  and hospitals but no prescription drug  coverage. That was back in the 1960s.  Things have changed.  Were we to write a Medicare Program  today, we would clearly include prescription drug coverage in that Medicare Program. I mentioned senior citizens especially because that  is who  benefits from the Medicare Program.  They represent about 12 percent of the  population of our country, and they  consume one-third of all prescription  drugs. It is not unusual at all to talk to  a senior citizen who has a series of  health issues, as they have reached the  later stages of their  lives, and they  have to take 4, 5, 10, and in some cases  12  different  prescription medicines  every day in order to deal with their  health issues.  The problem is, when senior citizens  reach that time of their lives where  they have retired and have a lower income, they have less ability to be able  to afford those prescription drugs. With  the cost and spending increasing substantially, senior citizens are finding  all  too often  that  the prescription  drugs they need to take are simply out  of reach.  Let me describe some of the consequences that result. I talked yesterday about the woman who came up to  me—and all of us have had this experience—she grabbed me by the elbow and  said: Senator DORGAN, can you help  me?  I said: What is wrong?  She said: Well, I have very serious  health problems and my doctor prescribed prescription drugs that I must  take, but they are too expensive.  I  don’t have the money to be able to afford them.  Her eyes welled up with tears and her  chin began to quiver and she began to  cry.  She said: Can you help me, please?  This happens all across the country  every day. Let me just read some letters. This is from a North Dakotan who  wrote me  some while ago, about  2  months ago:  DEAR SENATORDORGAN:  I  just returned  from a drug store, where I happened to witness a very pathetic situation that brought  tears to my eyes. Standing in front of me at  the counter was an elderly gentleman about  80 years of age. He handed 2 prescriptions to  the pharmacist. He said,  ‘‘Before you  fill  these, can you tell me what the price is?’’  The pharmacist checked the price through  her computer and told the elderly man, ‘‘The  first prescription is $94.76. The next prescription is $49.88. Do you want me to fill them  for you?’’ The old man looked around and  was deep in thought and said, ‘‘No, I guess  not. I haven’t bought Christmas presents for  my wife and grandchildren. I will just put up  with the pain.’’ Using his cane, he walked  away. ‘‘God bless America,’’ she writes. ‘‘I  just thought,’’ she said, ‘‘you and your  Senate colleagues who have reservations about the need for lower priced  prescription drugs ought to understand  that this is going on in our country.’’  A North Dakotan wrote to me and  said: I am 86 years old, so I cannot work. Her first thought, of course, would be  to work. I am 86 years old, so I cannot work. I am  writing in regard to the medication I take. I  get $303 in Social Security every month. I  have never worked out of my home. I pay  $400 a month for my medication. I have had  heart surgery and have osteoporosis of the  bones. The medicines are very high priced.  We need help. We are using all of our savings. I am 86 years old, so I cannot work. Another woman from my State says: I am a person with scleroderma, diagnosed  at the Mayo 24 years ago. While this disease  attacks different parts of my body, it’s mainly my lungs. I have been on oxygen for 2  years now. A new medication is out named  Tracleer. One pill a day is $3,600 a year. I  called Medicare to see if there was an insurance I can buy for medications. I was told I  could not do that. I am a farm wife, 74 years  old, who drove a tractor until 2 years ago  when I lost my husband and then my lungs  got worse. She goes on at some great length.  I recall a snowy North Dakota day in  January, in a small van going to Canada with some senior citizens from my  State. Among the people who traveled  to a little one-room drugstore in Emerson, Canada, that snowy day was Silvia  Miller, a  70-year-old Medicare beneficiary from Fargo, ND, with no prescription drug coverage. She has diabetes, heart problems, and emphysema.  She takes 10 to 12 medications every  day. In 1999, she spent more than $4,900  for her medications. Well, Silvia Miller, like a lot of others, struggles to try  to make do and deal with very serious  health problems and tries to catch an  increased price every year—increased  costs of prescription drugs. Of course,  she cannot catch that. It is moving out  of sight.  Last year, there was a 17- to 18-percent  cost  increase  for  prescription  drugs. The year before that,  it was  about 16 percent. The year behalf that,  it was about 17 percent. So year after  year after year, there are relentless increases  in  the  cost  of  prescription  drugs. This trend continues. What can  we do about it?  Well, the point we make with this  amendment is this: We support fully  putting a prescription drug benefit in  the Medicare Program. That ought to  be done. I hope it will be done. But if  that is all we do—if we do nothing to  try to dampen down prices, put some  downward  pressure  on  prescription  drug prices, we will have done nothing  but hook up a hose to the Federal  trough and we will suck it dry.  The American taxpayer beware. If we  don’t do something to try to put some  downward  pressure  on  prescription  drug prices, we cannot afford putting a  prescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program. We must do both, in my  judgment. Let’s put the benefit in the  Medicare Program, make it optional,  make it good, and at the same time  let’s do some things that put downward  pressure on prescription drug prices.  I mentioned that I went to Canada  with a group of North Dakota senior  citizens. More recently, the Alliance  For Retired Americans arranged 16 bus  trips to Canada between May and June of this year to highlight the enormous  price differences  that  exist  for  the  identical prescription drugs between  the United States and Canada. Participants in those 16 trips saved $506,000, or  $1,340 per person.  I think it is important that we talk  about policy in theory in the U.S. Senate, but  let me do something a bit  more than that, if I can.  I ask unanimous consent to show  some prescription drug bottles that describe the real problem.  ",2002
319,Senate,107,0.338,158,2002-07-17,Mr. SANTORUM.," I say to the Senator from Illinois, half the money in  advertising for drug companies is for  free  samples,  samples  to physicians  that end up going to patients for free  medication. Just understand half of  that money, roughly half, is for free  samples given out to hospitals and doctors. That is a way many people who do  not have prescription coverage end up  getting some medication.  I find it remarkable the Senator says  that PhRMA has the Congress  in a  death grip, and then says somehow the  bill  that  passed  last  year  over  PhRMA’s objection will pass this year  both in the House and the Senate. He  says PhRMA has us in a death grip, but  at the same time they are passing legislation willy-nilly. I find that inconsistent.  I also find it inconsistent when the  Senator says somehow or another we  are relying on the courage of the Canadians—that is an often used term—to  stand up to the drug companies. What  courage is he talking about? He is talking about price controls. He was very  forthright in saying we do not have the  courage  in the Congress to do price  controls, so this is the next best thing.  We all know how successful price controls are in America. They are an abject failure. We tried that in the 1970s.  We have not tried it since because of  the horrible disasters that occurred in  our economy because of it.  What we are doing here is trying to  impose price controls. On whom? We  are trying to impose price controls on  an industry that invests more on saving  lives and preserving the quality  and quantity of people’s lives than any  other industry in America. How are we  doing that? We are doing  it by reimporting drugs. And the safety issue  is clear.  I encourage everyone to vote for the  Cochran amendment. That is not going  to be enough. Under this measure, the  Dorgan proposal, drugs from all over  the world—from terrorist countries— can come through Canada  into this  country without anybody  inspecting  them in Canada, no one. The law in  Canada says they do not have to inspect it. As long as it is not to be used  in Canada, all they have to do is mark  it Canadian and ship it to the United  States, and God knows what will be in  the drugs. It could be terrorists, but it  could be just phony drugs. We have no  ability to check.  This is a huge safety issue. While the  Cochran amendment gets at it, it is  very important we need to do other  things on this  legislation to ensure  that we are not opening up another avenue for terrorism, another avenue for  people to die. The Dorgan amendment  says we are not going to do anything to  stop the reimportation of drugs until  we have a pattern of people dying. So if  one person dies, we will keep going  until we see three, four, or five? This is  remarkable. For what? So we can get  lower prices on pharmaceuticals.  Understand what  that means. The  Senator from Illinois held up a picture  of all  the countries  that have  low  prices  for drugs. Every one of them  have price controls, every one of them.  They have price controls. They say to  the company: Sell at the price we want  you to sell it at or you cannot sell it.  In Canada, yes, you pay a  lower  price. If the company does not take the  lower price, No. 1, they cannot sell  their drug in Canada. No. 2, if they do  not take the lower price, Canada can  go ahead and license someone in Canada to make it and infringe on their  patent.  What  choice  does  the  drugmaker  have? None. He is absolutely correct.  We in America subsidize that. He is absolutely right on that. There is no bone  of contention. The question is, If we  don’t, what are the consequences? The  consequences are very clear. There will  be a dramatic reduction in the amount  of research that is done. There will be  less new  drugs  coming  to market.  There will be less cures. There will be  less improvement of the quality of people’s lives. That is a tradeoff.  But to sit up here and say this is  somehow the big bad drug companies  against poor patients who cannot get  their drugs because of the expense of  the drugs here, we have to go to Canada to get them, is a false choice. The  choice is, giving that drug at a lower  price, yes; putting price controls in it.  If that is what the Senator from Illinois wants, he ought to offer an amendment. The choice is less research and  less cures in the future.  ",2002
320,,107,-0.459,200,2002-07-17,Mrs. CLAYTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring to your attention the momentous occasion of the 90th birthday of Mrs. Launa Banks Brewington of Greenville North Carolina. Mrs. Brewington was born in Pitt County on August 31st, 1912 to Oscar & Lena Banks. The 5th of 12 children, her family included eight brothers and three sisters. Only two of her siblings are still  living; Mrs. Lena R. Murrell-White and Mrs. Missouri (Lady) Wilkens. She married the late  Jesse Brewington of Greenville North Carolina in 1930. They lived and she still resides in the home that her father built in 1925. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1993. Although she and her husband did not have children of their own, they adopted her niece Bernice Banks Forbes and raised her as their own loving daughter. Mrs. Brewington is now the proud grandmother of  four children and great-grandmother to eight children. For 29 years, Mrs. Brewington worked in the Greenville City School system. After she retired, she still did not stop. She then joined the staff of East Carolina University becoming the first Black supervisor of the Custodial Department retiring after 10 years of service. During  the  90  years  of  her  life, Mrs. Brewington has exemplified  those attributes we all attempt to embrace. She is a caring, generous, dedicated, honest, and faithfully religious woman. She always received great joy in helping and caring for others. If anyone suffered with an illness, she was always there to help. The neighborhood children were also her children. She was always taking them in and caring for them. She has been a member of the Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church since 1937. Her  church activities  included singing in the church choir for over 50 years and acting as Treasurer for the choir, serving as President of the Missionary Board, President of the Senior Ladies Auxiliary, serving on the Trustee Board, President of the Pastor’s Aide organization, Chairman of  the Kitchen Committee, and serving on  the Pulpit Committee. In her community, she was the President of the Matrons Club which ministered to the bereaved  in  the community.  In addition, she was a member of the Morning Light Tent Lodge, serving as leader and was also elected as Queen of the Royal Degree Circle. Friends and family will gather in Hampton, Virginia  to  celebrate Mrs.  Launa  Banks Brewington’s 90th milestone. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me, our colleagues, Mrs. Brewington’s family and friends, and the city of Greenville in recognizing this momentous occasion of her 90th birthday. f HONORING THE FOX COMPANY, A MARINE CORPS RESERVE UNIT FROM UTAH HON.

321,,107,0.596,200,2002-07-17,Mr. CANNON.," Mr. Speaker, after the tragic events of September 11, Americans have shown their patriotism and support for the War on Terror in various ways, such as voting, volunteering and serving  in  the armed  forces. One such group of patriots  is  the men and women of the Fox Company, a Marine Corps Reserve unit  from my home State of Utah. These Marines were recently called to active duty and sent to Camp Pendleton, California, assigned to Homeland Security. They have left their families, friends, homes and careers to defend and protect us, standing as bulwark for our freedom. Today  I wish  to  thank  those men and women of the Fox Company for accepting that call of duty. These Marines have willingly put their lives on the line to defend the freedom that this country enjoys. Though they have not yet been deployed  to  fight  the enemy overseas, these Marines play a vital role in securing our safety and liberty. Their service and determination to uphold and defend our rights must not go unnoticed. They should be recognized and appreciated by all Utahns and all Americans. I would also like to recognize the families of these Marines. Their support, sacrifice and love are the driving force and inspiration behind the Fox Company. These Utah families are not only facing the absence of a father, husband, mother or wife, but also  financial hardship due to the significantly decreased income from established careers so they may serve full time. This is no easy task, but one that  these  families willingly  take on as  their part in operation Enduring Freedom. I commend  the courage and patriotism of the Marine Reserve Fox Company. They are admirably performing an honorable job to defend and support the flag at a time when evil enemies are attempting to tear down the institutions  that protect  the  freedom Americans have worked long to build. We should all be thankful for the sacrifice and work of the Fox Company. f HONORING HAROLD OSHRY HON. PETER DEUTSCH OFFLORIDA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, July 17, 2002 ",2002
322,,107,-0.324,200,2002-07-17,Mr. DEUTSCH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. Harold Oshry, a noted humanitarian, a civic-minded businessman and an exemplary leader. Born in Chelsea, Massachusetts in 1918, Mr. Oshry graduated Magna Cum Laude  from Bowdoin College  in 1940. Shortly  thereafter, he proudly answered  the call of his nation and served as a captain in the 32nd Special Services Unit of the Eighth Army Air Force during World War II, where he was awarded six battle stars for his courage in the Normandy Invasion and other crucial European Campaigns. After his discharge, he married Claire Herman and relocated to New York City where he began a successful business career. In 1955, Mr. Oshry founded a transportation holding company, which later became known as Sandgate Corporation. This  immensely successful venture afforded Mr. Oshry the opportunities and resources to make a significant impact on many people’s lives. His most noted accomplishments were seen in his efforts to further  cultural understanding  through education. Mr. Oshry was an influential member of the New York United  Jewish Associations Federation where he demonstrated his commitment to the public’s understanding of Jewish culture. In 1976, he established the Harry Oshry Scholarship Fund at Bowdoin College in honor of his father. Additionally, Mr. Oshry’s generous contributions allowed Ben Gurion University in Israel to endow a chair in Aquatic Microbiology Federations. As a  final  tribute, Mr. Oshry was honored a week before his death by the Yeshiva Shaar Ephraim, a center for Jewish Studies in Monsey, NY, for his generosity and philanthropic pursuits. Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a truly special occasion  for me  to honor Harold Oshry, who worked  to  foster  a  better  understanding among  the world’s citizens. His unparalleled dedication to this cause serves as an example for us all. Mr. Oshry  is survived by his wife Claire Oshry of Tamarac, FL,  in addition  to his daughters Suzanne Oshry of Pacific Palisades, CA, Meryl Evens of Point Reyes Station, CA, and son Michael Oshry of Hewlitt Harbor, NY. Mr. Oshry also is survived by his sister Sally Adelson of Delray Beach, FL and brother George Oshry of Brookline, MA, along with seven grandchildren. f PRESIDENT’S  EXECUTIVE  ORDER GRANTING CITIZENSHIP TO U.S. SERVICEMEN ON ACTIVE DUTY HON.

324,Senate,107,0.403,5,2002-09-03,Mr. THOMPSON.," Mr. President, it is  indeed true that today we begin consideration of the most significant reorganization of  the executive branch  in  over 50 years. Not since the creation of  the Department of Defense and the creation of the national intelligence apparatus in the National Security Act of  1947 has the Senate considered such a  massive restructuring of Federal agencies.  Just as World War II and the start of  the cold war demonstrated the need to  reorganize our defense and intelligence  establishment, the terrorist attacks of  September 11 demonstrate the need to  reorganize our homeland security establishment to address the threat of  terrorism and other types of asymmetric warfare against our country and  against our people.  I start by acknowledging and thanking Senator LIEBERMAN, the manager of  the bill, for his leadership on this issue.  He was an early supporter of legislation to reorganize the executive branch  to confront emerging threats against  our country. He recognized what needed to be done and has worked hard to  get us to the point where we are today.  While we have some disagreements in  some important areas, in the end we  both believe that the creation of a new  Department of Homeland Security is  needed to make this country safe. Our  Nation and the Senate also owe a debt  of gratitude to the Members of the  Hart-Rudman  and Gilmore Commissions. Recommendations  from  both  commissions have contributed greatly  to our efforts. Indeed, the proposal before us owes much to the insight and  thoughtful  recommendations  of  our  former colleagues, Senators Gary Hart  and Warren Rudman.  This legislation is one of the centerpieces of our country’s overall homeland security strategy. What we do  here will have lasting effects on our  Nation. It will certainly outlive us.

325,Senate,107,-0.22,47,2002-09-03,Mr. CLELAND.," Madam President, 27  years ago the National Medical Association and other prominent organizations endorsed the development of the  Medical School at Morehouse College  in Atlanta, GA. This came in light of  studies that revealed,  first, a severe  shortage  of  African-American  and  other minority  physicians  in  the  United States, particularly in Georgia,  and,  second,  that African-Americans  suffered disproportionately from major  diseases. Since  its  inception, Morehouse School of Medicine has worked  to help solve our Nation’s healthcare  crisis by graduating top-quality physicians who dedicate themselves to serving the more than 32 million people in  this country who live in medically neglected communities. Seventy percent  of Morehouse School of Medicine graduates practice in underserved communities.  The entering M.D. class has grown  from 24 students in 1978 to its current  44. Each year, more than 20,000 Georgians who are disadvantaged are served  by approximately 30 community health  promotion projects sponsored by Morehouse  School  of Medicine.  These  projects include prevention initiatives  associated with substance abuse, teen  pregnancy, geriatric services, cancer,  lead poisoning, and violence prevention. In addition, Morehouse School of  Medicine faculty provides about 75,000  patient encounters per year in community clinics throughout metropolitan  Atlanta. The student body of Morehouse School of Medicine continues to  excel. For the past few years, 100 percent of the school’s family medicine  residents  have  passed  their  board  exams in their first sitting.  These accomplishments grow out of  strong leadership, beginning with the  vision of Dr. Hugh M. Gloster of Morehouse College and Morehouse School of  Medicine’s  founding  dean  and  first  president, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, and  continuing with Dr. James R. Gavin,  the current president. Since its inception in 1975, Morehouse School of Medicine has established a four-year medical education program, a master of  public health program, a Ph.D. program in the biomedical sciences, seven  residency programs, and several centers of excellence. These centers  include the Neuroscience Institute, the  Cardiovascular Research Institute, and  the NASA/Space Medicine  and Life  Science Research Center, the first of  its kind at a minority medical institution.  Today we celebrate the new home of  one of those centers of excellence, the  National Center for Primary Care. This  state-of-the-art facility will house an  exceptional  team  of  administrators,  educators, and researchers devoted to  eliminating health disparities in this  country.  Georgia should, indeed, be grateful  for this new jewel in our crown. Under  the guidance of former Surgeon General David Satcher, Director of the National Center for Primary Care, this  healthcare think tank is poised to educate and  illuminate  for decades  to  come.∑  f  ON  THE  DEDICATION  OF  THE  YSMAEL R. VILLEGAS MIDDLE  SCHOOL,  RIVERSIDE,  CALIFORNIA  ∑",2002
326,House,107,0.554,2,2002-09-09,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to thank my colleague from California  (Mr. ROHRABACHER) for his continuing  support  in  recognizing  this anniversary. NPR had a great tribute to the  general this morning which I listened  to. I think it is altogether appropriate  that  the gentleman do  this on  the  House floor, of course, and I want to  thank him.  Mr. Speaker, on another matter, I  rise to deal with something that  is  more close to home, and that is dealing  with something I am involved with in  telecommunications. I am urging my  colleagues to support a bill that I introduced  to  eliminate  impediments  that  restrict  the ability of  certain  wireless telecommunication providers  to, I think, meet the urgent need of the  consumers. The bill has bipartisan support  and  the  support  of  the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and  the Internet on which I serve.  I am pleased, Mr. Speaker, that a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal supports my actions on this matter, and I will be providing the Wall  Street editorial to be made a part of  the RECORDand part of my speech.  The affected providers are the successful bidders  for wireless spectrum  that  the  Federal  Communications  Commission auctioned off in Auction  No. 35. Some of the spectrum had previously been licensed to companies, including NextWave Personal Communications, whose bankruptcy  filings,  and subsequent failure to pay amounts  due to the FCC for their licenses, led to  the cancellation of those licenses. The  FCC  subsequently  reclaimed  the  licenses and  reauctioned  them off  in  Auction No. 35 for about $16 billion. In June 2001, the D.C. Circuit held that ‘ ‘the  Commission  violated  the  provision  of  the  Bankruptcy Code that prohibits governmental  entities from revoking debtors’ licenses solely  for failure to pay debts dischargeable in bankruptcy. ’ ’ In August 2001, after the issuance of  that court’s mandate,  the FCC  restored  the  NextWave licenses to active status. More recently, the Supreme Court granted the FCC ’s  petition  for a writ of certiorari  to review  the  D.C. Circuit’s  judgment. The Supreme Court  will not hear argument in the case until the fall  of 2002 and is unlikely to announce a decision  until the spring of 2003. If the Court reverses  the D.C. Circuit ’s decision, there will be further  litigation on remand in D.C. Circuit to resolve  issues that court did not reach in its first decision. As a result, there is not likely to be a  final resolution of the status of the NextWave  licenses any time soon, and the FCC therefore  will not be in a position to deliver licenses to  the winners of Auction No. 35, until three or  more years from the time the auction was concluded.  Now, the status of NextWave’s  license has been the subject of extended  litigation in not only the bankruptcy  court, but the United States Court of  Appeals  for the Second Circuit, the  United States Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia Circuit, and soon  to be, the Supreme Court of the United  States.  Although the FCC recently returned  most of the downpayment funds previously deposited by all these successful bidders, it continues to hold, without interest, Mr. Speaker, substantial  sums, equal to 3 percent of the total  amount of the winning bids. It apparently intends to hold these sums indefinitely.  Despite the lengthy delay in delivering the licenses, moreover, the FCC  takes the position that the successful  bidders remain obligated, on a mere 10day notice, to pay the full amount of  their successful bids if and when the  FCC, at some unknown future date, establishes its right to deliver those licenses.  Now,  I  think, as  the Wall Street  Journal points out, this is grossly unfair to those who bid on these licenses  and did so in good faith. Companies  calibrate  their  bids  on  the  understanding of the auction, implicit in any  commercial arrangement, that the delivery of the licenses will occur in a  reasonable time  following these auctions. That expectation  is especially  crucial in the context of spectrum licenses. Given the recent volatility we  have seen  in the market prices  for  spectrum, we  can  understand  that  there would be some action by the FCC  after the auction.  Moreover, it is particularly burdensome to some companies to have the  FCC hold even a small portion of their  enormous downpayment without any  interest on these amounts. It is not  done in the private sector; it should  not be done in the government. They  are paying no interest on these deposits for extended periods of time.  In addition, winning bidders are obligated, as I mentioned, on very short  notice to pay the remaining $16 billion  they bid for the license at issue. Obviously, this adversely affects their capacity to serve the needs of their customers, because they must have this  capital always on hand and they cannot use it for long-term benefits for  business. This need to keep itself in a  position to fulfill that obligation at an  indefinite future date impedes its ability to take, as I mentioned, interim  steps for building their own businesses.  The FCC’s failure to respond appropriately to alleviate these serious burdens, I believe, deserves the public interest. That is why I have dropped bill  H.R. 4738. It addresses this problem in  two ways, Mr. Speaker.  First, it requires the FCC promptly  to refund to the winning bidders the  full remaining amount of their deposits  and their downpayments. Second,  it  gives each winning bidder an opportunity to elect, within 15 days after enactment, to relinquish its rights and to  be relieved of all further obligations  under Auction No.  35. Those who  choose to retain their rights and obligations under Auction No. 35 will nonetheless be entitled to a return of their  deposits and downpayments in the interim period. If and when the FCC is in  a position to deliver the  license at  issue to those who remain obligated,  they will be required to pay the full  amount of their bid in accordance with  the FCC’s existing regulations. Those  who elect to terminate their rights and  obligations under this auction will be  free to pursue their business interests  without the burdens under which they  must labor.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this timely and much-needed  legislation, and I appreciate the Wall  Street Journal bringing to the attention of the Nation this very important  problem, and I also hereby submit for  VerDate Sep 04 2002  02:27 Sep 10, 2002 Jkt 099061 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K09SE7.002 H09PT1 ",2002

I served with Senator Jewell  from  1991  to  1993 as Congressman DAVIS  noted, who, by the way, is an Arkansas  native. He left Arkansas when he was  19, but he has never forgotten where he  came from.  It was my pleasure also to serve with  Senator Jewell in the State Senate. He  certainly made history by being the  first African American since Reconstruction to be elected to the State  Senate. He was the first African American president pro tem and he became  acting Governor. In Arkansas the way  our Constitution works is if the Governor or lieutenant governor leaves the  State, they lose their power as Governor, so Senator Jerry Jewell became  acting Governor.  He had a very colorful civil rights  history. I attended his funeral a couple  weeks ago, and Dr. Roosevelt Brown  told this story how when they were  young men the efforts to try to desegregate a  swimming pool during  the  summertime in Little Rock that basically involved Senator Jewell talking  to the young person at the gate and  two  or  three  other  young African  American men running past and jumping in the pool and immediately all the  white folks jumping out, the kind of  story now that we think is humorous  but at the time was deadly serious. It  was a sign of his courage that he participated in those kinds of events.  The  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  DAVIS) and I want to acknowledge the  passing of Senator Jewell, the part of  history he played in Arkansas, and the  loss to his friends and family. f  ",2002

We are all committed to acting decisively to  win the war on terrorism, and President Bush  has had my full support in that effort. In fact,  Congress voted as one voice after September  11th to give the President both moral support  and authority to prosecute the war on terror  and to bring those responsible for the attacks  to justice.  I am also concerned that the proposed ‘ ‘preemptive war’  against Iraq will divert the nation ’s attention and limited resources from our  war on  terrorism as well as  from domestic  needs, such as building up the economy and  a prescription drug benefit for our seniors.

Smithfield has a population of 6,584 and is  approximately 10.1 square miles in size. Located on the banks of the Pagan River in Isle  of Wight County, Smithfield, Virginia was incorporated in 1752 from land donated and surveyed by Arthur Smith  IV. Smithfield offers  residents a small-town atmosphere, a great  school  system,  affordable  housing,  and  a  beautiful historic downtown.  While numerous Tidewater  localities  suffered during the Revolutionary War, the War  of 1812, and  the Civil War, Smithfield was  spared the devastation. Since the Town’s inception, Smithfield has worked hard to maintain its architectural heritage and small town  charm.  The rise of Smithfield is most often credited  to its world famous ham industry. Know as the  ‘Ham Capital of the World,’  no visit to Smithfield can be considered complete without enjoying a quality ham.  To mark  the Town’s anniversary, on September 28th, the residents of Smithfield will be  making the largest ham biscuit in the world.  The ham biscuit bill will be eight fee in diameter and large enough to feed 1,752 people. I  hope the Guinness Book of World Records will  recognize  the biscuit as  the worlds  largest  ham biscuit.  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the citizens of  Smithfield, Virginia,  as  they  celebrate  the  Town’s 250th anniversary and wish them continued success and prosperity in the years to  come. While rich in history and in the beauty  if its surroundings, the greatest part of Smithfield is the people who live there. It is truly an  honor and privilege to represent the people of  the Town of Smithfield  in  the United States  House of Representatives. f A PROCLAMATION RECOGNIZING  MARK DUGAN HON. ROBERT. W.

346,,107,-0.556,107,2002-09-09,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Point Reyes National Seashore on the  occasion of  its 40th anniversary. On September 13, 1962, President John F. Kennedy  signed into law P.L. 87– 657 ‘ to save and preserve,  for  the purpose of public  recreation,  benefit, and inspiration, a portion of the diminishing seashore of the United States that remains undeveloped.’ Conceived as a park in the 1930s, the hard  work of dedicated people made Point Reyes  National Seashore a reality many years later.  Today the Seashore, located an hour’s drive  from the urban San Francisco Bay Area, is enjoyed by over 2.5 million visitors annually. It  comprises over 71,000 acres  including estuaries,  beaches,  coastal  grasslands,  salt  marshes, and coniferous forests and contains  45 percent of North American avian species  and 18 percent of California’s plant species.  The Park is the best site for whale watching  on the West Coast with as many as 200 migrating whales sited per day.  In 1988 Point  Reyes National Seashore was  internationally  recognized by the United Nations Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  for  its examples of  the world’s  major ecosystem types and named the Central  California Coast Biosphere Reserve.  Lying just across the San Andrea Fault from  the rest of North America, the Point Reyes peninsula  is also a geological  land  in motion  which has moved over 300 miles in the last  100 million years. Visitors to the Park’s Earthquake Trail can see the results of this activity  from near the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.  The cultural history of Point Reyes dates  back 5,000 years to a time when the Coast  Miwok Indians inhabited the peninsula. Over  120 Miwok archeological sites exist within the  park. In 1579 Sir Francis Drake was probably  the first European in the area, landing on the  shores of  the Bay which bears his name.  Lighthouses and  lifesaving stations, several  still available  to visitors, were established  in  the 19th century in response to the many shipwrecks in the treacherous waters off the coast.  In the early 19th century Mexican land grantees established ranchos, and today ranching  operations  continue  in  the Park’s pastoral  zones.  Today,  under  the  direction  of  Superintendent Don Neubacher, the Park successfully balances the needs of visitors and ranchers with the preservation of ecosystems and  historical sites.  Mr. Speaker, Point Reyes National Seashore ranks among the top twenty most-visited  National Park service areas in the country and  exemplifies  the Park Service’s mission  to  ‘care for special places saved by the American people so  that all may experience our  heritage.’ f PAYING TRIBUTE TO ANDREA  ARAGON HON.

We now have  eight,  count  them,  eight appropriations bills that have not  been passed, with 4 days remaining. We  could be working on that legislation  right now. So it is really quite amazing  that the Republican leadership would  squander its opportunity to make real  progress on a legislative agenda, real  progress on addressing the problems  and concerns of the American people  by  taking up  issues  that are completely under their control right now.  The Democrats, given our minority  position, have limited ability to control the agenda, so we have a discharge  petition right now to take up a piece of  real legislation that would reduce the  cost of prescription drugs, H.R. 5272.  This is a bill that would stop the gaming of the system and would allow real  competition  so  that we  could  find  lower prices for prescription drugs in  this country. This is something that  people really care about. Let us do  something real and stop this chitchat. ",2002
348,House,107,0.122,13,2002-09-19,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I would remind the preceding speaker  that the Senate has not acted on welfare reform and the Senate has not  acted on prescription drugs. The House  has reauthorized welfare reform and  the House has passed a very strong bill  providing prescription drugs to seniors  as an entitlement. It is very disturbing  that 12 days before this bill expires, before the welfare reform bill that has reduced poverty among children more  dramatically than any change in public  policy in my lifetime, that it could languish unauthorized. The House has  acted. The Senate has not. The fact is  there are 12 days and that this Congress cannot complete work on welfare  reform alone.  Mr.  Speaker, welfare  reform  has  helped women and children in America.  It has been a good thing in their lives.  We need it. For the preceding speaker  to have said that we have cut work  education  and  training  is  simply  wrong. It is true we do not allow 12  months of vocational education, but  for the first time we not only allow 4  months  of  any kind  of  education,  whether it is vocational or not, but  then 2 full days for 5 years. So we allow  ongoing education which not only can  help you prepare yourself for a job but  through which then you can develop  the skills to advance your career and  move up the salary and career ladder.  It is the most generous inclusion of  education and training and opportunities  in welfare reform that we have  ever passed.

350,House,107,0.54,20,2002-09-19,Mr. COX.," Mr. Speaker, I would observe  in  response  to  the  previous  speaker that the House has acted on  prescription drugs. We have passed a  prescription drug bill here to add a prescription  drug  benefit  for Medicare  beneficiaries. The President has said he  will sign it and it awaits action in the  Senate where the bill is not moving.  The same is true of the death tax.  The House has acted. We have already,  Democrats and Republicans, voted on a  bill by majority vote here and sent it  to the Senate. It is the bill the President has asked for and he will sign it.  It makes permanent the repeal that is  already in existing law. We repealed  the death tax originally because a majority of the Congress and a big super  majority of the American people recognize that the virtual confiscation of an  individual’s after-tax lifetime savings  is wrong and immoral.  It was said just a moment ago that  this somehow affects only the rich. To  the contrary, the problem has been the  forced liquidation of small businesses,  and the people that are laid off, who  lose their jobs at ranches and farms  and small businesses across the country are not the rich. In fact, the rich  person is the only one who does not  care because he is dead by definition,  but, rather, they pay a 100 percent tax  because they lose their jobs, they lose  everything. By destroying jobs, by destroying small businesses, the death  tax has properly earned  the opprobrium of the American people.  Now, in the other body they slipped  in a mickey. Repeal expires somehow  in 10 years. That 10 years is coming  closer so it is January 1, 2011 that we  will have the death tax right back  again, even  though  it has been  repealed. That  is why  the New York  Times referred to this as the ‘‘Throw  Mama From the Train Act.’’  Whether you are  for or against a  death tax, nobody can be in support of  this provision that has a repeal and  then springs back to life in 10 years.  The House has acted and now both the  House and the American people want  the Senate to act on permanent death  tax repeal.

This  is  nothing more than the Republicans pandering  to their wealthy contributors six weeks before  the election. How timely!  This resolution is a complete waste of time.  The House has already passed a bill to provide permanent repeal of the estate tax earlier  this year, despite my opposition. Now, my  constituents back home will ask. ‘ ‘Why did you  need yet another resolution for something that  the House has already addressed?’  The only  truthful answer is that the Republicans can’t  agree among themselves on how to proceed  with spending bills this year so they are padding the floor schedule with meaningless drivel  like this to make it appear that Congress is  doing its job. The American people ought to  be outraged!  Rather  than addressing  the critical appropriations bills to keep the government running,  the GOP would rather debate this non-binding,  meaningless  resolution.  If  the GOP doesn’t  want to work on appropriations bills, we have  40 million disabled and elderly who depend on  Medicare and have been  clamoring  for a  Medicare prescription drug benefit. We could  address  that  issue. Or what about  the solvency of Social Security? there are critical domestic issues facing this Congress— and facing millions of Americans— that ought  to be  addressed today.  Repeal of the estate tax will only help the  wealthiest one percent of those who receive  inheritance, or around 23,000 estates per  year. Congress is seeing declining federal income receipts; is being asked to fund a pending war in Iraq; improve security here at home;  and must still address the needs of working  families. We have much bigger issues than a  tax  that will affect 23,000 wealthy estates.  Let’s take our oath of office a bit more seriously and get back to the issues that matter.

In particular, I want to acknowledge  the Office of the Attending Physician  and the health care professionals in his  office who by their quick actions and  early  intervention  prevented  actual  cases of anthrax within the Capitol Hill  complex. They responded to and managed  the  largest bioterrorism event  ever, providing direction locally that  was used nationwide and even worldwide.  It should be noted that the anthrax  letter event proved to be the largest  public  health  crisis  in  the United  States since the smallpox outbreak in  New York City in the 1940s. The incredible response by the Attending Physician and his staff as they evaluated and  treated over 7,000 people ensured the  continuity of two branches of government, the Congress and the Supreme  Court.  Mr. Speaker, I hope this bill we are  introducing today can move quickly  through the House and be passed before  October 14, the 1-year anniversary of  the anthrax letter arriving in Senator  DASCHLE’s office.  f  U.N.

Each year, thousands of rehabilitation providers and health and human services agencies join together during the third week in September to celebrate the powers of rehabilitation and share the message that through rehabilitation there is hope, achievement, and success. To answer the need to educate people  throughout the United States, Allied Services  healthcare  system  first  celebrated National  Rehabilitation Week in 1976. What began as  a small scale  local awareness campaign 26  years ago has steadily grown in scope over  the years.  The Rehabilitation Unit at Roxborough Memorial Hospital is dedicated to serving the rehabilitative needs of the Roxborough community. Rehabilitative  therapy allows many victims of injury and illness to achieve independence and improved quality of life. Individuals  with disabilities have  found hope, spirit, and  dignity  through  the service of  rehabilitation  medicine.  Mr. Speaker, I commend the Rehabilitation  Unit at Roxborough Memorial Hospital for their  tireless dedication to help patients work to regain  strength,  confidence, and daily  living  skills after a disabling injury or illness. f PRESCRIPTION DRUGS  HON. JUANITA MILLENDER-McDONALD  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 18, 2002 Ms. MILLENDER-MCDONALD. Mr. Speaker,  our Nation and its seniors are experiencing a  crisis regarding Medicare benefits and specifically prescription drugs. This issue is of vital  concern to them. Furthermore, in my Congressional District, my  constituents  consistently  raise questions  to me about what  looms on  the horizon as it relates to them obtaining a  prescription drug benefit, because the cost of  prescription drugs is so high.  At  the current  time, seniors on  fixed  incomes are confronted with escalating prices  for medication and private companies are offering benefits  that are grossly  inadequate.  Meanwhile,  the majority’s proposal will  force  seniors to shop for and buy a private insurance plan.  The truth is, seniors are pawns in the corporate  and  political  game  of  prescription  drugs. They are being forced to choose between buying  food or  their medication. No  matter what choice they make, their health is  still imperiled. It is unfair and unconscionable  that our seniors are being treated in this manner. They deserve far better treatment.  Democrats support a Medicare prescription  drug benefit  that covers all seniors under  Medicare, a benefit  that would be voluntary  and universal. I fully support the Democratic  proposal, and I also support the proposals put  forward by AARP.  If we  look at  the  facts and put aside  the  rhetoric, the facts are clear. Soaring prices for  prescription drugs are putting medicine out of  reach for millions of seniors.  We Democrats support a Medicare prescription drug benefit that covers all seniors. Every  senior would  have  access,  regardless  of  where he or she lives and the amount of their  income.  However, the House Republican prescription  drug plan is a sham proposal that provides no  real guarantee at all. Their plan will not cover  all seniors. In fact, the benefit will be so limited that it won’t be worthwhile for many middle-income seniors  to enroll. Moreover,  the  Republican plan forces seniors to shop for and  buy a private insurance plan, making it a hassle for older Americans who will have to contend with insurance plans that come and go.  Democrats know  that  this model doesn’t  work. The model didn’t work  in 1965, and  that’s why we created Medicare. Even the insurance companies say  it won’t work— the  Health Insurance Association of America has  said that they will not offer drug-only policies.  Simply put, the Republican plan is guaranteed  to fail.  Let me also emphasize that the Republican  prescription drug plan does absolutely nothing  to slow prescription drug prices  from continuing their upward spiral.  It is time for my majority colleagues to come  clean. Now is the time to pass a meaningful  prescription drug plan that uses Medicare to  make drugs affordable and which provides a  universal, voluntary benefit  for all seniors.  If  we closely examine the proposals put forward  by  the majority,  it  is abundantly clear what  they are doing. They say ‘ ‘Lower the cost of  prescription drugs now,’  but  that really only  translates to ‘ take credit for minimal discounts  that are already available.’ The facts are crystal clear, the so-called discounts will be nothing more than minimal discounts  from programs  that are readily available  in  the marketplace  today. Furthermore,  these programs advertise  far better savings  than what they actually offer.  Another mantra being repeated constantly is  ‘guarantee all senior citizens prescription drug  coverage,’  but the translation is ‘ ‘promise seniors an inadequate drug benefit offered by private insurance companies.’ At the end of the day, when seniors have to  check their bank balances, there is no getting  around  the  reality  that an  inadequate drug  benefit offered by private insurance companies  is really no guarantee whatsoever.  Early  reports  indicate  that  the Republican  plan has major gaps and  their prescription  drug plan will  leave Medicare beneficiaries  100% financially liable for thousands of dollars  in drug costs. At the same time insurers can  charge whatever  they want and discriminate  against  the most vulnerable,  including  those  with disabilities.  What we must do as Democrats is improve  Medicare by providing more choices and savings, not by shifting costs to seniors and limiting the choice of providers.  My seniors are telling me that they think the  Republican proposals will not result  in more  health care providers or more savings. They  express deeply held fears that the end result  will be a negative shift in costs to seniors, and  a conversion of Medicare into a voucher program in which seniors would get a fixed government contribution and in turn would be told  to choose a health plan they can afford.  For all  the  talk about strengthening Medicare for the future, seniors around this great  nation are concluding that the ultimate goal is  to undermine Medicare by forcing seniors into  private  insurance and HMOs  for drug coverage.  Now is the time to provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Democrats are ready,  willing and able to provide seniors with a benefit they desperately need. Our colleagues on  the opposite of the aisle need to roll up their  sleeves and work with us. We owe a debt of  gratitude to seniors who have helped to make  America great and strong. The least we can  do is deliver on our commitment to help keep  them healthy by providing a prescription drug  benefit. f PAYING TRIBUTE TO: JIM AND  HELEN BERNAL  HON.

She  recently  received the 2002 Spirit of Service Honor Award  from the Michigan Assisted Living Association  for her outstanding dedication and commitment to community-based services.  When Joyce Keller became executive director of JARC at age 26, the organization had  one  home,  three  employees,  and  served  seven individuals with developmental disabilities.  Their  annual  budget was  $40,000.  Today, JARC  is an $8 million agency  that  serves over 150 adults in a variety of residential settings, provides support services to over  300  families with a disabled child or  family  member still living at home, and employs over  200 staff members. In her 25th year as executive director, Ms. Keller continues to oversee  and ensure the highest quality of service, as  well as the raising of nearly $2 million annually  in private contributions and a $13 million endowment fund.  Ms. Keller has assumed extensive and substantial leadership roles, serving on the President’s Committee on Mental Retardation and  the Governor’s Community Health Advisory  Council in Michigan. In addition to her recent  award from the Michigan Assisted Living Association, Ms. Keller has been honored with  several distinguished awards over the course  of  her  career,  including  being  named  Michiganian of the Year by the Detroit News.  Mr. Speaker, with Joyce’s  tenacity, dynamism and creativity, JARC has become one of  the  largest and well-respected organizations  for residential care in the country. She is passionate about honoring the dignity of the people JARC serves and enabling  them  to  live  rich and purposeful lives. Joyce Keller is a relentless advocate for the right of every individual to be valued and respected in our society and I congratulate her on the occasion of  receiving  the 2002 Spirit of Service Honor  Award. She is truly a worthy recipient. f PAYING TRIBUTE TO RUDOLPH  CRESPIN  HON. SCOTT McINNIS  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 19, 2002 ",2002
357,,107,0.403,146,2002-09-19,Mr. ISAKSON.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  congratulate Lucy Hall,  founder of  the Mary  Hall Freedom House in Atlanta. Lucy was recently selected as one of  ten people  from  across the country to receive the nation’s most  prestigious award for community health leadership from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  Her  award  includes  a  grant  of  $120,000 to continue her community efforts.  Lucy founded the Mary Hall Freedom House  in memory of her mother, who she lost to alcoholism at the age of six. Freedom House is  a  residential  recovery program  to help addicted mothers break the pattern of substance  abuse. The program provides women with intensive chemical dependency  treatment and  vocational training.  She launched the Freedom House in 1996  while working as a housekeeper and volunteering as a counselor in Atlanta. Lucy used  $5,000 in seed money from her employer to  get the effort started. From this modest beginning,  the program has grown  to serve 250  women a year, many of whom are referred  from the court system and homeless shelters.  The program, which started out as six beds  in a  three-bedroom apartment, now has 70  beds in 26 apartments— and Freedom House  now has a staff of over 30 people.  Lucy realized early on that many addicted  women with small children had no access to  residential  treatment because most recovery  programs did not admit  children. So,  she  made Freedom House the only residential recovery program in Atlanta for women with children. Now, the children take part in prevention  lessons to teach them how to avoid becoming  substance abusers themselves. She also recently opened the Heavenly Angels’ Day Care  Center to provide care for children while their  mothers attend  treatment and  training programs.

358,,107,-0.244,153,2002-09-19,Mr. MALONEY of Connecticut.," Mr. Speaker,  I urge my colleagues to support the Consumer  Rental Purchase Agreement Act, H.R. 1701.  The bill before us is the product of the many  months of hard work by several Members. I  want to especially thank Congressman WALand my Financial Service Committee colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  their constructive input in producing a bipartisan, consumer friendly piece of legislation.  Let me make it clear, this bill establishes a  federal floor for Rent-to-Own disclosures and  consumer rights, and preserves states’options  to regulate costs and other disclosures. That  is, States can still apply further economic and  substantive  safeguards,  such as  regulating  maximum rental costs, allowable fees, and fair  collection practices should they decide to do  so.  In April of 2000, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a staff report that addresses  many of  the  issues surrounding  the rent-toown industry. Generally speaking, the FTC report concluded that clear and comprehensive  disclosures of the rental-purchase transaction  would benefit both  the  industry and  consumers. In that report, the FTC made some  recommendations regarding the types of disclosure  that would benefit consumers. The  ‘Consumer Rental Purchase Agreement Act’ is an effort to begin to implement those recommendations.  I think that everyone will agree that giving  consumers the information they need to make  informed decisions is both good public policy  and ultimately good economic policy as well.  The consumer safeguards provided in this legislation include the prohibition of certain fees,  improved  consumer  disclosures,  expanded  civil  liability, prohibition of abusive practices,  and the preservation of existing rights.  H.R. 1701 requires several clear and conspicuous disclosures  that assure merchants  will not present information in such a way that  conceals or misleads consumers as to the true  cost of the transaction. The proposal includes  a plain language requirement for use in contracts. Specifically,  the bill  requires  that all  merchandise bear a label or tag that discloses  specific  cost and merchandise  information,  such as the price to purchase the merchandise for cash, the rental payment amount, the  total number of payments  to acquire ownership, and the total cost of ownership. Additionally, H.R. 1701 requires  that price  tags and  label disclosures (as well as contracts) include  the total cost for ownership, which consists of  the sum of all rental payments and any mandatory  fees or charges, per  the FTC report  recommendation. The bill also  requires  that  price tags and labels (and contracts) identify  whether merchandise is new or used.  The Consumer Rental Purchase Agreement  Act also prohibits the imposition of any special  fees to acquire ownership, including a prohibition on balloon payments. The bill prohibits  merchants from charging more than one late  fee for a delinquent rental payment, or charge  for an unpaid late fee. This will ensure that  consumers are not charged with unfair or  over-burdensome penalties and fees for simply missing a payment.  Importantly, H.R. 1701 clarifies civil liabilities  protections  for consumers  in Rent  to Own  transactions. H.R. 1701 expands civil liability  and penalties  to allow actions based on a  ‘pattern or practice’  of advertising violations.  The bill explicitly provides for civil action and  expanded penalties  for enforcement by  the  FTC and State attorneys general, based on a  pattern or practice of violations by a merchant.  Additionally, the bill ties criminal and civil liability and penalties  for violations  to  the requirements of  the Truth  in Lending Act and  Consumer Leasing Act.  Mr. Speaker, this bill establishes an important federal floor for consumer protection, and  create a  framework  for additional consumer  protection in the future. In sum, this legislation  will give consumers the information they need  to make informed decisions. It will also create  a uniform  regulatory baseline  that will help  with  the growth of  the  industry and  its contributions  to our economy.  I urge my colleagues to support this far-sighted legislation. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. FRANK MASCARA  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 19, 2002 ",2002

361,House,107,0.426,32,2002-09-26,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding me time.  We on the Committee on the Judiciary have been wrestling with this issue  for many years and have had many different proposals cross our desks on this  very same theme. What brings us to  the floor now is that when we were  first considering it the problems were  terrible. Now the problems are more  than terrible, almost unbearable.  Every day in Pennsylvania, just like  in your home States, you hear anecdotes about the giving up of a practice  by a physician or the constriction of  services to be rendered at a hospital or  actually the closing of a hospital, all  due to the rising cost of insurance premiums and the awards granted on behalf of plaintiffs across the board.  What is so good about the plan we  have in front of us is, as the gentleman  from Wisconsin was able to articulate,  that this puts no caps at all on the economic damages. As a matter of fact,  the testimony that we had from the  Californians who testified as to the  system that is extant in their State  was that even though health care costs  are rising and that they must consider  that in the awards that are granted in  California, the rising health care costs,  even though they go up, are going up  incrementally, and the cap on the noneconomic damages remains the same,  thus preserving the very root of this  kind of legislation. It is to allow physicians and hospitals to remain in place  across the spectrum of medical services. Why? Because  their  economic  damages of their own, caused by the  high  insurance  premiums  and  high  awards visited against them, would be  retarded by this legislation. It would  not cure the matter, but it would retard their financial difficulties.  If we can retard their financial difficulties, we give them reason to stay  in place, to leave their practice thriving in a particular sector in my State  and in yours. It would allow hospitals  to be able to budget in such a way,  with the shrinking cost of insurance  that we hope that this brings about, to  be able to extend services or remain in  place over a long period of time, where  otherwise, with  the high costs now  seen across the Nation, they are incapable of maintaining their own level  of services. So this is the time to bring  about a great reform.  I remember in 1995 we were on the  floor with a different version of this  bill and many of us thought we had a  great chance of passing it. But, for one  reason or another, it did not occur. All  I do now is repeat that that was then  when the situation was very bad; today  it is much worse, and we have a chance  to strike a blow at this emergency  right now.  ",2002
362,House,107,-0.502,32,2002-09-26,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding me time.  So the Republicans say that they  have identified a big problem: Insurance premiums for physicians are skyrocketing, and we have to do something about it.  What is their solution? Just what the  insurance companies ordered for a solution: A cap on noneconomic damages at  $250,000; pain and suffering, all that,  $250,000. The juries are not even told  that the limit is $250,000, so they could  come back with a $1 million verdict,  but only $250,000 to the victim.  But their bill does not say that the  savings goes to physicians. No. They  have all the money go to the insurance  company executives.  Now, last night I made a request to  the Republicans that I be allowed to  make an amendment that says that  any amount of money that a jury renders above $250,000, let us say $1 million, that the court would then give  that money over to a court-appointed  trustee and the court-appointed trustee  would then ensure that the insurance  premiums  for  the physicians  inside  that area would be lowered.  The  Republicans  prohibited  that  from coming out here because  that  would guarantee that the physicians  would be the beneficiaries, not the insurance industry. And what is the problem? Well, the insurance company executives have a fiduciary relationship  to their shareholders, to their wives, to  their children, to maximize profits for  themselves. That is a legal responsibility.  If we are going to pass this bill and  limit the ability for victims to recover,  then the only justification should be  that physicians’ premiums go down,  and that is the one big missing link in  the Republican bill. There  is no requirement that the insurance companies lower the premiums for doctors,  and that is what the Democrats are  trying to do, to help the patients, to  help the doctors. And what is the Republican Party doing once again? They  are bringing out the agenda of the insurance industry.  If we have learned anything from the  accounting practices across this country, it is that it is impossible to know  where those savings would have gone. ",2002
363,House,107,-0.451,53,2002-09-26,Mr. SCOTT.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  conference report on H.R. 2215, the 21st  Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act. I want to  commend my  colleagues,  the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Chairman SENSENBRENNER) and the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. CONYERS), particularly  for their leadership in ensuring that we  have worked in a bipartisan, cooperative method  in developing this conference report.  It is because of that kind of leadership that we have for the first time in  over 20 years a bill to authorize the  programs and funding in the Department of Justice.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is based on the  provisions that both sides of the aisle  in both Chambers can agree on, rather  than provisions which divide us based  on  the disagreements. This  is especially true in the juvenile justice provisions in the bill.  For years, juvenile justice programs  and funding have been characterized in  both Chambers by contention and differences. In this bill are two juvenile  justice provisions, one developed in the  Committee on the Judiciary and one  developed in the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Both bills  were developed through bipartisan cooperation and agreement, in stark contrast  to  the contention and  rancor  which has deadlocked both Chambers  on the issue of juvenile justice in recent years.  I want to give special credit for the  hard work on this bill to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. SMITH), the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, and  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  GREENWOOD), who has worked for years  on juvenile justice issues.  Juvenile justice bills in the past have  been based on the advice of political  pollsters and consultants. These bills,  however, were developed based on advice of juvenile justice researchers, administrators,  judges,  psychologists,  educators, and other experts  in the  field.  The Committee on the Judiciary bill  provides for accountability of the juvenile to the law, as well as accountability of the juvenile justice system  to the juvenile and the public through  a program of graduated sanctions and  services.  States and  localities are provided  with resources to ensure that offenses  by juveniles are responded to with an  appropriate degree of punishment and/ or services, as the individual case requires, graduated and increasing in the  level of punishment or services with  any subsequent offenses until the problems bringing about such offenses are  resolved.  The education bill authorizes the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act for the first time in almost 6  years. We have maintained the core requirements of the act that serve to protect juveniles from abuse and that direct resources towards reducing overrepresentation of minorities in the system.  This reauthorization also provides resources through a delinquency prevention block grant designed to identify  at-risk children and to address difficulties which may  lead to  juvenile offenses  before  such  offenses  occur  through proven  juvenile delinquency  prevention programs.  The juvenile justice provision of the  report also contains a provision to ensure that the Office of Juvenile Justice  and Delinquency Prevention has continued responsibility for the oversight  and planning for the research, evaluation, and statistical functions of the office,  in addition  to grant and contracting authority for these functions.  The research and evaluation arm of  that office has been critical to the development of effective juvenile delinquency prevention programs, and this  reauthorization reaffirms its important  role within the office.  In sum, Mr. Speaker, the  juvenile  justice provisions of this bill will provide the necessary resources to effectively reduce juvenile delinquency and  hold juveniles accountable for any offenses they commit.  I am also pleased to see several other  items in the bill which are the result of  bipartisan cooperation. We converted a  temporary  judgeship  in  the Eastern  District of Virginia to a permanent  one, which is of critical importance to  the area that I represent.  I am also pleased to have worked to  include in the bill the bill introduced  by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  STUPAK), providing our brave law enforcement  officers with  bulletproof  vests, and another bill introduced by  the gentleman  from California  (Mr.  SCHIFF) to provide suitable tributes to  those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice protecting the public from criminals.  Mr. Speaker, there are provisions in  the bill which some would prefer would  not be there, and other provisions were  left out which some would have preferred were in the bill, but the bill represents a well-reasoned, bipartisan effort to fund important programs in the  Department of Justice. I would like to commend the Members on both sides of the aisle, and our  respective staffs in both Chambers, for  their hard work and accomplishments,  as well. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2002
364,House,107,0.312,53,2002-09-26,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, as a member of  the Committee of Conference on H.R. 2215,  the Department of Justice Authorization Act for  Fiscal Years 2002 and 2003, I strongly support adoption of the conference report.  I am particularly pleased that the conference  report authorizes $10,732,000 and an additional six  full-time employees  in  fiscal year  2003  for  the Community Relations Service  (CRS) of the Department of Justice. CRS is  an extraordinarily important office whose many  accomplishments have been too little noticed.  It has  the statutory  responsibility  to assist  communities around  the United States, and  particularly minority communities, in preventing  violence and  resolving conflicts arising  from  racial and ethnic tensions and to develop the  capacity  of  such  communities  to  address  these  conflicts without external assistance.  They do a wonderful job and we are fortunate  to have  them. The  increased authorization  ",2002
365,House,107,0.325,60,2002-09-26,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation before  the House, H.J. Res. 111,  is a continuing resolution, a CR, for fiscal year  2003, and it extends our spending profiles for four big days.  At midnight  this coming Monday,  the fiscal year ends. None of the appropriations bills has been sent to the  President’s desk, regardless of who is  at fault. We have heard some discussion on that. We will probably hear  more about that. But we need this legislation to continue operations of the  Federal Government for the first 4 days  of the new fiscal year.  As everyone is aware, the Committee  on Appropriations continues to work  on the fiscal year 2003 appropriations  bills, despite the fact that we have no  common budget with the other body.  The collapse occurred because we had a  breakdown in the budget process, not  the appropriations process. The budget  process stalled because the other body  did not adopt a budget resolution. The  House did. But because both Houses did  not, we had no opportunity to come to  conference and reach the same 302(a)  number, the 302(a) number being the  top number that we would both use in  our appropriations process.  Anyway, despite all of that, we continued to produce bills, and we have a  number of bills in the queue ready to  go when we are given the approval to  bring them to the House floor.  I will comment again that without a  common 302(a) number, the top number, it is nearly impossible to have a  common 302(b) number for the respective subcommittees of the House and  the Senate appropriations committees.  It is unfortunate that this is the case,  because one of the fundamental responsibilities of Congress is the power of  the purse. I emphasis ‘‘responsibility.’’ The guiding principles of checks and  balances that the founders of our great  Nation embodied in our Constitution is  lost when the Congress does not complete its work with regard to government spending.  If I might indulge my colleagues in  the House for just a moment by reading from Article I of the Constitution,  it very simply says, ‘‘No Money shall  be drawn from the Treasury, but in  Consequence of Appropriations made  by Law; and a regular statement and  account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time.’’ That is in our Constitution. Unless  we do this, we are failing to uphold our  basic constitutional responsibilities.  It  is unfortunate  that our budget  process broke down at a critical time  for our country when we are currently  at war against terror and when the security of our homeland is at risk. I do  not believe the people who wrote the  Budget Act ever intended that budget  debates would get in the way of our national security interests.  The House has passed five of the 13  appropriations bills. We are currently  in conference with the Senate on two  of those bills, the defense and military  construction bills. We are waiting to  appoint conferees on  the  legislative  branch bill.  The Committee  on Appropriations  has reported four other bills that are  awaiting floor action, and that is the  appropriations bill for agriculture, energy and water, foreign operations and  the District of Columbia. On Tuesday  of next week we will conclude consideration of the transportation appropriations bill, and next week we also plan  to report the VA–HUD bill from the  Committee on Appropriations.  But until we get to the point where  we can develop a common set of numbers between the House and the Senate  for us to work with, it is important  that the operations of our government  agencies continue without any disruption, and that is what this legislation  is about today.  Let me briefly describe the terms and  conditions of the CR. It will continue  all ongoing activities at current rates,  including  supplementals,  under  the  same terms and conditions as  fiscal  year 2002. We have codified the term  ‘‘rate for operations not exceeding the  current rate’’ as defined in OMB Bulletin No. 01–10. As in past CRs, it does  not allow new starts, and it allows for  adjustment for one-time expenditures  that occurred in fiscal year 2002. It restricts  obligations  on  high  initial  spend-out programs so the annualized  funding levels in this bill will not impinge on our final budget deliberations.  It includes eight funding or authorizing anomalies, of which six allow for  the continuation of existing programs  and fee collections that would otherwise expire. The remaining two provisions will ensure that executive agencies use the Government Printing Office when procuring government printing, as specified under current law and  to ensure that funding for all of the  uniformed services to support the accrual contribution for Medicare-eligible retiree health care is available.  After  some of  the discussion, Mr.  Speaker, this may come as a surprise  to some, but I believe the CR is noncontroversial, and I urge the House to  move this  legislation to the Senate  quickly so that our government will  continue to operate smoothly and efficiently and so that we can continue  our work to finish our regular appropriations bills when we are able to do  that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2002
366,House,107,-0.45,60,2002-09-26,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes  to  the  distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. FROST).  ",2002
367,House,107,-0.538,67,2002-09-26,Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I intend to support the continuing  resolution that is before us today, but  I must say that the administration’s  budget proposal in this body has not  lived up to the commitment that we  made to leave no child behind.  Yesterday, the Census Bureau stated  that the proportion of Americans living in poverty rose significantly last  year, increasing for the first time in 8  years. At the same time, the Bureau  said that the income of middle-class  households fell for the first time since  the last recession ended, in 1991. In the  last 2 years, 2 million more Americans  have  lost  their  jobs, and  economic  growth is at an anemic 1 percent, the  slowest growth in over 50 years.  What has been the House’s answer to  this: Tax cuts, the ability to find another $100–200 billion for a possible war  in Iraq.  A  strong  economy  depends  on  a  strong workforce, and that means educating all Americans and providing  them with skills they need to be productive workers. Some Members  of  Congress seem to have a single focus,  and that  is keeping America strong  abroad. But we have a dual responsibility, keeping America strong abroad  and also keeping America strong at  home. Education is the key to keeping  America strong at home, and that is  why I think we must finish our work  here before we adjourn for the elections  in November.  The title I program provides funds  for school districts to help disadvantaged children obtain a high-quality  education,  and  at  a minimum,  to  achieve proficiency on challenging academic achievement  standards  established by the States.  The President’s request  for title I  education is $4.56 billion below the $16  billion he supported and Congress supported in the Leave No Child Behind  Act. The administration refused to request  funding  for title I school  improvements funds, and last year over  8,600  schools,  10 percent across  the  country, were identified as failing to  meet the State standards. With the additional funds promised by the Leave  No Child Behind Act, school districts  would have been able to hire an additional 92,000 title I teachers.  ",2002

",2002
369,,107,-0.349,291,2002-09-26,Mr. RODRIGUEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay  tribute to Dolores Huerta, the most prominent  Chicana labor leader within the Latino community. Dolores Huerta  is  the co-founder and  First Vice President Emeritus of  the United  Farm Workers Union of America (UFW), AFL – CIO. For decades she has dedicated her life  to the struggle for justice and dignity for migrant  farm workers. Honored with countless  awards for her tireless commitment, she is a  role model for the entire Hispanic community.  In the mid 1950’s Dolores Huerta began her  work empowering workers by joining the Community Service Organization (CSO), a Mexican  American self help association founded in Los  Angeles. Dolores understood early on that empowerment was the key to leveraging power  within  the Latino community. She registered  voters, organized citizenship classes for immigrants, and pressed local governments for improvements in the poorest of barrio communities. Given her passion and determination  the CSO sent her to lobby on behalf of these  under served communities  in Sacramento.  It  was in this capacity that Dolores began her  historic work serving  the needs of migrant  workers.  Life  for migrant  farm workers  is  incredible  harsh. They endure painful work conditions  during the day—with the hot sun beating down  on them as they spend long hours bent over  picking strawberries, grapes, lettuce and other  crops. The conditions did not improve in the  evenings—they retired to run down shacks, if  they were fortunate enough to have a home.  Often their cars or the floor were their only retreat. The workers were paid nominal wages,  $.10 to $.20 a basket, and often were subject  to  further deductions  in pay  for water  they  consumed  in  the hot sun. The majority of  these workers were Mexican  immigrants or  Mexican Americans who were monolingual  Spanish speakers and had no voice. Dolores  would soon lend her voice, in fact shouts, for  justice to their cause.  She  joined  the Agricultural Workers Association (AWA), a community interest group in  northern California. Through her work with the  AWA she met Cesar Chavez, at that time the  director of the CSO in California and Arizona,  soon to become her colleague in the organization which would improve the quality to life for  migrant workers across the country the United  Farm Workers Union (UFW). The UFW was  founded in 1972 with a commitment to justice,  heard through the shouts of ‘ ‘si se puede ’ ’ or  felt through the pounding rattle of their traditional unity claps, has won many significant  struggles for Latino workers.  As a co-founder and second in command to  Chavez, Dolores helped shape and guide the  union and contributed to their significant successes. Her style has always been  forceful  and uncompromising, yet she has been able  to build  successful  coalitions of  feminists,  community workers,  religious groups, Latino  associations, student organizations, peace activists and countless others. Many of Dolores  activities on behalf of the UFW have placed  her  in personal danger. She has been arrested more  than 22  times  for non-violent  peaceful protest and in 1988 during a demonstration in San Francisco, she was severely  injured by baton swinging police officers. She  suffered  two  broken  ribs  and  a  ruptured  spleen. However, this painful and life threatening experience did not stop her  resolve.  After recovering from her life-threatening injuries, Dolores resumed her work on behalf of  farm workers in the 1990’s and today at 72  years of age she continues to make appearances,  lobby, and advocate on behalf of  Latino workers. She has truly devoted her life  to ensure  that workers  in  this country are  treated with dignity and justice. f TRIBUTE TO CHRISTOPHER REEVE  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 24, 2002 ",2002
370,,107,-0.379,291,2002-09-26,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, on  the eve of  Christopher Reeve’s 50th birthday, I would like  to recognize his unfailing courage, strength,  and faith as he has worked to overcome paralysis. Not only has Christopher Reeve put a  human face on spinal cord injury, but he has  become a  leading advocate  for medical  research, better care for people with spinal cord  injury and for increased quality of life for the  more  than  two million Americans  living with  paralysis.  After graduating  from Cornell University  in  1974 and  studying at  Julliard, Christopher  Reeve made his broadway debut opposite  Katherine Hepburn in A Matter of Gravity. Best  known for his star role in Superman and its  many sequels, Christopher Reeve has dazzled  the big screen and stage in numerous productions, such as The Bostonians, Street Smart,  Speechless, Noises Off, Above Suspicion, The  Remains of the Day, and most recently, Rear  Window. He made his directorial debut with  ‘In the Gloaming’ ’ in 1997, which received five  Emmy nominations and published his autobiography, Still Me in 1998, which spent eleven weeks on the New York Times Bestseller  List.  But beyond his experience within the entertainment  arena,  Christopher  Reeve  has  achieved great success in a new and much  more challenging  role: a survivor of spinal  cord injury who is working toward a medical  miracle. Christopher Reeve has become a  beacon of hope for all people with spinal cord  injury and paralysis. The recent news reports  about his medical progress has been an inspiration for not only those living with paralysis,  but also for the medical research community.  For the first time since his accident in 1995,  Christopher Reeve is able to wiggle his fingers  and  toes, experience sensation  in his body,  and tell the difference between hot and cold— something that the medical community did not  believe was possible  in someone so  far removed from the initial time of his accident.  Christopher Reeve’s  recovery and  recent  scientific evidence show that there is hope for  those living with paralysis. At research centers  in the United States, Europe and Japan, new  techniques of rigorous exercise has helped an  estimated 500 persons with paraplegia and  limited sensations in their lower bodies to walk  for short distances, either unassisted or using  walkers.  While the results of these new methods are  quite miraculous,  the  limits of what physical  exercise can do for patients remains grossly  understudied. While each person and each injury is unique, and some people recover spontaneously, an estimated 200,000 Americans  are  living with spinal cord  injuries  that have  not improved. Which therapy or combination of  therapies will work  for each persons  is unknown. Today 2 million Americans are living  with paralysis,  including spinal cord  injury,  stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, ALS  and spina bifida. We need research  to see  how these new interventions work on the entire population of individuals living with paralysis.  Tomorrow, I will join my colleagues in introducing the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Act of  2002, which seeks  to  further advance  the  science needed to help those living with paralysis take that next step and at the same time  build quality of life program in the state that  will  further advance  full participation,  independent living, self-sufficiency and equality of  opportunity  for  individuals with paralysis and  other physical disabilities.  Those living with paralysis face astronomical  medical costs, and our best estimates tell us  that only one-third of those individuals remain  employed after paralysis. At least one-third of  those  living with paralysis have  incomes of  $15,000 or less. And over the past 20 years,  overall days spent in the hospital and rehabilitation centers  for  those  living with paralysis  have been cut in half.  Christopher Reeve’s  recent  triumphs  in  overcoming paralysis prove how close we are  to achieving major breakthroughs  for people  who have paralysis. The Christopher Reeve  Paralysis Act of 2002 will ensure that the federal government does its part to help the more  than two million Americans with paralysis who  are still waiting for their own breakthroughs.  As John F. Kennedy once said, ‘ ‘The stories  of past courage can define that ingredient— they can teach, they can offer hope, they can  provide  inspiration. But  they cannot supply  courage itself. For this each man must look  into his own soul. ’ ’ Since Christopher Reeve  was injured, his tireless efforts to walk again,  coupled with his  faith, passion and commitment to improve quality of life for others living  with paralysis, make him an inspiration to us  all. Happy Birthday, Chris. ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

I  rise as  the Co-Chairman of  the  Congressional Caucus on  India and  Indian  Americans to express my condolences to the  families of the victims of the brutal attack on  the Swaminarayan Temple in Gujarat.  Thirty-two— including many children— an attack in Gandhinagar.  Last year, I led a congressional delegation  to Gujarat  immediately  following  the  devastating earthquake  that hit  the state. From  that  trip and my dealings with  the Gujarati  community  in  the U.S.,  I have developed a  deep fondness for the people of Gujarat.  During my visit, I visited the Swaminarayan  Temple and witnessed first hand the efforts of  the Swaminarayan Temple to assist victims of  the earthquake. Our heart goes out  to all  Gujaratis harmed by this violent act.  The Swaminarayan organization was established in 1907. It is a religion that preaches religious  tolerance and practical spirituality.  I  only wish  that more people  in  this world  shared those values. f IN HONOR AND REMEMBRANCE OF  MADELINE L.

372,House,107,0.337,5,2002-10-02,Mr. REHBERG.," Mr. Speaker, another  week has passed without a comprehensive and balanced energy plan. In the  first 6 months of this year, we paid terrorists an average of $13 million a day  for their oil. This must end. Because  America does not have a comprehensive energy plan, we continue to purchase oil from the Middle East; but  there is a balanced plan, and it does include increasing domestic oil production.  More domestic oil will give us a stable supply and allow us to diminish our  dependence on foreign oil. From January to June, we paid $2.3 billion to the  countries  that give  suicide bombers  thousands of dollars to threaten the  very existence of democracy.  Total reliance on energy resources  from nations that harbor animosity towards America and our allies must become a thing of the past. Mr. Speaker,  we need to unify as Americans and pass  a comprehensive and balanced energy  plan. The security of our Nation depends on eliminating our dependence  on foreign oil.

373,House,107,-0.455,33,2002-10-02,Mr. FARR of California.," Mr. Speaker,  pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of House rule  IX, I rise to give notice of my intent to  present a question of privilege to the  House.  The form of the resolution is as follows: A resolution,  in accordance with House  Rule IX, expressing a sense of the House that  its integrity has been impugned and Constitutional duty hampered by the inability of  the House to bring to the floor H.R. 854, legislation that would promote the general welfare of the nation by protecting its health  care system.  Whereas President George W. Bush has  urged Congress to put Medicare on a ‘‘sustainable financial footing’’ in order to assure  Americans  of  affordable  and  accessible  health care.  Whereas the Administration has failed to  take action to protect Medicare and Medicaid programs from severe cuts that threaten basic services to persons in need of health  care.  Whereas the Medicaid program is facing  significant cuts through reductions in the  disproportionate  share  hospital  program,  threatening the very financial viability of  the nation’s public hospitals.  Whereas the cuts made in order by the Balanced Budget Act were postponed until 2003  by the Benefits Improvement and Protection  Act but without further congressional action  cuts will be reimposed and have the potential to seriously cripple safety-net public  health services in states across the nation.  Whereas, in addition to slashing payments  to hospitals  the Administration has also  eliminated the UPL payments for hospitals,  further weakening their ability to provide  health care to the indigent and uninsured.  Whereas  federal payments to states  for  this program have been reduced by approximately $700 million in FY 2002 and will be reduced further by about $900 million in FY  2003, thus severely restricting public hospitals’ ability to serve persons in need of  health care.  Whereas the number of uninsured persons  without access to health care has risen in  the last year to 41.2 million.  Whereas by failing to act Congress imposes  on the states and localities an undue burden  to carry health care costs as well as abrogates its responsibility to maintain the general welfare of the country, bringing discredit to this Body and threatening the very  well-being of the populace.  Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved that it is  the sense of the House of Representatives  that the Congress should complete action on  H.R. 854 or other provider reimbursement  legislation before recessing and should insure that Medicare and Medicaid providers  have appropriate funds to carry out their  health care mandates. The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  THORNBERRY). Under rule IX, a resolution offered from the floor by a Member other than the majority leader or  minority leader as a question of the  privileges of the House has immediate  precedence only at a time designated  by the Chair within 2 legislative days  after the resolution  is appropriately  noticed.  Pending that designation, the form of  the  resolution noticed by  the gentleman from California (Mr. FARR) will  appear in the RECORDat this point.  The Chair will not at this point determine whether the resolution constitutes a question of privilege. That  determination will be made at a time  designated for consideration of the resolution.

374,Senate,107,0.552,61,2002-10-02,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, my wife  and I have four kids and 11 grandkids.  My youngest daughter Katie  is  the  chairman of the Jesse Helms Fan Club.  Katie, who looks like she is about 14 or  15 years old, is in her thirties. She just  had her second baby. She has, I say to  my good friend, Senator HELMS, prominently framed as you walk in to her  home a picture of Senator HELMSholding her first baby, Baby Kate. You see,  I have a wife named Kate, a daughter  named Kate,  and  a  granddaughter  named Kate. The picture  is prominently displayed in her living room.  She  talks  about  this wonderful,  gentle man in Washington who is different  than  anybody  else we  have  known in Washington. She says he has  to be the most lovable man in the history of Washington, DC.  Jesse, I say to you, that is not just  one little girl talking. She speaks for  so many people.  Since one of the programs that Senator HELMShas always held up and said  is the greatest program because it does  not involve Government dollars, it involves putting into the hands of young  people in America the ideals that made  this country great, I thought it would  be appropriate if we adopt S. Con. Res.  143, which is the 4–H resolution. The  Senator from North Carolina has been  such a prominent part and one of the  first cosponsors of this resolution. So  let’s adopt  this  resolution on Jesse  Helms Appreciation Day.  My resolution, S. Con. Res. 143, designates next week, October 6 through  12, as the ‘‘National 4–H Youth Development Program Week.’’ The  4–H Youth Development Program sponsors clubs in rural and urban  areas in every county throughout the  Nation. As neighbors and colleagues, 4– H members and volunteers are making  a difference by pledging the four Hs:  their  ‘‘heads’’ to a clearer thinking,  ‘‘hearts’’ to greater loyalty, ‘‘hands’’ to  larger service, and ‘‘health’’ to better  living for the club, the community, the  country, and the world.  In an era when education is recognized as more important than ever, 4–H  offers a variety of training through its  diverse programs. Young people gain  experience and citizenship and civic  education, communications and expressive  arts,  consumer  and  family  sciences, environmental education and  earth sciences, healthy lifestyle education, personal development and leadership, plants and animals, and science  and technology; and it goes on.  4–H has grown to over 5 1⁄2million annual participants from all ethnic backgrounds, ranging from ages 5 to 19. 4–H  clubs strengthen families and communities and foster leadership and voluntarism for youth and adults.  I will say something about my State  of Oklahoma. Turning to a survey of 22  counties  in Oklahoma, 4–H members  and volunteer leaders participated in 4  million hours of community service.  No Government program told them to  do that. They just did it out of their  hearts  because  they had  leadership  they could look up to, the ultimate  leader being Senator HELMS in this  case.  Whitney Ferris, a 4–H club member  and student at the Oklahoma State  University, is one example of someone  who has given back to her community.  She has used skills she has developed  through 4–H to conduct leadership development classes  for Native Americans in the Chickasaw Nation. As a result of her efforts, Whitney  is now  working with other Native American  tribes in Oklahoma to help them establish development workshops in order to  learn skills that will make them tomorrow’s leaders.  That is what we are really talking  about: tomorrow’s leaders. We would  like to produce more JESSEHELMSes  for this world.  Other OSU students, who are also 4– H members, have won the prestigious  Truman Scholarship  for  their  outstanding  academic  and  leadership  skills.  Recently, I supported 4–H by requesting funding for a national civic education program to be conducted by the  National 4–H Council. This program is  aimed at involving young people from  all socioeconomic backgrounds in public policy and community involvement,  with a special focus on community governance and leadership skills. I have also requested funding for an  innovative Rural Health Outreach Program, which will  be  administered  through the 4–H Youth Development  Program.  This program will develop,  implement and evaluate an overall youth  health promotion and awareness strategy designed to target youth and their  families, particularly in rural America.  It will also devise strategies to reach  minority and disadvantaged youth and  their families.  4–H is changing the lives of America’s youth for a brighter, better tomorrow and I am proud to recognize  this important program.  Congratulations, 4–H, on your good  work and your centennial. I conclude by saying we have hundreds of thousands of kids around this  country who are participating today  and have participated in this program.  I think that each one of them would  look up to the top and see one person  who really sets an example for what  truly makes America great, and that  would be our good friend JESSEHELMS.

I salute the dedication and leadership  provided via  the motto  ‘We Serve.’  Having  formerly been a member of the Rogers Lions  Club, and having practiced optometry for 25  years, I truly value the club’s accomplishments  in eye care.  The legacy founded in Chicago in 1917 by  Melvin Jones has grown into an organization  which boasts a membership of 1.4 million. Accepting the challenge first posed by Helen Keller  to become  ‘Knights of  the Blind’ in  the  crusade against darkness, Lions have provided 3 million cataract surgeries, funded 68  eye clinics and hospitals, and have screened  6 million patients for eye disease. They also  distribute 4 million pairs of eyeglasses annually in developing countries. Having personally  assisted with the distribution of eyeglasses in  Haiti, I can honestly say that the efforts of the  Lions truly impact the lives of those less fortunate.  I encourage each member of the Van Buren  Lions Club to continue the work of this valuable organization. Their contributions  to  the  Lions Club  International Foundation, which  funds Leo Clubs, Youth Camps,  the  International Youth Exchange, and the annual consultation at the United Nations, serve to bring  hope to many.  Mr. Speaker, on this historic 80th anniversary, I applaud the Van Buren Lions for their  dedication to the world’s largest service organization. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to recognize them. f HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF  CALIFORNIA  STATE  SUPERIOR  COURT COMMISSIONER FOR ALAMEDA  COUNTY,  MICHAEL  L.  KANNINEN  HON.

377,,107,0.495,145,2002-10-02,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker, one year  ago, Americans  looked on  in horror as  the  events of September 11 unfolded. At the end  of the day the skyline of one of our greatest  cities was forever changed, the Pentagon, a  symbol of America’s military might was still  smoldering, and a previously indistinguishable  field  in western Pennsylvania had suddenly  and  terribly become an unmarked grave  for  America’s newest heroes.  In  the aftermath of  the Challenger space  disaster, when seeking to comfort a shocked  and hurting country, President Reagan told us  that  the  ‘The  future doesn’t belong  to  the  fainthearted;  it belongs  to  the brave.’  Overwhelmed by grief, and reeling from a devastation, attack, some nations would have been  ‘ ’ ‘ ’   ‘ ’ ",2002
378,,107,-0.606,152,2002-10-02,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in disappointment. The Continuing Resolution, House Joint Resolution 111, on  the  floor today is a slap in the face of the American people. Our constituents all over  the  country are counting on us to help them put  food on the table, provide their children with  the best education possible and to make them  and their families safer. Despite the best efforts of Democrats, the Republican leadership  of the House continues to let them down. It is  inexcusable  that  this body has only passed  five appropriations bills. What  is even more  disappointing is that the Labor/HHS/Education  Appropriations bill has not even been brought  to the House floor for a vote. The other body  has passed its version of the bill, yet we continue to twiddle our thumbs at the expense of  our children. The Senate’s proposal would increase education  funding  in  the President’s  budget by a  little over $3 billion and would  provide funding increases for Teacher Quality,  Title 1, Head Start, and financial aid programs,  and would restore funding for rural school programs.  Instead of  following  in  the Senate’s  lead, the House Republicans refuse to act on  this issue.  The failure of the Republicans and the Administration to follow through on their commitment to education is disappointing. The ‘ ‘No  Child Left Behind Act’  was supposed to provide our children with the resources needed to  obtain the best education possible, but, unfortunately, this has not happened. The law was  touted as a way to prevent children from being  trapped’  in failing schools but left behind may  be  thousands of unhappy parents and students. The President’s budget of $50.3 billion  in  discretionary  funding  for  FY2003  has  stopped six years of steady progress in federal support to local schools dead in its tracks.  Under  his  proposal,  the  overall  education  budget would only  increase by 2.8 percent,  barely enough to cover inflation. Our so-called  ‘Education President’  is doing the exact opposite of what he promised. He is leaving our  children behind.  Unfortunately, the only version of the House  Republicans’ Labor HHS Education appropriations bill  follows  the President’s budget  request. The bill would freeze or reduce funding  for most education programs,  including  the  teacher  quality,  after-school, math/science  partnerships, Safe and Drug-Free schools, bilingual education, Pell Grants, Gear-Up and  TRIO programs. Funding for several important  programs, including rural education and technology  training  for  teachers would be completely eliminated.  It also  includes no  resources to address the $127 billion crisis in  school repairs. The bill cuts  funding  for  the  ‘No Child Left Behind Act’  by $90 million from  last year, resulting in 16,000 fewer teachers  getting trained, 50,000 fewer children in afterschool programs, and yet another year without  the needed resources  to  turn around  failing  schools. The President and  the Republicans  continue to break their promises to the children of our country.  In my home state of  Illinois,  they are attempting  to  take away nearly $200 million  needed to support the Title I grants program,  which provides supplemental assistance to improve  the  educational  attainment  of  lowachieving students, especially  those  in high  poverty areas. Also,  they are cutting nearly  $600 million from IDEA funding, which is desperately needed to improve special education  in Illinois. Finally, student debt is skyrocketing  as college  tuitions  rise, making  loan affordability critical. Despite this fact, the Administration’s budget cuts  the maximum Pell Grant,  which provides up  to $4,000  to  low-income  students to help with college tuition costs, to  $3,600, $800 short of what is needed to keep  pace with projected tuition hikes.  Mr. Speaker, this is not what I consider education reform. If we refuse to fund our educational system, then we are only cutting short  the potential of our country’s children and  jeopardizing our nation’s future. I urge my colleagues to listen to the millions of Americans  out there and support a bill that follows the  Senate’s bill and not the President’s budget. It  is time to give our children the opportunities  they deserve. HOME SAFETY COUNCIL STUDY ON  HOME INJURIES AND DEATHS  HON. RICHARD BURR  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 1, 2002 ",2002
379,,107,0.453,152,2002-10-02,Mr. BURR of North Carolina.," Mr. Speaker,  unintentional home injuries have reached an  unacceptable level, according to a new study  by the Home Safety Council, and Americans  need to be aware of the risks they face in their  own homes. It may be surprising to some that  these injuries are the leading cause of death  for  those between  the ages of 1 and 44,  and— other than illness— unintentional injuries  are  the number one cause of death  in  the  United States.  The study, recently completed by the University of North Carolina, also shows us how  unintentional  home  injuries  hurt America’s  working families and our economy. Lost workdays for injured parents cost both employees  and employers, not  to mention driving up  health care costs and raising dilemmas in providing childcare. These  injuries cost Americans nearly $380 billion each year, and account for an estimated 10 percent of all visits  to hospital emergency rooms.  We are  forming a Congressional Home  Safety Working Group  in  the next Congress  that can directly address home safety issues  on Capitol Hill and in Federal agencies. The  working group will examine how the Federal  Government can support home safety education and prevention activities. A year from  now, we need to see a reduction in the number of unintentional home injuries. For some  great suggestions on what Americans can do  right  now  to  protect  themselves,  visit  www.homesafetycouncil.org.  I want to congratulate David Oliver, Executive Director of the Home Safety Council, for  commissioning  this monumental  study; Dr.  Carol Runyan, Director of the Injury Prevention Research Center at University of North  Carolina at Chapel Hill  for conducting  the  study; and Dr. Sue Binder, Director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control,  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  for supporting this study and bringing Federal  attention to this critical issue. I would also like  to encourage my fellow colleagues to raise the  level of attention  to home safety  issues on  Capitol Hill and in Federal agencies. f MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK  BOUNDARY  ADJUSTMENT  ACT  OF 2002  HON.

383,House,107,0.453,12,2002-10-09,Mr. BURR of North Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Florida  (Mr. GOSS)  for not only his  leadership as chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence  but also for the gentleman’s leadership  in the debate on this  issue on this  floor.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  resolution, but I want to take a moment to thank my colleagues who seek  a peaceful solution to this crisis. I, too,  would prefer peace to war.  As Thomas Jefferson wrote to Andrew Jackson in 1806, ‘‘Always a friend  to peace, and believing it to promote  the happiness and prosperity of mankind,  I  am  ever unwilling  that  it  should be disturbed, as  long as the  rights and interests of the Nation can  be preserved.’’  Jefferson went on to say in this letter, when our rights and interests are  threatened, ‘‘we must meet our duty  and convince the world that we are just  friends and brave enemies.’’  Mr. Speaker, the rights and the interests of our Nation are threatened  today. Voting to send our military into  battle, even potential battle, is among  the hardest things we will do as Members of Congress. It is not a duty to  take lightly. However, I have come to  the realization that there are times  when such votes are necessary. This is  one of those times.  The threat to our Nation from Saddam Hussein’s weapons programs and  his growing ties to the networks of  international terror cannot be underestimated and should not be ignored.  Willful blindness to this threat will not  make it go away.  In a little more than a decade, we  have sent our Armed Forces to war on  behalf of the Kuwaitis, the Saudis, the  Somalis,  the  Bosnians,  and  the  Kosovars. Some in our military made  the ultimate sacrifice.  It may soon prove necessary to send  our troops to war on behalf and in defense of the American people. I cannot  in good conscience ignore the dangers  posed by Iraq to my constituents, including the servicemen and women who  call North Carolina home. Inaction on  our part may very well be more costly  to our Nation than action. The threat  is real.  As a member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce, I have heard  testimony from countless officials on  the status of our Nation’s preparation  for chemical and biological attacks. I  know firsthand the need to eliminate  this threat while we continue with our  preparation.  As a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I have  reviewed the evidence of Iraqi’s weapons programs and its increasing ties to  international  terror.  I have participated in countless hearings on the terror threat and the state of the war  against terrorism. I have seen, heard  and read things that keep me awake at  night.  Iraq brings the dangers of chemical  and biological weapons, their use, and  international terrorism together in one  clear, defined threat. Addressing this  threat is mandated by our duty to protect our Nation’s rights and interests.  The reason for my support of this  resolution, Mr. Speaker, is simple. No  matter how well we protect our borders,  increase our military spending  and strengthen our intelligence community, we cannot secure our homeland without eliminating the threat  Saddam Hussein’s weapons present to  America and to the world. We must  find them. We must destroy them. We  must be prepared to take action when  the international community will not,  and we must fulfill our duty.  I will conclude with President Jefferson’s  letter to John Adams  in September 1821.  ‘‘The flames kindled on  the 4th of July, 1776, have spread over  too much of the globe to be extinguished by the feeble engine of despotism; on the contrary, they will consume these engines and all who work  them.’’  One wonders what President Jefferson would say about the weapons available to our enemies on this day at this  time. Today, the bright flames of July  4th find themselves in struggle with  the dark fires of September 11. Those  fires, lit by the enemies of freedom,  cannot be allowed to prevail. Will we  allow them to advance, possibly in the  ashes of a nuclear holocaust, or will we  extinguish them before they gain a  foothold? Those dark  fires may not  have been lit in Baghdad, but they are  certainly fanned from that city.  It is time to extinguish those fires.  The evidence is clear, the cause is just,  and timing is of the essence. We must  give our President the tools he needs to  protect our Nation, our interests, and  our citizens.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this resolution.  ",2002
384,House,107,-0.238,12,2002-10-09,Mr. BOSWELL.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  from New York  (Mr.  CROWLEY), for yielding me this time,  and the chairman of our committee.  We have had an  interesting  several  months together and not all fun; but it  is a very, very serious thing.  I would like to start off my comments by saying that this Member, although I am a veteran, as many are  here, I am not a hawk, I am not a dove.  I am a concerned American who wants  our country and our people to be safe.  I have had  some of  those  sleepless  nights. I think of the gentleman from  California (Mr. CUNNINGHAM). I think of  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SAM  JOHNSON), the price he paid. I think of  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BOYD)  and the gentleman from California (Mr.  THOMPSON) and many others who have  served and know something as well as  I what it is like to face war. It is not  a good thing.  I am a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and I  have  tried  to  prepare myself with  knowledge and information, and some  things I am convinced of and I would  share with you today. I am convinced  that Saddam Hussein has weapons of  mass destruction. I am convinced that  he has the chemical and biological and  he wants very badly to have the nuclear; and given a chance, he will have  them. I am convinced that he would  use them. He is a despot. No question  about it in my mind. But he would not  only use them, I think he would make  them available to others if they came  to buy or he would even give them to  them.  So I am very concerned about this,  and I have had my sleepless nights. It  almost  reminds me of  some of  the  times going  into a major operation  when I was in Vietnam. It was pretty  hard to sleep when we knew that lives  would be lost that next day and we  might have to write the letters to the  next of kin, the moms, the dads and  the husbands, the spouses about how  their son paid the supreme sacrifice  that day.  I served 20 years, served a couple of  tours over in NATO. I know something  about  the  international  relationship  that needs to be there as we go into  this world that we live in today. It is a  very, very serious matter, and I have  no quarrel with those that have spoken  just as the last speaker. I respect that.  But I am concerned about the tomorrow  for my children and my grandchildren.  I know that when I went to Vietnam,  I settled my family there in a little  farm there in southern Iowa the night  before I was to leave. My little daughter, who now has a  teen-age child,  came out to the yard where my wife  and I were sitting and having kind of a  quiet moment as the sun was going on.  She said, Daddy don’t go. So I said,  Sweetheart, I’m a soldier. I have to go.  She said, Please don’t go. I am afraid.  Think about this, your own child: I am  afraid you may not come back. So I  tried to give her assurance as I had the  first time I had gone that I would come  back. Lucky for me, I did; but everybody did not come back. So I understand that this is one of the most serious things we deal with.

",2002
386,House,107,0.536,33,2002-10-09,Mr. COLLINS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of this resolution to give the  President of the United States the authority to exercise his sworn duty to  protect the people of this Nation.  There  is no question that Saddam  Hussein  is a  threat  to  the United  States and other parts of the world. He  has used weapons of mass destruction  against his own people, killing and  maiming thousands upon thousands of  innocents, including women and children. He has deceived weapons inspectors and violated the conditions of the  1991  cease-fire  agreement with  the  United Nations. He has continued to  stockpile  chemical  and  biological  weapons, and recent intelligence tells  us he  is much closer than we previously thought possible to developing  and  constructing  a  usable  nuclear  weapon.  Over the past  few years, we have  learned many painful lessons regarding  the Middle East and terrorism: the Marine barracks in Beirut; the airmen we  lost in the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi; the foreign service personnel we lost in Tanzania and Kenya;  and then the sailors weapon  lost  in  Yemen; and, finally, Mr. Speaker, the  people we lost in New York and in D.C.  b1530  Intelligence  tells us  that Saddam  Hussein  has massive  stockpiles  of  weapons and he has missiles, the capability of delivering those weapons.  Our President does not easily want to  go to war. He has even stated this repeatedly on many occasions, but it is a  difficult situation that he is in and we  are in, Mr. Speaker. But this resolution  demonstrates the resolve of the American people to force Saddam Hussein to  comply with U.N. regulations which,  until now, he has flagrantly abused.  This resolution will send a clear message to the Middle East, to the oppressive dictator, the Butcher of Baghdad,  and to the rest of the world that we  will not live in fear; that we will not  tolerate terrorism; and that we will use  the force necessary to protect our people, our freedoms and our way of life  from those who seek only to destroy  such.  It goes without saying this President  has sworn to do a duty. We must give  him the power and the necessary authorization to do so.  I strongly support this resolution and  ask my colleagues to do the same.  Mr. Speaker, today we are debating whether  or not to support the President of the United  States in his efforts to exercise his sworn duty  to protect the nation.  That there is a gathering threat to America  from the dictator Saddam Hussein goes without saying, but let me reiterate some of the  past actions that demonstrate that threat.  Saddam Hussein  invaded neighboring Kuwait without provocation. He has used weapons of mass destruction against his own people, killing and maiming thousands upon thousands of innocents, including women and children. In 1993. Saddam sent a Land Cruiser  loaded with 400 pounds of explosives into Kuwait  to attempt  to assassinate  former President George Bush. He has deceived weapons  inspectors and violated the conditions of the  1991 Cease-fire agreement with  the United  Nations. He has continued to stockpile chemical and biological weapons, and recent intelligence tells us, is much closer than we previously  thought possible  to developing and  constructing a usable nuclear weapon.  Over  the past 12 years we have  learned  many painful  lessons  regarding  the Middle  East and terrorism. Our citizens have been attacked and killed repeatedly. The 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers by Saudi dissidents  funded and organized by  Iranian Leadership  killed 19 of our servicemen and women.  In  1998,  the coordinated bombing of American  embassies in Tanzania and Kenya killed 224  people, including 12 Americans. In 2000, 17  American Sailors were killed  in  the Port of  Yemen when terrorists bombed the USS Cole.  And our nation still reels from the effects of  September 11, 2001 when thousands of our  countrymen were tragically lost to us in devastating attacks.  And yet, as painful as each of these incidents has been, nothing can compare to the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:40 Sep 21, 2011 Jkt 099200 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\ERIC\H09OC2.REC H09OC2 B O J _ $ $ h t i w D O R P 1 C H R 6 W F K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2002
387,House,107,-0.34,40,2002-10-09,Mr. HINOJOSA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  in opposition  to House Joint  Resolution 114, giving authorization for  military force against Iraq. I am determined to convince my colleagues to  pass the substitute amendment that  will be offered by the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. SPRATT). I agree  with my colleague that the resolution  reported by the Committee on International Relations authorizing the use  of force against Iraq is an amendment  and an improvement over the original  House draft; and, yes, I also agree with  him that we must limit the broad authority it grants to our President.  While no one in this House believes  that Saddam Hussein should be allowed  to develop weapons of mass destruction, my fellow colleagues should see  the need to encourage the President to  persist in his efforts to obtain Security  Council approval for any action taken  against Iraq. The President should also  be required to seek a Security Council  resolution mandating a new and tougher round of arms inspection.  When  the Gulf War  ended,  Iraq  agreed to destroy all of its chemical,  biological, and nuclear weapons; and,  yes, Iraq should be held to that commitment. The safety of America and  the world depends on Iraq’s compliance  with the United Nations resolutions.  Because the Spratt substitute would  call on the United Nations to approve  the use of force, if necessary, to ensure  that Iraq meets its obligations to disarm,  the United Nations  Security  Council’s approval of action  in  Iraq  would provide several crucial benefits.  It would encourage all allies to fall in  line and support our efforts. It would  allow moderate Arab states to use the  council’s approval as a guide to support  our  troops’  presence  in  Iraq,  consequently enhancing  the chances of  post-war democracy and economic success in Iraq. If Saddam Hussein’s regime is toppled, a new government will  have to be formed to revive Iraq’s economy and bring together the various  ethnic factions to form a viable government.  Nation-building should be the work  of the United Nations, not the U.S.  military. As I have said, U.N. approval  of our efforts would improve our ties  with our allies, both European and  Arab, and would likely lead to a fledgling, yet  strong, democracy.  If  the  United Nations decides not to impose  additional sanctions or to cooperate,  then America should take unilateral  action against Iraq within the guidelines of the Constitution.  Everyone in this Congress has sworn  to uphold the Constitution. It was in  1787 that the founders of our country  gave Congress, not the President, the  power and the responsibility of declaring war and sending American troops  oversees. The Spratt substitute would  require the President to come to Congress and ask for the support through  an expedited process after it is determined that the United Nations will not  act.  I think this  is the appropriate  manner in which to conduct such a serious endeavor as another war. We need  to remind ourselves that we are not  just entering and referring to a congressional resolution, we are talking  about the potential loss of American  troops and the lives of civilian Iraqis.  Life is too precious a gift to grant  such broad powers even to our President without a thorough discourse with  the United Nations or with the United  States Congress. I do not question our  President’s authority to protect our  national security. I am asking that our  President work through the United Nations and consult Congress prior to engaging in what will become a serious  international conflict.  In closing, over the last few weeks I  have talked to many of my constituents from all walks of life: farmers,  ranchers, veterans, educators, parents,  students,  doctors,  businessmen,  and  businesswomen. I have listened carefully to all of their views and concerns;  and as a result, I will vote against  House Joint Resolution 114. I respectfully urge my colleagues to support the  Spratt amendment.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  resolution because it provides an opportunity for peace through diplomacy  while preserving the President’s flexibility to engage the full force of our  military to protect national security.  The resolution before us does not preordain a path  for our President  to  choose. Rather,  this  resolution provides the President with all possible  options.  Enacting  the  resolution  does not  mean that an attack is imminent. It  does mean that an escalation of our  current military conflict with Iraq is a  real possibility. Enacting this resolution does not mean that the President  will  stop  pursuing  diplomatic  and  peaceful means to a solution. It does  mean that there can be consequences  to continued inaction by the Iraqi regime. Enacting  this  resolution will  show the world, our traditional allies,  our potential allies, the Iraqi people,  and most importantly Saddam Hussein,  that the United States speaks with one  voice  in our determination to bring  peace and stability to the world.  The resolution references the continuing threat posed by Iraq. Make no  mistake, this threat is real and it is  growing. It is not just that Saddam  Hussein has weapons of mass destruction, Mr. Speaker. He has used them.  He used them against Iran. He used  chemical weapons against his country’s  own people, the Kurds of northern Iraq.  And we have to ask ourselves this question, Mr. Speaker: Since Saddam Hussein has no greater opponent than the  United States and our people and since  he continues to develop more and more  weapons, where will he use them next?  In the aftermath of September 11,  2001, countless voices asked this question: Did we do everything we could do  to prevent this tragedy? To answer  that question in the world that exists  today, in a world in which an enemy  can inflict damage with an army of  one, we must be willing to change fundamentally our security strategy by  accepting that intervention is a necessary part of protecting our safety.  With the passage of this resolution,  Mr. Speaker, Saddam Hussein will be  able to choose his destiny. Either Saddam Hussein’s regime must change the  way it acts or the regime itself must  change.

The  terrorists on September  11  tried  to  break the spirit of America, but they  failed. The spirit of our Nation is unbreakable and unwaivering. As a Nation, we will work together to fight the  war on terrorism, to preserve our own  lives and the lives of our peace-loving  friends all around the world.  b1630  During his address to the United Nations on September 12, and again on  Tuesday in Cincinnati, the President  outlined a powerful case as to why pursuing  regime  changes  by military  means, if necessary, in Iraq, is in the  vital national interests of America and  all freedom-loving people everywhere. I  feel that the President provided a clear  and compelling case that will lead to  broad international support of our objectives.  The President told us that Iraq possesses the physical infrastructure required to build nuclear weapons and  maintains stockpiles of chemical and  biological agents  for the purpose of  killing  literally thousands of people.  U.N. inspectors have stated that they  believe Iraq has produced as much as  four times the amount of biological  agents  it claims to possess and has  failed to account for more than three  metric tons of material that could be  used  to produce biological weapons.  Along with this threat, Iraq possesses a  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:40 Sep 21, 2011 Jkt 099200 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\ERIC\H09OC2.REC H09OC2 B O J _ $ $ h t i w D O R P 1 C H R 6 W F K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2002
392,Senate,107,0.419,173,2002-10-09,Mr. HUTCHINSON.," Mr. President,  freedom of speech does not exist  in  Iraq, and summary executions are commonplace.  Torture is seen as a legitimate tool  of control, and violence against women  is not just condoned but perpetrated by  the Iraqi government.  Political opponents of Saddam Hussein are subject to unimaginable cruelty. They are  jailed without cause.  Amnesty  International  reports  ‘‘Detainees  have  been  threatened with  bringing  in a  female  relative, especially the wife or the mother, and raping her in front of the detainee. Some  of  these  threats have been  carried  out.’’ In 1997, the UN reported that Iraq executed more than 1,500 people for political reasons. There are even reports  that the victims families are forced to  pay the cost of the execution.  Saddam stays in power through fear.  It is terror—sheer terror—that sustains  his evil regime.  Saddam Hussein  has  never  been  called to account for the Kuwaitis that  are still missing from the Gulf War.  There are still 609 cases of missing Gulf  War POW/MIAs.  Included in that number is one American Navy Pilot. The Iraqi government  continues to refuse to provide full information about his fate.  The passage of this resolution will  provide the President with authority  he requires  in order to address the  grave threat posed by Iraq.  I fully support his efforts to rally the  international community, and believe  that a strong vote on this resolution  will  strengthen his case before  the  United Nations.  It is the hope of all of us that military action will not be necessary. However, after a full decade of effort, we  have almost completely exhausted diplomacy.  There are some who believe that preemptive military action against Iraq  represents a break from our nation’s  traditions. My colleagues, unfortunately, we are  facing untraditional threats. We have  tried containment. It was built upon  the  idea of  inspection and sanction.  The inspectors were thrown out, and  the sanctions have been broken.  Again,  from Kenneth Pollack and  from  ‘‘The Threatening Storm,’’ he  says: Unfortunately, it is difficult to know exactly what is going into Iraq. This is the  main problem;  if  the United States and  United Nations knew, they might be able to  stop it. As it is, we know only that between  the smuggling and the surcharges Saddam is  making $2 billion to $3 billion per year that  he can spend as he likes. In addition, we have  been able to intercept some shipments and  get intelligence on others that give at least  a sense of what Saddam is using his illegal  revenues to import. For instance, in June  2002, the Indian government brought charges  against the executives of an Indian company  for selling atomized aluminum powder and  titanium engine parts to Iraq in such quantity and of such quality that India’s Defense  and  Research  Development  Organization  concluded they could only have been  intended  for chemical warfare and ballistic  missile production. We tried inspections. The sanctions  have been eroded, and deterrence only  works with a rational person. It assumes rationality. And the fact that he  can transmit weapons of mass destruction  to  terrorists who could  inflict  enormous  damage upon  the United  States  with  no  fingerprints—with  Saddam’s fingerprints not even being  on it—is evidence that the idea of containment to no longer be a workable  approach.  The attacks of 9/11 tore our hearts  and left us with a grief that will never  be forgotten. At the same time, those  acts of evil have brought forth a new  resolve and a new commitment.  It is the responsibility of the U.S.  Government, and  it  is the responsibility of this Senate to ensure that the  heartbreak of September 11 is not repeated. Our enemies have grown more cunning and their methods more sinister.  We must move swiftly and decisively to  deny them the opportunity to attack  us. When the threat is real, preemption  is not just tactically critical, but, I believe, it is a moral imperative.  In Saddam Hussein we are facing a  menace that has long expressed hatred  of the United States, established links  to  international  terrorists, and has  amassed large stockpiles of weapons of  mass destruction. He has been accorded  every opportunity to cooperate with  the international community, and he  has refused.  Every day that goes by, the threat  grows. He  continues  to  amass  his  stockpile and strengthens his ties to  terrorists. We cannot—we must not— stand by and allow this to continue.  And we must not delay. There have  been many people quoted in this debate, so let me add one more to the  record. Winston Churchill said: There is no merit in putting off a war for  a year if, when it comes, it is a far worse war  or one much harder to win. The world is watching us. And freedom-loving people across the globe are  waiting to see if America will answer  the challenge that history has put before us. They are waiting to see if our  Nation will assume the mantle of leadership in dealing with a tyrant with  maniacal ambitions.  Our enemies are hoping we  falter.  They hope we will continue to be mired  in the web of deception spun by Saddam Hussein. They need to be shown  that our resolve to protect the American people has never been stronger.  While my greatest hope is that military action will not be necessary, it  may be unavoidable. Others have come  to this floor to talk about the cost of  such an operation. They rightly cite estimates ranging in the tens of billions  of dollars. Some may discuss the damage that might be done to our relationships with other nations. More gravely,  some have spoken about the cost of  human life that any military action  would entail. These risks are real, but  these risks must be weighed against  the very real risks of delay.  The price of inaction is far too high.  Mr. President, 9/11 taught us that. We  will never know the complete economic  damage of the terrorist attacks of last  year. Some have estimated it at more  than $600 billion, but the true cost can  only be seen by looking in the eyes of  VerDate 0ct 02 2002  05:23 Oct 10, 2002 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09OC6.154 S09PT1 ",2002
393,,107,0.259,208,2002-10-09,Mrs. CAPITO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  remembrance  of Captain  Larry F.  Lucas,  United States Army. Captain Lucas, originally  from Marmet, West Virginia, served his country bravely in Vietnam as an Army Pilot. Sadly,  while on a reconnaissance mission over Laos,  Captain Lucas’ plane was shot from the sky  by anti-aircraft fire in December of 1966. Following military regulations, Captain Lucas ordered his co-pilot to eject from the plane first.  Regrettably, other pilots who witnesses  the  crash saw only one parachute. Despite appearing  to have remained  in  the plane,  the  Army would not conclude that Captain Lucas  had perished.  Captain Lucas never returned to the United  States alive. After many years his  remains  were miraculously found near the crash site a  few months ago. His  remains have been  transported back to the United States and on  November 1, 2002 he will receive a full military burial at Arlington National Cemetery.  Mr. Speaker,  I  firmly believe  that our nation’s strength as a world power comes from  citizens  like Captain Lucas. From an early  age, he displayed signs of strong leadership.  As an eagle scout in his childhood and then  as an ROTC cadet at West Virginia University,  Captain Lucas further developed these strong  qualities. Captain Lucas’ service to his nation  will never be forgotten.  It is an honor to commend Captain Lucas  on his service to the United States and to the  state of West Virginia. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON.

394,,107,0.638,8,2002-10-21,Mr. SCHAFFER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to the Archbishop Moeller High  School Student Government and its moderator  Brother Robert Flaherty, S.M. The Moeller  Student Government is an outstanding organization of student  leaders at  the  forefront of  youth statesmanship.  Archbishop Moeller High School  is a Cincinnati-based all-male Catholic high school. It  is among America’s  finest  secondary academic  institutions. Operated by  the Catholic  Archdiocese of Cincinnati, the school is staffed  and assisted by  the Society of Mary—the  Marianists. The school’s philosophy is based  on the ideas of Father William Chaminade, the  founder of the Marianist order.  Moeller has achieved national success  in  academics and athletics; and,  in developing  the spiritual character of its students. Christian  values, moral integrity, and a properly trained  conscience, combined with physical health, intellectual strength, and social responsibility define the men of Moeller. The Moeller Student  Government is one place these characteristics  come together and are perfected through authentic, meaningful exercises in practical leadership.  Brother Robert Flaherty has moderated the  Moeller Student Government for decades. He  has shepherded young leaders through character-building trials and errors and developed  a program  that serves more  than  the entire  school, but  the entire community. Under his  tutelage, boys are taught the principles necessary in becoming accomplished leaders of  men. The program raises, budgets, and appropriates considerable funds needed to support  events and activities designed to develop important life skills for the whole school.  Flaherty  is a devoted Marianist brother, a  dedicated Christian and a great American. He  is a compassionate counselor, a professional  teacher and a trusted, reliable friend to thousands. He has been the constant guide in the  formation  of  leadership  qualities  among  Moeller’s students.  According  to  its Constitution,  the Moeller  Student Government was founded in covenant  with the school’s administration. The studentled organization exists to inform the administration of  the needs of  the student body,  to  provide for the student participation in school  government, to foster school spirit, to promote  the general welfare of the students, and, ‘ ‘in  general to further Christianity.’ ’  Mr. Speaker, as the 1979 –80 student-body  president of the Moeller Student Government,  I am proud to recognize this outstanding organization  for  its excellence  in  leadership and  maintenance of various  traditions  that make  Moeller High School a first-class institution. I  am personally grateful  for  the  lessons  imparted  to me by  the school’s administration  and faculty, by my peers, but most of all, by  Bro. Flaherty. These instructions and accompanying skills clearly formed the foundation of  my own experiences and prepared me  to  serve  in  the United States Congress  representing the people of the great state of Colorado.  Mr. Speaker, the current leadership of the  Moeller Student Government consists of  the  following  students: President Tony Magner  ’03, Vice President Eric Shatzle ’03, Treasurer  Matt Takanen ’03, Recording Secretary Collin  Taylor  ’03, Corresponding Secretary Andy  Weisbrod  ’03,  and  Parliamentarian  Jason  Rahe ’03.  The Senior Class officers (’03) are President  Paul Gruber, Vice President Jason Bowman,  and Vice President Joe Kimener.  Junior Class officers (’04) include President  Paul Antenucci, Vice President Jack Novak,  and Vice President Ben Schonhoft.  Sophomore Class officer (’05) include President Mike Carter, Vice President Brian Bailey,  and Vice President Matt Tennant.  Together with an outstanding team of Freshman Class officers, these men comprise the  top leadership of the Moeller Student Government. They are  reinforced by other student  leaders who represent the homerooms of the  entire student body constituting  the General  Assembly, and appointed chairmen of various  student committees.  Mr. Speaker, the House has every right to  be proud of the Moeller High School Student  Government, Brother Robert Flaherty and the  Marianist Community. A splendid example of  student  leadership and Christian statesmanship, the Moeller Student Government is making a positive difference in the preparation of  the nation’s future community leaders.  It is upon the basis of these observations  and truths that I hereby ask the House to join  me in extending warmest congratulations and  heartiest commendations  to Brother Robert  Flaherty,  the student-leaders of  the Moeller  High School Student Government and the entire Moeller family. May they continue to thrive  and serve by  the blessings of  the Almighty  God of our country. f ON THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF  JEFFERSON DAVIS HIGH SCHOOL  HON. GENE GREEN  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 21, 2002 ",2002
395,,107,-0.324,8,2002-10-21,Mr. GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  commemorate the 75th anniversary of Jefferson Davis High School,  located  in Houston,  Texas. As a  teenager, growing up  in Houston’s North Side neighborhood,  I had  the  pleasure of attending this fine school.  Opened on November 2, 1926, the first senior class of 38 students graduated on May 30,  1927. Over the decades, this school has excelled in educating our youth, giving them the  skills they need to become leaders in the community, city, state, and nation.  The alumni of Jeff Davis are known for a  variety of achievements and accomplishments.  Many have served with distinction on our local  school board, City Council, state  legislature,  state Supreme Court, and  in  the U.S. Congress, as well as professionals in all fields— doctors, lawyers, architects, and engineers. It  has also produced nationally known entertainers, such as country and western star  Kenny Rogers.  In athletics, the fighting Panthers have excelled at every  level. Slater Martin  led  the  school to two state basketball championships  in 1942 and 1943. He went on to become an  All-American at the University of Texas, a key  contributor  on  several  championship Minneapolis (later Los Angeles) Laker teams, and  is enshrined in the NBA Hall of Fame. In the  international sports arena, several boxers from  Davis have excelled, including Jesse Valdez,  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

396,House,107,-0.256,10,2002-11-13,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, I first encountered this thing we call a continuing resolution when I was a young  officer in the Army working for the Assistant Secretary of Defense Comptroller.  I remember how  it was explained to me then by the DOD’s General Counsel. He said,  in effect, the  Congress is saying to us we have not  got our job done, we are a little embarrassed, so just keep spending money at  the level it is being spent until we can  catch up and get things done right.  This year, more than any year I have  ever seen or known about, we are deficient in doing our job. Eleven out of 13  appropriation  bills  have  not  been  passed. Let me just pick out four and  point out to Members the consequences  of having a continuing resolution in  lieu of a properly worked appropriation  bill.  Veterans medical care. If Members  are not aware that veterans are calling  their district offices and saying they  cannot get an appointment at veterans  hospitals in less than 6 months, Members have not been talking to their  ",2002
397,House,107,0.43,157,2002-11-13,Mr. BLUNT.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the majority leader for his kind comments and for yielding me the time.  I would like to engage in a short discussion with Chairman YOUNGon two  issues which are very important to me  and I feel need some clarification. This  relates  to  the  training of pilots  to  carry firearms in the cockpit of our  commercial airlines and to the training of cabin crew members in self-defense methods. As the House knows,  these provisions were included in this  bill; and I feel they are important provisions. However, I want to make clear  in my own mind and in the record that  these programs are not intended to be  a new cost factor for the Federal Government or for our economically challenged airline industry. I understand  they are voluntary. Just as our Constitution protects the rights of all citizens to own firearms for self-protection, we have provided the ability for  airline pilots  to voluntarily  request  that they be allowed to carry firearms  for the protection of their passengers  and crew while performing their duties  in flight and other cabin crew to be  trained in self-defense methods if they  choose to do so. Nevertheless, I want to  make sure the following is completely  clear:  One, the Federal Government and air  carriers  are not  obligated  to  compensate a pilot or cabin crew member  for participating in any training program, qualification or requalification  to carry a firearm or to train in self-defense.  Again,  the  word  there  is  ‘‘obligated.’’  It does not mean  that  they cannot do it at the airline level,  but they are not obligated to do it.  And, number two, these training programs cannot be an excuse or reason to  disrupt or otherwise interfere with any  carrier’s scheduled service. Therefore,  an air carrier will certainly not be required to disrupt its scheduled service  to accommodate a flight crew member’s training after that crew member  has already been scheduled for duty.  These  sections are not  intended  to  cause further operational burdens on  the airline industry. I just want to be  sure in my own mind in this discussion  with Chairman YOUNG that I understand what this does in a proper way.  ",2002
398,House,107,-0.421,164,2002-11-13,Mr. PASTOR.," Mr. Speaker, although I am a  strong supporter of  fully utilizing all possible  resources to combat this new and tragic war  on terrorism, I have serious reservations over  the proposal being presented to us today.  Realistically, this bill would do nothing more  than rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic.  What we really need is to address basic agency policies and promote efficient exchange of  information without diminishing critical agency  missions.  Keeping  major  intelligence  gathering  sources separated from this agency and moving desks across the hall, begs the question  as to what we will be accomplishing by this  move? Will it result in a smoother information  flow, not just from one Washington office to  another, but to the actual communities which  must have as much lead time as possible to  prepare for attack? Are we actually expanding  agency areas of  responsibility or will  it be  business as usual? What are we really doing  to ensure dam, water supply, energy sources,  and transportation safety? What are we really  doing to provide an enhanced capability to address hazardous material, chemical, or biological threats? What are we really doing to improve our risk, threat, and vulnerability assessments? What are we really doing to improve  the delivery of emergency food, shelter, and  medical care in the event of another tragedy?  Troublesome are  inconsistencies  found  in  the bill. For example,  is  the Administration’s  repeated statements that this bill would consolidate training programs, yet, under Section  403 we see the Department of Justice’s Office  of Domestic Programs which does COPS  training  being  placed  under  ‘Border  and  Transportation Security,’  while other  training  programs are being place under ‘ ‘Emergency  Preparedness and Response’  under Section  503.  Another example  is  found under Section  201(d)7, where the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection  is charged with exercising primary responsibility for public advisories related to threats to  homeland security, while in Section 214(g) it  states that the federal government may provide advisories, alerts, warnings  to  relevant  companies,  targeted sectors, other government entities, or the general public regarding  potential  threats. Where  is  the coordination  and are we creating  two separate sets of  warnings?  Questions have been raised on the coordination mechanism between Homeland Security officials and other Departments. For example,  if Homeland Security officials are designated  to establish research efforts and attempt to direct Department of Defense agencies on  those efforts, who actually has  final  authority?  In particular, I am troubled that this legislation offers so little to assist first responders,  the men and women on the street who willingly put  themselves  in harm’s way  for  the  greater good. We must ensure  that  these  dedicated citizens are provided with all possible resources to both protect them and support their mission.  I am hopeful that this legislation is defeated  and  the Congress continues  to consult with  experts  in a more circumspect manner and  that crafts a measured more approach  that  maximizes our ability  to anticipate, prevent,  and react to acts to terrorism.
