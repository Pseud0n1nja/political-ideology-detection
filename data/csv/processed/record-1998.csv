4,Senate,105,0.31,69,1,Mr. BOND.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today to recognize Missouri State Rep resentative Bonnie Sue Cooper for her  outstanding  contributions  to  the  American Legislative Exchange Coun cil (ALEC). As last year's chairwoman,  Bonnie Sue set a new leadership stand ard that will be a challenge for all fu ture chairpersons.  ALEC is the largest bipartisan, indi vidual membership association of State  legislators in the country. After serv ing as vice-chairwoman  for 2 years,  Bonnie Sue was voted chairwoman for  the 1997  term. According to Arkansas  Speaker of the House Bobby Hogue, ""In  the year Bonnie Sue has been chairman  there has been progress on every front  at ALEC. It has strengthened its policy  making operations and raised its pro file among both legislators and the pri vate sector."" Speaker Hogue replaced  Bonnie Sue as chairman.  Bonnie Sue has been an  incredible  leader, not only in the State of Mis souri, but also at a national  level.  I  enjoy seeing leadership of Bonnie Sue's  caliber and know that there are only  . bigger things to come for her. I con gratulate Representative Cooper on an other outstanding year and wish her  success in the future.   PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS   ",1998
5,Senate,105,-0.231,69,1,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, we con tinue  to see positive signs reflecting  the strength of our national economy.  Thirty-year mortgage  rates  remain  low, consumer confidence is high and  unemployment is down.  In the midst of these sustained posi tive  trends, America faces new chal lenges as we approach a new century.  Among them: meeting a critical need  for skilled technology workers and the  continuing effort to move more Ameri cans from welfare to work.  We are an innovative people and I'm  confident that we can meet new chal lenges, in part via public-private part nerships. One  of  the key people  in  America advancing the concept of pub lic-private partnerships  is Mr. Greg  Farmer. As Florida's Secretary of Com merce, Mr. Farmer pioneered public private partnerships at the state level,  doing more with less tax dollars.  Now  in  the  private  sector, with  Norte!, Mr. Farmer and his company  are helping provide high-tech equip ment to schools and technology train ing to help move people from welfare  to work. On  January  13,  1998, Mr.  Farmer  testified  before  the  Senate  Committee on Labor and Human Re sources.  I commend his  testimony to  my colleagues and all those interested  in  public-private  partnerships  as  a  means of reducing welfare dependency  and advancing job training. I respect fully ask that his testimony be printed  in the RECORD:  The testimony follows:  STATEMENT OF GREG FARMER, VICE PRES! .  DENT, GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND  INTER NATIONAL TRADE, NORTEL  Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee.  My name  is Greg Farmer, and I am Vice  President for Government Affairs and Inter national  Trade  for  Nortel  (Northern  Telecom). It gives me pleasure  to be with  you  this morning  to discuss  some of  the  things Nortel  is doing  in  the Washington,  D.C. area to help prepare inner city youth  for a fruitful life beyond high school, wheth er it be college or acquiring a special skill.  Bell Atlantic is a household word and all of  you  are  certainly  familiar with  it. You  might not be as well acquainted with Nortel  (even though-and I hesitate to say this in  case you had a telephone problem this morn ing-the Senate  does  have our  telephone  switch). Nortel is the leading global supplier  of fully digital network solutions and serv ices. We design, build and integrate digital  networks  that  communicate  voice,  data,  image and video for customers in the infor mation,  communications,  entertainment,  education, government and commerce mar kets. Our customers are local and long dis tance  telecommunications companies, busi nesses, universities, governments, cable tele vision companies, competitive  local access  providers,  Internet  services providers and  other network operators around the world.  We operate in 150 countries around the globe .  We have more employees in  the U.S.  than  anywhere else. Here, we are based in Nash ville, Tennessee and have major state-of-the art centers-including research and develop ment, manufacturing,  semiconductor  and  software-engineering  facilities-in  nine  other states. And we have sales and services  offices in every state of the union. We count  Bell Atlantic as a good customer, and I am  pleased to be on  the panel today with my  friend Bill Freeman.  Yesterday the Administration announced a  massive public-private effort aimed at high  tech training. This was in response to con cerns by economists and business  leaders  that U.S. companies have a critical shortage  of skilled  technology workers. The  initia tive, which will include millions of dollars in  grants to fund educational programs, comes  as a new survey shows that 1 in every 10 in formation  technology  jobs  in  the U.S.  is  unfulfilled.  This comes as no surprise  to Nortel. As  with other  telecommunications companies,  education and workforce development is an  essential part of Nortel's overall business  strategy.  Our  industry  requires  highly  skilled workers at even the most basic entry  level positions. We are constantly  looking  for opportunities to work with organizations  that provide training and enhance our work force.  The Administration ought to take a good  look at Capital Commitment. It is a stellar  example of a high  tech  training program  that works. It is a shiny gem; a diamond in  a  rusty crown. And I hope some of those  grants will go to Capital Commitment so it  can continue the incredible success it has en joyed in the past.  One only need hear the Ricky Mozee story  to understand the cascading good this pro gram has for individuals and for our commu nity. Ricky Mozee is a walking, talking wel fare-to-work  success  story. Before  finding  Capital Commitment in 1992, Ricky was a  drug and alcohol abuser, living on welfare in  the tough streets of Anacostia. In his own  words, he had no future; his family had no  future; he was afraid to dream. He was fight ing his addictions and looking at an 84 per cent unemployment rate in his community.  Then he found Capital Commitment. Today,  he has a high paying job as a telecommuni cations supervisor at National Airport. He  owns a house in suburban Maryland. He sup ports a wife and three children. He is a post er boy for what the future could be, if we get  it right.  When LaVerne and Ernest Boykin estab lished Capital Commitment in 1991, their vi sion  to  train  inner  city youth  in  tele communications and life skills and to facili tate  job opportunities  for  them resonated  ",1998
6,House,105,-0.376,82,1,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gen tleman  for yielding  to me.  I want  to express  my strong support for the passage of this leg islation.  Let me say at  the outset  that  I share  the  concerns which were  raised  by  the distin guished ranking member of the Committee on  International Relations, Mr. HAMIL TON, about  the inappropriate way in which this bill comes  to  the  floor of  the House  today. We should  have held hearings, and we should have had  proper consideration of this  legislation  in  the  Committee. There  is not such urgency in the  adoption of this  legislation that we could not  have followed regular procedures in the con sideration of this bill.  Having said  that, however, Mr. Speaker, I  want  to  indicate my strong  support  for S.  1564-the Holocaust Victims Redress Act.  I  want  to  thank my dear friend, Congressman  JIM LEACH, the Chairman of the Banking Com mittee, who  introduced a similar bill  in  the  House of Representatives and who has shown  great sympathy for this  issue. I also want to  thank my dear friend, Congressman BEN GIL MAN, the Chairman of the  International Rela tions Committee, for his efforts and support of  this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, the Holocaust Victims Redress  Act directs that the United States Government  support the contribution of all or of a substan tial portion of  the gold  remaining under  the  control of  the Tripartite Gold Commission  to  charitable organizations to assist survivors of  the Holocaust. It also authorizes the President  to obligate up to $30 million for such distribu tion.  It authorizes appropriations  for archival  research  to assist in  the  restitution of assets  looted  from Holocaust victims and  for other  activities  to  further Holocaust  remembrance  and education. The legislation urges efforts to  facilitate the return of private and public prop erty-primarily  works  of  art-which  were  seized during  the period of Nazi  rule  to  the  rightful owners in cases where the ownership  can be established.  Mr. Speaker,  it is most appropriate that we  take  the action proposed  in  this  legislation.  Thousands and  thousands of  the victims of  Nazi  terror suffered  the destruction of  their  lives, the murder of their family members, and  debilitating illnesses resulting from their unbe lievable hardships.  It  is only appropriate that  we acknowledge this suffering and take these  modest steps to assist the victims.  The Administration has indicated its support  for  the approach  that  this  legislation  takes.  The United States Government  recognizes  that a portion of the gold looted by the Nazis  contained a significant amount of gold stolen  or coerced from victims of the Holocaust. I am  delighted  that  the Administration  favors  the  proposal that the remaining gold, or most of it,  be contributed to the ""Special Persecutee Re lief Fund"" which was announced in December  1997, and  I welcome  the positive  reaction  from many of the potential donors to this fund.  I do hope, Mr. Speaker, that the neutral coun tries who received Nazi gold during the course  of World War II will also make generous con tributions to this fund. It is most appropriate in  view of the benefits they enjoyed as a result  of the Nazi gold that was moved to their coun tries during the war.  I am also pleased, Mr. Speaker, that the Ad ministration has shown United States leader ship by indicating our intention to participate in  this fund with a contribution of up to $25 mil lion. This should be an incentive for countries  which have claims under  the Tripartite Gold  Commission and countries which were neutral  in World War  II  to  join  in making significant  contributions  to  this  fund. Our contribution  is  indeed a modest amount-and I hope that our  participation will  increase-but I do hope that  it will encourage others.  Mr. Speaker, no amount of monetary  rep aration and no amount of recognition or ex pressions of sorrow can ever compensate for  the unspeakable suffering  that the victims of  the Holocaust have endured.  It  is  important,  however,  that we make  this gesture of rec ognition-regardless of how small  it  is in  the  face of the enormity of the  injustice against  these victims.  DREIER).  ",1998
7,House,105,-0.171,82,1,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker, I with draw my reservation of objection.  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  Is there objection to the re quest of the gentleman from Iowa?  There was no objection.  The Clerk read the Senate bill, as fol lows:  s. 1564  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ""Holocaust  Victims Redress Act"".  TITLE I-HEIRLESS ASSETS  SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.  finds as fol (a) FINDINGS.-The Congress  lows:  (1) Among the $198,000,000 in German assets  located in the United States and seized by  the United States Government in World War  II were believed to be bank accounts, trusts,  securities, or other assets belonging to Jew ish victims of the Holocaust.  (2) Among an estimated $1,200,000,000 in as sets  of Swiss  nationals  and  institutions  which were frozen by the United States Gov ernment during World War II (including over  $400,000,000  in bank deposits) were  assets  whose beneficial owners were believed to in clude victims of the Holocaust.  (3) In the aftermath of the war,  the Con gress recognized that some of the victims of  the Holocaust whose  assets were  among  those seized or frozen during the war might  not have any legal heirs, and legislation was  enacted  to authorize  the  transfer of up to  $3,000,000  of  such  assets  to  organizations  dedicated to providing relief and rehabilita tion for survivors of the Holocaust.  (4) Although the Congress and the Admin istration authorized  the  transfer of  such  amount to the relief organizations referred  to in paragraph (3),  the enormous adminis trative difficulties and cost involved in prov ing legal ownership of such assets, directly  or beneficially, by victims of the Holocaust,  and proving the existence or absence of heirs  of such victims, led the Congress in 1962  to  agree to a lump-sum settlement and to pro vide $500,000 for the Jewish Restitution Suc cessor Organization of New York, such sum  amounting  to 1/sth of the authorized max imum level of ""heirless"" assets to be trans ferred.  (5) In June of 1997, a representative of the  Secretary of State, in testimony before the  Congress, urged  the reconsideration of the  limited $500,000 settlement.  (6) While a precisely accurate accounting  of ""heirless"" assets may be impossible, good  conscience warrants the recognition that the  victims of the Holocaust have a compelling  moral claim to  the unresti tu ted portion of  assets referred to in paragraph (3).  (7) Furthermore, leadership by the United  States in meeting obligations to Holocaust  victims would strengthen(A) the efforts of the United States to press  for the speedy distribution of the remaining  nearly 6 metric tons of gold still held by the  Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of  Monetary Gold  (the  body  established  by  France, Great Britain, and the United States  at the end of World War II to return gold  looted by Nazi Germany to the central banks  of countries occupied by Germany during the  war); and  (B) the appeals by the United States to the  15 nations claiming a portion of such gold to  contribute a substantial portion of any such  distribution  to Holocaust survivors  in rec ognition of  the  recently documented  fact  . that the gold held by  the Commission  in cludes gold stolen from individual victims of  the Holocaust.  (b) PURPOSES.-The purposes of  are as follows:  (1) To provide a measure of justice to sur vivors of the Holocaust all around the world  while they are still alive.  (2) To authorize  the appropriation of an  amount which  is  at  least  equal  to  the  present value of the difference between the  amount which was authorized  to be  trans ferred  to  successor organizations  to com pensate for assets  in  the United States of  heirless victims of  the Holocaust and  the  amount actually paid in 1962  to the Jewish  Restitution Successor Organization of New  York for that purpose.  (3)  To  facilitate  efforts  by  the United  States  to seek an agreement whereby na tions with claims against gold held by the  Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of  Monetary Gold would contribute all, or a  substantial portion, of that gold  to chari table organizations to assist survivors of the  Holocaust.  this Act  SEC. 102.

(a) DIRECTIONS  TO  THE  PRESIDENT.-The  President shall direct the commissioner rep resenting  the United States on  the Tri partite Commission  for  the Restitution of  Monetary Gold, established pursuant to Part  III of the Paris Agreement on Reparation, to  seek and vote for a timely agreement under  ",1998
8,House,105,0.54,95,1,Mr. KINGSTON.," Mr. Speaker, last in  the hearts of the New York Times and  the Washington  Post,  first  in  the  hearts of his countrymen, that perhaps  is the most fitting description of Ron ald Reagan. He came into office after a  difficult decade, with humiliation  in  Iran  and  economic  tough  times  at  home. The Soviet Union was expanding  into Afghanistan and into our very own  backyard. Inflation was soaring, unem ployment was up, and also  that irre pressible  American  confidence  was  shaken.  But not Ronald Reagan's confidence.  He had  the courage  to stand up and  speak out for what was right. He had  the courage  to  face  the Soviet bear  right in the eye and say, back off.  Now that the Soviet Union is, as we  know it, dead and over with, Ronald  Reagan's legacy must stand proud and  tall. A fitting monument to him would  be naming the National Airport after  him so that when people come to our  Nation's capital, they can honor one of  America's greatest Presidents.

Last year  the  Democrats successfully fought to pass  legislation  that will  provide  health  care benefits to over 5 million children,  and both of  these bills were enacted  into law despite strong initial opposi tion from the Republican leadership.  Now, under  the President's  leader ship, Democrats are now poised to fight  for  two new health care  initiatives.  ",1998
10,,105,-0.367,147,1,Ms. SANCHEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  take this opportunity to honor a wonderful per son and a great American, on her 1 02nd birth day-Thelma Gammell.  Thelma is a joy to know. Perky, humorous,  and filled with the spirit of life. She was born  in Miller, South Dakota, and on October 9,  1895. Life was very different then. The United  States, itself, was just over 100 years old. Her  ancestors had migrated from Wales  in 1776,  during the Revolutionary War.  Life was very difficult and often hard. Thel ma, however, grew up  in a  family  that had  good values. They worked hard and they lived  the best they could with what  they had. Her  childhood was  filled with  horseback  riding,  dolls and  ""kitten playmates."" The winters on  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the prairie were long and cold, but Thelma en joyed playing in the snowdrifts with her sister.  In 1912 Thelma met with her husband, John  Gammell. They lived in several states includ ing North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana,  Wyoming and Nebraska. They had a son and  a daughter who were both born  in Wyoming.  In 1937  the Gammells moved  to Laguna  Beach, California, where John worked as a  carpenter and Thelma worked as a pottery de signer. After  retirement,  the Gammells  trav eled, visiting friends in the Midwest. After her  husband passed away  in 1967, Thelma be came active as a volunteer for the Santa Ana  Senior Center and has continued her dedi cated service for over 12 years.  Surely her secret to a long life must be her  warm and outgoing personality and her joy of  life. For Thelma Gammell life had been filled  with many wonderful memories. All who know  Thelma have been charmed by her presence.  Happy birthday and best wishes for a wonder ful year.  PROTECTION OF RELIGIOUS  FREEDOM IN THE WORKPLACE  HON. WILLIAM F. GOODUNG  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 27, 1998  ",1998
11,,105,0.336,147,1,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  to  introduce H.R. 2948,  legislation  that  re stores real protections to the religious convic tions of men and women  in  the workplace.  The  Workplace  Religious  Freedom  Act  (WRFA) would amend Title VII of  the 1964  Civil Rights Act to require employers to make  reasonable accommodation for an employee's  religious observance or practice unless doing  so would  impose an undue hardship on  the  employer. Currently,  the courts  interpret Title  VII  to  require  reasonable accommodation of  religious practices only where an employer  would not ""bear more than a de minimis cost.""  This bill  is a companion to S. 1124, which  was  introduced by Senators JOHN KERRY (0MA) and DAN COATS (R-IN), with an ideologi cally diverse group of cosponsors.  The version of the WRFA that  I introduce  today  is  intended  to reflect my concern with  the  instances of employers unreasonably re fusing to accommodate the religious needs of  workers. This is not a common problem, but it  is still a serious one. This bill  is intended as  a starting point, and  I do not necessarily en dorse all of its provisions. I wish to ensure that  businesses are not unduly burdened, while en suring  that workers'  rights are amply pro tected.  I hope my introduction of this bill will  foster a dialogue between  the business and  religious communities that achieves a bill ac ceptable to all.  The bill is endorsed by a wide range of or ganizations including: American Jewish Com mittee,  Baptist  Joint Committee,  Christian  Legal Society, United Methodist Church, Pres byterian Church (USA), Southern Baptist Con vention, Traditional Values Coalition, Seventh day  Adventists,  National  Association  of  Evangelicals, National Council of the Church es of Christ, National Sikh Center, and Union  of Orthodox Jewish Congregations. A com145  plete  list of the Coalition For Religious Free dom  In The Workplace  is attached  for  the  record.  I look forward to a healthy debate over this  legislation and its ultimate passage in a form  which  fairly balances the  legitimate needs of  both employees and employers.

WHY PHYSICIAN REFERRAL LAWS  ARE IMPORTANT  HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 27, 1998  ",1998
12,,105,-0.631,147,1,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker,  the January 9th  Federal Register contains the regulations im plementing the 1993 Physician Referral  laws,  designed to reduce or eliminate the incentives  for doctors to over-refer patients to services in  which the doctor has a financial relationship.  Study after study after study has shown that  when doctors have such a financial  relation ship,  they  tend  to order more services and  more expensive services. The Physician Re ferral laws try to stop this form of fraud, waste,  and abuse.  Members may hear complaints about  the  law and  regulations  from  some physicians.  Following is a portion of an amicus brief filed  in  the case of Thompson v. Columbia/HCA  December 12, 1996 by  three of America's  most distinguished and illustrious physicians Or. Arnold Reiman, Dr. C. Everett Koop, and  the late Dr. James S. Todd, former Executive  Vice President of the American Medical Asso ciation. The amicus explains eloquently why  this law is needed to help ensure the trust of  the American people  in  their physician com munity.  I hope Members will keep  in mind the  im portant ethical and moral issues described by  these three outstanding doctors.  ",1998

Thanks to the efforts of some civic-minded  groups in  the Bronx to meet the need for in creased education facilities and better prepare  the youth in the Bronix for real life, the Henry  Lou Gehrig  Intermediate School Microsociety  was established. In fact, the program prepares  6th grade students for high school after three  years. It gives them the opportunity to experi ence real life situations, explore career oppor tunities, become problem solvers, understand  the need for responsibility and develop leader ship ability.  Mr. Speaker,  the Henry Lou Gehrig  Inter mediate School Microsociety also encourages  the youth of our Bronx to share time and en ergy with neighborhood  improvement groups  and programs  for youth  in our community.  They gain strength, hope and leadership skills  through  united  community  involvement.  Through Microsociety  setting,  students  are  able to choose jobs in their area of interest.  Mr. Speaker,  I have  the privilege of  rep resenting the 16th district of New York where  the Henry Lou Gehrig  Intermediate School  Microsociety is located and I am delighted by  its success.  I ask my colleagues  to  join me  in paying  tribute  the Henry  Lou Gehrig  Intermediate  School Microsociety, to the administration and  faculty, and  to  the students, whose ambition  and hard work will make this great institution  a tremendous source of pride and success for  years to come.

14,,105,0.39,160,1,Mr. KIM.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recog nize and honor one of California's  true pio neers-George Chaffey Jr., on the 150th anni versary of his birth.  George Chaffey Jr., who was born on Janu ary 28, 1848, emigrated with his  family  to  Southern California  from Canada  in  1880,  went on to found the communities of Etiwanda  and Ontario, as well as developing what are  now the cities of Ontario, Upland and Rancho  Cucamonga. Additionally Mr. Chaffey founded  the California cities of Imperial, and Calexico,  as well as the Australian Cities of Mildura and  Renmark.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  In Etiwanda, now a part of modern day Ran cho Cucamonga, George Chaffey became the  first person west of the Rocky Mountains  to  design and  install a hydroelectric power sys tem to generate electricity that lit two towering  3,000 candlepower arc lights on his property.  The  Chaffey-Garcia  house  in  Rancho  Cucamonga was  the  first  in Southern Cali fornia  to use Edison's electric  incandescent  lamps. Chaffey also  installed  the world's first  long-distance telephone lines, and founded the  first mutual water company in California.  In Ontario, Chaffey integrated his  four key  principles: wide-scale  irrigation of  the  land,  construction of one main thoroughfare, estab lishment of Chaffey College as a branch of the  University of southern California and prohibi tion of liquor sales.  In 1901 George Chaffey designed and built  150 miles of canal from the Colorado River to  Imperial California.  In 1942, ten years after his death, the U.S.  Navy  launched a Liberty Ship  in San Pedro  named the SS George Chaffey.  It is an honor to pay tribute to this dedicated  individual who through his vision and foresight  helped to make the Inland Empire, and indeed  California the dynamic and liveable places that  they are today.

We know  that at this  point about 1.5 million abortions are per formed each year in the United States. And  we know that the fight over whether legal ized abortion should continue has not waned  with  time, as many thought it would, but  grown.  The debate has  always been  by  adults  about adults. What are the effects on women  when they terminate a pregnancy? Do they  suffer unusual depression a year or two after  the procedure?  Opponents of abortion also talk about the  effects of abortion on the fetus being abort ed. Does it feel pain?  But there is another group of children who  have  been  overlooked  in  the debate-the  children who have grown up in the abortion  culture, the children now 10 or 15 or even 20  years old who have had  it drummed  into  them by  television and radio and in maga zines, what abortion is and why and how it  became  legal. It is part of the aural wall paper of  their  lives. They have grown up  knowing phrases like ""abortion on demand""  and ""the right to abortion"" and hearing nice  adults, the people next door, talk about sup porting politicians who will ""protect"" these  ""rights.""  I wonder if such talk has not left many of  these children confused, so deeply that they  do not even know  they are confused, and  morally dulled.  We all know the recent horror stories. Ac cording to prosecutors and news accounts, a  January 27, 1998  girl at a prom delivers a baby in the bath room and lets it die, then rearranges herself,  washes up and goes back to the dance. A pair  of college-aged lovers from ""good families""  in ""pricey suburbs,"" as news accounts put it,  rent a motel room, where he delivers their  child, which they throw into a Dumpster.  Is it too much to see a connection between  the abortion culture  in which  these young  people came of age and the moral dullness  they are accused of displaying? Of course,  such crimes have occurred throughout time;  history and literature are full of them. But  what is new, I think, is the apparent surprise  of the young girl at the prom, and of the  young  couple at  the motel,  at  the  dis approval society has shown toward them.  And why should society disapprove? What,  after all, is the difference between what the  girl at the prom is accused of doing and a  late-term  abortion,  something  she would  have heard discussed, explained and defended  on television and in the newspaper?  A late-term abortion means pulling a fully  formed but not yet born baby out of  the  womb, piercing its brain with scissors, suck ing out the brain, collapsing the skull and  then removing the dead baby. In the girl's  home state, New Jersey, this was legal. Why  wouldn't she  think  there  is no difference,  really, between that and choking a baby to  death in a bathroom stall and then dropping  it in a  trash bin? And what,  in fact,  is the  difference? Only that one death occurred in a  bathroom stall, and the other happened in a  hospital with clean white sheets and a doc tor.  Consider,  too,  the young couple  in  the  motel and the reasoning that may have left  them free of any sense of sin or crime. If the  accusations are true, what did they do that  was wrong besides refuse to suck into life an  inconvenient baby? Isn't that what the cul ture they were born into, and grew to young  adulthood in, does?  I  think  that's the great  ignored story what we have done to our children by legal izing abortion and championing it. The daily  abortion stories and abortion polls and abor tion editorials and abortion pictures and sto ries showing how the movement to ""protect  these rights"" is faring-all this has drummed  into their heads the idea that human life is  not special,  is not sanctified,  is not a  life  formed by God but a  fertilized ovum  that  makes demands and can be removed.  What we  teach  the young every day  is  moral confusion about the worth of an ordi nary human life. This has wounded, in a very  real and personal way, big pieces of an entire  generation. And I suspect it has left them  frightened, too.  IN MEMORY OF DAVID E. PHILIPS  HON. SAM GEJDENSON  OF CONNECTICUT  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 27, 1998  ",1998
16,,105,-0.416,160,1,Mr. GEJDENSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  with great sadness to pay tribute to David E.  Philips, a man who will be  long remembered  as a unique person who enjoyed sharing his  many talents, not only with those close to him,  but with his entire community.

17,House,105,0.547,173,1,Mr. RYUN.," Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago  this week,  the North Vietnamese and  the Viet Cong  launched what  is now  known as the Tet Offensive. During the  Vietnam War a  cease-fire was  tradi tionally  observed  during  the Viet namese holiday, Tet. Both sides of the  Vietnam War agreed to a cease-fire to  extend from January 27 to February 2,  1968. However,  the North Vietnamese  and the Viet Cong broke their agree ment and  launched a massive attack  during  this week. The Viet Cong as sault team began the attack by breach ing the walls of the United States Em bassy  in Saigon. The  entire attack  lasted 2 weeks and took 1,000 American  soldiers' lives.  I have introduced a  resolution hon oring the Members of the United States  Armed Forces who  either  fought or  were killed during  the Tet Offensive  and the families of the service mem bers who were killed or injured during  that fighting. I ask my colleagues to  join in honoring our service members  who died 30 years ago during this offen sive.  BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR  HEALTH CARE INITIATIVES  (Mr. PALL ONE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1998
18,House,105,0.591,173,1,Mr. HEFLEY.," Mr. Speaker, they said  it could not be done. Thirty-eight years  as a team without winning the big one,  and they said it could not be done. For  13 years  the National Football Con ference dominated the American Con ference  in  the Super Bowl and  they  said the American Football Conference  could not do  it. Four previous  times  the  thundering herd  from  the Mile  High City had charged up to the sum mit only to come down with a  thud,  and some said it could not be done.  When they lost the last three games of  the season, many said they were fin ished, another year of disappointment.  Again, it could not be done. Wild card  teams do not get to the big game, they  sure do not win it.  Well, the experts said they cannot do  it. But I say to my colleagues,  these  that said  it could not be done were  wrong. They did  it. The Broncos are  world champions.  I guess it could be  done after all.

He further said  that the IRS is now starting a new pro gram. Check this out: Under this new  program,  the  IRS  district  director  must approve all  seizures. Unbeliev able. The IRS district director is now  ",1998
20,House,105,-0.408,186,1,Mr. ENGEL.," I want to thank my col league from New Jersey for giving us  this  opportunity  and my  colleague  from Connecticut. You  are  both  so  right. When we talk about health care,  it strikes me  there  is no Democratic  health care or Republican health care.  There is an American health care, and  all Americans of all political stripes, of  all persuasions, of all races and creeds  and colors and regions of the country  are all concerned about  their health  care. When I speak to my const.ituents,  I know  that health care  is  right up  there in terms of things that people are  very much concerned about.  My mother, her name is Seroy Engel,  she  lives in Tamarac, Florida. She  is  actually  in  the hospital now as we  speak. She is my best advisor in terms  of health care and Medicare and she  tells me, what are people to do? People  in  this country,  senior citizens who  have worked hard all their lives, played  by  the rules, are retired and they do  not  have  adequate  health  coverage.  Medicare does not pay for prescription  drugs. People have  to decide whether  they are going  to eat or  take  their  pills. Sometimes they eat half as much  as they should eat and only take half  as many pills as they need to take for  medical  reasons because  they simply  cannot afford it.  What is happening is that we are not  doing the job. The government is not  doing the job.  I want to really take my hat off to  the President of the United States be cause I think that last night he made  some  very  bold  statements  about  health care. Several years ago when he  put forth his program for health care  reform, I supported that program. I am  a supporter of the single payer plan as  well because I believe that we need to  cover every American in this country,  that it is a national scandal  that 40  million Americans have no health cov erage whatsoever. Of those 40 million  Americans, people do not  realize,  20  percent of them are working people. It  is not people who are unemployed. It is  working people that do not have health  care coverage. To me that is a national  disgrace. We could do better in 1998, as  we approach  the 21st century in this  country.  I want to commend President Clinton  for  raising  the  issue of health care.  When his health care plan was shot  down for a few years, no one wanted to  touch health care with a 10-foot pole.  But now we understand that we have to  do it. I am just so proud of the Demo crats here in the House because we are  grabbing the bull by the horns and we  are saying to the American people, we  think health care is a priority.  We  talked about managed care  re form. We are listening to our constitu ents. Our colleague,  the gentlewoman  from Connecticut, is so right. Many of  these decisions should be made by med ical doctors based on what is best for  the patient, not what is best for  the  private dollar,  the almighty dollar or  the bottom line.  We  understand  that people  are  in  business to make money, but if you are  providing health care, the bottom line,  the most important thing is the health  care of  that patient. That  is  really  what it should be. So I think that we  have a  lot of problems  to  tackle  in  terms of health care.  We participated in a  forum several  weeks ago about  the President's pro posed expansion of Medicare.  It was  very  interesting  because  yesterday  when the President mentioned it dur ing the State of the Union and said he  was for expanding Medicare for people  who are 62 to 65 or people who are over  55 who have  lost their  jobs and that  these people would pay their own pre miums so it would cost the government  nothing,  the Democrats stood up and  applauded. I was really very surprised  that on the other side of the aisle the  Republicans did not applaud. They just  sat there as if they were in opposition  to his program.  I have  to tell you, when I speak to  my constituents,  they all think it is  marvelous because people who are 62  and have no coverage, they are at great  risk. And people who have  lost their  jobs at 55,  they are at great risk. And  the Medicare program, we  know we  have  to  improve it. And we know we  have to get at waste, fraud and abuse.  But we do know that before there was  a Medicare program, the vast majority  of senior citizens in this country had  inadequate or no health care coverage  whatsoever. And since Medicare  they  do have health care coverage. Some of  it is inadequate, but at least it is cov erage. If we can extend that and at no  cost to the government or even a mini mal cost to the government, it is not  so terrible. If it is a minimal cost to  the government, I am all for it. I think  the American people are all for it.  I  think  the Democratic Party has  shown that it is on the side of the peo ple,  the Democrats in  this House, by  coming out very forthrightly  in sup port of it. So when we talk about the  whole issue in this Congress, and I hope  we will,  talk about managed care re form,  talk about Medicare expansion,  talk about giving health care to 40 mil lion Americans that do not have it, I  think we ought to be proud to tackle  these issues because health care affects  everybody, and everybody is concerned  with health care.  And so I want to really just commend  my colleague for raising the issue, and  the President yesterday again brought  it to the fore. I think it is something  the American people care about and  want to talk about.  I think hand in hand the other issue  that the President mentioned which I  think goes hand and glove with health  care is Social Security, because as peo ple get older,  they care about Social  Security and  they care about health  care. I think the President saying that  if there  is any kind of surplus  that  every dollar of surplus would go  to  shore up the Social Security system, I  think 90 percent at least of Americans  would agree with that.  So I look forward to working in this  Congress to shore up the Social Secu rity system, if there is a surplus, and if  there is not a surplus we know we need  to shore it up anyway and to work on  improving health care in this country.  We have  the greatest system  in  the  world in terms of health care, but we  know along  the way  there are  still  some problems. I believe that a coun try that can do so much, as we can do,  ought to very basically provide decent  health care for all of our citizens.  I  look forward to working with the  White House and with  the President  and with  the Democrats in CongTess,  and  hopefully  the Republicans will  come along and work with us in a bi partisan fashion so that we can provide  the kind of health care to all Ameri cans that all Americans know we need.  ",1998
21,House,105,-0.569,199,1,Mr. OWENS.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to begin by bringing America's at tention to the name of a young lady.  No, it is not a young lady who was an  intern  in  the White House.  It is  a  young lady who is now dead as a result  of negligence on the part of our sys tem. Her name is Yanahan Zhao. She is  a 16-year-old girl who was killed after  bricks fell from a scaffolding at PS-131  in Brooklyn.    I think it is very important that we  note that Yanahan Zhao may not be  the only student that has been killed  in this kind of accident, but certainly  this one we know about,  it was  re ported. It has high visibility. Any time  a child is killed in New York City, it  gets high visibility. A city that often  ignores the conditions under which stu dents and children are  laboring from  day to day will focus a lot of attention  on a child that is killed.  So death was cruel, and our concerns  and prayers we offer to the family of  Yanahan Zhao. But I think we ought to  understand that we should use her as  an example of what we do not want to  happen again. We  do not want any where in America a student killed by  bricks falling from the scaffolding of a  school, or we  do not want any one  American student killed as a result of  a building decaying or fixtures falling  or any other matter. We do not want  students killed and hurt.  Yanahan Zhao becomes a motto for a  school  construction  initiative  that  ought to spread all across America. We  have  to declare a state of emergency  and assume  that we have a  state of  emergency with respect to infrastruc ture, construction and everything re lated  to  infrastructure with  schools.  We have to listen to the General Ac counting Office when  they  say  that  more than $100 billion is needed to deal  with updating  the  infrastructure  of  public schools across the country. We  have to listen.  I have a few other examples of some  outrageous things that have happened  with respect to school construction or  the  lack of  it. At East New York's  Transit Technical High School, a wide  swath of brick facade broke free from  the building and came crashing down  to  the sidewalk. The only reason no  one was injured is that it was Martin  Luther King's birthday holiday,  and  the children were not in school. That is  the only reason we did not have mas sive  injuries. This wall, according  to  the report of the New York Times of  January 23rd, this wall weighed 10 tons.  The bricks  in  that wall weighed 10  tons, measuring about 500 square feet.  That  is  the wall  that  fell  from  the  school. Fortunately school was out and  no one was hurt.  According to the same article in the  New York Times of January 23rd,  the  city  construction  officials  had  in spected that school and found it safe  just 5 days before a wide swath of the  brick facade  fell. They said that the  school, East New York Transit Tech nical School, had been  inspected at  least three times in the last 5 months,  most recently last Friday. The last in spection was one of nearly 200 that had  been conducted by the city's building  department at schools throughout the  city after debris, variously described as  brick or cinder block, tumbled from a  construction site atop of a Brooklyn el ementary school, cracking the skull of  16-year-old Yanahan Zhao, who  later  died from that injury.  I think it is important also to note  that New York City has, of course, 1,100  schools, 1 million students. You expect  things like that to happen, some people  say, cynically dismissing  the signifi cance of this.  But across the country, having these  same accidents, that get less publicity.  At Phoenix, Arizona, at a Phoenix pre paratory academy, a large piece of fire proofing material tore away from the  metal decking of a second floor com puter room, hitting the teacher.  At  Blake  Elementary  School  in  Lakeland,  Florida,  a  student  was  struck on the head when loose mortar  fell from over a doorway.  A  second grade  teacher at Wash ington Elementary School in Spokane,  Washington, was hit on the head and is  still suffering nightmares after fluores cent lights peeled from the ceiling and  crashed  in her classroom. The  thou sand-pound metal fixture smashed onto  her desk and across a small rug where  students were gathered. Fortunately  the students were not injured.  At Grande Hills High School in Los  Angeles, California,  six students and  two  teachers were  struck by boards  that fell from the roof of their build ing.  And I am sure it goes on and on, and  I would like to invite other Members  on both sides of the aisle to gather up  these statistics, do a survey on what is  happening with the buildings in their  districts. This is not a pie-in-the-sky  proposition that we  should spend far  more money than has been proposed on  school construction.  I want  to sing my praises  for  the  State of the Union address. It was a  great address. It offered platforms and  programs that I certainly agree with.  The education initiatives, I think, that  were proposed by  the President are  magnificent. Most of the initiatives are  really needed. But I want to argue here  today, and  the reason  I am here so  early in the year, I want to make the  case that we keep our eye on the core  of the problem, that school construc tion and the infrastructure of schools  is central  to any effort  to  improve  America's schools.  There are a lot of other things that  are proposed in the President's set of  initiatives that can happen if you do  not have first attention and most at tention directed at  school  construc tion. You cannot have a  reduction of  teachers, a reduction of classroom size  so that you have fewer students in the  classroom, if you do not have the class rooms.  ",1998

Let me start and make  the points  that I came here to make because I do  believe  that  some  important  issues  were raised by the President last night  in the State of the Union Address, and  they are points that are worthwhile to  go back and look at for just a minute.  One change that has occurred here in  Washington  in  the . time  I have been  hereand it was very clear last night  when  I  listened  to  the President-is  that we now have a consensus; at least  a majority agree  that education  is a  national  responsibility as well  as  a  State and local responsibility. I can re member very  recentlyand you still  hear people say  this, but not many  anymore-but I can remember when a  substantial number of people used  to  say education  is not an appropriate  issue  for  the Federal Government  to  concern itself with.  Clearly, it is a great concern for the  people I represent in New Mexico, and  it is a great concern for working fami lies  all  over  this  country;  but  ""it  should not be a concern for people who  come to Washington to make the laws  or to appropriate funds or to allocate  ",1998

HAMILTON  OF INDIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 28, 1998  ",1998
30,,105,-0.171,329,1,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  insert my Washington Report for Wednesday,  November 19, 1997 into the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD.  GLOBAL WARMING AND THE KYOTO SUMMIT  Later this year the United States will par ticipate  in  an  international meeting  in  Kyoto, Japan to discuss the problem of glob al warming. Global warming refers to a proc ess by which manmade and natural emis sions of carbon dioxide and other gases build  up in the Earth's atmosphere and trap radi ated heat coming from  the Earth's surface.  Normally, forests, grasslands and oceans ab sorb most of these gases and recycle them so  that while global  temperatures might  fluctuate  over  time,  the  overall  system  would be in balance.  The large-scale industrial development in  this country and around the world, particu larly in the last 100 years, many be upsetting  that natural balance. Scientists believe that  man  is now generating more greenhouse  gases than the environment can handle, thus  causing global temperatures to rise. Over the  last century  the Earth's  average  surface  temperature has increased by about 1 degree  Fahrenheit. While one degree may not seem  like much, it can mean significant changes  in sea levels, crop harvests and weather pat terns. For example, sea levels over the last  100 years have risen by 4 to 6 inches, result ing in thousands of miles of lost shoreline  around the world.  The issue for U.S. leaders is how to respond  to global climate change. Environmentalists  and our allies in the industrialized world are  urging the U.S. to take the lead in curtailing  greenhouse gas emissions, primarily because  we generate more of those gases than anybody else. Others say that limiting emissions  in this way would have harmful effects on  the U.S. economy and U.S. consumers. The  challenge is to develop a policy which bal ances concerns about the global environment  with  concerns  about  our  economic well being.  The risks of global warming: Scientists gen The global debate: There are  erally agree that manmade emissions have  an  impact on  the global environment, but  are uncertain about  the precise effects of  human activity over time. They say that the  range of possible outcomes  is enormous from modest benefits  in  some  regions  to  total disaster  in others. For example, we  know that greenhouse gas emissions are up  by 3.4% for 1996, as compared to an 8% com bined increase over the previous six years,  and that the ten warmest years on record  have all occurred since 1980. We don't know,  however, how much  those manmade emis sions  contributed  to  the  temperature  in crease.  The effects of global warming have been  well documented, from the shrinking of gla ciers and rise  in sea  levels,  to changes  in  weather patterns. Higher average  tempera tures mean more  evaporation  of  surface  water, causing drought in some areas of the  world and abnormally heavy rainfall in other  areas. Some  scientists predict more  dra matic changes in the future. In the Midwest,  for example, some are predicting that the  Great Lakes will shrink, that the region will  experience more unpredictable and violent  weather patterns, and that over time Indiana  farmers will have to shift to growing wheat  and cotton rather than corn and soybeans.  two sets of  issues arising from any plan to curtail emis sions of greenhouse gases. The first involves  disputes between countries that are industri alized, such as the United States, Japan and  Germany,  and  those  that are developing,  such as China and India. Industrialized coun tries account for more than 75% of carbon di oxide emissions, primarily from burning gas oline  and other  fossil  fuels. The United  States alone produces 20% of all greenhouse  gases, even though we have only 4% of the  world's population. Developing countries, in  contrast, account for  less  than 33% of all  global emissions, but that figure is expected  to reach 50%  in the next 10 years. The U.S.  takes the position that an agreement to re duce greenhouse gases will be effective only  if both  the  industrialized and developing  countries agree to curb future level's of emis sions. The developing countries respond that  such restrictions will deny them the benefits  of future economic growth, and keep  their  people poor  relative  to  the  industrialized  world.  The second set of issues relates to how a  global agreement would affect the U.S. econ omy and U.S. consumers. U.S. businesses say  that an  agreement would  force  them  to  adopt expensive pollution control methods,  and that those costs would be passed on to  consumers in the form of higher prices on  gas, electricity and other goods. The net ef fect would be to slow economic growth and  cut  jobs. Environmentalists  respond  that  U.S.  industry made similar warnings about  passage of the Clean Air Act, and those pre dictions did not come true.

31,,105,0.162,355,1,Mrs. ROUKEMA.," Mr. Speaker, it is a sad re ality that today's headlines are filled with sto ries that spring from the everyday struggle of  working  families  to secure safe and depend able child care. The startling reality is the daily  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  struggle of working women and men to secure  affordable and safe child care.  The  trends  in  society and  the American  workforce are clear. More families have both  parents working. In today's society, many fam ilies need to have two parents working just to  make ends meet. A 1995 study by the Fami lies and Work Institute found  that 55 percent  of the women  interviewed contributed half or  more of their household income. Three out of  five women with children under age 6 are  working, and must  find someone to care  for  their children.  That burden  is a heavy one and becomes  even more burdensome when reliable, quality  child care is not available.  Mr. Speaker, President Clinton has correctly  identified child care as a growing American  crisis-a crisis that affects both the quality of  our citizens' work and the quality of their lives.  However, I regret that Mr. Clinton's broad pre scription implies a centralized government so lution  to a problem  that should be solved  in  each  local community. At a  time when  this  Congress is struggling to complete the task of  balancing the budget,  the President has pro posed a laundry list of tax changes, subsidies,  block grants and Washington-driven standards  at a cost of nearly $22 billion. Some of these  proposals have merit and deserve extended  analysis and debate.  Mr. Speaker, there is another way that is far  more feasible and immediately affordable.  The legislation which I am introducing, legis lation that will encourage a new public-private  partnership between local school districts and  businesses to develop community-based solu tions to meet local child care needs. This inno vative legislative initiative will be in the form of  grants  to  local education agencies  that are  able to show the community's needs and com mitment to a new child care program.  This legislation does not mandate a Federal  program  for child  care  that  imposes some  Washington-based requirements on local com munities. In fact, this bill combines the concept  of state and local control of education with the  time-tested concept of the public-private part nership. This bill makes  it possible  for  local  schools and businesses  to work  together  to  create  their  own  program  that meets  the  needs of their own community, whatever they  may be.  Specifically, the  legislation would create a  competitive grant program, administered by  the Department of Education. The program  would provide one-time start-up grants directly  to  local school districts  to explore and plan  child care programs  for children up  to  five  years old. Schools would be required to match  these grants with private  funds. The  ""seed""  money could only be used  for planning and  implementation of child care programs by local  school systems and private businesses, not  for construction or building renovation.  My  legislation:  (1) Creates a competitive  grant program administered by  the Depart ment of Education;  (2} provides a one-time  start-up grant directly to school districts; (3) is  available for programs providing care for chil dren ages 0 to 5 (or age of compulsory school  education);  (4)  expects  a  commitment  of  matching private dollars of 50% of the funding;  (5) cannot be used for building construction or  renovation.  353  This is not an untested concept.  My legislation is based on a model program,  the  ""Infant Toddler Development Center,""  which has operated successfully for more than  15 years in my Congressional District.  It was initiated by Kathy Marino, a teacher/  principal  in Ridgewood, New Jersey and has  attracted much-deserved praise.  It is the pro totype of the grant proposal  I am  introducing  here today.  We need  to help  families solve  the child  care problem. And we need to give local com munities the means to put their proposals to  the test. If we want our children to get a head  start in life, we must improve child care in this  nation. Child care must be available and  it  must be affordable but most of all  it must be  of high quality, both  in  terms of safety and  educational benefits.  IN MEMORY OF JAMES C.  KIRKPATRICK  HON. IKE SKELTON  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 28, 1998  ",1998
32,,105,-0.172,355,1,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I wish to take  a moment today to speak about a man of dis tinguished civic service and professional integ rity. Missouri's  ""Mr. Democrat,""  James C.  ""Jimmy"" Kirkpatrick, former Missouri Secretary  of State, recently passed away at the age of  92.  A native of Braymer, MO, Kirkpatrick grad uated from Northeast High School  in Kansas  City and Central Missouri State University in  Warrensburg, MO. After studying journalism at  the University of Missouri, Kirkpatrick became  interested in the news business. From 1954 to  197 4, Kirkpatrick owned and operated several  Missouri newspapers. He started his career at  the Warrensburg Daily Star-Journal and rose  to be editor of that newspaper. Later, he be came editor of the Jefferson City News-Trib une, then purchased the weekly Windsor Re view and later the weekly Lamar Democrat, in  the town of Harry S. Truman's birth.  While editing the Jefferson City newspaper,  Kirkpatrick was approached by then-Governor  Forrest Smith  to write a newspaper column  and speeches  for Missouri's chief executive.  That is what really got him interested in poli tics, which became his legacy.  Jimmy Kirkpatrick first ran for statewide of fice in 1960, when he lost his bid to become  Missouri Secretary of State to rising Democrat  star Warren Hearnes. He won  the  job  four  years later, in 1964, when Hearnes was elect ed governor. Kirkpatrick was re-elected to his  post as Secretary of State until his retirement  in 1985. During his  tenure, he  received 8.4  million votes, making him Missouri's greatest  statewide vote-getter since statehood.  In his  twenty  year  tenure, Kirkpatrick made over  1900 speeches which kept him very close to  the  constituents about which  he  cared  so  deeply.  In 1985, Kirkpatrick retired to Warrensburg,  MO, whereupon he became the statehouse's  most familiar booster of Central Missouri State  University.  In  fact, he served for 12 years on  the university's Board of Regents,  including  ",1998
33,Senate,105,-0.309,381,1,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, on Janu ary  25,  1998,  this past Sunday,  the  President  of  Georgia,  Eduard  Shevardnadze,  celebrated  his  70th  birthday.  President  Shevardnadze  is  one of the central international polit ical figures of our age, and has been  pivotal  in  the  transformation of  the  communist Soviet empire into a group  of nation states which have now em braced the goals of individual freedom,  democratic processes, and free market  economics. It is noteworthy that this  transformation, the dismantling of an  empire with  large  intelligence  and  military forces, and with a history of  inbred hostility toward the West, oc curred absent any violent confronta tion with the United States, or our Eu ropean allies.  Much of the credit for  this peaceful  transformation, the ending of the Ber lin Wall and the cooperation between  the Soviet leadership and  the United  States on major arms control and re duction agreements, rightfully belongs  to the enlightened and forceful person ality of Mr. Shevardnadze. His role em phasizes the crucial part played by per sonalities in the shaping of the major  events of human history. He serves as  an example that history is shaped to a  large extent by individual men, rather  than by social movements or economic  imperatives.  For  instance, Russian  cooperation  with the United States in working to  condemn, and then oust, Saddam Hus sein's forces from  their occupation of  Kuwait was to a large extent due to the  courageous  support  of  Mr.  Shevardnadze in the face of opposition  from forces in Russia which wanted to  preserve a historic Russian-Iraqi alli ance. His help in establishing a cooper ative  relationship with  the United  States regarding the invasion of Iraq  actually forced Gorbachev's hand and  trumped the Soviet security bureauc racies.  It has been well documented  that Shevardnadze quickly  shed  the  negative approach  to East-West rela tions that was the hallmark of former  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Gro myko when Shevardnadze  took over  the Foreign Ministry of  the Soviet  Union in 1985. Both former Secretaries  of States George Shultz and  James  Baker have written extensively about  Shevardnadze  and  praised his many  contributions to the ending of the cold  war. As a  former U.S. Ambassador to  the Soviet Union, Jack Matlock, has  written in the September 25, 1997, issue  of the ""New York Review of Books,""  ""If Gorbachev had been served by a less  imaginative  and  courageous  foreign  minister it is doubtful  that the cold  war could have been ended as rapidly  and definitively as it was.""  Shevardnadze served as Soviet For eign Minister from 1985-1991, and pre sided over the rapid transformation of  East-West relations and the end of the  cold war. It was, as I have said, an ex traordinary era in which we have all  been fortunate to participate in and to  witness. In 1991, Eduard Shevardnadze  resigned as Soviet Foreign Minister in  protest over what he perceived as the  coming of a military dictatorship  in  Russia, and he returned to his native  Georgia. Georgia was in an advanced  state of shambles, with  the economy  ",1998
34,Senate,105,0.23,407,1,Mr. CAMPBELL.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am introducing the Bulletproof  Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998, a  bill to establish a matching grant pro gram to help State, Tribal and local ju risdictions purchase armor vests  for  the use by law enforcement officers. I  also am working with my colleague,  Senator LEAHY, on an expanded version  of body armor legislation.  There are far too many law enforce ment officers who patrol our streets  and neighborhoods without the proper  protective gear against violent crimi nals. As  a  former deputy  sheriff,  I  know first-hand  the  risks which  law  enforcement officers face everyday on  the front lines protecting our commu nities.  Today, more than ever, violent crimi nals have bulletproof vests and deadly  weapons at their disposal. In fact, fig ures from the U.S. Department of Jus tice indicate that approximately 150,000  law enforcement officers-or 25 percent  of the nation's 600,000 state and local  officers-do not have access to bullet proof vests.  The evidence is clear that a bullet proof vest is one of the most important  pieces of equipment that any law en forcement officer can have. Since the  introduction of modern bulletproof ma terial, the lives of more than 1,500 offi cers have been  saved by bulletproof  vests. In fact, the Federal Bureau of In vestigation has concluded that officers  who do not wear bulletproof vests are  14 times more likely to be killed by a  firearm  than  those  officers who  do  wear  vests.  Simply put,  bulletproof  vests save lives.  Unfortunately, many police depart ments do not have  the  resources  to  purchase vests on their own. The Bul letproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of  1998 would  form  a  partnership with  state and local law enforcement agen cies in order to make sure that every  police officer who needs a bulletproof  gets one. It would do so by authorizing  up  to $25 million per year for a new  grant program within the U.S. Depart ment of Justice. The program would  provide 50-50 matching grants to state  and local law enforcement agencies and  Indian  tribes  to assist  in purchasing  bulletproof vests and body armor. To  make sure that no police department is   left out of the program, the matching  requirement could be waived for those  jurisdictions that cannot afford it.  This bill is a companion to legisla tion introduced in the House of Rep resentatives by Congressman PETER J.  VISCLOSKY from Indiana. That legisla tion already has over 200 cosponsors.  This bill has been endorsed by  the  Fraternal Order of Police, the National  Sheriffs' Association, the International  Union of Police Associations,  the Po lice Executive Research Forum,  the  International Brotherhood of Police Of ficers, and the National Association of  Police Organizations.  While we know that there is no way  to end the risks inherent to a career in  law enforcement, we must do  every thing possible  to ensure that officers  who put their lives on the line every  day also put on a vest. Body armor is  one of the most  important pieces of  equipment  an  officer  can have  and  often means the difference between life  and death.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 1591  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United states of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ""Bulletproof  Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998"".  SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.  (a) FINDINGs-Congress finds that(1) too many law enforcement officers die,  while protecting the public, as a  result of  gunshot wounds;  (2) according to studies, between 1985 and  1994,  709  law enforcement officers  in  the  United States were feloniously killed in the  line of duty;  (3) more than 92 percent of such law en forcement officers were killed by firearms;  (4) the number of law enforcement officers  who die as a result of gunshot wounds has de clined significantly since the introduction of  modern bulletproof material;  (5) according to studies, between 1985 and  1994, bullet resistant materials helped save  the lives of more than 2,000 law enforcement  officers in the United States;  (6) the number of law enforcement officers  who were killed in the line of duty would sig nificantly decrease if every law enforcement  officer in the United States has access to an  armor vest; and  (7)  the Executive Committee  for  Indian  Country Law Enforcement Improvements re ports that violent crime in Indian country  has risen sharply, despite decreases  in  the  national crime rate, and has concluded that  there  is a  ""public safety crisis  in  Indian  country.

36,Senate,105,0.344,420,1,Mr. HAGEL.," Mr. President, I come to  the floor  today to address what I be lieve  is a  serious  issue. Let me read  just the opening paragraph of a story  that  appeared  this morning  in The  Washington Times. The headline of the  story is ""Koop given waiver for burial  at Arlington; former Surgeon General  helped Hillary.""  The first paragraph of the story  this:  is  President Clinton overrode Army opposi tion and granted a unique burial waiver at  Arlington National Cemetery to C. Everett  Koop at a  time when First Lady Hillary  Rodham Clinton had enlisted the former Sur geon General to support her national health  care plan, internal documents showed yester day.  The story goes on to talk about not  just the dynamics of an implied deal,  but it is far more serious than just an  implied deal in my opinion, Mr. Presi dent,  because what we  are  talking  about here  is giving  sacred  resting  spots of our Nation's veterans away as  deals, as rewards, as bargaining chips,  as thank yous, as awards, as quid pro  quos.  Mr. President, this is not only a bad  precedent and very dangerous for  the  future of our country, but it flies in the  face of the honor and  the  trust that  America has always placed in its vet erans and their service to our country.  This is hallowed ground, Mr. President,  this  is sacred ground. Arlington Na tional Cemetery is a national shrine. It  should be a national shrine. We have  very strict regulations and limitations  as to who is allowed the great and dis tinct honor to be laid to rest at Arling ton.  Mr. President, I have no quarrel with  Dr. Koop. He was a very successful and  important  Surgeon General,  a  re nowned doctor, and he has done many  good things for his profession and our  country  and  our Government.  But  someone has  to  talk about  this be cause, you see,  there is a connection;  there is a connection between what ob viously was done and what is not being  done today for our active military men  and women in uniform and for our re tirees.  I would like  to read  just  two  lines from one of Rudyard Kipling's fin est  poems. This  poem, Mr. Kipling  wrote is called ""Tommy."" Many vet erans will know this poem. Two of the  last lines go like this:  For it's Tommy this an' Tommy that, an'  chuck him out the brute!  But it's ""savior of 'is country"" when the  guns begin to shoot.  Mr. President,  this  is a  time when  this  body will  debate  and  vote  on  shortlyin the next few weeks-wheth er we are going  to ask our military,  our men and women in uniform, who  we call on every day to protect our lib erties around  the world, and we are  going to commit them to more respon sibility  in Bosnia, NATO  expansion,  Iraq, maybe, yet we are now in a posi tion  to be giving away burial spots  that were originally always  intended  for the man and the woman who put on  America's military uniform and serve  our country with great honor and great  distinction. This  is also a  time, Mr.  President, when veterans are having  difficulty  using  the  veterans'  pref erence  in getting  jobs in the Federal  Government. We are asking them con stantly, especially over  the  last  few  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.  ",1998

38,Senate,105,-0.374,472,1,Mr. LEAHY.," Madam President, I am  glad tom Utah and welcome him back  from a productive weekend.  Last week,  I commended the chair man of  the Judiciary Committee  for  scheduling  the  judicial  confirmation  hearing, the first of this year, for to morrow afternoon, and I commend the  chairman again. I note that he is fol lowing  through on his earlier state ment  by  including  both Margaret  McKeown  of Washington State  and  Susan Oki Mollway of Hawaii at that  hearing. They have each been pending  for over 18 months, and it will be good  to have their confirmation hearing.  I hope we will maintain pace  this  year  that was established during  the  last 9 weeks of  the  last session.  In  order to do that, I hope that in addi tion to these nominees we can proceed  to confirm additional nominees for ar ticle III  judicial vacancies before  the  end of the week.  I am delighted the Senate is getting  the opportunity to consider the nomi nation of Judge Carlos Moreno to the  United States District Court  for  the  Central District of California. He has  been strongly supported by both Sen ators FEINSTEIN and BOXER. They have  both  spoken  to me  about him  and  strongly support him.  I have spoken often about  the Dis trict Court of the Central District of  California,  its workload and the need  to confirm qualified nominees for  the  judicial vacancies that persist and are  arising on that Court.  I have spoken  most often about that Court in connec tion with the longstanding nomination  of Margaret Morrow. It is my expecta tion  that  the Senate will  fulfill  the  commitment it made last year and pro ceed to that nomination by the end of  next week.  Judge Moreno  received  his  under graduate education at Yale College and  his  law degree  from  Stanford Law  School. He was a deputy city attorney  in Los Angeles, as well as a municipal  court judge before joining the Los An geles Superior Court  in 1993.  Judge  Moreno is currently serving the people  of California as a  Judge of the Cali fornia Superior Court. He received high  remarks from the American Bar Asso ciation and was reported by the Judici ary Committee on November 13, 1997,  unanimously. I thank both the major ity  leader and my good  friend  from  Utah for bringing him up this morning.  Along with Judge Moreno currently  pending on the Senate calendar are Ms.  Morrow, two nominees for long-vacant  judgeships  in Illinois and a Pennsyl vania State court judge. I hope that we  have a  strong bipartisan vote  in his  favor.  I also expect that today the Senate  will confirm the President's judgment  in nominating and reappointing Judge  Christine Miller to the Court of Claims.  The President's nomination of Judge  Miller was received last year before her  first  term  expired,  but  the  Senate  failed to act on it before adjournment  last fall.  The President used his  recess  ap pointment power  to  reappoint Judge  Miller and  resubmitted her nomina tion. Today  the Senate will  reaffirm  the President's action and confirm her  to a full term.  The Court of Claims is an important  court.  It is established by Congress  under article I of the Constitution. No  less than the Federal judiciary that is  appointed to fill vacancies in the arti cle III courts that we speak about so  often,  the vacancies on  the Court of  Claims should be filled and filled with out delay.  Madam President,  I hope  that  the  distinguished Senator from Utah and I  will be  allowed by our caucuses  to  move forward on judges as quickly as  possible.  I know  there  is support  in  mine to do that.  Madam President,  I  see  the distin guished Senator from California on the  floor and yield to her.  ",1998
39,Senate,105,-0.266,472,1,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Madam President,  I  thank  the  ranking member, and  I  thank  the Presiding Officer.  I  also  would  like  to begin by  thanking  the  distinguished chairman of the Judici ary Committee for what was, by and  large, a rapid and prompt processing of  Carlos Moreno. I submitted the name  of Carlos Moreno to the President for  appointment to the District Court from  the Central District of California. In a  sense, Madam President, I believe he is  prototypical of really what a good Fed eral judge should bring to that office. I  would like to just quickly go over what  is an amazing success story.  Judge Moreno was born in East L.A.,  just 2 miles from  the Federal court house where he will be serving. He has  earned the respect and admiration of  both the legal and the law community,  and he has had 13 years of service on  the State courts. He has strong bipar tisan support,  including  the endorse ments of the former Governor George  Deukmejian and Los Angeles County  Sheriff Sherman Block.  ",1998
40,Senate,105,-0.276,485,1,Mr. REID., What amendment is that?  ,1998
41,House,105,0.635,511,1,Mr. ARMEY.," Mr. Speaker, I am not  sure that I will take my whole 5 min utes, but I do have a few things that I  would like to point out.  Washington, D.C.,  has  some  very,  very good schools, has some exception ally good public schools, and  it has  some  exceptionally  good  private  schools. Unfortunately,  the city also  has  some  exceptionally bad  schools  where we have  too many young chil dren that are caught in circumstances  that would almost say they have no op portunity for anything but failure.  Those of us that have met these chil dren have understood what one always  understands when one meets a child:  This is a very, very special and pre cious person. We have seen too many  cases of children that have the ability,  that have  the energy,  that have  the  hopes and the dreams that are coupled  with the same on the part of their par ents and punctuated with prayers for a  better opportunity for this child, for us  to turn our back on these children.  Mr. Speaker, we will bring to consid eration for this body again a bill that  would allow scholarships for choice for  those families  that are disadvantaged  so  they,  like so many more wealthy  families, particularly here in D.C. and  across the country, could exercise their  opportunity to take their child out of a  school  that  is  failing  that child and.  move that child to a school where the  child will have their hopes and dreams  and abilities recognized and nourished.  We  have  people  that oppose  this.  They oppose it for ideological reasons;  they oppose  it for  institutional  rea sons;  they oppose it for reasons that,  quite frankly, I do not understand.  One prominent Senator said,  ""D.C.  parents and ministers and local leaders  have made it clear that they do not  want  vouchers."" Another  prominent  Member of this body made the point, ""I  think I can say with confidence that  the people I represent would deeply re sent the imposition of vouchers."" That  was the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. NORTON). ""I think I  can say with confidence that the people  I represent would deeply resent the im position of vouchers.""  What is a voucher? We say to people,  we make available  to you the oppor tunity. You can choose or you cannot  choose to accept that opportunity for  your child.  On October 13, 1997,  the Washington  Scholarship Fund announced the avail ability of 1,000  new  scholarships  for  children  that  are  disadvantaged  by  being stuck in failing schools. By the  deadline  last Saturday, 7,573 children  applied. One out of every six children  eligible for these scholarships applied.  Mr. Speaker, D.C. parents are mak ing the effort.  Let me talk about this a moment. I  have had the opportunity to work with  the D.C. Scholarship Fund. I have met  these parents.  I have met these chil dren. I have seen those that have al ready had the scholarships that have  moved to the other schools. I have seen  them brighten up and seen  them do  better. I have seen children that might  have been stuck forever with failure  emerge and shine.  What child  is not precious enough  that  they ought  to have  this oppor tunity? How can somebody's heart be  so cold as to say we deny that?  This is not taking money away from  the other D.C.  schools. The voucher  program that we are putting forward  says we will add additional money be yond that which is already available to  the City of D.C., which has, if not the  highest, certainly the second or third  highest per capita student budget for  their school system of any city in the  Nation. And yet, with all that they al ready have, we have children that are  not being well served by the schools;  and we are saying, in addition to that  money, let us put some more vouchers  in place for these little children.  Mr. Speaker, this is a little thing in  Washington.  The  numbers  here  are  very big. The President has got a $1.73  trillion budget. He has got all kinds of  things in that budget, all full of good  intentions. Big heart. Something  for  everyone.  We are saying drive off these Capitol  grounds two blocks,  three blocks. See  the children that do not have the op portunity that children in my district  in Texas have to walk to school safe in  neighborhoods that are safe; to be with  friends  in school and  to be proud of  their school;  to  learn and understand  and be appreciated and, yes, on occa sions, disciplined so that they can suc cessfully learn.  Then I ask my colleagues to tell me  if they meet these children, they meet  these parents, they see these opportu nities, that they can have a heart that  is so closed, cold, and a mind that is so  closed,  a  dedication  to  a  union  so  strong or a perversion of priority so  cruel that they will say ""no""  to these  children.  Mr. Speaker, I cannot do it. And it is  not just because I have met the chil dren.  I do not think anybody can do  that. And I have to say I deeply regret  the callous expressions of sentiment  that I read from the two Members of  Congress whose quotes  I opened  this  discussion with. I hope that something  will  touch their heart for  these chil dren.  PRESIDENT CLINTON'S EDUCATION  INITIATIVE  ",1998

46,House,105,0.311,615,1,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  I, too, join today with my colleagues  in saluting a great American, a won derful  friend,  a wonderful  colleague.  The United States Congress and  the  constituents of the 9th Congressional  District in California will sorely miss  you, RON.  One of my first days on this floor in  the 104th Congress  I had a chance  to  witness what I believe  is one of  the  greatest orators of this chamber, and  that was you. You  inspired me  that  day. You delivered a speech that was so  important in my life. And I  think of  the  fights we  have  had  since,  not  against each other but  for  common  issue, and  that was  the B-2 bomber.  And I  learned so much.  I  learned so  much.  I think the greatest thing we can do  in  this body  is share knowledge and  share opportunity with your colleagues  to make  this country a better place,  and you have shared more than you can  ever imagine with this young Member  from Florida.  I have learned style. I have learned  grace. I have learned about equality. I  have  learned about patience.  I have  learned that there is a  time to speak  and there is a time to listen.  You have taught me so much of those  great lessons here. You have been able  to reach out across the audience. You  have been able to reach out across the  aisle. You have been able to focus on  some of America's greatest strengths  and shore up some of our great weak nesses.  I believe you brought together people  of all races, all ethnicities in the fight  for  a  strong defense. But you  also  taught me that a strong defense does  not mean just throwing money at the  Pentagon  and hoping  it makes  the  right destination. When we  joined to gether  in  the  fight  against  excess  spending and waste, it was not about  shortchanging our men and women, it  was about making certain that they, in  fact, had more, that we  treated them  better, that we took care of their hous ing, that their families lived above the  poverty level. But the only way to do  that was making  choices,  difficult  choices.  I know you did not come here  to  argue against this defense contractor  or that or this weapon system or that.  You came here to make a difference.  And you have done that. You have con tinued  us  on  a  course  of military  strength but, more  important,  fiscal  sanity.  I will miss deeply the debate when it  arrives again for some of these impor tant projects. There will be not one  voice that can replace you, I can assure  you. There will be no one in this Con gress that can rise to your level of eloquence in debate nor, I believe, rise to  your level of sincerity.  You have been a  true patriot, a fine  American, a role model for all children.  I wish you well and Godspeed in your  new career, and I wish your community  its best in finding someone who will  pick up the challenges, be as good to  the constituents as you have been, be a  role model that you have been and fill  that big void that will be left by your  departure.  I do wish you well, RON. You are a  wonderful human being,  and  it has  been my distinct pleasure  and high  honor to serve with you in this Con gress.  ",1998
47,House,105,-0.578,615,1,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank the gentleman from South Caro lina (Mr. SPRATT) for taking out this  special order in honor of our colleague,  RON DELLUMS. For  the  last 27 years,  the Ninth Congressional District of  California has benefited from the lead ership and dedication of one of Amer ica's  finest  lawmakers. RON'S  retire ment will bring  to closure a  distin guished  record of public  service  for  California and for the American people.  When RON DELLUMS was elected  to  Congress in 1970, he brought to Capitol  Hill the determination to make a dif ference in the Vietnam War, in the war  against poverty, in the social and eco nomic  injustice  in  this country. His  previous service as a member of the  Berkeley City Council helped prepare  him for the task at hand. His advocacy  for peace in a  turbulent world caused  his reputation to precede him in  the  Congress. RoN DELLUMS came to Con gress as a legend.  RoN DELLUMS came into the Congres sional Black Caucus at the moment he  came into the Congress. We welcomed  him in the Congressional Black Cau cus.  I recall the battle that we undertook  during his first term in order to secure  a seat for RON on  the Committee on  Armed Services. There had never been  an African American to serve on that  committee, and the committee did not  want RON DELLUMS. They rejected his  application because he was  too mili tant. They felt that they did not w::tnt  him on that committee.  To  the credit of  the Congressional  Black Caucus, we  stood up  for RON  DELLUMS  and demanded  that he  be  given an opportunity to serve on that  committee. Nothing could have made  me prouder and other Members of the  Congressional Black Caucus who were  here at that time than the day we saw  you  become  chairman  of  the  com mittee on which they wanted to deny  you a  seat. As others have said here  today, there is the pride all of us take  for  the great service you gave, with  your picture hanging with dignity and  on  distinction  in  that Committee  Armed Services room.  It was on  this committee  that  the  Nation began  to  take notice of this  young, articulate legislator. It was RON  DELLUMS who challenged the Congress  to cut defense spending and invest in  our children's  future. He  challenged  the Nation  to put  families  first,  re minding us of the human needs that he  saw  in his congressional district and  cities across America. He was a fearless  advocate in opposition to what he often  referred to as our insane military pol icy.  Mr. Speaker, others have mentioned  RoN DELLUMS' opportunity to sponsor  legislation  in  this body  that helped  change  the world.  In 1971, he  intro duced  legislation calling for  the eco nomic sanctions against South Africa  in an effort to end that country's racist  apartheid  regime. RON DELLUMS uti lized the halls of Congress to call our  Nation to conscience. He  led protests  at the South African Embassy. He was  vocal, and, most importantly, he never  wavered. Fifteen years it took before  the Congress passed his antiapartheid  legislation  over  President Reagan's  veto.  When  we  welcomed  Nelson  Mandela  to Capitol Hill upon his re lease from  the South African prison,  the first person he asked  to see was  RON DELLUMS.  All of us were proud when we went to  South Africa and our delegation stood  there  in celebration of the  inaugura tion of Nelson Mandela, whereas  the  speaker before me,  the gentlewoman  from the State of Oregon (Ms. FURSE),  mentioned  that RoN  DELLUMS  was  known by even little school children.  RON DELLUMS' name until South Afri ca, to all of our pride, is a household  word.  RON DELLUMS' service on  the Com mittee on Armed Services, the Perma nent Select Committee and  the Post  Office  and Civil Service Committee  earned him the respect and admiration  of his colleagues on both sides of the  aisle. I am also proud of RoN's leader ship as the past chairman of the Con gressional Black Caucus.  Mr.  Speaker,  as  he  departs  this  chamber, many of us can say that we  shared a special relationship with RoN  DELLUMS. As I reflect upon our time in  the United States Congress, I will al ways remember  the very special per sonal friendship that RoN and I shared  in this body.  I will also remember, RoN, your advo cacy  for health  legislation,  the RoN  DELLUMS comprehensive health legisla tion that you fought for for such a long  period  in  this body.  I will remember  also you were the arc hi teet for many  years of the Congressional Black Cau cus budget. You saw that as a means of  setting priorities for the Nation and for  the Congress.  I will  always  remember your  elo quence, how all of us took pride any  ",1998
48,House,105,-0.556,628,1,Ms. WOOLSEY.," And, Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman for letting us do  this. I promise I would have been here  earlier, but I was on an airplane com ing from a very rainy, rainy California.  I tell RON this story because it made  such an impact on me. RoN DELLUMS  came to my district and spoke in front  of a group of my friends. He spoke out side and the birds stopped singing be cause  they were  listening  to  him.  There was not a person listening that  had a dry eye. Every single person in  that group, and there was at least 10~  some people, had a story that they re membered  about RoN  DELLUMS  and  what he has done for this country. So  then I had  the fortune  to come here  and work with you, RoN, and I am so  privileged that that has been part of  my growing up here as a very junior  Member of this Congress.  And I appreciate you for daring all of  us in this House of Representatives by  giving us the challenges to go and do  more  than we  thought we  should do  and could do. You dared us to not just  settle for what is politically possible.  You dared us and you  inspired us  to  think beyond the day-to-day battles, to  look at the big picture; to think about  what we are doing and how it relates to  our children, our families, our seniors,  our  communities. You did not  ever  have one small vision of what you were  doing and talking about.  I, like those ahead of me, could go on  and on, but I want to  tell you, RON,  that I have always thought of you as  the dean of our delegation, of the Bay  Area delegation, the California delega tion; the person that has taught me the  most about integrity. But what I am  going to miss the most with your leav ing us is that booming voice here on  this House  floor.  I am going  to miss  that. I am going to miss your leader ship and I will miss your message, but  I will not  forget  it. Thank you  for  being my friend.  ",1998
49,House,105,-0.644,628,1,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my distinguished colleague from Texas  for his generosity, and in respect to the  special order  that  the gentleman  is  calling, I shall be brief and I appreciate  his gesture of generosity  to my col leagues as well as to myself.  First, let me say in a humorous spir it,  to capture  the notion of my col league from New York,  it is kind of  like a funeral, but the marvelous thing  is I am still alive to hear it and to walk  away, and so that is good. Hopefully, at  some point before my service has ended  on Friday the 6th, I will have some op portunity to take the well and to speak  to all of my colleagues about what for  me has been an extraordinary journey  of 31 years across four decades in public  life, 27 years of them here.  Suffice to say at this moment that I  want  to  thank  the gentleman  from  Missouri (Mr. IKE SKELTON) for setting  up this special order and to all of my  colleagues who took the time to par ticipate. My heart is full at this mo ment. My heart soars like an eagle at  this moment. And  in  the  course of  these few hours, I have felt every emo tion from laughter and joy to tears and  sadness.  Just suffice at this moment  to say  that I never came here to become a ce lebrity. I never came here to become a  big personality. I am just a guy from  the Bay Area who came here to try to  do a  job.  I have been extremely hon ored  to serve  in the Congress of the  United States. Late night  talk show  host  jokes about politicians notwith standing, it is indeed an honor to have  gotten up every sing'le day to march to  the floor of the United States Congress  with life and death in my hands, along  with 434 other colleagues,  to  try  to  shape  the  course of history  in  this  country and throughout the world. It  has been an extraordinary honor.  Later, hopefully, I will be able to say  more, but  I  leave without cynicism.  The day that I  take the plane out of  Washington  for  the  last  time, know  that I go with my optimism and my  idealism intact and that I will miss all  ",1998

118,,105,0.458,667,1,Mr. COMBEST.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay  tribute  to  the  life and achievements of  James Roberts of Andrews, Texas.  James Roberts was a very important reason  that  the county and community of Andrews  lived up to its self-proclaimed truism, ""A Com munity of Quality."" James embodied every bit  of that quality as the local boy who grew up  to take an active, important part in his commu nity.  After  graduation  from  Andrews High  School, he completed his education after serv ing this country in the U.S. Army in World War  II and bravely surviving a year's time in a Ger man prisoner-of-war camp. He returned home  to Andrews and married Marie Holman on  April 18, 1946. He had attended Texas Tech  in Lubbock, and  in 1950, earned his college  degree from Baylor University.  James became the owner and editor of the  Andrews County News. His writing spoke with  the strong, common sense voice and views of  the vast West Texas and Eastern New Mexico  region through several newspapers under the  Roberts Publishing banner. The family paper,  founded by his parents during the Great De pression, carried James' own ""Drifting Sands""  column of homespun  humor and  down-to earth basics of daily  life and politics, James  Roberts' own course  in  life was anything but  drifting. James was an important and thought ful  local  leader,  one  of  the  community's  strongest boosters.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  As  the president of the Andrews  Industrial  Foundation, he attracted Fortune 500 busi nesses to Andrews,  to diversify an economy  once dependent on financial fluctuations in the  domestic oil industry. James Roberts was also  a leader among newspaper editors and pub lishers throughout the state, serving as presi dent of the Texas Press Association and the  West Texas Press Association. With strong  community ties, a member of the First Baptist  Church,  two  terms as president of  the An drews Chamber of Commerce, and  the 12year presidency of the Permian Basin Railroad  Company,  it  is no surprise  that James had  earned early  recognition  as Andrews' Out standing Citizen.  Just a few days before Christmas, James  Roberts passed from  this  life-a life of com munity service for the betterment of his neigh bors. Mr. Speaker,  I believe  that Andrews,  Texas will always be that community of qual ity, with credit due  to  the quality of its peo ple-people like James Roberts.  COMMEMORATING GENERAL  LUCIUS D. CLAY  HON. NEWT GINGRICH  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 3, 1998  ",1998
119,,105,0.377,667,1,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker,  today Con gressman Barr and I introduced a House Res olution  to  commemorate  and  honor  fellow  Georgian General Lucius D. Clay,  the United  States Military Governor  of Germany  and  Commander of the US Forces  in Europe fol lowing the end of World War II.  Born  in Marietta, Georgia  in 1897, Clay's  Southern heritage influenced his ideology and  policy  throughout his  life and military career.  General  Clay's  impressive military  career  began in the 1930's as a military engineer. He  soon established himself a highly competent,  willful and vigorous man with a exceptional un derstanding of  the purpose of government.  General Clay's impressive role  in US Military  affairs in Europe and more specifically in Ger many are marked not only by his military  prowess but also by his humanitarian efforts to  protect all men and women regardless of their  military allegiance and ideology.  The Russian motivated Berlin Blockade,  which halted all freight, passenger, water and  food supply traffic to Berlin, began June 24,  1948. On June 26, 1948,  the United States,  under General Clay's  leadership, began  the  Berlin Airlift that provided the German people  with the necessary supplies for day-to-day ex istence. The Airlift continued for 328 days until  May 12, 1949 when the Russians ended the  blockade.  We are very pleased to honor the prominent  role General Lucius Clay played  in  imple menting the Berlin Airlift and in shaping post WWII Europe. Issuing a postage stamp would  be a  first step  in appropriately  recognizing  General Clay's role in history.  665  RECOGNIZE AND LAUD PROGRESSIVE  ALTERNATIVE  BUDGET  FOR BERKELEY  HON. RONALD V. DELLUMS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 3, 1998  ",1998
120,,105,-0.644,667,1,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  call attention to, and to praise the passage of  the Progressive Alternative Budget 1997-1998  for the City of Berkeley. This landmark budget  was passed by the City Council on June 24,  1997.  This budget, initiated by the Honorable Vice Mayor,  Maudelle  Shirek,  established  the  seemingly impossible goal of forging a budget  which would meet the needs of two apparently  divergent, distinct communities within Berke ley. Although Berkeley's population of approxi mately 112,000 places it in the category of a  small city,  it has  two polar economic groups  with attendant issues, a common characteristic  of  large urban areas. To quote Vice-Mayor  Shirek:  ""The City of Berkeley  is divided  into  two distinct societies; one consisting of those  well above the safety net; the other made up  of those just above, within or below that same  safety net.""  The Vice-Mayor's 1997-98 budget achieved  the target of meeting the basic needs of the  entire city by maintaining the excellent police  and fire services, as well as meeting the spe cial requirements of the citizens with the low est income and the greatest needs. The Vice Mayor,  working  with  four  other  Councilmembers,  Margaret  Breland,  Linda  Maio, Dona Spring and Kriss Worthington, set  three priorities  in allocating  the $200 million  discretionary  funds available;  increased em ployment opportunities for the poor and home less, access to health care for at-risk individ uals, and more affordable housing.  Within these three priorities, the Vice-Mayor  proposed  that  the budget be appropriated  in  the  following manner; city parks and water front,  clean,  safe  streets,  and  the  library  (39.92%); public safety  (22.84%); a healthy  city and the disabled community (7.17%), the  needy and  soon-to-be-needy  (5.35%);  eco nomic development (4.22%); children and sen iors  (3.19%); South and West Berkeley,  two  traditionally underserved sections of  the city  (0.32%); and arts and culture (0.29%).  In  presenting  this  premier budget, Vice Mayor Shirek expressed her appreciation  for  City Manager James Keene and his staff for  the data that formed the basis of her budget,  and was especially proud  to note  that  this  budget included the traditional annual 4o/o sur plus as well as an AA rating enjoyed by only  17 other cities in California.  It is appropriate at this time for me to thank  all those involved in this undertaking for their  energy and hard work.  I am proud  that  the  Berkeley community has united to focus its at tention on  issues which are  critical  to  the  health, safety, and well-being of its citizens.  ",1998
121,,105,0.254,680,1,Mr. GILLMOR.," Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct  honor and pleasure to rise today to pay spe cial tribute to an outstanding group of student athletes from Ohio's Fifth Congressional Dis trict. This past fall, the Defiance High School  Football Team completed a  truly memorable  season by winning the Ohio High School AthFebruary 3, 1998  II State Champion letic Association Division  ship.  The  1997 Defiance High School Bulldog  Football Team demonstrated that, with a great  deal of hard work, dedication  to  the  task at  hand and  to each other, and a strong sense  of commitment, you can  realize your dreams  and make them come true.  The Defiance Football T earn achieved more  this past year than any other football team in  the school's history by winning  its  first ever  State  Football Championship.  The Bulldog  Football T earn capped off a perfect 14-Q sea son by defeating Uniontown Lake in the Divi sion  II  state  championship  game  held  in  Massillon, Ohio.  Under  the guidance of Head Coach Jerry  Buti,  the Bulldogs  realized a life-long dream  through a great deal of hard-fought success.  Their willingness to sacrifice for each other, to  dig deep within  themselves  to  find  the extra  energy needed  to produce a champion  is a  true testament to the unwavering  loyalty that  each player has  for  the  team. The unselfish  attitude of the Defiance Bulldogs is certainly a  good example of what can be accomplished  when people work  together  for a common  goal.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to congratulate  Coach Jerry Buti and  the 1997 Division  II  State Champions,  the Defiance High School  Bulldogs. I would urge all of my colleagues to  join me  in paying special  tribute  to an out standing team.  ",1998
122,Senate,105,0.536,693,1,Mr. ASHCROFT.," Mr. President,  re serving the right to object, and I do not  intend to object, I am troubled by mov ing  to  this measure because  I have  sought information from this adminis tration, from  the Centers for Disease  Control, and that information has not  been forthcoming.  I  thank the majority leader for his  willingness to assist me in this respect.  He has been very gracious and helpful  to me in seeking to get the information  that I have requested. I will continue  to propound that request, and I have  agreed that it would be appropriate to  proceed with the measure at this time.  I want to thank the majority leader.  While I do not intend to object,  I do  want to say that I think it would be in appropriate to conclude the debate on  this matter in any respect, by a vote or  otherwise, absent the kind of coopera tion that I think the Senate deserves,  when  the President  has  brought  a  nominee to the Senate and individual  Members of the Senate have asked for  information.  With that in mind, I  thank you for  this opportunity to express myself on  this. I do not object.  ",1998
123,Senate,105,0.014,693,1,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of nomination of Dr. David  Satcher to serve our nation as Surgeon  General and as Assistant Secretary for  Health. Dr. Satcher is a well-respected  physician and medical researcher who  has devoted his career to serving the  Nation's public health.  I want to note at the outset that it is  relatively unusual for one person to be  nominated to fill two such significant  positions at the same time. When Ire viewed the history of these positions,  however, I learned that there is a his torical precedent. From 1977  to 1981,  Dr. Julius B. Richmond served ably in  both positions. I believe that by com bining  these  responsibilities we will  better serve the needs of the nation.  Dr. Satcher has demonstrated  the  kind of commitment to serving our Na tion's public health  that will be  re quired to faithfully fulfill these respon sibilities. At a time when many physi cians and policy makers failed to ap preciate urban health care needs, he  began his career serving  low-income  ",1998
124,Senate,105,0.572,745,1,Mr. ALLARD.," Mr. President, I have,  of course, from time to time addressed  the Senate at this point in the day be cause I am introducing a piece of legis lation called The American Debt Re payment Act.  I think this is an important piece of  legislation,  and  it certainly  is very  timely when we  take  into consider ation that Congress now has the Presi dent's budget before us  for consider ation. Recently  the  President  sub mitted to Congress what he claims to  be a balanced budget for the fiscal year  1999.  I would like to welcome him to  the ball game of talking about a bal anced budget.  Since I was elected as a Member of  Congress in 1990, I have fought to bal ance the budget using real numbers. In  fact,  I was a member of  the House  Budget Committee that passed the first  balanced budget in over 25 years only  to see  this detailed,  responsible plan  vetoed by the President.  As happy as I am that the adminis tration has  come  close  to  realizing  what the Republican led Congress has  known all along, that we can balance  the budget while maintaining respon sible spending habits, I am deeply con cerned that all progress could be lost if  we  do not diffuse  the  ticking  time  bomb of the Federal debt. The Federal  debt now stands at over $5.4  trillion.  That is almost $20,000 for every man,  woman and child in the United States.  If we do not begin a procedure for paying down the debt and funding the So cial Security trust fund, entitlement  programs will consume the entire Fed eral  budget  by  the  time  the  baby  boomers retire. This is of great concern  to me, and we cannot be shortsighted  in dealing with the future of our chil dren and grandchildren.  The news, however, is not all bad. As  I said,  the President has submitted a  budget that balances on paper begin ning with  the fiscal year 1999. While  the reality could be different,  this is  still 4 years ahead of the 2002 timetable  that was  laid out by previous Con gresses. Balancing the budget is clearly  not the end but, rather, is only the be ginning. From the outset, many of us  have realized that once the budget is  balanced, the Federal Government has  the responsibility to retire the Federal  debt. Included in the balanced budget  agreement of 1997 was an amendment  of mine, and it expressed the sense of  the Congress that the President submit  a plan to pay down the debt when he  submitted his budget. He did not follow  this congressional guideline and that is  one of the reasons why I  feel I must  come to the floor today and introduce  the American Debt Repayment Act  with my good  friend  from Wyoming,  Senator ENZI. It is clear that now is  the  time  to begin  that process and  commit to retiring the Federal debt.  Let's talk a  little bit about what I  call the debt tax. The debt tax is the  amount of hard-earned tax dollars that  Americans send to Washington to pay  the interest on the debt. With the Fed eral budget in balance, we can begin to  pay down the debt and decrease the an nual gross  interest payments of $355  billion.  I  repeat  that, $355 billion  is  what we are paying in gross interest.  This is $355 billion that could be spent  on any number of programs, or more  beneficially, in my view, tax relief for  American  families.  In  real  terms,  American families are paying an an nual debt tax of about $5,300 to pay in terest on  the debt. As any consumer  knows,  the  interest on unpaid debt  compounds quickly, which  is exactly  what has been happening to our coun try. We need to relieve our citizens of  this burdensome tax.  Now, there are reports that we might  actually realize a  surplus before  the  fiscal year 1999. While I am not ready  to take it to  the bank yet, I believe  that is exactly what we should do with  any surplus, take it to the bank andre tire  the Federal debt. The Congres sional Budget Office is predicting a $5  billion deficit for fiscal year 1998. That  is down from a forecast of $120 billion  at the beginning of the year. I believe  that we can and should deliver a bal anced budget to  the American people  beginning with this fiscal year.  I am a realist and understand that we  cannot retire the Federal debt imme diately. What we can do  is create a  plan by which we pay down the debt  ",1998
125,House,105,-0.553,771,1,Mr. OBERSTAR.," I greatly appreciate  that. That is a very grand gesture, and  I appreciate that very much.  I will return just briefly, if I have ad ditional  time,  to summarize my con cern about the bill at hand.  Of course, we will debate it on its  merits later. But it is not appropriate  for the Congress to intercede in a juris dictional matter where we have given  authority to a local airport entity with  full power, full authority, over the Dul les and National airports to then take  back some of that power and say we  will arrogate onto ourselves  the au thority to name this airport, not only  to name it but to take off a good name  that it already has and to replace an other name. That is my principal ob jection.  Never  in  the history of  the Com mittee on Transportation and  Infra structure or  its  predecessor,  named  Public Works Committee, did we take  a name of a building and replace  it  with another name.  Washington National already has a  name. It is good enough for the coun try. It has been good enough since 1940.  It ought to be good enough for the next  50 years or the next millennium.  We should not be in the business of  renaming facilities. If this precedent is  followed,  then woe be  to any other  building that the Federal Government  has funded or any other airport that  has received Federal airport improve ment funds anywhere in the Nation as  this Congress  is  setting a precedent  today that we can come  in and take  names off buildings and place other  names on  them. That  is not appro priate.  If this building were rising fresh out  of the ground, if there had not been a  Washington National Airport, I would  have no objection  to naming  it  for  whomever the Majority chose to name  it. But I certainly object to taking the  name Washington National off that air port  and  replacing  it with  another  name.  ",1998

With all due respect  to  the  former President,  it  is no secret  that  there was no  love  lost between President  Reagan and this city. Over and over again, he  stated emphatically that he did not hold  this  city in high regard. He was proud to call him self anti-Washington.  Clearly, when visitors arrive in their Nation's  Capital,  it  is only appropriate the airport don  the name of our Nation's  first President.  It  would be  inappropriate  to name  this airport  after the man who in 1981, fired over 11 ,000  air traffic controllers and deprived the aviation  ",1998
130,House,105,0.377,797,1,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I have thought a good  bit about the debate that has occurred  both in the committee and in the Com mittee on Rules and on the floor and  also in the Senate about naming the  Ronald Reagan National Airport.  I  have  partly  reflected,  as  a  former  member of the Committee on Trans portation and Infrastructure, on how  often over the past years when I have  been here Republicans, in a good spirit,  voted yes to name buildings, to name  airports. Because we felt that if there  was somebody who was a national lead er who had worked hard, even if they  had been a partisan figure, that there  comes a moment when we band  to gether as Americans and we express it.  I just flew back from a meeting and  landed  at Kennedy Airport  in New  York. I did not think anything of it. I  happen  to serve on  the board of the  Kennedy Center, and it is totally ap propriate.  Yet there has been more noise, more  heat.  I do not think a  single Repub lican who has served in the House, who  is currently serving, can remember the  level of opposition, the level of expla nation. People who are for it, but. They  like President Reagan, but. They think  there ought to be something named for  him, but.  Yet I have to confess, as I was read ing Dinesh D'Souza's  brilliant  new  book on Ronald Reagan which he called  ""How An Ordinary Man Became An Ex traordinary Leader,"" that it is a real  tribute to President Reagan that even  today  that  there  is so much passion  about who he is.

Mr. Chairman,  I would  just like  to  say to the gentleman from Arizona, we  can settle this right now. As we have  heard earlier, the sense of the Congress  resolution would have no legal effect.  What the American Law Division told  me is if its language was introduced as  a bill, its effect would work, if it is not  ruled unconstitutional.  So I would ask the gentleman if he  would object if I asked unanimous con sent that on page 3,  that we strike all  of section 2, basically which is the sec tion  that talks about a  joint resolu tion, and merely reword the language  to say, ""No payment of award by tax payers. The award of $285,684.78  in at torneys' fees, costs, and sanctions that  Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the  defendants  to pay  in Association of  American  Physicians  and  Surgeons,  Inc., et al., v. Hillary Rodham Clinton,  et al., shall not be paid with taxpayer  funds.""  I would offer  that as a unanimous  consent. We could agree, and go home.  ",1998

133,House,105,-0.328,810,1,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman  for  yielding me  this  time.  Mr. Chairman,  this resolution deals  with the President's Task Force on Na tional Health Care Reform. That task  force  was  concerned  about  quality  health care for the people of this coun try. It dealt with many subjects,  in cluding how to expand health care in surance for many Americans who had  no health care  insurance, and it was  also deeply  concerned about quality  standards and consumer protection for  people who are  in managed care pro grams.  Each of us have heard from our con stituents their concern that the prac tice of medicine, the medical decisions  are being made by bureaucrats rather  than by medical professionals.  The United States District Court rul ing that is the subject matter of this  resolution awarded attorneys' fees for  some physicians who  challenged  the  work of that task force. This sense of  Congress resolution says that those at torney fees should not be paid for by  taxpayer funds.  As  the gentleman  from California  (Mr. CAMPBELL) pointed out,  the  law  says that attorneys' fees can only be  paid for by the government, and, there fore,  if this sense of Congress resolu tion was carried out, if we made it law,  as my friend the gentleman from Cali fornia  (Mr.  STARK)  pointed out,  the  plaintiffs in that lawsuit would not be  able  to  recover any attorneys' fees,  which is certainly contrary to the in tent of the sponsors of this resolution.  That is why  this sense of Congress  resolution makes no sense. The impact,  though, could have an impact. As the  subcommittee  chairman Mr.  KOLBE  pointed out, it is his intention to deny  these  funds  from  the White House  budget.  Therefore,  this  resolution  could have an effect if we pass it, a psy chological effect and a chilling effect,  on people who want to serve their gov ernment on  task forces  that look at  problems.  The work of  the President's Task  Force on National Health Care Reform  goes  forward. We have had a  Presi dent's Commission on Quality Stand ards for Managed Care. The work of the  task force moves  forward,  important  work. We have legislation pending that  deals with those recommendations.  One deals with external appeal  for  managed care programs.  I  received a  phone call  this morning from a  con stituent,  a  constituent whose  child  needed  institutional  care, who was  being threatened to be taken out of the  hospital  just arbitrarily by the man aged  care  operator. That  is wrong.  That plan had no external appeal, inde pendent appeal,  so  that person could  take that grievance to an independent  body.  We need to correct that. We need peo ple who are willing  to serve on  task  forces to correct that. This resolution  will have a  chilling effect on people  serving on those types of task forces.  We have legislation here that would  provide  access  to  emergency  care.  Today I can tell you of examples in my  community where people who are in a  managed care program go to an emer gency  room. They have chest pains,  they are sweating, they think they are  having a cardiac problem. They go  to  the emergency room. The good news is  that they didn't have a heart attack,  but then when they get the bill from  the hospital and the managed care plan  refuses  to pay because  the diagnosis  was not an emergency,  they almost  have a heart attack.  We  need  to  enact  legislation,  the  work of that task force, in order to cor rect  those  problems. We  have  cir cumstances every day that people need  referral to specialists, and the managed  care plan prevents  that referral. We  need people willing  to serve on  task  forces in order to correct those prob lems.  So, Mr. Chairman,  it is  important  that we do not send the message out  today that we do not want to see peo ple work and provide  their expertise  and independence, so the Congress can  get the benefit of their work.  The  sense  of Congress  resolution  should call upon us  to enact quickly  the consumer protection provisions for  managed care plans. Then the sense of  Congress resolution would make more  sense. Better yet, we  should use  the  ",1998

On April 4, 1847, 14 pioneers left Rot terdam, the Netherlands, with the hope  of finding religious freedom and eco nomic opportunity  in America. They  arrived in New York harbor on May 23  and  settled  on  the  south  shore  of  Macatawa beach in Holland, Michigan,  on June 20.  The  settlers  soon  founded  the  Graafschap  Christian  Reformed  Church,  dedicating  their  first  log  church in 1848. As Graafschap Christian  Reformed Church grew in numbers and  strengthened her spiritual roots, its vi sion  expanded  beyond  its  own  con gregation and extended into its com munity.  In  the past 150  years,  the  church has been a strong supporter of  Christian  education. As  a  leader  in  community ministry, the congregation  has supported and participated in mis sion projects around the world.  The past and present members of the  Graafschap Christian Reformed Church  have had a profound impact on the Hol land, Michigan, area. Now with more  than 500 members, the church is dedi cated to continuing its spiritual mis sion far into the future.  I would like to extend my thanks to  Graafschap Christian Reformed Church  for 150 years of service and commit ment to God and the community, and  offer my congratulations on the cele bration of their anniversary. May God  continue to bless the congregation and  their work in the years to come.

137,,105,0.419,875,1,Mr. PACKARD.," Mr. Speaker,  I proudly rise  today to recognize the men and women who  have honorably served  in  the United States  Navy Nurse Corps. On May 13 of this year,  the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps will celebrate their  ninetieth anniversary of dedicated service  to  our country.  Established by an act of Congress in 1908,  the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps has played an in tegral  role  in  the day-to-day medical oper ations of the United States Navy. Serving  in  both times of conflict and peace, the men and  women of the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps have  bravely provided the highest level of medical  assistance.  Beginning as a small, dedicated collection of  twenty women, the Navy Nurse Corps quickly  grew  in numbers  to support  the expanding  needs of the military. During World War I, the  Nurse Corps totaled over 460 regular and re serve force nurses. By the end of the World  War II,  the Corps had an enrollment of over  11 ,000 nurses. Through  their  involvement  in  the  two world wars and  their service during  the conflicts  in Korea, Vietnam and  the Per sian Gulf, the Navy Nurse Corps has consist ently proven their ability to adapt to changing  circumstances and technological advances.  I respect the dedication, innovation and pro fessional excellence that the U.S. Navy Nurse  Corps has displayed since its  inception. Dur873  ing my years of service  in  the Naval Dental  Corps, I was able to experience, firsthand, the  hard work and commitment shown by  the  nurses.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is with a great amount of  pride that I congratulate the men and women  that have previously and currently serve in the  United States Navy Nurse Corps on their nine tieth  anniversary. The United States Navy  Nurse Corps  truly  represent nursing excel lence.  WELCOME TO REPRESENTATIVE  STEPHEN CHEN OF TAIWAN  HON.

138,,105,0.627,875,1,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," Mr. Speaker,  I wish  to join my colleagues in welcoming Represent ative Stephen Chen  to Washington. Prior  to  his present assignment, he was a deputy sec retary-general  in  the office of  the President,  Taiwan.  Representative Chen joined the Republic of  China's foreign service early in his career and  has been a career diplomat, having served in  various Republic of China's embassies and  consulates throughout the world. Representa tive Chen brings to his Washington post vast  experiences and super knowledge of  foreign  policy  issues affecting the Republic of China  such as Taiwan's eventual  reunification with  the People's Republic and Taiwan's relations  with the United States and Japan.  I wish Stephen Chen a pleasant tour of duty  in Washington. These are trying times for the  Republic of China's diplomats. But with pa tience  and wisdom  exercised  by Taiwan's  President Lee Teng-hui and Foreign Minister  Jason Hu, I am confident that Taiwan will con tinue  to be  respected and  recognized world wide as a free vibrant democracy, deserving  admiration from all  freedom-loving people ev erywhere.

139,,105,-0.361,875,1,Mr. MANTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  pay tribute to Marie Biaggi, a true heroine not one who has been heralded publicly, nor  sought the fleeting fame of a celebrity-but a  steadfast human being whose very being was  the spiritual and emotional center of her family  and whose guiding hand nurtured  them  in  body, mind and soul.  Marie was an unassuming woman, whose  strength, determination and sheer will is with out peer. She was a matriarch  in  the most  positive sense of the word-a leader in the mi crocosm of her family, who chose  to stay  in  the shadows so that others could bask in the  sunlight of their own accomplishments-hus band,  children,  grandchildren,  friends,  aca demic associates and community and humani tarian activists. It was her strength that served  ",1998
140,House,105,0.336,888,1,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman,  about  a  year  ago,  President Clinton announced his pro posal for a Federal test in fourth grade  reading and eighth grade math, and the  White House and  the Department of  Education relied upon a  little-known  program,  the Fund  for  the  Improve ment of Education, for their authority.  Yet, nowhere, nowhere in the Fund for  the Improvement of Education is there  specific or explicit authorization . for  the President's national tests in read ing and math. Nor was  the program  ever intended as a justification for na tional tests.  A few years ago, the predecessor to  the Fund for the Improvement of Edu cation specifically and explicitly pro vided for ""Optional Tests of Academic  Excellence."" However, the majority at  that  time  in 1994  changed all  that.  That  testing  language was purposely  removed by Congress in the Improving  America's Schools Act of 1994. It is now  clear that there is no current specific  or explicit authority in  the Fund for  the Improvement of Education or any  other  statute  for  implementing  the  President's national tests.  When  the  testing  issue was put  to  vote last CongTess, nearly 300 Members  voted against national testing, includ ing many Members from both sides of  the aisle. I realize that is diminishing  because  there are all sorts of pie-in the-sky promises, and  therefore,  the  vote will be different. That is obvious.  The final result of the appropriations  activities  last year was  to  prohibit  pilot testing, field  testing or any im plementation or administration of the  tests in 1998. Limited test development  activities  could go  forward, because  they already put up $17 million, but  what happens beyond 1998 was never  addressed.  Despite the appropriate language, the  White House and  the Department of  Education continue to represent to the  public that testing will automatically  go forward in future years, even with out any action by Congress. That is  wrong. No decision has ever been made  by Congress about testing policy in the  fiscal  year  1999  or  any  other  time  thereafter.  Now, at the November 13, 1997 signing  of the appropriation bill, the President  said, ""For the very first time, Congress  has voted to support the development  of voluntary national tests to measure  performance  in  fourth grade  reading  and eighth grade math. The tests will  be created by an  independent, bipar tisan organization and will be piloted  in schools next October 1998."" 1998.  Just last week the President reiter ated in his State of the Union address,  and at that time  the President said,  ''Thanks to the action of this Congress  last year, we will soon have,  for  the  first  time, a voluntary national  test  based on national standards in fourth  grade reading and eighth grade math.""  Again, the point is that the Congress  has made no decision about Federal  testing in 1999 or future years. That  was never even talked about. In addi tion, beginning in November of 1997 and  continuing  through  January of 1998,  the day of our markup last week, the  Department of Education's website rep resented to the public that pilot test ing would in fact take place beginning  in the fall of 1998.  D 1130  Here is how the web page read at that  time:  ""The bill,  [PL 105-78] provides  full funding to proceed with immediate  development of the first-ever voluntary  national test in fourth grade reading  and eighth grade math ... The bill  perrni ts pilot testing to begin  in fall  1998.""  Never, never did any Congress ever  say that that is what is going to take  place. That is a decision that we as a  Congress will make, not the President  of the United States.  On the very next day after our mark up,  the Department changed the year  for pilot testing from 1998 to 1999. Well,  I know why. We all tried to tell them  they cannot get a test that is going to  be valid, worth anything, in less than 3  to 5 years. So NAGB, of course, redid  the contract and rebid the contract and  told them here is what we have to do.  We  also  found out a day after  the  markup that the display now says on  their web site, ""The first pilot tests are  scheduled for the fall of 1999, and the  first  field  tests  in  the spring of  the  year 2000.""  Again, what I am trying to point out  is there is no agreement about 1999, the  year 2000, or any time thereafter. That  is the only point we are trying to make  in this legislation. It is our responsi bility. The Congress  of  the United  States, to make that determination.  Mr. Chairman,  let me  tell my col leagues who probably gave us the best  argument for slowing down this train.  It was  the minority members on my  committee. The minority members on  my committee during markup gave us  all  the  reasons why we  should slow  down this train. What did they say dur ing markup? There were  those  that  were concerned about tests being used  for  tracking. There were  those who  talked about we are concerned about  language barriers in tests. There were  those who said how are the tests going  to be used? Are they going to be used  to compare schools, children, etcetera?  There were those who were concerned  about who determines the content.  All of these  things carne up during  the debate when we were marking up  this legislation. And what did I say to  them? I said, ""Well, let me ask you, did  the Secretary call and ask you for any  input on how  they were putting  this  test together?"" Total silence.  Then I said, ""How about the contrac tors, did the contractors call you and  ask you to give input on how they are  putting together these tests?"" Total si lence.  And  then I said,  ""Well, how about  NAGB? Have they called and asked you  for any input in what they are doing?""  Total silence.  And, of course, that is the whole pur pose of this piece of legislation today;  to give those people who were asking  those questions an opportunity to par ticipate  in any kind of development.  To make sure that their concerns that  they had, legitimate concerns, are real ized and that they are understood.  But if we do not do what we are going  to do today, they get no opportunity to  participate in any way, shape, or form,  it is a done deal. And so we get 300  math  professors  who  say, wait  a  minute, they are moving in a way of  constructing a  test that really is not  the best way to teach mathematics. We  have reading people saying is the read ing  test dealing with phonics?  Is  it  dealing with  look-see?  Is  it dealing  with any other kind of programs that  may be out  there, whole  language?  They need  to have answers  to  those  questions.  My  colleagues  on  the  cornrni ttee  have  to have answers  to  those ques tions. My colleagues who are on  the  minority side  truly need  to have an swers to those questions.  The only way they get to participate  is if we, as a matter of fact, accept this  legislation  today so  that we become  the players, the Congress of the United  States, in determining what goes for ward  as we  reauthorize N AEP  and  NAGB this year, we look at the whole  picture.

We  have worked very diligently in the past  years when I was the chairman of the  committee and we worked with staff.  The staff did a tremendous job. We had  hearings. We had people come in from  all of the services, and we worked to gether as a bipartisan group to put to gether what we thought were bills over  the past years that were in the best in terest of our men and women in serv ice.  We have had to fight some difficult  battles because our budget has been  shrunk, and we have actually been in  free fall for a few years, and we are not  even up to what we were several years  ago. It is a little bit disappointing that  the President and the folks down at the  other  end  of  Pennsylvania A venue  would be  looking for some  things  to  scratch in this bill. I think they are ab solutely misguided  in  their direction  on our bill.  Some of  the  folks  said  that  these  were not already designed, but most of  these projects could be completed, they  ar~ in the 5-year plan. Not everything  has to be a certain percentage designed  because some of them are off of the  shelf, and  they can be  implemented  right away. They are all good projects.  They have been  considered by  four  committees, and they all have a con tribution to our national defense.  I spoke against and was totally op posed to the line item veto because I do  not  think  it serves democracy very  well. And so the Members that would  say, I voted for the line item veto and  I cannot very well go back on my vote,  if they read this bill and if they look at  the  things  that  it does, when  they  voted for the line item veto, they did  not take a blood oath that anything  that was vetoed  that  they would go  along with. That is not the way our de mocracy works.  This is a good bill. It has been well  thought out. The staff did a  tremen dous job along with the other body.

144,Senate,105,0.506,979,1,Mr. GRAMS.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to the Boy Scouts  of America (BSA) on  the occasion of  the 88th Anniversary of its founding on  February 8, 1998.  At the turn of the century in Eng land, Robert Baden-Powell, an outdoor  enthusiast and a veteran of the British  Army's campaigns in Africa, published  a nature skills book intended for young  people to expose them to the rewards  offered by a working knowledge of na ture. The book was titled ""Scouting for  Boys"" and was based on survival manu als Baden-Powell authored during his  military  career.  Shortly  after  the  book's publication, Baden-Powell led a  group of 22 boys on a  scouting exhi bition  on Brownsea  Island,  off  the  coast of England, for the purpose of ap plying the principles contained in the  book.  From that original group of 22 sprang  forth a movement which now boasts  over 5 million members in this country  alone, and continues to grow each year.  In my home state of Minnesota, the Vi king Council  of  the Boy Scouts of  America serves over 57,000 youths be tween the ages of 5 and 20, making it  the 21st largest of the 335 Boy Scout  Councils in this country.  Participation  in  the Boy Scouts of  America gives young people a sense of  self-worth and satisfaction that is the  product of setting and accomplishing  goals, and being a part of a winning  team. Such experiences cultivate dis cipline and a  sense of responsibility  that are assets for life.  By cooperating with peers to achieve  a common end, Scouts learn valuable  lessons in leadership. Countless civic,  professional,  and community  leaders  throughout our Nation were  involved  in  the Boy  Scouts  of America  as  youths,  including 302 members of the  104th Congress.  Through programs  like  the ""Urban  Scouting Emphasis,"" which has over  4,300  participants  in  urban  Min neapolis, the Boy Scouts of America is  bringing  its valuable  life  lessons  to  inner city youth who are particularly  at risk of falling victim to the entrap ments of the streets. The Boy Scouts of  America offers  a place where young  people can gain a  sense of belonging  and loyalty that they may otherwise  seek to find in street gangs. Further more, the importance of programs like  ""Urban Emphasis""  is amplified when  considering the annual cost per youth  served by Viking Council  is  $58.31,  whereas the cost of housing a  juvenile  offender is $100.00 per day.  Of  course  all  the  forementioned  would hardly be possible without the  adult volunteers who are  the founda tion of the Boy Scouts of America. Cur rently there are over 1.3 million men  ",1998
145,,105,0.109,992,1,Mr. FORBES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay trib ute to a good friend and neighbor to all of us  Suffolk County who  recently passed away,  Robert G. Keene, beloved historian  for  the  Town of Southampton.  Bob was a  familiar  figure  in Southampton  and a regular columnist for the weekly South ampton Press, where according  to his editor  Peter Boody,  :""He wrote mostly about things  that irritated him, and that included everything  from people with no class  to historians who  didn't  give Southampton  the  credit  it  de served."" Bob was a vocal and articulate advo cate of Southampton's cause  in  the debate  with Southold over which community was the  first on Long  Island  to establish an English speaking settlement.  For 31  years, Mr. Keene  ran a bookstore  and art gallery  in Southampton  that brought  him  into daily contact with such notables as  Truman Capote and Willem de Kooning. His  store carried many rare titles, including a first  edition of Dr. Samuel Johnson's dictionary and  a copy of the first Roman Catholic bible pub lished  in America. Bob also had a very pas sionate appreciation for art and eventually he  combined his  love  for books and art by dis playing art work in his shop.  Bob started working with  the  town histo rian's  office  when  it was  under William  Dunwell. Mr. Dunwell was first appointed town  historian  in 1939 and served  the people of  Southampton faithfully for 43 years until 1981  when he retired to become historian emeritus.  Bob took over the historian's office in 1979, al though he was not officially appointed histo rian until Mr. Dunwell's  retirement  in 1981.  From  day one Bob office was an  historic  treasure  trove piled high with books, docu ments, photographs and local history memora bilia. The local history that Mr. Keene carried  in his head, garnered  from his own personal  experiences and his years working with Wil liam Dunwell, was  considered  so valuable,  that the town board recently budgeted $10,000  to capture it all  in an oral-history project. Re grettably, that project was not begun before  Mr. Keene's untimely death. An  irreplaceable  history is lost to us forever.  Although Bob Keene only settled  in South ampton  in 1950, from Bar Harbor Maine, his  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  heart and  soul  beat  for Southampton. He  loved Southampton and he  loved .the people  of Southampton. He will be sorely missed.  I  urge my colleagues to  join me in celebrating  the  life and accomplishments of Bob Keene  and wishing his family, especially his daughter  Melissa Elizabeth,  our prayers and  condo lences.

146,,105,0.288,992,1,Mr. WELLER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  congratulate the Gardner Grade School Cho rus of Gardner,  IL. on  their  recent perform ance at Walt Disney World in Orlando, FL.  At the direction of Patti Johnson, the Gard ner Grade School Chorus had a dream back  in 1996, that it would someday have a chance  to perform at Walt Disney's Magic Kingdom.  After a year of research, planning, rehearsals,  and  raising  the  funds  that were needed  to  make the trip to Orlando, the Gardner Grade  School Chorus realized their dream on June 9,  1997.  The journey to Orlando by the 40 member  chorus and 10 chaperones began on June 7,  1997. After saying  their goodbyes  to  family  and friends, the chorus was escorted through  Gardner by  the  local police and  fire depart ments as they began their 23-hour bus ride to  the Magic Kingdom. In short Mr. Speaker, this  was not a dream come true just for the cho rus, it was a dream come  true  for an entire  town.  On June 9, 1997  the  long-awaited dream  was finally fulfilled. Outlasting the Florida rain,  the chorus dazzled the audience as they per formed on  the Tomorrowland Stage  in  the  Magic Kingdom. The chorus performed sev eral selections in their 25-minute performance  including,  ""Dance, Dance, Dance"",  ""Sea of  the Cowboy"", and  ""Footloose"". On June 10  the Chorus participated in a 3-hour music edu cation workshop at  the Epcot Center, where  chorus members  received  first hand knowl edge ~n how Disney. prepares its shows from  the Disney cast.  Now as you might suspect Mr. Speaker, this  trip was not all work and no play. On the final  2 days of their trip, chorus members explored  the theme parks and took part in many of the  activities  in  the Orlando area, taking advan tage of a much deserved rest before returning  home to Illinois.  Mr. Speaker,  the Gardner Grade School  Chorus had a dream that they would perform  at Walt Disney World someday, and they did.  Thanks to the hard work of its members, di rectors and chaperones,  the Gardner Grade  School Chorus not only realized  their dream,  but, they shared  their dream with  their par ents, schoolmates, town, and the people in the  audience at the Magic Kingdom. Mr. Speaker,  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting the  Gardner Grade School Chorus and their very  special performance at Disney World, and  I  ask that a list of those who participated on this  trip be  included  in  the RECORD  following my  statement.

Smith  of Chicago, IL, who will be retiring next month  from  the U.S. Small Business Administration.  He has honorably served as director of  the  SBA's Chicago District Office of over 20 years.  Jack has been a faithful Federal employee  for 46 years beginning in  the U.S. Navy and  then establishing his career in the Department  of Commerce's Economic Development Ad ministration.  In 1973, Jack was named Re gional Administrator for the Commerce Depart ment's Office of Minority Business Enterprise.  The SBA noticed his extraordinary accom plishments as Commerce Regional Adminis trator and after just 2 years, Jack was ap pointed SBA Chicago District Director. He has  been a major supporter of private sector de velopment through his dedicated service. Dur ing his  tenure, Jack oversaw several billion  dollars  in  loans and Federal contracts to  Illi nois small businesses.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, I am a member  of  the  House  Small  Business Committee  which oversees the SBA, and the retirement of  one of the best directors from  Illinois will cer tainly be a loss to the Chicago business com munity and to the state. Jack's experience and  enthusiasm for his work will be missed greatly  by business owners and public officials  in volved  in private sector development.  I wish  him the best in his future endeavors.  Mr. Speaker, Jack dedicated his life to  the  community and to the SBA. Now it is our turn  to thank Jack for all of the energy and dedica tion he expended for so many years to make  Illinois a better place.  ",1998

I understand we are going to be voting  on cloture on a bill that has not gone  through  any  committee, hasn't had  any hearings.  It  involves an area of  science and medicine which very few, if  any, of us in this entire body are quali fied to vote on with short notice, with out proper hearings and proper input.  Yet, it's trying to be rammed through  here.  I am talking about  the bill re garding cloning research.  Now, there has been a lot of, I think,  undue,  inflammatory kinds of state ments and comments made about this  cloning research. It seems odd to me  that on something that has so much  It  potential to alleviate human suffering  and which  is also, I will be frank  to  admit, fraught with perils of ethics and  bioethics-i t  seems odd  to me  that a  bill of that nature would be rushed so  soon  to  the  floor of  the Senate.  seems to me that this is the kind of bill  that ought to go through a lengthy and  involved hearing process,  to bring  in  the best minds, ethicists, physicians,  doctors, researchers, those involved in  gene therapy, those who have been in volved in cloning research in the past,  to hear their views on this. And then  out of this, perhaps we can develop a  more reasoned,  logical, bipartisan ap proach on the issue of cloning research.  So  I have  to ask, what  is  this so called rush? Why bring it out on the  floor like this. without the proper kind  of hearings, because there is a hidden  political  agenda?  Is  this  to  inflame  fears among people? Well,  I hope not.  To  take  away  that  apprehension,  I  think the best thing would be to refer  this  to committee and have hearings  on it. I serve on the Labor, Health and  Human  Services Committee,  and  I  would assume that committee would be  the proper one to have the hearings, at  least some of them, plus those on the  House side. So I want to speak about it  in that context.  Mr. President, each year,  too many  of our loved ones suffer terribly. They  are  taken away  from us by diseases  like  cancer, heart  disease  and Alz heimer's. For many  years,  I  have  worked hard  to expand research  into  finding cures and preventative meas ures and  improve  treatments for  the  many conditions  that rob us of our  health. Over  the  last  several years,  there have been major breakthroughs  in medical research. We need to make  sure  that  our world-class  scientists  continue to build on this progress, but  that we also say to young people who  are  in college  today, maybe even  in  high school, who are thinking of pur suing  research careers,  that we wel come their inquisitiveness, we welcome  their experimentation, we want there  to be no bounds put on their inquiries  by a rush to judgment by the Congress  of  the United States, which  is  ill equipped to make such a  judgment. I  think our actions here  send a  very  chilling message to young people, who  want  to go  into biomedical research,  that somehow there is going to be. the  heavy hand of ""Big Brother"" Govern ment overlooking their research,  tell ing them you can do this but not that,  or you can go no further than that, or  you can ask  this question, but you  can't ask that question.  I  think  this  bill that we have, again, pushed before  us in this rush, can have that kind of  chilling effect.  Now, another area of research that  has been ongoing for a long time-this  is nothing new-has recently captured  public attention. That is the research  into cloning, cloning cells. Now, there  ",1998

150,Senate,105,0.366,1135,1,Mr. FRIST.," Mr.  President, Cadet  Captain Guy Pryor, a student at Hay wood High School, in Brownsville, Ten nessee, will soon be honored by the Air  Force Junior Reserve Officer Training  Corps with its highest honor, the Cadet  Gold Valor Award. Cadet Pryor is re ceiving this award for his heroic efforts  on Sunday, December 19, 1997, as he at tempted  to save  the  life of an auto mobile accident victim.  Cadet Pryor and his friends  left a  Sunday evening church party in Jack son when they came upon the scene of  an accident, a head-on collision. One of  the cars in the accident, a Toyota pick up, was already  engulfed  in  flames,  lying in a ditch, having rolled about 100  feet  from  the  crash  site. The man  trapped in the vehicle was desperately  calling for help.  Without hesitating, Cadet Pryor ran  to the truck, and began pulling at the  passenger door. Those watching cau tioned him that the truck might well  explode at any moment, and called for  him  to move  from  the  truck. The  flames were already so hot Cadet Pry or's palms burned,  and an onlooker  threw him a coat to better insulate his  hands against the fire.  Cadet Pryor succeeded in pulling the  man from the truck just as paramedics  arrived.  Unfortunately,  the  victim,  Hugh Rainey Pegram of Jackson, died  on  the way  to  the hospital, and our  hearts go out to his loved ones. Cadet  Pryor was  taken  to  the hospital  for  treatment of his burned hands and re leased.  So often we do not hear about our  young people who distinguish  them selves. Cadet Pryor is a hero in the tru est sense of the word because at great  peril to himself, he gave willingly and  without question  to a  fellow human  being in need. His spirit of service and  selflessness is an example for all of us  to emulate.  This recognition from the Air Force  Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps  is a wonderful testament to Cadet Pry or's bravery  that Sunday night. The  Cadet Gold Valor Award brings honor  to Cadet Pryor and his family, and also  to  the  outstanding Tennessee  944th  unit of the Junior ROTC at Haywood  County High  School. Cadet Pryor's  story is an inspiration to us all, and I  am proud to be his United States Sen ator.   NATIONAL AFRICAN AMERICAN  CREED   ",1998
151,Senate,105,0.331,1135,1,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. President, I sub mit for the RECORD  the following Na tional African American Creed, written  by one of my constituents, Mr. Terry  Harris. Mr. Harris is an active member  of the National Association for the Ad vancement of Colored People (NAACP),  and has presented this creed before the  NAACP Executive Board. Mr. Harris'  National African American Creed chal lenges people to make a difference be ginning with themselves. In particular,  Mr. Harris encourages other African  Americans  to eschew drugs and gang  violence, gain an education, display  kindness, and support our country.  I  commend Mr. Harris on his interest in  helping others.  The material follows:  THE AFRICAN AMERICAN CREED  (By Terrance Harris)  I,  the African American, man, woman,  child-son  and  daughter  and great-grand child of  slaves, descendant of Africa and  child of God, no longer have to search to find  my place in this world.  I,  the African American, have a responsi bility  to my forefathers whose struggles I  must continue to ward off hatred and big otry.  I,  the African American,  descendant of  Ishmael and Abraham, have a responsibility,  to help my brothers and sisters when, and  after, they fall by the wayside.  I,  the African American,  descendant of  great kings and queens of Africa, am obli gated to teach my children about our ances tors and their customs.  I,  the African American, of dark  com plexion, have a responsibility for keeping my  dark beautiful armor shined with Christ-like  luster in my daily walk.  I,  the African American, whose ancestors  were great warriors, must become a great  warrior against such  things as drugs and  gang violence.  I, the African American, come from a race  which was so powerful, to cause a nation to  change its views on segregation and rethink  its views on desegregation.  I, the African American, great grandchild  of great chiefs  in Africa, have a  responsi bility to become the head of my family and  to raise my children in such a manner that  will enable my children  to become great  leaders.  I, the African American, come from a race  which helped to build this country, have a  responsibility to keep the talent alive and to  build great buildings that will stand along  side the great pyramids of Egypt.  I, the African American, whose forefathers  came from a land rich in vegetation and ani mal  life, have a  responsibility  to preserve  that beauty so that my children will have  the same opportunities to bathe in the beau ty of nature that God has created for all to  enjoy.  I,  the African American, whose ancestors  used as a part of their culture, great dances,  am obligated to pass this tradition and the  history behind the dances on to my children.  I, the African American, come from a race  where such powerful men and women  laid  down  their lives so that I might be able to  get a fair education, am obligated to attend  a school of higher learning.  I, the African American, whose forefathers  have been spit upon and smitten, all in the  name of equality,  just so you and I could  stand here today, must be willing to display  in return the same equal kindness that we  have demanded, not just to men and women  of the African American race, but to men  and women of all races.  I, the African American, whose fathers and  mothers can now become men of science,  medicine, and law, am obligated to follow in  their  footsteps ensuring  the best possible  care, in order to preserve my history.  I, the African American, whose forefathers  have died  in wars when  they were not al lowed to drink from the same drinking foun tain, yet were equal enough  to share  the  same bullet, but couldn't be buried in  the  same cemetery, am obligated  to become a  great general of the Armed Forces, and even  to become President of the United States of  America.  My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of Lib erty let it be known that if any changes are  to occur, it must start with me-of Thee I  sing. Land where my fathers died,  land of  every man's pride, from every mountain side,  let freedom ring and ring.  ",1998
152,,105,0.338,1174,1,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr.  President,  I  just want to thank the majority leader,  again, for his willingness to cooperate  with both Senator SPECTER and me in  our request that Judge Massiah-Jack son's nomination not be voted on here  in the next few days but that the proc ess  be  able  to  be worked out  and  worked through, a hearing to be held. I  know Senator SPECTER, who cannot be  here  right  now,  fully  supports  this  process that we now have begun to get  her a hearing  in  the Judiciary Com mittee. And then I hope very promptly  to bring her back to the floor of the  U.S. Senate for a vote.  I would not like to see this nomina tion hang out for a long period of time  after  the hearing.  I don't think that  would be fair, again, to her or to the  process,  or  to  the President who  I  know, in having conversations with the  White House,  they would  like  to see  this matter be dealt with in an expedi tious fashion after  the hearing takes  place. A hearing will not be able  to  take place until the week after next be cause we are not in session next week.  So I am hopeful we can bring this judge  up for a final vote here in the U.S. Sen ate within a  3-week period of  time,  maybe a 4-week period of time. I think  that would be appropriate for her and I  think appropriate  for  the Senate at  some point to pass  judgment on  this  nominee. I think it is important when  the President puts a nominee up who  has had, certainly, the amount of at tention that this nominee has had, that  the Senate, all Members, get an oppor tunity  to express their opinion as  to  whether this nominee has the creden tials and qualifications and qualities  necessary to serve on the Federal judi ciary.  With that, I again thank the major ity leader and thank my colleagues for  allowing  this  procedure.  There  are  things  that could have been done.  I  talked  to  several  of my  colleagues  about those things that could be done.  The Senator from Missouri and others  would have liked to vote today. In fact  they could  force  a vote  today.  It is  within the right of any Senator on this  nomination to offer a  tabling motion,  which would bring the debate to a stop  and cause a vote. They have agreed to  not do that and I appreciate that very  much.  They could have derailed this effort.  But their indulgence in allowing what  two home State Senators believe is a  fair process, their indulgence in allow ing what we believe to be a fair proc ess, in acquiescing to those desires, is  ",1998
153,Senate,105,-0.45,1187,1,Mrs. BOXER.," I say to Senator LEAHY,  before he leaves the floor, and because  Senator HATCH in his absence.explained  the wonderful  tribute he  is going  to  have shortly with his portrait being  hung in the Agriculture room, and he  himself said that he is so respectful of  you and wants to show his respect so  much that he is going to join you, so  that will leave me here on the floor to  debate with  the Senator  from Mis souri-before  you  leave  the  floor  I  wanted to say to you and to Senator  HATCH together, and I say this from the  bottom of my heart, without the two of  you looking fairly at this nomination,  this day would never have come.  To me it is, in a way, a moving mo ment. So often we stand on the floor  and we talk about delays and so on and  so forth. But when you put the human  face  on  this  issue  and you have  a  woman and her husband and her son  and a  law firm  that was  so excited  about  this nominee, and you add  to  that 2 years of twisting in the wind and  not knowing whether this day would  ever come, you have to say that today  is a wonderful day.  So,  before my  colleague  leaves,  I  wanted to say to him: Thank you for  being there for Margaret Morrow and,  frankly, all of the people of America.  Because  she will make an excellent  judge.

156,,105,-0.483,1252,1,Mrs. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the  gentleman, my  esteemed  colleague,  the gentleman  from Ohio  (Mr. STOKES), for having the insight to  organize today's Black History special.  Certainly,  the history of the people  of African descent is interwoven with  the history of America. The theme of  African Americans  in Business: The  Path Toward Empowerment, is particu larly significant. Since African Ameri cans have been on American soil since  1619, black Americans have. played an  important part in the development of  this great Nation. We helped to build  this Nation. We helped  to  fight  for  America,  and we helped America  to  gain  its  independence. We  helped  to  build this country's thriving cities and  farmed its fields and settled the West.  D 2000  As  we  celebrate  Black  History  Month,  I am mindful of this month's  theme  again,  ""Black Americans  in  Business."" And  I can  think of many  that have been mentioned,  like Ma dame C.J. Walker, Percy Sutton, John  Johnson, Robert Johnson, and Cathy  Hughes.  And then I cannot forget that blacks  have  owned and managed businesses  since  slavery.  In  the  1770's, Samuel  Fraunces  was  a  successful  tavern  owner in New York.  During this period, many blacks also  owned well-to-do barber  and beauty  shops and dry goods stores. After slav ery, blacks began to acquire more prop erty and capital, and increasing num bers began to set up businesses. Two of  the earliest of those were Annie Ma lone and Madam C.J. Walker.  Funeral services was one area where  blacks had  a  significant number of  businesses and other personal services.  Blacks have ventured into other for ays. Maggie Lena Walker became the  first black woman in 1903 to become a  bank president. She founded the Saint  Luke Penny Savings Bank  in Rich mond, Virginia, and the bank became  so very strong that it survived the De pression.  Mrs. Walker's bank was by no means  the first black-owned bank. That dis tinction belongs to the True Reformers  Bank of Richmond, Virginia.  Mr. Speaker,  I cannot overlook the  North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance  Company founded in 1893 in Durham. In  1789, James Forten, Sr., established the  first major  black-owned  sailmaking  shop. We could go on and on talking  about  the  good highlights  of black  ",1998
157,,105,-0.018,1291,1,Mrs. MORELLA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Town of Garrett Park, Mary land which is celebrating 1 00 years of incorpo ration this year. Throughout the year the town  will  be  celebrating  numerous  centennial  events, including a New Year's Eve party and  a New Year's Day Open House.  The Town of Garrett Park is named for Rob ert W. Garrett, who was president of the Balti more and Ohio Railroad  in  the  late 1800's.  The railroad, which first opened in the Wash ington, D.C. area  in 1873, helped  jump-start  development in Montgomery County and ulti mately, helped lay the groundwork for the in corporation of Garrett Park.  The one hundredth anniversary of Garrett  Park's  incorporation  is a great achievement.  This  lovely  town, which  is  located on  the  banks of Rock Creek, has grown from its sim ple beginnings into a model  for other munici palities  to emulate. Garrett Park  is a  town  which has embraced modern technology and  yet still maintained a strong association with  its rich history.  When you ask the people of Garrett Park to  describe themselves and their town, they usu ally speak of their ""independence"" and ""civic  duty"". They have a great respect for their local  government and strive  to  look after one an other. Garrett Park's greatest attribute may be  the sense of close-knit community, from which  stems its national recognition.  Again,  I congratulate Garrett Park on  this  milestone. It is an achievement that all Amer ica should look up to and honor.  TRIBUTE TO MR. WALTER HAMEL,  LAST SURVIVING WORLD WAR  I  VETERAN  OF  HAVERILL,  MASSACHUSETTS  HON. JOHN F.

158,,105,-0.488,1291,1,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute  Mr. Walter Hamel,  the  last surviving World  War I veteran  in  the City of Haverill, Massa chusetts.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Mr. Walter Hamel is a true American patriot  and war historian. Born 97 years ago, one of  seven children, he enlisted in the war. Still un derage at only 17 years old, Walter entered  the service with  the permission and blessing  of his mother. During World War I, Walter was  assigned to the U.S. Army Signal Corps in Ha waii. Not only did he gallantly serve  in  this  post during World War I, his patriotism for the  United States never weaned. Upon his return,  Mr. Hamel participated  in many parades and  walked from nursing home to nursing home to  distribute flags on Veterans' Day. Last Novem ber, the Haverill Gazette, located  in my dis trict, profiled Mr. Hamel as ""An Enduring Pa triot'' for his actions.  Indeed, Mr. Hamel  is not only a source of  inspiration to his friends and family, but also to  us all. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the accom plishments of Mr. Walter Hamel; his military  service and civil pride are to be commended.  I hope my colleagues will join with me today  in wishing Mr. Walter Hamel the very best as  he continues to inspire us all.  TRIBUTE TO EDWARD C. VALDEZ  HON. GEORGE P.

159,,105,0.484,1291,1,Mr. RADANOVICH.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to Edward C. Valdez for  his commitment and dedication to the Hispanic  community. Edward Valdez is a prominent at torney and was awarded the 1997 Latin Amer ican Businessman of  the Year. His accom plishments with  the Hispanic community are  noteworthy and warrant recognition.  Born in Castroville, California, Valdez spent  much of his childhood in the fields picking fruit  and  vegetables. Valdez  did  very well  in  school, but had  the notion  that college and  higher education was  for non-Hispanics. He  grew up in a community where people worked  in the fields all of their lives and no one ever  went to college. This discouragement caused  him to join the Army instead of continuing on  with school.  In  the service, Valdez began  to meet col lege graduates and realize that he could also  go to college. In 1964, Valdez finished his mili tary obligation and enrolled  in  junior college.  His college studies and determination paid off  in  the  late 1960s when AAA Insurance hired  him as a claims adjuster. The company soon  promoted Valdez to a job in Fresno, where he  continued his education at California State  University, Fresno.  In  1969, he began  law  school and worked as a paralegal by day and  studied by night.  After graduation, Valdez and several other  lawyers formed a partnership that became well  known  for work with  the under-served Valley  populations and Hispanic  leaders. When his  partners  left  the  firm  to  become  judges,  Valdez built his firm  into a solo practice. He  continued his motivation by providing help with  several  community service projects. Valdez  supports  the  Central  California  Hispanic  Chamber of Commerce and  the positive ef fects it has on business in the Valley.  Valdez credits much of his success as a re sult of his education. I praise his emphasis in  1289  the  importance of higher education. He en courages  lifting Valley farm-labor populations  into enterprises  that bring  jobs and money  through higher education.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I pay  tribute  to Edward C. Valdez  for his accom plishments and  dedication  to  the Hispanic  community. His passion  for the  legal profes sion  and  his  encouragement  for Hispanic  youth is both refreshing and inspirational. I ask  my colleagues to join me in wishing Edward  Valdez many more years of success.  PHILADELPHIA  INQUIRER  REPORTS RAMP ANT LABOR ABUSES  IN U.S. COMMONWEALTH  HON.

160,,105,-0.552,1291,1,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker, the  following article is the second of two that ap peared  in  the February 9, 1998 Philadelphia  Inquirer and describes  the plights of tens of  thousands of  foreign workers who  live and  labor in one of our U.S. territories, the Com monwealth of  the Northern Mariana  Islands  (CNMI). This  article,  ""For Workers,  Island  Jobs can be a Losing Proposition,"" describes  the desperate situations of these workers once  they arrive  in  the CNMI deeply  in debt and  prone to exploitation.  Every  independent  reporter who has  trav eled  to the CNMI  to  investigate the working  and living conditions of the tens of thousands  of imported  foreign workers  there has  found  that the principles behind the labor and immi gration situation  in  the CNMI are contrary to  those defined by established  ideals of Amer ican democracy. The CNMI economy is based  on the exploitation of a large, disenfranchised,  foreign population, and  laws to protect these  workers on U.S. soil are neither being ade quately applied, nor enforced, and perpetra tors of justice are not being punished.  The article describes  fifty-five men  from  China who each paid $7,000 to a Chinese re cruiter for ""transportation, passports, and the  promise of construction jobs. Most had to bor row money  from  friends, family members or  loan sharks."" Once they arrived in the CNMI,  these men found no jobs waiting. Although the  men marched in protest to the offices of the  U.S. Department of Labor, the federal govern ment could not help them because the CNMI  has sole authority over immigration policy and  controlling recruiters.  A similar story is repeated for 134 men from  Bangladesh who paid $5,000 to recruiters for  jobs that did not exist.  In both cases, the re cruiters  responsible  for bringing  these men  from China and Bangladesh to the CNMI have  fled, while the men remain disenchanted, hun gry and desperate for employment.  The article also details the story of one 22  year old Chinese worker who  tells of being  summoned four times by her garment factory  supervisor in his attempts to pressure her into  returning  to China  to have an abortion after  she became pregnant. The worker refused to  have an abortion and, after  losing several  days of work because of a pregnancy related  ",1998

Every year, members of the Mr. Amigo As sociation, who  represent  the city of Browns ville, Texas, travel  to Mexico City to select a  new Mr. Amigo to serve as the honored guest  of the Mr. Amigo festivities in Brownsville. The  Mr. Amigo festivity is a four day international  event which  invites  the United States and  Mexico  to  celebrate  the  cultures  of  these  neighboring countries. During  the Mr. Amigo  celebration, which originated as a pre-Lenten  festival, Brownsville citizens participate  in a  series of parades, dances and parties to dem onstrate the goodwill of both countries.  It is a  major function which is eagerly anticipated by  many South Texans as well as our winter visi tors.  We are honored  to  recognize Mr. Alberto  Vazquez as the 34th Mexican citizen chosen  by  the Mr. Amigo Association. Mr. Vazquez  was born in Guaymas, Sonora. He filmed 34  movies with outstanding Mexican Stars such  as Soler, Marga Lopez, and last year's recipi ent  of Mr.  Amigo,  Angelica Maria. Mr.  Vazquez has recorded 108 records, many of  them receiving gold and silver status, and list ings on  the  top  spots of  the  international  record  charts. He  has  received  numerous  awards and  recognitions  throughout Mexico,  the United States and Latin America.  Alberto Vazquez recently released his latest  record ""Cosas de Alberto Vazquez,"" which in cludes such hits as ""Te he Prometido,"" ""Tus  Ojos,"" ""Anoche me Enamore,"" and ""EI Ultimo  Beso.""  Mr. Alberto Vazquez is a perfect recipient of  the Mr. Amigo award. For he has, over the  long period of his career,  taken his unique  screen, television, and stage performances to  numerous  countries,  including  the  United  States. A true ambassador of his country and  of his culture, he has been praised by numer ous organizations  for his unconditional com mitment to improve mutual understanding and  cooperation between Mexico and  the United  States. Mr. Alberto Vazquez should be recog nized for both his artistic ability and his con tribution  to his commitment to bicultural  rela tions between the two nations.  Mr. Amigo, Mr. Alberto Vazquez, will receive  the  red-carpet  treatment  when  he  visits  Brownsville as the city's honored guest during  the upcoming Mr. Amigo celebration. During  his stay on the border, he will make personal  appearances  in  parades and  other  festival  events. Official  ""welcome""  receptions will be  staged by organizations  in Cameron County,  Texas, and  the cities of Brownsville, Texas,  and Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico.

As  Colonel of the Eastern Battalion of New Jer sey's militia forces, Jacob Ford participated in  the first Battle of Springfield. However, shortly  thereafter, he fell  ill with pneumonia and died  on January 10, 1777. Even so, Colonel Ford's  widow, Theodosia, who was left with five chil dren, offered the mansion to General George  Washington to use as his headquarters during  the very harsh winters of 1777 and 1779-80  in New Jersey. Unlike the areas of New Jer sey nearer to New York City, Morristown had  fewer  loyalists and  its surrounding hills pro-  vided natural defenses  for a winter  refuge  where  the next summer campaign could be  planned. In addition, the Continental Army and  various militias could be maneuvered quickly  to either Manhattan or Philadelphia from their  primitive and difficult encampment at Jockey  Hollow.  In this grand home, Washington, along with  his aide-de-camp Alexander Hamilton, would  lay out the strategy for much of the Revolu tion's greatest campaigns. At a tall secretary  desk, which still graces  the mansion, Wash ington penned some of the most important let ters of the Revolution. Some of the greatest  heroes of  the war, including  the Marquis de  Lafayette, General Schuyler, General Greene,  General Knox, and even  the  infamous traitor  General Benedict Arnold, walked through  the  Ford Mansion's front door and graced Martha  Washington's wartime dining  room with  their  conversations about victory, defeat and  the  battles yet  to come.  It has been said  that  under  the Ford Mansion's  roof have been  gathered more  figures known  to  the military  history of our Revolution than any other house  in America. It is no wonder that Morristown is  considered the Military Capital of the Revolu tion.  Nearly a century later, the Washington As sociation of New Jersey was founded  in Mor ristown  in June of 1873, in order to save the  Ford Mansion as it was offered for sale by the  heirs of Colonel Ford's grandson, the Honor able Henry Ford.

We came into this body a  few days apart. He was  just ahead of  me, so he always gets the office I want  and I am right behind him. But we are  kind of a class of our own.  Just two little stories that make me  know what SAM  JOHNSON and Shirley  Johnson are all about. When I talk to  SAM, and he does not talk much about  it, he says when they stand you up and  blindfold you and  they are going  to  shoot you and  then  they do not, he  says, you never fear again.  And then when I  talk with Shirley,  and she  is a great friend of Connie's  and mine, she takes it so lightly. Well,  he ran off while I was raising the chil dren.  I think they are a great couple.  You certainly do love your country,  your family and your God.  It shows  every day in that great big smile. God  bless you, SAM.  ",1998

After  I was drafted  into  the Army  and served 2 years during the Korean  conflict, I could not wait to get out and  tell my friends and family how much I  had suffered when I was in the Army,  the great contributions and sacrifices  that I made. The truth was that I never  saw combat. I was in a  tank once at  Fort Knox, and I did go through basic  training, was trained to be a tank com mander; but I was lucky and never did  really have to do anything that would  put me in harm's way.  But then I met JOHN MCCAIN and SAM  JOHNSON  and  others  in  similar  cir cumstances, and all of a sudden, I made  a plea to myself and promise to myself  that I would never say that I suffered  while I was in the Army. I was glad I  served, and I am happy that I did my  duty. But it paled  in comparison  to  those sacrifices made by the likes of  SAM JOHNSON and JOHN MCCAIN.  ",1998

His  record of  sacrifice and dedication to duty is unmatched  in this House.

173,House,105,0.51,1356,1,Mr. MANZULLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to a real American hero, Congressman SAM JOHNSON, and to all his fellow  POWs who  so bravely and valiantly served  this country. As you well know, SAM was shot  down over North Vietnam and imprisoned for  almost  seven years under horrifying  condi tions.  What strikes me most about SAM's story is  his  unshakeable  faith  in  the Lord. On  the  evening of his 72nd day  in  leg stocks, SAM  was ready to give up. For months he had not  been able  to move  from  his  shackles. For  months  he  had  not  seen  the  sun or  sky  through  the boarded-up windows of his  tiny  cell. As  he  fell  asleep  that  evening,  SAM  thought to himself: ""It would be okay if I never  woke up again."" That night, a powerful  ty phoon struck Hanoi. As SAM's cell filled with  water, be began to pray as never before. He  knew then more than ever that the Lord was  his hope and his salvation. As SAM  later re counted, ""When I woke up the next morning,  I realized the storm has blown the covers off  the window, and that morning  I saw the sun  rise for the first time in 72 days. That was God  in all His glory coming up out there. And  it's  good to know He's there;  it certainly helps to  put your mind  at  rest.  It  helps you  to get  through those tough times.""  God bless you SAM JOHNSON. God bless our  POWs. And God bless America.  CONGRESSMAN SAM JOHNSON  (Testimonial as told to Northwest Bible  Church)  Listen, I want you to know that we've been  doing a little bible study up there in Wash ington, DC, believe it or not .... My good ness,  the Lord  is directing you and, you  know, it goes to show you the faith and the  grace and the failures that make our lives  worth  living. Let me  tell you a  little bit  about what happened  to me  in Vietnam. I  was shot down in an F-4 and ejected to get  out. Our air speed was about 650 knots, which  is kind of slow I guess. I broke my left arm  in two places and dislocated my left shoulder  and broke my back. When I landed the bad  guys were on me  in about 30  seconds. We  were right in the middle of a division of the  enemy  troops,  and  I was  caught pretty  quickly.  They threw me around and they took over  a house and just kicked the people out. The  guards and I were thrown in there. My back seater also got out, fortunately, and was put  in another house where  they  threw people  out. We stayed there for just one night and  then went  to a  place called  ""Dong Hui""  which was in North Vietnam. There they ac cused us of being air pirates and took me out  and put me in front of a firing squad. Even  though you've been trained in the Air Force  Survival School and you know or think they  are not really going to hurt you, when you're  standing there with six guys facing you with  rilles, and you see them pull a clip out of  their pockets, jam it in the gun, and charge  the weapon, you know you can't really tell  whether there's a bullet going in or not. And  they pull them up and the officer gives the  signal  to  fire  and  they  all  go  click,  click .... You're facing them and you won der about that. They tried again later, and  the second  time  I  laughed at  them. They  threw me in a pit. You know, in retrospect,  that was the Lord being with me. I followed  him by praying as hard as I could at that  time, but the real faith you know, the Lord  really being with you, doesn't  come home  until you stop and think how he provided.  Later they put a cast on my arm. They  dressed up some guards like doctors (which  ",1998
174,Senate,105,-0.395,1408,1,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, I want to  express my support for President Clin ton, in consultation with Congress and  consistent with the United States Con stitution and  laws,  taking necessary  and appropriate actions to respond ef fectively to the threat posed by Iraq's  refusal to end its weapons of mass de struction programs.  I  am presently  in Moscow accom panying Secretary of Defense William  Cohen on a  trip that has taken us to  Saudi  Arabia,  Kuwait,  Oman,  the  United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bah rain.  I believe that it would be useful to  briefly review some of the historical  record  relating  to  Iraq's compliance  with United Nations Security Council  resolutions leading up  to  the present  crisis.  United Nations Security Council Res olution  660  of August  2,  1990,  con demned  the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait  and demanded  that  it withdraw  its  forces  from  Kuwait.  The  Security  Council's Resolution 678 of November  29, 1990, affirmed by Resolution 687 of  April 3, 1991, authorized the use of all  necessary means  to  restore  inter national peace  and  security. During  this period and up to the actual use of  force by  the United States-led coali tion, there were a series of diplomatic  efforts to convince the government of  Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Ku wait. But Saddam Hussein didn't get it.  Following the Gulf War, the Security  Council continued  the economic and  weapons sanctions on Iraq  that were  imposed after it invaded Kuwait. The  Security Council conditioned the lift ing of the sanctions on Iraq's accepting  the destruction, removal or rendering  harmless,  under  international  super vision, of its nuclear, chemical, and bi ological weapons programs and all bal listic missiles with  a  range greater  than 150 kilometers. Despite the crip pling international economic sanctions  that have been imposed on his country  by the international community, Sad dam Hussein still didn't get it.  ",1998
175,Senate,105,-0.296,1434,1,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce legislation that we  call  the HEALTHY Kids Act.  It ad dresses the question of how we form a  national policy on tobacco.  I am joined in cosponsorship by Sen ators  AKAKA,  BAUCUS,  BINGAMAN,  BOXER,  BREAUX,  BRYAN,  BUMPERS,  DASCHLE, DODD, DORGAN, DURBIN, JOHN SON,  KENNEDY,  BOB  KERREY,  JOHN  KERRY, KOHL, LANDRIEU, LAUTENBERG,  LEAHY,  MOSELEY-BRAUN,  MOYNIHAN,  REED,  ROCKEFELLER,  TORRICELLI,  WELLSTONE, and WYDEN. And we have  additional Senators who  are  consid ering cosponsorship of this legislation  as we speak.  First of all, I thank the Democratic  leader, Senator DASCHLE, for his strong  leadership and support of the work of  the  task force. Months ago he called  me and asked me to head up an effort  within the Democratic Caucus to draft  tobacco  legislation. We have engaged  21 members of  this  task  force  in a  lengthy effort  to  listen  to  those af fected and to try to craft a responsible  national tobacco policy.  We held 18 hearings. We heard over  100 witnesses. We held hearings across  the country. We engaged in this level  of effort because the subject is so im portant.  Tobacco  is  the  only product  that  when used  legally-and as  the manu facturer intendedaddicts and kills its  customers.  For too long tobacco companies have  waged war on our kids. It is time to  counterattack.  For too long big tobacco has hooked  our kids on a  lifelong addiction. It is  time to stop it.  For  too  long  the  tobacco  industry  has deliberately targeted kids as ""re placement smokers"" to fill the shoes of  over 425,000 Americans killed by  to bacco each year.  Let me  repeat  that. Over  400,000  deaths  a  year  in  this  country  are  caused by the use of tobacco products.  Many more, as we have heard in our  hearings, have suffered terribly. As we  heard Monday at a hearing in Newark,  NJ,  when  we  heard  from  Pierce  Frauenheim,  a  coach  and  assistant  principal who had a  laryngectomy be cause of throat cancer caused by the  use of tobacco products. He told us of  the terror and trauma of that illness.  And we heard  from a  young woman  named Gina Seagrave, a young woman  who lost her mother to a massive heart  attack when she was only 45 years of  age because of using tobacco products.  Her tears told the story of her family's  pain and suffering.  Mr. President,  those stories are re written day in and day out because of  the awful effects of tobacco. There is  something we can do about it if only  we have the political will and the cour age to act. Witnesses told us repeatedly  that we need a comprehensive plan to  dramatically reduce the use of tobacco  products in our country. That is what  we present today-the HEALTHY Kids  Act.  Mr. President,  the HEALTHY Kids  Act is  the work of the Senate Demo cratic  task  force on  tobacco  legisla tion. The HEALTHY Kids Act provides  responsible tobacco policy. It protects  children, promotes  the public health,  helps  tobacco  farmers,  and  resolves  Federal, State and local legal claims,  without providing immunity to the in dustry;  it  invests  in  children  and  health care; it provides savings for So cial Security and Medicare; and it re imburses taxpayers for costs that have  been imposed on  them by the use of  these products.  The HEALTHY Kids Act protects  children. It does that with a healthy  price increase-a $1.50 a pack health fee  phased in over 3 years. It protects chil dren by providing the Food and Drug  Administration with full authority to  regulate  these  products.  It provides  strong penalties  for  those companies  that fail to reach the targeted projec tion for  the reduction of teen smok ing-a 67  percent  reduction  in  teen  smoking over the next 10 years. Those  penalties are a 10-cent a pack penalty  industry wide if the goals are not met  and a 40-cent a pack penalty for the in dividual companies for their failure to  reach  the objective. We  also protect  children by providing comprehensive  antitobacco programs. Included in that  are counteradvertising, prevention pro grams,  smoking . cessation  programs  and  research. Finally,  in protecting  children, we provide for retailer com pliance-State  licensure  of  retailers  and no sales to minors.  The HEALTHY Kids Act also pro motes the public health. It does so by  addressing the question of secondhand  smoke. Most public  facilities  in  the  country would be smoke free under our  proposal. We would provide exemptions  for bars, casinos, bingo parlors, hotel  guest rooms-that is, hotels could have  smoking  and  nonsmoking  rooms  as  they do nownonfast-food small res taurants,  that  is,  those  restaurants  with less  than 50 seats would be ex empt; prisons,  tobacco shops, and pri vate clubs. At the same time we pro vide those exemptions, we also provide  for no State preemption. If a State or  local unit of government wants to have  more stringent provisions, it is free to  do so.  We also promote the public health by  protecting the public's right to know.  We provide  for  full document disclo sure; all relevant documents go to the  FDA. The FDA is able to make those  documents  public;  and  the  public  health interest overrides  trade secret  or attorney-client privileges when the  FDA makes a determination that the  public health is the overriding interest.  We also provide for international to bacco marketing  controls:  no  pro motion of U.S.  tobacco exports. I am  proud to say that in this administra tion we are not doing that, but in pre vious administrations they have. This  would codify  the conduct of this ad ministration and provide  for no pro motion of U.S. tobacco exports. It also  provides a  code of conduct. No mar keting to foreign children. Any activi ties carried out in this country to mar ket  to  children  in another  country  would be  illegal.  It also has modest  funding for international tobacco con trol efforts. And we require warning la bels, warning labels of the country that  is the recipient of products sent from  this country. And if they do not have a  system of warning labels, then our own  warning labels would apply.  The HEALTHY Kids Act also helps  tobacco farmers. They were left out of  the  proposed  settlement  completely.  Their interest was not addressed. We  do not think that is fair. We provide  $10 billion in just the first 5 years for  assistance  to farmers and  their com munities. We  authorize  funding  for  transition payments  to  farmers  and  quota holders. We provide for rural and  community economic development re training  for  tobacco  factory workers  and tobacco farmers and even college  scholarships  for  farm  families  if  the  committees of Congress deem that ap propriate.  The HEALTHY Kids Act makes very  clear that we will not provide immu nity to this industry, no special protec tion for future misconduct, no special  protection against individual lawsuits  for past misconduct. We do resolve the  outstanding Federal, State, and local  government legal claims. States, how ever, can opt out of this national set tlement if they so choose, and cities  and counties are assured of getting a  fair share of reimbursements that go to  States.  On the question of attorney's fees, we  concluded  that no monies  from  the  HEALTHY Kids Act should be used for  attorney's fees. With respect to the size  of  the  fees, we deliberated  long and  hard, listened to all of the affected in terests and concluded that the attor ney's fees in these cases ought to be re solved by arbitration panels using ABA  ethical guidelines. Those guidelines are  set out with specificity in the legisla tion that I will introduce today.  And so if we are in a circumstance  like the controversy in Florida, if the  parties cannot agree,  an arbitration  panel would resolve the matter and de termine what the attorney's fees were  ",1998
176,Senate,105,0.109,1460,1,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased  to  join with my  colleagues,  Senators JEFFORDS and ENZI in intro ducing  the Preventing Addiction  to  Smoking Among Teens Act.  Tobacco  is  the No.  1 preventable  cause of death in the United States, ac counting for more than 400,000 deaths a  year  and more  than  $50  billion  in  health care costs. Clearly  the single  most effective thing we can do  to im prove our Nation's health and control  health care costs is to stop smoking.  While recent headlines detailing the  settlement of multimillion dollar law suits  against  the  tobacco  industry  might delude us into thinking that we  are winning the war against tobacco,  the facts tell a far different story. De spite  extensive  public  health  cam paigns  linking smoking  to heart dis ease and cancer, smoking rates are ac tually going up,  particularly among  our young people. Tragically, addiction  is increasingly a ""teen-onset"" disease:  in fact, Mr. President, 90 percent of all  smokers began smoking before age 21,  What is particularly alarming is that  children, especially girls, are smoking  at younger and younger ages. Smoking  is at a 19-year high among high school  seniors and has increased over 35 per cent among eighth graders and 43 per cent among tenth graders over the last  7 years.  Moreover,  of  the  3,000  teens who  enter the ranks of ""regular smokers""  every day, one-third will die  tobacco related deaths. Mr. President,  I  am  very proud of many of the accomplish ments and achievements of my great  State 6f Maine, but there is one area  where we do need to do much, much  better. The sad fact is that my State of  Maine has  the dubious distinction of  having  the  highest  smoking  rate  among people age 18 to 34 in the entire  United States. In Maine, almost 40 per cent of high  school students smoke.  They purchase  1.4 million  packs of  cigarettes illegally each year. If this  trend  continues,  more  than  31,000  young people in Maine currently under  the age of 18 will die prematurely from  tobacco-related diseases. If we are  to  put an end to this tragic yet prevent able epidemic, we must accelerate our  efforts not only to help more smokers  to quit, but also  to discourage young  people  from  ever  lighting up  in  the  first place.  The Preventing Addiction  to Smok ing Among Teens Act, which we are in troducing today, adopts a comprehen sive approach  to prevent  teens  from  smoking and builds upon and improves  re ",1998
177,Senate,105,0.46,1473,1,Mr. KEMPTHORNE.," Mr. President, I  rise today to express my strong support  for  the National Character Counts  week resolutions submitted by my es teemed colleague, Senator DOMENICI.  I  have  cosponsored  similar  resolutions  for the past 4 years and am honored to  have  the opportunity  to do  so again  this year.  I  stand before you  today, because  children  and  adults  alike  are  con stantly being bombarded by violence,  profanity,  and  immorality,  both  through  the media and  in every day  life. This onslaught of negative images  and expressions has expanded the issue  of character from a casual concern to a  matter of considerable  social  impor tance. During my tenure in the Senate  it has been my goal, and the goal of  many of my colleagues, to raise aware ness of the importance of raising our  younger generations in an atmosphere  of strong principles. I can think of few  things we could do  to better achieve  this goal than to bring the attributes  of good character to a level that will be  admired by our children.  through  our own actions, we demonstrate  the  value, and indeed the necessity, of good  character, we may help  turn  future  generations  away  from  the  all  too  often glamorized visions of unscrupu lous activities.  As a father, I am concerned that the  role models our nation's children seek  for leadership and guidance do not ex emplify  the  integrity  and character  that most parents would condone. As  an elected leader, I believe it is my job,  and the obligation of my colleagues, to  take an initial step to reinvigorate the  attributes  of  character-trust worthiness, respect, responsibility, jus tice and fairness, caring, civic virtue,  and citizenship-which National Char acter Counts Week highlights. We need  to regain these qualities in our commu nities, in. our families, and in the devel opment of our own lives.  Mr. President, as we watch our chil dren blossom into the leaders of the fu ture it is my hope that each and every  one of them will be able to look up to  individuals who epitomize  the values  and attributes that are represented by  National Character Counts Week. I am  proud  to  stand with my  fellow  colIf,  leagues  today,  to discuss  the  impor tance of having genuine character. The  simple step of raising awareness of the  value of good character can have a  powerful and  long  lasting  impact.  In  the words of President Ronald Reagan,  ""They say the world has become far  too complex for simple answers. They  are wrong. There are no easy answers,  but there are simple answers. We must  have the courage to do what we know  is morally right.""  Mr. President, I believe by standing  before you today, the supporters of Na tional Character Counts Week are tak ing  the  initial step in accomplishing  what is morally right. We are, however,  only a  single piece in the puzzle. My  colleagues and I, along with civic orga nizations around the Nation, are only  emissaries of a message. The true fun damental values that will instill char acter  in our children must begin at  home. No amount of moral instruction  from outside the home can replace the  guidance of a  loving and supportive  family.  Recognizing  a  national  week  to  stress  the  importance of character is  but a small step in addressing the cri sis of ethics the Nation faces. At the  same  time,  it  is an  important step  which I believe all of us should support.  I would like to thank Senator DOMENICI  for his  continued  leadership on Na tional Character Counts Week,  and  urge my colleagues  to cosponsor  the  resolution.  SENATE RESOLUTION 177RELATIVE TO PRISONERS OF WAR  Mr. COVERDELL  (for himself, Mr.  CLELAND, Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire,  Mr.  LOTT,  Mr.  HAGEL,  and  Ms.  MOSELEY-BRAUN)  submitted  the  fol lowing  resolution; which was consid ered and agreed to:  S. RES. 177  Whereas  participation  by  the  United  States Armed Forces in combat operations  in Southeast Asia during  the period from  1964  through 1972  resulted  in several hun dreds  of members  of  the United States  Armed Forces being taken prisoner by North  Vietnamese, Pathet Lao,  and Viet Cong  enemy forces;  Whereas the first such United States serv iceman taken as a prisoner of war, Navy Lt.  Commander Everett Alvarez, was captured  on August 5, 1964;  Whereas following the Paris Peace Accords  of January 1973, 591 United States prisoners  of war were released from captivity by North  Vietnam;  Whereas the return of these prisoners of  war to United States control and to their  families and comrades was designated Oper ation Homecoming;  Whereas many members  of  the United  States Armed Forces who were taken pris oner as a result of ground or aerial combat  in Southeast Asia have not returned to their  loved ones and their whereabouts remain un known;  Whereas United States prisoners of war in  Southeast Asia were routinely subjected to  brutal mistreatment,  including  beatings,  torture, starvation, and denial of medical at tention;  Whereas United States prisoners of war in  Southeast Asia were held in a number of fa cilities, the most notorious of which was Hoa  Loa Prison in downtown Hanoi, dubbed the  ""Hanoi Hilton"" by the prisoners held there;  Whereas  the hundreds of United States  prisoners or war held in the Hanoi Hilton and  other  facilities  persevered  under  terrible  conditions;  Whereas the prisoners were frequently iso lated from each other and prohibited from  speaking to each other;  Whereas  the  prisoners  nevertheless,  at  great personal risk, devised a means to com municate with each other  through a  code  transmitted by tapping on cell walls;  Whereas  then-Commander  James  B.  Stockdale, United States Navy, who upon his  capture on September 9,  1965, became  the  senior POW officer present in the Hanoi Hil ton, delivered to his men a message that was  to sustain them during their ordeal, as fol lows: Remember, you are Americans. With  faith in God, trust in one another, and devo tion  to your country, you will overcome.  You will triumph.;  Whereas the men held as prisoners of war  during the Vietnam conflict truly represent  all that is best about America;  Whereas  two of these patriots, Congress man Sam Johnson, of Texas, and Senator  John McCain, of Arizona, have continued to  honor the Nation with devoted service; and  Whereas the Nation owes a debt of grati tude to all of these patriots for their courage  and exemplary service: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the Senate(1)  expresses  its gratitude  for, and calls  upon all Americans to reflect upon and show  their gratitude for, the courage and sacrifice  of the brave men who were held as prisoners  of war during the Vietnam conflict, particu larly on the occasion of the 25th anniversary  of Operation Homecoming, their return from  captivity; and  (2) acting on behalf of all Americans(A) will not forget  that more than 2,000  members of the United States Armed Forces  remain unaccounted  for from  the Vietnam  conflict; and  (B) will continue  to press for  the fullest  possible accounting for such members.  SENATE RESOLUTION 178-TO AU THORIZE  THE  PRODUCTION OF  SENATE DOCUMENTS AND REP RESENTATION BY THE  SENATE  LEGAL COUNSEL  Mr.  LOTT  (for  himself  and Mr.  DASCHLE) submitted the following reso lution;  which  was  considered  and  agreed to:  S.

178,Senate,105,-0.301,1486,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, next  Wednesday, February 18, marks an aus picious occasion: Michael B. Robert son-a constituent-will  turn 50. He  will become a quinquagenarian.  Indi viduals often approach this milestone  with some trepidation. That need not  be,  for as Sir Richard Steele wrote,  ''Age in a virtuous person, of either  sex, carries in it an authority which  makes it preferable to all the pleasures  of youth."" Now, Steele was all of 38 or  39 when he wrote that in 1711, but I can  attest to the sentiment, having become  a septuagenarian last March. More im portant, we learn from Leviticus 25:10  that ""Ye shall hallow the fiftieth year,  and proclaim  liberty  throughout all  the land unto all the inhabitants there of: it shall be a jubilee unto you.""  Michael Robertson was born in Scot land  in 1948. But he ""left fair Scotland's strand"" at the age of six and  moved with his family  to  the United  States. He obtained a bachelor of arts  degree in English from Wilkes Univer sity in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania in  1969. From there, as a young man, he  headed west,  following  the advice of  Horace Greeley  (actually,  it was  the  advice of John Babsone Lane Soule, in  an article published in the Terre Haute  Express in 1851).  His car and his funds made it to Los  Angeles. He  had  to  find work,  and  ended up taking a  job in the mailroom  of Carson/Roberts Advertising. His su periors quickly  recognized his  innate  ability and work ethic, and promoted  him to copywriter. Soon thereafter, he  was an associate creative director with  Young & Rubicam, eventually return ing to the East Coast. Onward and up ward  in  the highly competitive busi ness of advertising to his present posi tion as executive creative director of  Bates USA, where he is responsible for  the overall creative product of a $1.1  billion agency.  Mr. Robertson,  I might note,  is a  neighbor of sorts. His office  is in the  venerable Chrysler Building,  a  few  floors below the suite which is my New  York City office. He has a lovely fam ily, including a daughter, Megan (just  recently married); a  son, Brendan  (a  strapping young man presently in col lege); and another daughter, Charlotte  (a star fourth-grader at the Nightin gale-Bamford School). His wife, Linda,  is quite accomplished in her own right:  she produced  the  television commer cials commemorating the fiftieth anni versary of the United Nations.  I would like to take this opportunity,  Mr. President,  to  join with Michael  Robertson's family and friends too nu merous to count in wishing him a very  happy fiftieth birthday. May it truly be  a jubilee.   LONDONDERRY  HIGH  SCHOOL  LANCER MARCHING BAND, PAR TICIPANT  IN THE WASHINGTON,  D.C.,  ST.  PATRICK'S DAY  PA RADE   ",1998
179,Senate,105,0.623,1486,1,Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.," Mr.  President, I rise today to congratulate  the students of the Londonderry High  School Lancers Marching Band for the  distinguished  honor  of  representing  New Hampshire  in  the Washington,  D.C., St. Patrick's Day Parade. All 201  band members and Andrew Soucy, the  Band's director, deserve special com mendation  for  their hard work  and  achievement.  These  band members  have  proven  that  determination,  hardwork  and  dedication are the hallmarks of success  both as musicians and students. Many  of the songs they play symbolize Amer ican pride and forever keep patriotism  alive  through  the  language of music.  ""Londonderry Ear,"" also known as ""Oh  Danny Boy,""  is a hometown favorite  the  that is also played  in  tribute  to  Granite State and their home town.  I am indeed honored to have the Lon donderry High School Lancer Marching  Band representing New Hampshire with  their  outstanding musical  perform ances.  I had  the pleasure of meeting  some of the band members, young men  and women, who have recognized their  own  talents and continue  to develop  them into something great. I am proud  to say, this continual drive for perfec tion and aggressive strive for greatness  are  commendable  characteristics  among Granite State students.  These  students  not  only  attended  school and practice, but they also had  to raise money through several fund raisers to come to Washington, D.C. As  a  result,  the band accomplished their  goal by implementing a plan and hav ing  the right attitude and  talent  to  meet their goal.  The Londonderry High School Lanc ers Marching Band with  their classic  red, white, and blue uniforms have per formed  for audiences  throughout  the  country. To name a few, they played at  the Foxboro Stadium, home of the New  England Patriots in Boston, Massachu setts, Nascar Winston Cup Series, and  for Good Morning America, an ABC  Television Network.  I also want to recognize the London derry community, for giving so much  support in helping these young adults.  I am well aware of the pride the com munity has for this talented band. It is  much easier to be successful when you  have  the  support of others and  the  backing from friends and family.  Mr. President, I want to congratulate  all  the students and  the director on  such  a magnificent  accomplishment  and I am proud to represent them in  the U.S. Senate. I also ask that a  list  of the names of these outstanding stu dents be printed in the RECORD.  The list follows:  LONDONDERRY HIGH SCHOOL LANCER MARCHING  BAND  Scott Abernethy, Noura Alkhamis, Bridget  Ambrose, Heather Applegate, Jordon Avalos,  Christina  Belmonte,  Matthew  Blake,  Danielle  Boshetto,  Katie  Broadhead,  Carolynne Camillleri, Greta Carlson, Sarah  Chretien, Ashley Clover,  James Dahlfred,  Jessica  Davis,  Arthur  Decaneas,  Tim  Desmarais, William Doss, Amanda Eaton,  Sheridan Farrah Jr., Bethany Ferreira, Na than Formalarie, Kim Garrison, Madelyn  Gonzalez, Bridget Gugliotta, John Harding,  Andrew Hatin, Tara Henry, Nik  Janson,  Adam  Keller,  Kerry  Kilpatrick,  Joy  Arbruzese, Vanessa Allum,  Dan Anderson, Patrick Applegate, Sabrina  Baker, Kristin Beltrimini, Suzanne Blundell,  Meleah Brackett, Candice Brown, Ashley  Carlson, Mike Carlson, Tim Christensen,  Sarah Cody, Katie Daneau, Dave Day, Robert  Decker  Jr.,  Jenn Dillon, Kristen Dubois,  Michelle Eddy, Mike Fawcett, Greg Fisher,  Rachael  Fryd,  Leah  Gaumont,  Nicole  Gregorio, Kate Gunnery, Jason Harrington,  Kristen Hatin, Neil Huntemann, Elizabeth  Jones, Andrew Keller, Katie Klasner, Alex andra Adams, Allison Alper, Andrew Apple gate, Ryan Arnold, Diego Batista, Erin  Blake,  ",1998
180,,105,0.348,1499,1,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor Saint David, the Welsh Patron  Saint. Many of my friends and colleagues may  not know  that  I am of Welsh descent-but  then again maybe my name, Lewis, gives me  1497  away. I am very proud of the Welsh blood run ning  through  my  veins. What  American  wouldn't be  if he knew  just how many great  Americans were also Welsh! Let me  take a  moment to share some  interesting facts with  you.  Did you know that twenty percent of our Pil grim Fathers were Welsh? Almost fifty percent  of the signers of the American Declaration of  Independence were also Welsh or of Welsh  heritage-as were nine of  the Presidents of  the United States,  including  John Adams,  Thomas Jefferson, James Madison,  James  Monroe, John Quincy Adams and Abraham  Lincoln. There are just too many great Welsh Americans to name!!  Another interesting fact I would like to share  with you pertains to Saint Patrick, the Patron  Saint of Ireland. Did you know that Saint Pat rick was really a Welshman? As a boy of six teen, Patrick was taken from the Welsh village  where he was born by an  Irish slave trading  party. He was a slave in Ireland until the age  of twenty-two, when he escaped and returned  to Wales. Later, he became a priest and was  sent back to Ireland where the Welshman Pat rick became  revered as Saint Patrick of  Ire land.  When  you are  in Washington, D.C.,  the  more athletically-inclined Welsh among  you  might like to hike half-way up the stairs in the  Washington Monument to read an  inscription  there:  ""Fy  laith, Fy Ngwlad, Fy Nghenedl,  Wales-Cymru Am Byth."" My  language, my  country, my nation, Wales-Wales forever!  On March 1st, Welsh Americans across the  Nation will honor the birth of Saint David, the  Patron Saint of Wales. At  the Welsh Pres byterian Church  in Los Angeles,  the Welsh  Choir of Southern California will give its pre miere  performance,  conducted  by  famous,  Welsh-born  Hollywood  composer  Michael  Lewis!  I know that this concert will be a treat  for all who hear  it.  I only wish  I could be  present!  I would say to my colleagues, let us all re member that March 1st is the birthday of Saint  David, the Patron Saint of Wales.

181,,105,-0.376,1499,1,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to  ask my colleagues to join me in commending  the public schools of the Canton and City of  Basel, Switzerland, on the comprehensive pro gram of Holocaust education which has been  adopted for their public schools.  Much has been written and said about the  outrageous behavior of some Swiss banking  executives with regard to deposits of gold and  other valuables by Holocaust victims during  the period before and during World War II, but  little attention has been  focused on  the out standing degree to which the people of Basel  and other Swiss cities and cantons have as sumed  the  responsibility of  teaching Swiss  ",1998
182,,105,-0.438,1512,1,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to introduce a resolution calling for Tai wan's representation  in  the World Health Or ganization (WHO) and U.S. support for such a  bid. As  the  ranking member on  the House  Subcommittee on Health and Environment,  I  am pleased  that several of my colleagues  from both sides of the aisle have joined me in  this  important endeavor,  for health knows no  boundaries and  this issue is one  that should  unite rather than divide us.  Sick children  feel  the same pain and shed  the same  tears, whether they  live  in Taipei,  Los Angeles, Milan, or Nairobi. The stated and  noble aim of the WHO  is to help achieve the  highest possible level of health for all peoples,  but the 21 million people of Taiwan are cur rently barred from accessing the latest medical  knowledge and  techniques which  the WHO  could provide. Moreover, Taiwan cannot con tribute  its own  substantial health  resources  and expertise  to  furthering  the goals of  the  WHO, as it did prior to 1972.  Quite  simply,  as  increased  international  trade and travel leads to a greater potential for  the cross-border spread of infectious diseases,  the case for Taiwan's participation in the WHO  grows stronger every day. Taiwan and its chil dren have much  to gain  from  the WHO, as  does  the WHO  from Taiwan. This  issue  is  principally a matter of the basic human right to  good health, and  I encourage all my  col leagues to support this resolution.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  IN HONOR OF MELVIN E. KAMEN:  AN  INVENTOR  OF  THE  YEAR  NEW  JERSEY  INVENTORS HALL  OF FAME  HON. ROBERT MENENDFZ  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 12, 1998  ",1998
183,,105,-0.362,1512,1,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to pay tribute to an outstanding scientist, Mr.  Melvin E. Kamen, who will be honored as an  ""Inventor of the Year"" by the New Jersey In ventors Hall of Fame at  their 1Oth Annual  Awards Banquet on Thursday, February 12,  1998, at the William Hazell Center at the New  Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, NJ.  Mr. Kamen, Chief Research Scientist  for  Revlon, has been with  the company  for 28  years. Prior to his association with Revlon, Mr.  Kamen was the president and chief chemist of  New Jersey-based Kamco Chemical  Indus tries. he  is  recognized  for his work in devel oping  ENVIROGLUV,  a  revolutionary  new  glass decorating  technology. He holds mem berships in several professional organizations,  including  the American  Institute of Chemists  and American Oil Chemist Society, as well as  the New York Academy of Science and  the  Society of Glass and Ceramic Decorators.  Mr. Kamen, a resident of Highlands, NJ, is  Senior Vice  President  of Advanced  Tech nology at the Revlon Research Center in Edi son. Mr. Kamen spent 10 years developing  and refining  the ENVIROGLUV process. This  process eliminates any heavy metals, solvents  and volatile organic compounds from the glass  decorating process. ENVIROGLUV provides  both an economic and environmentally sound  alternative  that  is  superior  to  conventional  glass decorating methods. This technology is  touted as one of the biggest breakthroughs in  the glass decorating business in 1 00 years.  Revlon Technologies  is  the  technology  li censing division of Revlon, Inc., a worldwide  leader  in  the development and marketing of  cosmetics, skin care, fragrance, personal care  and professional products. The division's first  product is ENVIROGLUV which uses patented  and proprietary  inks  in a glass decorating  technology based on  ultraviolet  light  rather  than old-fashion heat curing ovens. The proc ess offers superior color, greater speed and  flexibility,  reduced manufacturing  costs and  environmental benefits.  It  is an honor  to  recognize Mr. Melvin E.  Kamen for his outstanding accomplishments. I  am certain that my colleagues will join me in  paying tribute to this remarkable gentleman.  DAYCARE FAIRNESS FOR STAY AT-HOME PARENTS  SPEECH OF  HON. FRANK R. WOLF  01< VIRGINIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 11, 1998  ",1998
184,,105,0.284,1512,1,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  House Concurrent Resolution 202,  the Equi table Child Care Resolution. There's been a  lot of talk about child care over the  last few  February 12, 1998  months, and I think that's good. It's good that  we're talking about this subject. But my ques tion  is, is  it  fair and  right to give tax credits  only to those parents who use paid day care  for their children? What about those who have  made the decision to either be home with their  kids, or who have  their  relatives caring  for  their children?  There are a lot of different child care pro posals on  the  table right now, and  there will  probably be more to come. The administration  has laid out its child care proposal. But there  is something that all of these proposals have  in common: They are all  trying  to help fami lies, but only those families who use commer cial day care. But what I would like to see is  fairness  for  the  families who don't fall under  that category.  The fact is, at-home care of children is not  just a thing of the past in some ""Leave It To  Beaver"" world. The majority of  families with  preschool-aged kids are either caring  for the  children  themselves or are having  relatives  take care of the kids. Some of these parents  are working  part-time, or working  in  ""tag team"" shifts so they can both have time with  their kids and avoid having to pay for some one else to care for them. Some of them have  grandma or grandpa taking care of their chil dren, or an aunt or uncle.  According  to  the most  recent  information  that we have  from  the Census Bureau, only  about a third of children under the age of 5  are in some form of paid day care while the  mother works outside the home. Is it really fair  to only give tax relief to that one-third of Amer ican  families? What can we do  to help  the  other  two-thirds of  families? Let's not  forget  about them.  The American family is under great financial  pressure today. And a lot of that pressure is  due to the burden of taxes. Who is being hit  the hardest? Families with children. These last  50 years have meant a huge increase in  the  tax burden being placed on these Americans.  In 1948,  for example, a mom and dad with  four kids only paid a mere 3 percent of their  family income to the federal government in di rect  taxes. But  last  year,  that  figure  had  jumped dramatically. In fact, that same family  had  to pay almost a quarter of its income to  Uncle Sam!  (When you  include state,  local  and  indirect taxes,  that 1997 figure  leaps  to  about 38  percent.) This  is  ridiculous. And  something has to be done about it. Why are  we penalizing people for getting married and  having children? And why, as we  talk about  child care proposals, are we penalizing those  who are sacrificing even more by staying at  home or having  relatives  take care of  their  kids?  And that's why I stand here to give my sup port to the Equitable Child Care Resolution, H.  Con. Res. 202.  I urge my Colleagues to take  this step  to ensure  that all  families will be  treated  fairly as we continues  these discus sions about day care.  ",1998

189,Senate,105,0.403,61,9,Mr. THOMPSON.," Mr. President, on  behalf of myself and a bipartisan group  of senators, I introduce today the Fed eral Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. This  legislation is needed to preserve one of  the Senate's most  important powers:  the duty to advise and consent on pres idential nominees.  The Framers of the Constitution es tablished a procedure for the appoint ment of all government officers:  they  were to be nominated by the President  and confirmed by  the Senate, unless  Congress decided that the appointment  of specified inferior officers was to be  made  by  the  President  alone,  the  courts, or by department heads. The  First Congress,  however,  recognized  that vacancies would arise in executive  positions, and enacted legislation pro viding for officials to temporarily exer cise the powers of an office even with out Senate confirmation. The law was  adopted essentially in its current form  in 1868, and was last amended in 1988.  As amended, the first assistant or an other Senate-confirmed individual can  serve for 120 days after the vacancy,  and,  in addition, may  serve beyond  those 120 days if the President submits  a nomination for that office to the Sen ate within those 120 days.

The 141  em ployees affected by this case, from Ha waii, California, Guam and Oklahoma,  have gone unpaid for their services due  to bankruptcy of the corporation and  an error in the Navy's disbursement of  monies due the corporation.  I am submitting the amendment in  response to constituent requests. In ad dition, the Navy is willing to make the  payment, but has indicated that legis lative authority is needed to disburse  the funds.

I am glad to hear that she did not men tion the words ""census sampling,"" be cause of course we know  that what  that really means is guesstimating.  Many people who are talking about  the census nowadays are the same ones  who  suggested that we have a  thing  called the ""Motor-Voter Bill"" in Cali fornia, which as we found out was noth ing more than the ""Illegal Alien Voter  Registration Act.""

193,House,105,-0.184,100,9,Mr. BARCIA.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank  the Committee on Science leadership,  especially  the gentleman  from Wis consin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER); the rank ing Democratic Member,  the  gen tleman  from California  (Mr. BROWN);  and  the  chairwoman  of  the  Sub committee  on  Technology  (Mrs.  MORELLA);  as well as  the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. DINGELL), the prin cipal author of the Fastener Quality  Act,  for  their diligence  in bringing  House Resolution 3824  to the floor on  an expedited basis.  Through  today's  action, we  in  the  House are showing that we are ready  and willing to do our part in making  these corrections, and we hope that the  Senate will find a way to bring their  bill to the floor as soon as possible. We  on the House side stand ready to do all  that is necessary to clear this legisla tion for the President in advance of the  July 4th district work period.  It  is clear from our subcommittee  hearing, and from extensive conversa tions we have had with a cross-section  of manufacturing companies,  that it  would be unwise  to allow regulations  implementing  the  Fastener Quality  Act to go into effect without a careful  review of how that act relates to the  current  state  of manufacturing.  In  fact, the automobile industry has esti mated that they will incur more than  $300 million in annual compliance costs  should this legislation fail to be signed  by the President before the July 26 im plementation date.  The primary purpose of the Fastener  Quality Act was  to  avoid disasters  caused by  the counterfeiting of bolts  by unscrupulous manufacturers. Unlike  the proprietary  fasteners of auto or  aircraft manufacturers, many of these  fasteners were  not  easily  traceable  from their end use back to their manu facturer.  However, while  it has been argued  that an increasingly competitive mar ketplace has made the Fastener Qual ity Act unnecessary, we know of no  current study showing  the extent  to  which protections, other than the Fas tener Quality Act, are now in place to  prevent a  recurrence of the old prob lem.  In  fact, many of  the countries  that exported defective fasteners in the  1980s are currently in economic turmoil  and  their current economic situation  may cause them to once again exhibit  unscrupulous behavior and flood Amer ican markets with  counterfeit  fas teners.  Therefore, I feel the study contained  in the act is necessary to give us the  assurance that the problem is perma nently under control before we  relax  the act for nonproprietary fasteners.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col leagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1998
194,House,105,0.331,113,9,Mr. BASS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in very  strong support of House Resolution 399,  a resolution that would make the full  funding of special education a high pri ority of this Congress.  I want  to  thank  the distinguished  chairman and gentleman  from Cali fornia for making  this a  truly bipar tisan resolution.  ",1998

Since  its  founding  in  1983,  this  group, geared mostly  towards patients with  Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disease, has been  combating the rehospitalization of patients fol lowing their discharge from  inpatient settings.  This program has yielded many positive ef fects, a record of which has been published in  the March 1993 issue of the Journal of Psy chosocial  Nursing.  The  Psychoeducation  Group has helped many patients who have  been out of the hospital, to change a pattern  of  recidivism  for consistent outpatient  treat ment.  The Psychoeducation Group consists of pa tients and  families  that are primarily,  immi grants from  the Caribbean nations. The pro gram has been well  received by  this group,  and  the  information sharing model has been  very effective.  I would like to recognize the hard work and  commitment that the Psychoeducation Group  has  exhibited  throughout  the  past  fifteen  years. Its efforts have truly changed the nature  of many lives.  ",1998
196,Senate,105,0.52,178,9,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, I rise  in opposition to this bill. And I take of fense  to some of  the comments that  were made by some of our colleagues  on the other side of the aisle who said,  that anybody who wants  to kill  this  bill is an instrument of big tobacco.  That s simply not true. I did not sup port this deal when the tobacco indus try and the administration and attor neys general got together and made a  deal. They didn't consult this Senator.  I was never in favor of the deal they  were in favor of that some people have  tried to promote and some people have .  tried to push, including, this adminis tration. So let me just make that very  clear.  Now, I have many reasons to oppose  this bill, and I am going to enumerate  these. Not one of them has anything to  do with the way the tobacco industry  wants this Senator to vote. And so peo ple making  allegations! wonder  if  that  can  be  turned  the  other way  around, but I am not going to do that.  I do not impugn people's motives or  their integrity. I think people have the  right to make decisions on whether or  not  legislation  is good  legislation or  bad.  ",1998
197,House,105,0.475,243,9,Mr. ROGAN.," Mr. Speaker, the defend ers of the education status quo are on  the wrong side of history. Each year  these people ask for more money for  the same failed programs that gave us  such poor education results in the first  place. Parents are fed up with broken  promises  and  the  lack  of  account ability that has been the hallmark of  these  demands  for more  and more  money. Parents and reformers are de manding  change.  Charter  schools,  school choice and education IRAs are  the wave of the future. Yet these re forms are fought tooth and nail by the  special interests and their defenders in  Congress.  But these bureaucracy lovers will ul timately  fail. They will  fail because  parents who care about the education  of their children will no longer accept  failure no matter how much money is  wasted on the failure.  Mr. Speaker, parents and their chil dren who desire more educational op portunities are looking to Congress to  pass the Coverdell legislation and vote  for better educational opportunities for  their children. That is the mandate and  the obligation of this Congress, and I  urge my colleagues to follow it.

198,House,105,-0.321,243,9,Mr. REYES.," Mr. Speaker,  tomorrow  Capitol Hill will be given  the oppor tunity to experience what I believe is  one of the most dynamic,  innovative  and educational programs ever created  in our country. This program, called  FIRST, teaches our youth that science  and technology can be fun, it can be ex citing and, yes, even cool.  Mr. Speaker,  teams of high school  students work with local adult mentors  to build  robots. They  then compete  against other teams in regional com petitions and culminate with  a  na tional competition at Disney World in  Florida.  Tomorrow FIRST is bringing 12 of its  outstanding  teens here  to provide  a  mini version of one of its competitions.  One of these teams, I am proud to say,  is Montwood High School and  their  robot Rambot which comes  from El  Paso, Texas, in my district. I am very  proud of the hard work and determina tion that brought them here this week.  Mr. Speaker, many of our colleagues  on both sides of the aisle have already  joined me in supporting FIRST and are  helping to sponsor tomorrow's event. I  urge each one of my colleagues, as well  as their staffs, to come by the Rayburn  foyer tomorrow between 9:30 a.m. and  4:00 p.m. to learn how the lives of our  students  and  students  in my  col leagues' districts can be changed for ever in a very positive way.

199,House,105,0.433,269,9,Mr. RILEY.," Mr. Speaker, our Tax  Code is a monstrosity. It is one that I  do not believe can be tinkered with or  reformed. It has become a Goliath that  has to be slain. It is 17,000 pages, 5 and a-half million words,  and  3  times  longer than our Bible. Our Tax Code is  too complicated and it is far too com plex. Even worse, it is unfair and coun terproductive.  Why? Because it penalizes the people  of this country for being married; it pe nalizes  them  for working,  for being  productive,  for saving. It even penal izes  the  people  of  this country  for  dying.  Mr. Speaker, this is insane. It is time  to scrap this code, and we have a bill  before us today that will do just that.  The Tax Code Termination Act will put  an end to one of the largest, most com plicated and detrimental  tax systems  in the world. This legislation will at  least force Congress into a serious and  open debate on the best way to replace  this old Tax Code.  Mr. Speaker, a vote against this bill  is a vote for the same tax policies we  have  suffered under  for  the  last 30  years. A vote for this bill is a vote for  finding a better, fairer, simpler way for  Americans to perform their civic duty.  In short,  this will be a vote  for  the  American people.  ",1998

Then we ought to have  the line-item veto around here so that  we can pray that the Supreme Court  will  turn it down. Then we ought  to  have the Balanced Budget Amendment  which we were able to accomplish with out disturbing the Constitution.  What is the latest gimmick? The lat est gimmick  is, how do we  tell  the  American people we are now sunsetting  the Tax Code when there is not any body here who believes  that 5 years  from now or 4 years from now that that  is going to occur.  This outrageous bill, which they pro pose and suggest would terminate our  current system, is nothing more than  another effort  to convince  the public  that  government  solutions  are  all  going to be easy. No body here defends  the current tax system or says that it  does not need some improvement. No body says that the IRS here is not in  ",1998
201,House,105,-0.181,282,9,Mr. BOYD.," Mr. Speaker,  I want  to  thank my friend  the gentleman from  New York  (Mr. RANGEL)  for allowing  me this time to talk about this motion.  First of all,  I want  to  say  to my  friend from Oklahoma (Mr. LARGENT)  that I believe that his intentions are  very good in trying to move this debate  forward,  in  trying  to develop  some thing that serves this country better. I  certainly do not question those inten tions.  I spent the last couple hours watch ing on  television,  though, as Member  after Member came to the podium; and,  basically,  it was a partisan shouting  match,  and  that  somewhat  dis appointed me that we carried it to that  level.  My colleagues, we live in the greatest  country in the world. Our economy is  clicking at  a  rate  that  it has not  clicked at for more than 50 years. Cer tainly, there is nothing perfect about  our Tax Code, and  I believe  that it  needs changing. But I  think we ought  to be very careful in the way that we  change that.  I agree that the Tax Code needs to be  reformed. There are some parts of the  Tax Code, however, which provide real  benefits to millions of taxpayers that  will be  thrown out if this bill  is en acted. Any business owner knows there  are many  important decisions which  are made, at least in part, because of  the  tax  treatment  those  investments  receive.  As a  former State  legislator,  I am  well aware of the important role mu nicipal and State bonds play in funding  new  schools,  roads,  and other  infra structure construction. This bill could  throw the bond market into chaos as  municipal bondholders and State and  local  governments who  offer  those  bonds will not know how the Tax Code  will treat their investments after the  year 2002.  Every day business owners make de cisions based on the tax treatment of  certain  investments. Hiring new em ployees,  purchasing  new  equipment,  those are decisions which are  influ enced by the Tax Code. Upsetting the  Tax Code could paralyze investment in  new  plants  and  equipment  because  business owners will be unwilling  to  hire new employees or build new manu facturing facilities because of the un certainty this bill would create.  Under the current Tax Code, employ ers who provide insurance benefits to  their employees receive 100 percent tax  deduction. This bill would scrap that  provision and cause many businesses to  eliminate health insurance benefits for  their employees.  Yesterday,  the National Association  of Manufacturers announced their opposition to this bill because it does not  allow businesses to plan for the future.  D 1500  Also, I heard earlier that the Cham ber of Commerce had taken a position  that they were going to score this in  opposition to this but there may have  been some calls from some very impor tant Members of this body who have  changed their mind.  I am unclear at  this point as we begin to take a vote on  it whether that will be done.  It is clear that the vast majority of  business owners realize sunsetting the  Tax Code is an irresponsible move that  will  jeopardize our country's remark able economic growth.  The motion to recommit before Mem bers now seeks to address the problems  in this bill and pushes the Committee  on Ways and Means to do something it  should have been doing  for months,  hold  comprehensive hearings  on  re forming the Tax Code. H.R. 3097 states  the obvious, that the current Tax Code  needs to be reformed. Unfortunately, it  leaves  the hard work of developing a  fair and understandable replacement to  a future Congress.  I urge my colleagues to support the  Rangel-Boyd-Tanner-S tenholm motion  to recommit and send this bill back to  the Committee on Ways and Means so  we can get a responsible piece of legis lation that addresses the needs of busi ness owners and taxpayers.

205,,105,0.16,334,9,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker, un fortunateiy  the  ironic phrase  ""no good deed  goes unpunished"" suits  the case of Russian  citizen Alexandr Nikitin. Most Russian officials  will be the first to admit that the collapsed So viet military-industrial complex  left behind a  deplorable environmental legacy which affects  not only the Russian Federation but also Rus sia's neighbors. The best known example  is  Chernobyl, but environmental specialists could  provide a much  longer  list of environmental  ""hot spots."" Regretlably, certain elements of  the Russian military and security service seem  determined to continue the Soviet practice of  hiding the truth about environmental depreda tion.  Mr. Speaker,  retired Russian naval officer  Alexandr Nikitin has been charged with  ""re vealing state secrets""-and if convicted, could  receive the death sentence-for his work with  the  Norwegian  environmental  organization  ""Bellona""  in exposing both  the Soviet and  Russian  Navy's  nuclear  waste  dumping  around the White Sea and Kola Peninsular in  northeast Russia. Nikitin and his supporters  claim  that all  the material he  secured  for  Bellona's report, ""The Russian Northern Fleet:  Sources of Radioactive Contamination,"" had  already been published in open sources.  Originally charged in February 1996, he was  held  in detention until December 1996, when  an  international outcry was raised  in his be half. Still the investigation continues to drag on  and on and on.  The problem, from the standpoint of the in vestigators and  the security services, is  that  the Russian Federation has a constitution with  provisions on  civil  liberties, which  some  in  Russia take seriously, and there are now law yers in Russia who actually know the law and  defend their clients. At first, the  investigators  threatened  to  indict Nikitin on secret unpub lished military instructions, but this was in con flict with Part 3, Art. 15 of the Constitution, ""no  regulatory  legal act affecting  the  rights,  lib erties or duties of the human being and citizen  may apply unless it has been published offi cially for general knowledge."" Now after six at tempted  indictments,  investigators have proEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  duced an  indictment that the claim will pass  constitutional muster.  The  prominent Ukrainian writer Nicholai  Gogol wrote a  fictional story about a  legal  case that dragged on for years in Tsarist Rus sia. Nikitin must identify with a character from  that story.  Through efforts of concerned human rights  and environmental activists, the  international  community has begun  to  focus atlention on  the Nikitin case. Amnesty International has de clared him as Russia's only political prisoner  since the fall of the Soviet Union. The Prime  Ministers of Norway and Canada have raised  Nikitin's  case  with  Prime  Minister  Chernomyrdin,  and  President Clinton  has  called  for  ""just deliberations""  in  the case. A  couple of weeks ago, former Soviet President  Gorbachev stated that ""there is nothing to [the  Nikitin case], but that ""democratic Russia still  can't let go of its affection for catching spies.""  Meanwhile, back on  the streets of St. Pe tersburg, Alexandr Nikitin has been  followed,  believe it or not, by a group of ""men in black.""  The tires on his car have been slashed, and  his door locks filed with glue. Recently, one of  his  lawyers was  accosted  by  unidentified  thugs and  told  to ""stay away from  this."" An other lawyer suggests, quite plausibly, that the  security services realize their case  is an em barrassment, and they want Nikitin to fear for  his  life and  that of his family so that he will  admit to the charges in exchange for amnesty.  Mr. Speaker,  I believe sincerely  that  the  American people and  the Congress wish  the  Russian people well, and we wish to work to gether in areas such as the environment that  will benefit both our peoples. But, the case of  Alexandr Nikitin  raises serious doubts about  the Russian military and security services  to  find a  reasonable balance between security  and the public interest.  I  recognize  that  the Russian Government  and  the people are working  toward civilian  control of the military and an established rule  of  law system. The  resolution of  the Nikitin  case will be a significant indicator of progress  in these areas.  HONORING VICKY MOLGARD  HON.

206,Senate,105,0.709,347,9,Mr. FAIRCLOTH.," Mr. President, the  McCain bill is dead, and I say good rid dance. It was nothing more than a mas sive  tax  increase on working Ameri cans to fund an expansion of the Fed eral government. However,  I  suspect  that we will revisit the tobacco issue,  and  I want  to ensure  that my  col leagues remain aware of a critical issue  to the people of my State. I'm talking  about thousands of tobacco farm fami lies. These are people who depend on  tobacco  farming  for  their  livelihood  and who share a long and proud herit age.  Mr. President, my farmers are hurt ing, and we're losing more and more of  them every year. The  tobacco quota  continues to drop, but not their credit  payments, so they're getting squeezed  to the limits. Some of them are well  past their limits and were  forced off  their farms.  I believe  that we will  face  the  to bacco issue again next year. Certainly,  whether or not we do a small and far  less expensive youth access bill with out a  tax increase at the end of this  year, we will return to the so-called to bacco settlement next year. If we  re turn to this bill next year-not in a po litically charged atmosphere  just five  months from Election Day-it will be  far easier to manage this process and  to come up with a reasonable bill that  addresses the needs of all parties. That  means farmers, and that is a critical  point, because they are the folks on the  front line and under fire in this war on  tobacco.  We need  to address  this  issue  in a  calm and reasonable atmosphere, not  this hysteria, and  I  look  forward  to  that debate. The men and women of the  tobacco family need some certainty. If  the Democrats want to continue their  war against  tobacco-and  I want  to  point out  that  just  two Democrats  voted  to kill  the McCain bill-! say  ""protect the farmers"" because they are  the innocent victims of this unfair as sault. This  is  indeed an unparalleled  assault on their crop.  The farmers need help-and a settle ment bill must  include  this help-in  order  to  restructure  their debt  to a  manageable  level. A  long-term pay ment  scheme will not  service  their  debt because  tobacco production will  continue  to drop. These farmers  fear  that the creditors will call the loans  and the fire sales that follow will de press land and equipment prices. They  can't sustain this assault by their own  government.  I want to be sure that the next gen eration of farmers have opportunities  to grow  tobacco, and  I will  fight  to  make sure that they have those tools,  because they are the future of our nation. They grow our food. In Sampson  County, North Carolina, where I  live,  you  see  the  slogan  ""Support  agri culture or  try used  food,""  and  that  sums it up. We cannot let our farmers  suffer. We will not let our farmers suf fer.  I look forward to this debate-! hope  it will be a reasonable one rather than  a  tax-and-spend bonanza-and  I  look  forward  to  the effort  to prepare our  farmers for the future.

209,Senate,105,-0.352,477,9,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President,  today I  want to call the Senate's attention to  Representative Edward LeLecheur and  his long history of service to the Com monwealth of Massachusetts. The citi zens of Massachusetts have benefitted  from his many years of service and leg islative  leadership.  Representative  LeLecheur has distinguished himself as  a community leader, an elected official  and a family man.  Edward LeLecheur started out as the  proprietor  of Stolphine's Market  in  Lowell, MA. This small grocery store is  located in the part of Lowell know as  the Sacred Heart, named for the nearby  Catholic church. Ed expanded his role  in the community by running for and  winning elected office  in 1975. Since  then, he has served the eighteenth Mid dlesex District for twenty-three years  in the same way he served Stolphine's  customers: one at a  time, with integ rity, dedication, and compassion.  Representative  LeLecheur's  giving  spirit has manifested itself in a variety  of ways. He  drives  physically  chal lenged people to the Registry of Motor  Vehicles,  and  purchases  turkeys  at  Thanksgiving  and  Christmas  time  which he  then delivers door-to-door.  Those same people, and countless oth ers, enjoy the baseball stadium which  Representative LeLecheur helped bring  to Lowell. Due  to Ed LeLecheur, our  national pastime is now part of the on going revitalization of Merrimac Val ley, bringing prosperity and entertain ment  to  families  from  all  the  sur rounding communities.  As a member of the Ways and Means  Committee for  the past  twelve years  and as the current chair of the Com mittee on Personnel and Administra tion,  Representative  LeLecheur  has  also extended his spirit and service be yond his district. The state has been  well served as a  result of his leader ship.  Representative LeLecheur has been  successful not only  as  a  state  rep resentative, but also as a family man.  He and his wife Eileen were married on  June 4, 1947, more than fifty years ago.  Together they raised six children and  are  today  the proud grandparents of  ten grandsons and granddaughters.  Mr. President, I would like to thank  him for his tireless devotion to his con stituents and neighbors. Representa tive LeLecheur is an inspiration to all  of us who work for positive change in  our communities. I wish him and Ei leen the very best as they embark on  this new chapter in life.   U.N. WORLD DAY TO COMBAT  DESERTIFICATION AND DROUGHT   ",1998
210,Senate,105,-0.308,477,9,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to mark  the United Nations  World Day to Combat Desertification  and Drought, which took place on June  17, 1998. This date is important because  it  is  the  fourth  anniversary of  the  United Nations General Assembly's  adoption of the Convention to Combat  Desertification  in Countries Experi encing  Serious  Drought  and/or  Desertification, Particularly in Africa.  The United States has signed this trea ty, but the Senate has yet to exercise  its advice and consent responsibilities  on this important convention.  The  World  Day  to  Combat  Desertification  and Drought  should  serve as a reminder to this body that  we should honor our constitutional re sponsibilities and act on this conven tion in a timely manner. As the rank ing member of the Subcommittee on  African Affairs, I have had the oppor tunity to see first-hand how valuable  the provisions of this convention will  be to the people of Africa. It is a mech anism by which  the people of Africa  will be assisted in preserving and pro tecting their land, which is a vital link  in Africa's fight  to become self-suffi cient.  This convention  is particularly im portant for Africa because more than  two-thirds of the land comprising that  continent is desert or dry land, and al most  three-quarters of  the dry  land  used for farming is in danger of becom ing unusable. The Sahelian droughts of  1971-73 and 1984-85 contributed to  the  deaths of thousands and spurred migra tion that put further stress on already  taxed land around Africa.  This  Convention  to  Combat  Desertification, which has already been  ratified by 120 countries, establishes a  framework  to promote  land and soil  health in developing countries, in order  to halt the kind of neglect that eventu ally leads to land that is unusable for  farming. This convention is innovative  because it requires participation from  all segments of  the population,  from  the farmers and herders who work the  land,  to  local governments and envi ronmental organizations, to those who  affect environmental and agricultural  policy at the national and regional lev els.  I hope  that the Senate will act on  this convention  in a  timely manner,  and that next year's anniversary of the  Convention to Combat Desertification  will  be marked by progress  in  the  world's efforts to protect the land and  soil  that sustains  life  in developing  countries.

212,House,105,-0.491,503,9,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the gentleman from Texas for yielding  and his hard work on this very, very  difficult issue.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express  some  concerns  about  the  resolution  that we will have before us soon, a res olution  to  establish  a  Select Com mittee on National Security and Other  Concerns with China before us today. It  is a troubling one to me.  The concerns presented here are seri ous and they are important. Congress  has not only the right but the responsi bility  to exercise oversight of policy  decisions.  Indeed,  the Committee on  National Security and the Committee  on Intelligence and the Committee on  International Relations are the appro priate venues for such oversight.  When there is a connection between  campaign contributions and policy decisions,  that  investigation  is  being  done by the Justice Department. Over  the years, I have been proud to work  very  closely  in a bipartisan  fashion  with my Republican colleagues on the  China  issue,  including the gentleman  from Virginia  (Mr. WOLF),  the gen tleman from New York (Mr. SOLOMON),  whom  I  respect very highly and will  miss very, very much when he is going  on  to happier  things. The gentleman  from California  (Mr. Cox), who will  chair this committee, is one of the fin est Members of this body. I respect his  intellect, his sense of fairness and ap propriateness  in dealing with  these  issues. It is not anything against him  that I have the question, but concerns  about the nature of this committee.  I have worked closely with the gen tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH)  and others who have consistently op posed  the current U.S.-China policy.  These people that I mention and others  on the Republican side have real stand ing in criticizing the consequences of  the policies.  As my colleagues know on both sides  of the aisle, I have pulled no punches in  criticizing  the President, whether he  was a Republican President or a Demo cratic President,  for what I  think  is  the wrong China policy. But as one who  has consistently  joined with some of  my Democratic  and Republican  col leagues in raising concerns about the  Chinese military  for many years on  this  floor,  I  see  today's action as a  move by the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr.  GINGRICH)  and  the Republican  leadership to exploit the China issue.  As I say, as one who has worked very  hard and long on this issue, I regret to  see that the Republican leadership has  just walked lock step with the Clinton  administration on China and,  as  re sponsible as President Clinton is and  his  administration  is,  on  the  con sequences of that China policy.  Allowing  U.S.  satellites  to  be  launched on foreign rockets is a policy  started under President Reagan, con tinued under President Bush and Presi dent Clinton. So if there is a criticism  of  the  consequences  of  that policy,  then the blame should be laid at the  feet of both parties in a bipartisan way.  Mr. Speaker, indeed, again this year  the Speaker could not move quickly  enough to support the President's re quest  for  a  special waiver  to grant  Most Favored Nation  status  to  the  People's Republic of China. He sent a  letter of support to  the President al most before the request for the special  waiver reached Capitol Hill.  I see this Select Committee as an at tempt by the Speaker to seek cover for  his affiliation with  the President on  the China policy. Do  they  think we  have no memory? Do they think we do  not know what we say on the floor year  in and year out by  the proliferation  and the Chinese mobilization and their  interest in acquiring U.S.  technology  and then all of a sudden the obvious,  predictable consequences of that pol icy, obvious and predictable to many of  us, is all of a sudden being investigated  by a Speaker who, day in day out, time  and  time again, and at every oppor tunity has  supported  ignoring  those  concerns?  And so, I see this as an attempt to  set up  this committee as venue hop ping. There have been investigations. I  can show my colleagues a stack of re ports on committees investigating this  issue.  As I say, I believe, and I do not deny  Congress's right to oversight, to inves tigate, and  to be  relentless  in doing  that in  terms of the consequences of  policy.  Establishing  this Select Committee  to me, after all the sweat and strain  and work that we have put in trying to  educate Congress to the dangers of the  policy that the Republican leadership  has supported year  in and year out,  looks to me like a cynical and hypo critical act which does a disservice to  the  debate  about U.S.-China  policy,  cost the taxpayers money, and wastes  Congress' time.  For that reason, I urge my colleagues  to defeat the previous question so that  the proposal of Mr. CONDIT can be con sidered to fairly fund and fairly con sider how we should go forward with  this.

As a  member of  the House Committee on  National Security, I cannot overstate  the significance of the mission we are  undertaking with the creation of this  Select Committee.  More than 1 year ago, the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. HENRY HYDE) and I  wrote to the Attorney General, asking  her to investigate the loosening of ex port controls on a host of sensitive  dual-use equipment and technology.  We asked the Attorney General to in vestigate the questionable decision to  allow McDonnell Douglas  to  sell  so phisticated machine tools to the PRO.  Just last week ""60 Minutes"" reported  that those machines have ended up in a  Chinese Silkworm missile plant.  The  Loral  incident  is what  has  brought us to this point today, and for  good  reason. According  to press  re ports, the Defense Technology Security  Administration  concluded  that,  ""United States national security has  been harmed.'' And an April 9th, 1996,  Air Force Intelligence report reached a  similar conclusion.  Clearly,  the questionable actions of  both Loral  and  the  administration  have serious implications for our na tional security. But so do the questions  surrounding transfers of sophisticated  machine  tools,  supercomputers,  hot  section  technology and  telecommuni cations technology.  The Select Committee we  are cre ating today faces a daunting but crit ical task. In a nutshell, it must answer  the question: Did  the United States  provide technology to China that will  benefit its military? And, if so, why did  this administration allow it to happen?  I urge my colleagues to vote ""yes""  on the resolution so that the American  people  can  find out  the answers  to  these questions.  Mr. Speaker, the letter to the Attor ney General referred to earlier is pro vided for the RECORD as follows:  Hon. JANET RENO,  U.S. Department of Justice,  Washington, DC.  MAY 22, 1997.  DEAR GENERAL RENO: We are writing tore quest that the Justice Department's  inves tigation of alleged illegal foreign campaign  contributions  to the Clinton campaign and  the Democratic National Committee include  an investigation of the possible link between  contributions from various Asian donors and  the Clinton Administration's loosening of ex port controls on  sensitive dual-use  equip ment and technology, which has specifically  benefited the military and intelligence serv ices of the People's Republic of China (PRC).  The PRC makes no secret of the fact that  it is attempting to acquire a diverse, highly  flexible, strategically dispersed and surviv able military production  capability, with  force projection a key goal. The administra tion's pattern of decontrol and failure to en force existing law with regard to both export  procedures and punitive sanctions has sub stantially benefited the military goals of the  People's Republic of China and presented se rious new challenges to the security inter ests of the United States.  In our minds, there are a number of cases  that raise serious questions about whether  improper outside  influence' was brought  to  bear on Administration officialsincluding  the President--and if that influence has re sulted in decisions and policies that have lib eralized the transfer of defense-related tech nologies, something which is clearly incom patible with the interest of our nation.  Examples of Questionable Decisions  Sales of sophisticated machine tools to the  PRC.-A U.S. company, McDonnell Douglas,  was allowed to ship an almost complete in tact missile and strategic bomber factory to  the PRO, despite strong opposition from spe cialists at the Department of Defense and  evidence that the equipment was going to be  diverted  to military production  facilities.  Prior to the issuance of the original export  licenses, the case was discussed with concern  at the highest levels of the government, yet  it was approved in the end.  News stories and a GAO report requested  by the House National Security Committee  (HNSC) all show that before the equipment  was shipped, U.S. officials were aware that  the conditions placed upon issuance of the  export licenses were unenforceable, and that  the Chinese possibly intended to divert the  equipment they had purchased for civilian  use to a military production facility.  During the period immediately before the  sale-and before the export licenses had been  approved-McDonnell  Douglas  officials  showed officials from CATIC (China National  Aero-Technology  Import-Export  Corpora tion)  through  the plant during operating  hours, allowing them to videotape classified  production lines in operation-a violation of  current export law, which was brought to the  attention of Administration officials and ig nored.  Finally, once it was determined that the  diversion had occurred, political appointees  at the Departments of Commerce and De fense approved new  licenses with different  end-use conditions and destinations rather  than expressing displeasure with the Chinese  or exercising their legal obligation to sanc tion the PRC.  While aspects of this case are now under  review by a grand jury in the District of Co lumbia, it is imperative that this matter re ceive full scrutiny in the context of the Jus tice Department's investigation of campaign  finance improprieties.  Supercomputers.-The extraordinary loos ening  of  controls  on militarily-sensitive  supercomputers, which began in 1994, has re sulted in the sale of 46 supercomputers rated  at 2,000 MTOPS and above to China in the  last 15 months. According to a former Under  Secretary of Defense who testified before the  HNSC  Procurement  Subcommittee,  these  sales may have given the PRO more super computing capacity than the entire Depart ment of Defense. Uses for supercomputers in clude: design and testing of nuclear weapons;  sophisticated weather forecasting; weapons  optimization studies crucial for the efficient  use  of  chemical  and  biological weapons;  aerospace design and  testing; creating and  breaking codes; miniaturizing nuclear weap ons, and finding objects on the ocean floor,  including submarines.  The decision  to  loosen U.S.  controls on  supercomputers was made in spite of the op position of a number of Defense Department  staff  experts,  senior military  and  intel ligence officials, and Members of Congress. It  was justified by a report commissioned and  paid  for by  the Department of Commerce  using outside consultants supplied by polit ical appointees at  the Department of De fense. The contract for the report was award ed noncompetitively to a well-known oppo nent of export controls. Viewed in the con text of recent revelations about Chinese ef forts  to  influence  the U.S. political scene,  the significant policy changes that have been  pursued in this area bring into question the  Administration's motives for decontrol.  Hot Section Technology.-The Administra tion's decision to change the jurisdiction on  so-called ""hot section"" technology from the  Department of State, which had guarded it  jealously, to the Department of Commerce,  which is in the business of making it easier  for foreign entities to purchase U.S. products  and technology also raises serious concerns.  Hot section  technology allows U.S.  fighter  and bomber aircraft to fly for thousands of  hours longer than those produced by less so phisticated manufacturers,  providing  our  military  forces with  significant cost and  readiness advantages over those of other na tions. Again, serious questions arise with re spect to policy changes in light of Chinese  efforts to influence Administration actions.  Telecommunications.-In  1994,  sophisti cated  telecommunications  technology was  transferred  to a U.S.-Chinese  joint venture  called Hua Mei, in which the Chinese partner  is an entity controlled by the Chinese mili tary. This particular transfer included fiber  optic communications equipment which  is  used for high-speed, secure communications  over  long distances. Also  included  in  the  package was advanced encryption software.  Both of these transfers have obvious and  significant military applications, and, again,  this transfer was accomplished despite oppo sition from technical experts at the NSA and  within the Pentagon.  The administration's actions in the above mentioned cases, and others, have resulted  in a significant increase in indigenous Chi nese military production capabilities. Given  China's willingness to sell weapons and tech nology  to  the  highest  bidder-including  rogue nations such as Iran, Iraq, and Libya these  transfers could  represent a profound  threat to U.S. military personnel. Moreover,  the  increased capabilities  that China has  gained portend a regional arms race and in crease the possibility of conflict in a region  ion which the United States has major inter ests.  Under  the circumstances,  if flies  in  the  face of common sense for us to provide the  ",1998

217,House,105,-0.552,581,9,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Chair man,  I move  to strike  the  requisite  number of words.  Mr. Chairman,  I want  to begin by  commending the gentleman from Mas sachusetts (Mr. MEEHAN) and the gen tleman from Connecticut (Mr. SHAYS)  for all of their work on this legislation.  They have spent many, many, many  months crafting this legislation to ad dress many of the underlying problems  that we have in our current campaign  to  financing system in this country; prob lems  that  threaten  this  institution,  that threaten many of our democratic  institutions;  problems  that are  cor roding the way we make decisions in  the House of Representatives,  in  the  United States Senate, and within the  administration.  They are problems that the American  people demand  that we  address and  that we rectify and that we once again  bring them back in to our democratic  decision-making process and not bring  them in based upon the size of their  wallet,  the size of their contributions  and who they know, but rather, on the  merit of their arguments. That is what  this, the People's House, is supposed to  be doing.  This  discussion  about  the  sever ability amendment is simply a ruse to  attack this legislation and to certainly  set it up for  later attack if it looks  like,  in fact,  it is going to pass. We  draw, very often, very complicated leg islation in this House. And we know,  very often, that we are treading to the  end, because people, in fact, are trying  to  affect court decisions when  they  draft  legislation,  when  they  draft  amendments. And to protect the under lying  legislation, very often we put  severability clauses in those pieces of  legislation.  We do it in the State legislatures, we  do it in city councils, and they do it in  the United States Congress,  and we  have for many, many, many years.  In  this particular  legislation,  the  gentleman  from Connecticut and  the  gentleman  from Massachusetts  have  addressed a  number of  the problems  that we confront in our campaign fi nance system. Each and every one of  those remedies could stand by  them selves, and they are very, very impor tant  to  improving our system. They  are very, very important to improving  the participation of the American pub lic in that legislation. That is why we  want  the severability clause, because  of those provisions by themselves.  So  if a  constitutional challenge  is  brought on one of these single provi sions, we will retain the best of this  legislation, and that will become part  of our campaign financing system, and  we will, in fact, have a better campaign  financing system than we have today.  We will have a  less corrupt campaign  financing system than we have today.  We will have a campaign finance sys tem that encourages people to partici pate, which our system does not do  today. That is why we need this sever ability.  To  throw  this up and suggest  that  somehow this is a  trick and this is to  allow us to do a lot of unconstitutional  things is just simply not the case. The  authors of this legislation are far more  careful about  their  legislative duties  than that. The people that they have  consulted have guided us and are rely ing on past court decisions.  Yes, we may not do it perfectly, but  we should not be in a position where  one challenge against a very small part  of  this  legislation can  throw out so  many other parts of  the  legislation  that are very, very, very important to  us.

Wyatt High School in Fort  Worth, Texas. These fine young men not only  won  the  University  Interscholastic  League  state championships, but  left all  their  fellow  competitors behind. Headlining  the  team  is  senior sprinter Demario Wesley, who was indi vidually honored by the Fort Worth Star Tele gram as the male track athlete of the year. Mr.  Wesley placed first in all three events he en tered. Just one year after trying to run on an  ankle with bone spurs, Wesley won  the 100  meter dash  in a time of 10.23 seconds, the  200 meter run  in a time of 20.74 as well as  anchoring the 4x100 meter relay. With Wesley  taking  the  leading position, Wyatt won  the  state  competition  by  a  26  point margin.  Wyatt's  most  impressive  accomplishment  came  in  the 4x1 00 meter relay victory when  Milton Wesley, Monte Clopton, Michael Frank lin and Demario Wesley broke  their own na tional record.  I would like to recognize the ex traordinary efforts of this exemplary team as  well as their coach Lee Williams whose hard  work has inspired his team  to victory. These  young men have not only set a standard for  future Wyatt boys  track  teams,  they have  proven  that next years stars are currently  in  our schools and  in our homes. Mr. Speaker,  let us  join  in congratulating O.D. Wyatt High  School on their accomplishments at the state  track championships.  Thursday, June 18, 1998  ",1998
221,,105,0.278,607,9,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to  introduce legislation to amend the  Indian  Employment, Training  and  Related  Services Demonstration Act of 1992. My legis lation will provide for the transfer of services  and personnel from  the Bureau of  Indian Af fairs  to the Office of Self-Governance and to  emphasize the need for job creation in Alaska  native communities and on  Indian  reserva tions.  Since its enactment in 1992, the ""477"" pro gram of the Indian Employment, Training and  Related Services Demonstration Act, has be come one of the few successful economic de velopment programs  in  Indian country. This  program was  implemented  to help  tribes ad dress severe problems  in employment and  poverty faced  in  their communities.  It allows  tribal  governments  to  consolidate  formula  funded employment, training and related pro grams into one streamlined, efficient program,  which enable  tribes  to  reduce administrative  time and costs, and increase services to their  members. Alaska tribes have informed me that  they have  reported great savings  in admin istering  employment and  training  programs  through consolidation of application and  re porting requirements.  On October 9, 1997, Senator CAMPBELL  in troduced S. 1279 and on this same date, Sen ator MURKOWSKI  introduced S.  1281, which  proposed amendments to the ""477"" program,  and  included Alaska-specific provisions. On  May 14, 1998, the Senate Committee on  In dian Affairs held a committee oversight hear ing  to discuss the provisions of the program.  S. 1279, as amended,  incorporates several  ",1998
222,House,105,0.484,620,9,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker, will we  ever learn from history?  Last year the liberal Democrats said,  ""We need to spend more money on edu cation because it will improve the edu cation of our children.'' And so Con gress voted to do so. The year before  that,  the message was  exactly  the  same: Spend more money. And Con gress did.  And the year before that, we heard  the  same  arguments:  Spend more  money, and children will do better in  school. And Congress did.  And the year before that, the liberals  were in full cry demanding that more  money be spent on education because  that will surely improve student per formance. And indeed Congress bowed  to those demands.  But some~ow we  have  still  failed  schools, and student performance is as  dismal as ever.  My question is to the other side: At  what point do  they conclude that the  problem in education is not a question  of money? Is the other side utterly in capable of thinking seriously about the  question, or will no amount of failure,  absolutely no amount of evidence, ever  have  the  slightest  impact  on  their  thinking?    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of any thinking time they may have.  UPTEACHERS  IN  CANNOT  EVEN MEN BEAM  ME  AMERICA  TION GOD?

223,House,105,0.464,620,9,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Speaker, it is  not very useful or helpful to debate an other man's motives. After all, how can  one possibly know the true motives in  another man's heart? But how else can  we explain  the President's opposition  to perhaps  the best single  thing  this  Congress has done  for  our Nation's  children this year in the area of edu cation?  Yesterday  the  President  indicated  that he plans to veto the Coverdell leg islation  that would  allow  parents,  guardians,  even  corporations  and  unions to set aside up to $2,000 per year  in tax-free savings accounts.  Think about  this: The President  is  opposed to education savings accounts.  This  is  something  that middle-class  parents have been calling for for years.  What could possibly explain the opposi tion of most of the Democrat Party to  this pro-education bill? Could  it be  that this party is utterly, totally, inex tricably  beholden  to  the  teachers'  unions,  special  interests  that  fight  every single reform that might threat en their power?  This is special-interest politics at its  worst, and our children are  the ones  who are being short-changed by it.  WHERE DO THE REPUBLICANS  STAND?

251,,105,-0.547,763,9,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr. Speaker, each year a new  group of children walks  into a school  for the  first  time. They are our  future  leaders,  the  hope of America. Students rely on the support  they get from parents, mentors, and teachers  as they prepare for their future. Harry lstok, at  Malow Junior High  in Shelby Township, Ml,  has developed an  innovative  technical pro gram called  Integration 2000. With  the help  and  support of businesses  throughout  the  Metro  Detroit  area,  Integration  2000  has  changed  the way we  look at  technical edu cation in Michigan.  Harry lstok is a veteran teacher. For twenty seven years, he has  taught drafting  to stu dents at Malow Junior High. But during  the  school year of 1995/1996, Harry took drafting  to a new level. By taking skills from art, draft ing, technology education, and general busi ness, Harry integrated the manufacturing side  to show students how their final product would  be produced. Students  in 7th, 8th, and 9th  grades have designed, engineered, manufac tured and marketed products such as key  chains and pen and pencil holders proudly  bearing  the Malow Mustang. Harry  lstok  is  preparing  students  for  life after  secondary  school. Harry has stated, ""the whole purpose  of education after the  Industrial Revolution is  to prepare students for the world of work. We  have to show the kids that there are viable al ternatives  to a four year college education.""  Integration 2000 provides students and busi ness with the opportunity to work together in  a hands-on educational environment.  Since  1995, Harry  has  enlisted  twenty seven area businesses to participate  in  Inte gration 2000. Each business donates time and  materials  to  the education of  the students.  Without their dedication and commitment Inte gration 2000 would not be possible. On March  8, 1998, Harry and his partners were honored  with  the Program Excellence Award at  the  60th International Technology Education Asso ciation in Fort Worth, Texas. The participating  businesses are: RCO Engineering, Northern  Metalcraft,  Joint  Production  Technologies,  Thunder Tool, Shoe Design, Entire Reproduc tions, Rhetech, Pinnacle Technologies, Proper  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Mold, Macomb Sheet Metal, P-Ess Sheet  Metal, Breed Technologies, Kinzer Collision,  International Hardcoat, Shelby Mold Inc., Mod ulated Metals  Inc., E & E Engineering, Ad vanced Machining Ltd., Mt. Clemens Steel  Inc., R.-J.'s E.D.M., OCT  Inc., Unique Fabri cating, Acra Grinding, 3-Dimensional Services,  Powder Cote  II,  lnterplas and Consumers  Lumber.  As a parent and congressman,  I am  im pressed so many young people will have the  opportunity  to experience  the world of high  tech manufacturing when  they are as young  as twelve years old. Harry  lstok's vision has  brought  together a unique partnership be tween Malow Junior High and businesses  in  southeastern Michigan.  Integration 2000 will  serve as an example for other schools to fol low.  I would like to thank Harry and all of his  twenty-seven partners  for  their  lasting con tribution to education in the United States.  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. EVA M. CLAYTON  OF NORTH CAROLINA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 19, 1998  ",1998
252,,105,-0.459,763,9,Mrs. CLAYTON.," Mr. Speaker, during roll call  vote numbers 245, 246, and 247, I was un avoidably detained.

MAX SANDUN  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 10, 1998  The House  in Committee of  the Whole  House on the State of the Uriion had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 3150)  to amend  title 11 of  the United States Code, and for  other purposes:  ",1998
253,,105,-0.25,763,9,Mr. SANDLIN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in  qualified support of this legislation to overhaul  our nation's bankruptcy laws. H.R. 3150 is an  imperfect bill  that addresses a very real and  pressing problem. I will vote for this bill to ad vance  it  through  this stage of the  legislative  process. However, if this bill does not improve  in conference negotiations with the other body,  I am prepared to vote against the conference  report.  Although the rate of personal bankruptcy fil ings in Texas in 1996 was well below the na tional average,  it  is still high at 8.4 bank ruptcies per 1000 households. Nationally, fil ings  increased 20% from 1996 to 1997, and  the economic cost of  these bankruptcies  is  passed on to all consumers, creating a hidden  tax of $400 on every household.  While there are multiple factors contributing  to this recent surge in bankruptcy filings, the  ease with which a debtor can file for Chapter  7 bankruptcy is surely one of them. There are  certainly scattered cases of debtors  running  up their debt and then  filing Chapter 7 bank ruptcy  to discharge  that debt when  they are  13133  capable of paying a substantial portion. The  bankruptcy system should not assist debtors  in evading debts they could otherwise pay. In stead, our nation's bankruptcy  laws should  offer a  fair and honest way  for  those over whelmed by financial pressures to pay off as  much of their debt as they can and begin a  fresh start.  This bill takes a good initial step at limiting  a debtor's ability to ""game the system"" or take  advantage of our bankruptcy code. However,  the bankruptcy code affects millions of working  Americans annually, and any changes to  the  code will  have  significant  ramifications  for  many of them. We must undertake any rewrite  of this code with extreme diligence and cau tion.  Amendments to this bill, both  in committee  and on the House floor, addressing child sup port  and  alimony  payments,  have  allayed  some of my fears. However, I still have signifi cant  lingering  concerns  that making  some  credit card debt nondischargeable places this  debt  in direct competition with child support  and alimony payments. Although child support  and alimony payments retain priority designa tion, credit card companies will generally have  a better ability to collect these debts than an  ex-spouse. Before this bill is enacted into law,  we must be absolutely certain that it will not  benefit credit card companies at the expense  of women and children who rely on these pay ments for their survival.  This bill, as  reported by  the House Com mittee on Judiciary, would have preempted  provisions in the Texas Constitution which pro tect a debtor's homestead  from seizure. The  bill would have capped the homestead exemp tion at $100,000, while Texas  law has no  monetary limit on the homestead exemption. I  was adamantly opposed to this provision, and  was pleased  that  it was eliminated  from  the  bill on  the House floor. However, I still have  concerns that this bill would  intrude on state  law by prohibiting a debtor from exempting as sets  transferred  into one's homestead within  one year of filing for bankruptcy. I hope to see  this provision eliminated from the bill in nego tiations with Senate.  I will vote  for this bill now, but  I urge  the  conference committee  to address  these very  significant issues before this legislation returns  to the House for final passage.  If women and  children are not adequately protected  in  this  rewrite of  the bankruptcy code,  I will  vote  against the conference report.

257,House,105,-0.451,893,9,Mr. SCOTT.,"  There was no objection.  -MILITARY CONSTRUCTION  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  NETHERCUTT). Pursuant to House Reso lution 477 and rule XXIII, the Chair de clares the House in the Committee of  the Whole House on the State of the  Union for the consideration of the bill,  H.R. 4059.  0 1621  IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  Accordingly,  the  House  resolved  itself into the Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union for the  consideration of  the bill  (H.R.  4059)  making  appropriations  for military  construction, family housing, and base  realignment and closure  for  the De partment of Defense for the fiscal year  ending September  30,  1999,  and  for  other purposes, with Mr. PEASE in the  chair.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from California (Mr. PACKARD).  ",1998

259,House,105,-0.455,919,9,Mr. FAZIO of California.," Mr. Chair man,  I  yield 2 minutes  to  the gen tleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTSCH).  ",1998
260,House,105,-0.324,919,9,Mr. DEUTSCH.," Mr. Chairman, I  join  all of my colleagues in congratulating  and really saying thanks to the chair man and the ranking member who have  done more  for  this country,  really,  than few other Members.  To  the gentleman  from California  (Mr. FAZIO), personally,  if I have had  literally one key mentor in Congress,  it has been him.  I would join many of my colleagues  today to say that as good as this bill is,  our hope from a Florida perspective is  that the legislation could have gone a  little bit  further  towards  the Presi dent's  request in terms of Everglades  restoration projects.  I am planning on introducing for the  record an Army Corps of Engineers  analysis which  talks about  the  spe cifics of programs, if this is the ul ti mate budget, that will not be funded.  Congress has made an incredible com mitment in  the 6 years  I have been  here towards this.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  record the following:  include  for  the  Fiscal year  1998  project allocations  Fiscal year  1999  Budget request  Senate  markup  House  markup  C&SF ......  Kissimmee  Critical projects  .......  $21,833  2,817  4,009  $40,800  27,300  20,000  $25,000  10,000  10,000  $20,900  3,500  3,000  CENTRAL & SOUTHERN FLORIDA  All assumptions are made with the under standing that funding will only be delayed  for one year and required funding will be  available in the following year.  If Senate Budget is Adopted ($25,000,000 al location):  West Palm Beach (C-51): Delay in funding  for relocations may not impact the overall  project schedule. Delay in funding S-360, G312, and levees (components of Stormwater  Treatment Area 1 East) would not signifi cantly impact the project. The project would  likely still be completed within the overall  completion schedule.  South Dade (C-111): Delay in funding for S332A, B, and C pumping plants, and Levees  and the Canal work will not significantly im pact the overall project completion. Recent  requirements  for  a  new GRR  supplement  have caused this delay to be necessary re gardless of funding.  Upper St. Johns: Delays in funding L74N  and 8-96E will increase  the overall project  completion time.  If House Budget is Adopted ($20,900,000 allo cation):  West Palm Beach (C-51): Delay in funding  for relocations may not impact the overall  project schedule. Delay in funding S-360, G312, and levees (components of Stormwater  Treatment Area 1 East) would not signifi cantly impact the project. However, the ad ditional  cuts would  delay  completion  of  pump Station S-362 (Stormwater Treatment  Area 1 East outflow pump station) which  would delay the overall project completion.  The time could not be made up regardless of  the follow-on funding.  Comprehensive Restudy: The  additional  cuts will adversely impact work on the Re study. A delay in funding will result in com pletion beyond  the mandatory completion  dates.  South Dade (C-111): Delay in funding for S332A, B, and C pumping plants, and Levees  and Canal work will not significantly impact  the overall project completion. Recent re quirements for a new GRR supplement have  caused this delay to be necessary regardless  of funding.  Upper St. Johns: Delays in funding L74N  and S-96E will increase  the overall project  completion time.  KISSIMMEE RIVER RESTORATION  If Senate Budget is Adopted ($10,000,000 al location):  Contract  3(S-65 Modification),  CNT  4C  (local levee removal), and Contract 2 (Canal  widening for C-35 & 36) can be completed.  Contract 14A (to remove 1M CY of mate rial) can be completed. Contract 14B (to re move 5M CY of material) will not be awarded  in FY 99. The entire 6M CY of material of  Contract 14A & B must be removed before  any work in the lower basin is initiated.  Majority of the environmental restoration  benefits are claimed in the lower basin. How ever, if the request is reduced to 10 million,  the  initial environmental component Con tract 7 (Reach 1 Backfill of canal C-38) will  definitely not be awarded in FY 99. A prior  commitment was made to initiate Reach 1  Backfill by 30 March 1999. This commitment  will not be met. The remaining three reaches  will also be delayed, and the corresponding  environmental benefits will not be obtained.  Engineering efforts in preparing P&S for fu ture contracts will be downscaled because of  limited funds and no A-E contract awards in  1999.  To  implement  the Reach 1 backfill con tract,  flood  control  features of Istokpoga  basin (Contract 6, a  large tributary within  Reach 1) will need  to be addressed. If the  Istokpoga works is delayed, the Corps will go  to condemnation, tie-up resources, cause ad ditional delays, and Reach 1 Backfill cannot  be initiated.  The balance of FY 1999 will be used to pre pare P&S which will be shelved until funds  become available.  If House Budget is Adopted ($3,500,000 allo cation):  In addition to the above, Contract 14A (to  remove  1M CY  of material) will not be  awarded in FY98. As noted above, all of Con tract 14 needs to be completed before imple mentation of the lower basin works. None of  the primary restoration benefits will be ob tained in FY 99.  CRITICAL PROJECTS  If Senate Budget is Adopted ($10,000,000 al location):  With a funding level of 10 million, NEPA,  and design development could not be initi ated on 4 projects for which letter reports  have been developed; Seminole Tribe Big Cy press,  Loxahatchee  Slough,  L-31E  and  Melalueca Quarantine Facility. In addition,  the South Dade County Agriculture  and  Rural Area Retention and South Biscayne  Bay Watershed Management Plan  studies  could not be  initiated. Since WRDA 96  re quires that the Critical Projects be initiated  by  30  September 1999,  all projects  listed  above could not be implemented under this  authority.  If House Budget is Adopted ($3,000,000 allo cation):  With a funding level of 3 million, NEPA,  and design development will not be initiated  on 9 projects for which letter reports have  been  developed:  Golden  Gate  Estates,  Tamiami Trail Culverts, Lake Okeechobee  Water Retention!Phosphous Removal, Ten  Mile Creek, Lake Trafford, Southern Crew,  Seminole Tribe Big Cypress, Loxahatchee  Slough, L--31E,  and Melalueca Quarantine  Facility. In addition, the South Dade County  Agriculture and Rural Area Retention and  South Biscayne Bay Watershed Management  Plan studies could not be  initiated. Since  WRDA 96 requires that the Critical Projects  be  initiated  by  30  September  1999,  all  projects  listed above  could not be  imple mented under this authority.  Mr. Chairman,  I  yield  to  the gen tleman from Florida (Mr. SHAW).  ",1998
261,House,105,0.3,919,9,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank  the gentleman for yielding to me.  I would  like  to  join with him  in  thanking the committee for what they  have put in this particular bill with the  shore  protection,  as  the  gentleman  from New Jersey just was speaking to,  but most particularly I think to really  impress upon the committee that it is  most  important on  these Everglades  projects to move at least substantially  towards the Senate markup document  at this time, knowing that there is not  going to be enough money to get back  to the President's budget.  But  these  are  very  important  projects. The Kissimmee River going  back  to  the natural  flow  into Lake  Okeechobee and  then  south  through  the Sharks Slough to the Florida Bay,  this is tremendously important to the  Everglades and should be of utmost im portance  to  this committee and  this  Congress.  I would also like to point out that  one of the facilities that would be lost  if we do not at least go  towards  the  Senate would be the Melalueca Quar antine Facility, which is tremendously  important.  ",1998
262,House,105,-0.547,945,9,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  joined tonight by my colleagues,  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. DAVIS)  who just spoke, the chief deputy whip  of our party,  the gentlewoman  from  Connecticut  (Ms. DELAURO),  the gen tlewoman  from California  (Ms. BAR BARA LEE), and the gentlewoman from  California  (Ms.  LYNN WOOLSEY),  as  well.  We are here this evening, Mr. Speak er, to talk about unions. We say that  word with  pride. Earlier  this year,  many of us heard powerful, real life ex perience  stories  by  Betty  Dumas,  Cathy  Sharp,  and  Juan Mazylmian  about the challenges they faced when  they tried to organize their workplace;  a basic right,  to organize your work place for wages, for benefits.  For Juan, he and his fellow asbestos  removal workers  in New York won  union recognition and a shot at a bet ter life. For Cathy Sharp, she struggled  in a hospital system where she worked  in San Diego and she won union rec ognition,  and  a  contract  that gives  nurses more  input  into  the  care of  their patients.  For Betty Dumas  and her  fellow  workers at the Avondale shipyard in  New Orleans, their fight goes on. It is a  brave fight, but their resolve remains  stronger than ever. They will win that  fight, because they are standing up for  folks who they work beside every day  who are deprived of decent wages and  decent benefits and  the  things  that  many of us take for granted today at  the workplace.  These three individuals touched us in  a very special, fundamental way when  they spoke to us at our conference in  Virginia. We  understood  their  fights  were for basic human respect and for  basic human dignity.  This week, and particularly on  the  24th of June this week, many of us are  lending our voices and our support to  working men and women around  the  country. We will be speaking out about  their efforts  to  improve  their future.  On the 24th, a day to make our voices  heard, workers will be showcasing their  ambitions and their visions and their  successes, and yes, even  their heart aches, in their effort to come together  to form a union.  It is not easy to do. I will talk about  that in a second. There are activities  planned  in  over  70  communities  to  highlight workers' basic, fundamental  rights  to organize. From Seattle  to  Miami  and  from Burlington  to San  Diego there will be activities to cele brate past victories, and to remind us  of the work that is yet to be done.  Some will say, how difficult is it to  join a union? To give you some idea of  how hard it is for workers to join to gether to form a union, let me try to  offer an analogy.  Imagine waking up  the morning after the November elec tion and reading the headlines: Chal lengers win;  challenger wins.  Incum bent  files objection  to  the way  the  election was conducted. The court will  issue a decision within 2 to 5 years. In cumbent  to hold office pending out come of litigation. End of headline.  This sounds absurd and profoundly  undemocratic, but that is what is hap pening. That is what is happening to  workers in our country whenever they  win an NLRB election. That is the Na tional Labor Relations Board's  elec tion.  Just winning takes tremendous cour age and resolve. Employers and their  sophisticated  anti-union  consultants  commonly launch campaigns of terror  and fear against workers who  try  to  form a union. Once a worker steps onto  their employer's property,  their basic  human rights of free speech and free dom of assembly and free press,  they  get left at the curbside.  Workers  face  union-busting  tactics  such as threats of being fired or taking  away their health insurance; or being  forced  to attend a  compulsory anti union meeting, either in large groups  or in one-on-one shakedown sessions;  or threats of moving the plant to Mex ico or other countries.  There is in this country, and I am sad  to report this, but there is in the coun try today a multi-million dollar indus try that is established just to quash or ganizing drives  in America. Against  these odds, workers need all  the help  they can get.  That  is why more and more orga nizing drives have become community  campaigns. Religious and community  leaders  are  speaking out more  and  more to improve the quality of life of  their families and friends and neigh bors. There is greater recognition that  these drives are part of a larger cause,  the  fight  for human  rights and  for  basic jUstice.  Organizing not  only  improves  the  lives of individual workers, but also  the  entire  community. When  those  wages go up because workers can come  together and band  together and bar gain  for  a  good  contract  and good  wages,  that money  gets  circulated  throughout the community and every one benefits. It does not stay in a few  pockets.  Organized workers get contracts and  salaries which  set  the  standard  for  other workers in the community who  may not be unionized, so they bring up  everybody's  wages,  not  just  union  workers.  There  is a  huge wage gap  in  this  country today. I think everybody real izes that that gap is growing, and it is  as wide as it has been in decades. It is  wider  than any other western demo cratic  society,  capitalist  society,  today. Today  the struggle  to  reduce  the ever-expanding wage gap between  the top 20 percent and the rest of us is  an important struggle, and it will be  the struggle that will be waged over  the next decade.  The only way  to restore some sem blance  of  economic  justice  to  this  country  is  if  the  labor movement  grows. When the labor movement grew  after the Second World War, the pie for  America was shared by all. When pro ductivity grew 90 percent, wages grew  90 percent during the 1950s. But during  the 1960s and the 1970s and 80s and 90s,  we saw that productivity continue  to  grow but  the wage  level for workers  continued to decline. It declined sig nificantly. That is why we have  this  huge wage gap.  One of the reasons it declined is be cause membership in unions across the  country, which was at a high of about  40 percent in the 1950s, has slipped to  about 15 percent  today, and about 10  percent among the private sector.  The workers' struggle for union rep resentation  and  free  association  is  deeply  interlinked with overall  eco nomic disparity and participation  in  our democracy.  In order  to win, we  need to build an alliance between union  members, churches, progressive organi zations, and public officials who care  about workers.  If we can do that, if we can shed some  light on union-busting activities going  on in the workplace, we can win this  battle. Winning  takes a good deal of  teamwork. Members of Congress I be lieve have  a  responsibility  to  speak  out.  That is why about a week ago, at my  alma mater, the University of Iowa, I  was saddened to see that the univer sity's hospital system is fighting  the  ",1998
263,,105,-0.303,958,9,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to  pay  tribute  to my  colleague and  close  friend,  State  Representative  Robert  E.  Belfanti, Jr. Bob will be honored by the Sus quehanna Valley Boy Scouts Council at  the  Council's July 7 American Distinguished Cit izen Dinner.  I am pleased and proud  to be  able to participate in this prestigious event.  Mr. Speaker, Bob Belfanti  represents parts  of my congressional district in Northumberland  County, Montour County, and Columbia Coun ty. I have been proud to work with him on nu merous occasions since  I was first elected in  1984. I consider him a close personal friend.  Born  in 1948 to Robert and Rose Belfanti,  Bob attended local schools in Mount Carmel,  Pennsylvania, in what is part of the District he  now  represents. He was active  in Scouting  and became an Eagle Scout in 1961. He grad uated high school in 1966 and enlisted in the  United States Marine Corps the following July.  Bob served in Vietnam and was decorated six  times. Following his  tour of duty in Vietnam,  Bob attended the University of North Carolina  on a special lnservice Program. In 1971, Bob  received  an  honorable discharge  from  the  Corps but remained active in a Reserve unit  for another two years.  In 1972, Bob began electrician school and  graduated as a journeyman in 1975. He oper ated his own contracting company prior to his  election to the Pennsylvania General Assem bly in 1980.  Active  in  numerous  local  organizations,  Representative Belfanti  is a member of  the  AmVets, N.E.

June 22, 1998  HONORING NEAL BROXMEYER  HON. GARY L. ACKERMAN  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 22, 1998  ",1998
264,,105,-0.429,958,9,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to share with my colleagues in  the House of  Representatives the story of a man whose life,  which ended all too soon  in 1996 at age 43,  was dedicated to the pursuit of truth.  Neal Howard Broxmeyer searched for truth  with a great intensity. He was long immersed  in spiritual work which brought  tremendous  peace. A beloved and respected leader of the  School of Practical Philosophy, he played a  major role in establishing its Abraham Lincoln  School  for Boys and Girls on  the upper east  side in Manhattan. His 9-year-old son is a stu dent there, and is very proud of the role his  Dad played. Indeed, it was one of Neal's pre cious dreams  to see  the school  flourish and  grow.  Neal's devotion to his family was exemplary.  He naturally  included within his  family  the  many people whose lives intersected with his.  In that sense, Neal's family included his asso ciates and colleagues at Fairfield Properties,  where he was a partner. His brothers have  said  that he was an excellent businessman,  known  for his honesty and his  integrity. He  was seen as the ""heart and soul"" of his busi ness, and he was referred to as the ""light of  the office.""  Neal Broxmeyer was a man who always  looked beyond his own needs. He led his life  in keeping with  the maxim: Set no  limits  in  service, and  encouraged others  to do  the  same. He was always available to others. He  cherished  the community  in which he  lived  and was very happy to be part of the commu nity association. He led the way in establishing  the security patrol  in  the community, and al ways said ""How could I not take it on?""  Neal was a simple man who was extraor dinary. Always  there, steady and balanced;  never looking  for faults in others, but instead  finding the goodness in everyone. Everything  and everyone who benefited  from his atten tion, concern,  insight, wisdom, counsel, and  warmth understands that there was ""absence  of claim."" Although not rigid, Neal was highly  disciplined. His  life,  though very short, was  filled with a quality beyond most. Nothing, it  seems, was wasted.  Neal is survived by his loving family: His be loved wife Susan; their children, Dara, Jen nifer, and David; by his parents, Muriel and  Joseph; and by his brothers Mark and Gary.  June 23, 1998 will mark the inauguration of  the Neal Broxmeyer Scholarship Fund. This  fund will help to keep alive the memory and vi sion of this extraordinary man. Mr. Speaker, it  is my privilege and distinct honor to bring the  brief life of Neal Howard Broxmeyer to the at tention of my colleagues and hope  they will  join me  in paying  tribute  to an outstanding  human being.

265,Senate,105,0.419,997,9,Mr. HUTCHINSON.," Mr. President,  I  thank the majority leader for the opportunity  to work with him on  this  issue. I believe the China amendments  I have offered have g:reat value. The de bate has been healthy, and the debate  has been necessary. I, frankly, am will ing  to  stand  here  and  talk  about  human rights in China in general this  week and next week, or as long as it  takes. My great objective  is  to  see  these provisions become the public pol icy of this land.  In my opinion, the opponents of these  amendments do not have a substantive  leg to stand on. The only reason they  have  brought  up  to  oppose  these  amendments involves the timing of the  offering of these amendments. I remind  my colleagues, once again,  that I of fered these and filed these amendments  over a month ago. They have sought to  obfuscate the issues, obscure the moti vations, and place obstacles in the path  of clean and  substantive votes. The  hollowness of the administration's pol icy is evident in their unwillingness to  embrace  these  very modest  human  rights amendments.  Mr. President, if I might say again,  the hollowness of the administration's  China policy is evident in their unwill ingness to embrace even those modest  human  rights  amendments,  and  the  length  to which  they have gone  to  block them from a vote on their mer its, I think, speaks to the weakness of  the policy. The policy has failed. The  lack of outrage by this administration  over the news today that China denied  visa approval for Radio Free Asia re porters, I  think, gives powerful testi mony to the kind of acquiescence and  concessionary spirit that characterizes  this administration's policies. It is all  too typical.  These issues will not go away, I as sure you. Slave labor conditions, forced  abortions,  forced  sterilizations,  reli gious persecution, and proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction are real  issues. They are not fiction or partisan  weapons;  they are not used for some  kind  of political  brownie  points  or  ""got-you"" points. These are real issues  that need to be debated, and we need to  change our foreign policy in relation to  these abuses that are ongoing in China.  If history teaches us anything, his tory  teaches  us  that  appeasement  never works. The fact that this admin istration has refused even to offer the  annual resolution at the U.N. conven tion  in Geneva on human  rights,  I  think,  is  indicative  that  even  the  smallest stands for human rights have  gone by the wayside. I think it was Ed mund Burke who said, ""All that is nec essary for evil to triumph is for good  men to do nothing.""  What the Senate has done today on  China policy is nothing. The fact that  these bills passed overwhelmingly  in  the House of Representatives, the fact  that this body voted not to table them  by  80-plus  votes,  indicates  there  is  strength in their appeal. I want to ex press my appreciation to the majority  ",1998

267,Senate,105,-0.205,1049,9,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President,  I  rise to honor one of America's earliest  diplomats and a distinguished native of  Connecticut, Joel Barlow. On June 28,  in a modest ceremony, a bronze bio graphical  tablet will be dedicated  to  Barlow in the churchyard of the tiny  village  of Zarnowiec, Poland, where  Barlow died and was  laid  to rest  in  1812. The event  is organized and  the  tablet donated by the Joel Barlow Me morial Fund, in cooperation with the  American Center of Polish Culture and  DACOR, Diplomatic and Consular Offi cers Retired (of the U.S. State Depart ment).  Joel Barlow was born  in 1754  and  raised in Redding, Connecticut. His an cestors were among  the earliest set tlers of  the  region. After graduating  from Yale University in 1778, he took  an  additional Divinity  course  and  joined George Washington's army as a  chaplain, serving for three years until  the end of the Revolution. He slipped  home  from  his  army  duties  long  enough to marry Ruth Baldwin, the sis ter of a Yale classmate. They married  in secret because of her father's initial  objection.  At the close of the war in 1782,  the  couple moved to Hartford, where Bar low  helped  publish  the  magazine  ""American Mercury,"" writing political  pamphlets, satires, and poetry. He was  one of a  group of satirical writers,  mostly Yale men, known as the ""Hart ford Wits."" At that time, he also com pleted and published the first version  of his American verse epic, ""The Vision  of Columbus."" It is said that in this  work, he was the first writer in English  to use the words ""civil,"" ""civic,"" and  ""civilization"" in their modern senses.  He  also  envisioned  a  future  inter national council very much  like  to day's United Nations,  dedicated  to  peacekeeping, cultural exchange, and  development of the arts.  In 1786, Barlow studied law and was  admitted to the Bar. He worked as a  ",1998
268,House,105,0.552,1062,9,Mr. GUTKNECHT.," Mr. Speaker, an  important measure was recently passed  by this House that begins to liberate  American  families. Those of us who  talk about values like faith, family and  personal  responsibility must  pursue  policies that reinforce those values.  Allowing families  to save for  their  children's education through education  savings accounts  is one  such policy.  Fourteen million American kids will  benefit from this program. Our friends  on  the  left say  that  they know best  how education dollars should be spent.  We say parents do. This is one more  chapter in the ongoing debate.  Mr.  Speaker, we want  to  return  power  and  resources  from  the  bureaucratized  Federal  Government  back to American families. The good  news is American families are winning.  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",1998
269,House,105,0.435,1062,9,Mr. SOUDER.," Mr. Speaker, I move to  suspend  the  rules and pass  the bill  (H.R. 3853) to promote drug-free work place programs, as amended.

271,House,105,-0.459,1075,9,Mrs. CLAYTON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentlewoman for yielding me  this time.  Mr. Chairman, I also want to rise in  support of this bill and to commend the  gentleman  from New Mexico  (Chair man SKEEN) and the ranking member,  the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAP TUR)  for  the very fine, persistent and  diligent work they have done to bring  this bill to the floor.  This is a .comprehensive bill. It af fects a wide range of constituents, so  there are different sectors of our com munities who are concerned about its  success or its failure.  0 1215  I want to tell the Members, this bill  does bring some unique opportunities.  It is an opportunity to right a wrong.  In the self-executing rule that was just  passed was a provision of opportunity,  removing a stumbling block that thou sands of minority black farmers have  had in not being able to have their case  adjudicated before the courts or admin istrative remedies. So I want to thank  both sides of the aisle, but particularly  the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr.  SKEEN) and the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Ms. MARCY KAPTUR) and  the  leader ship for bringing this to the floor.  It also has the opportunity to make  sure we do not use food as a sanction in  the cases of India and Pakistan. I think  those  are  obviously  commendable  areas.  I also want to raise the issue of pro viding new opportunities for inspection  of food and quality of food, new  re sources  for  conservation  and  clean  water. Many of our farm areas are im pacted and need this additional assist ance to make sure they have a contin uous opportunity for providing  those  resources  to keep  their environment  clean.  However,  there  are  some  short comings to this bill. We just signed the  bill on  research over at  the White  House a few minutes ago, and this bill,  by this act, will now zero out what we  have just said. I  think that is a mis take. It removes the infrastructure for  water and sewer and some of the hous ing  initiatives  that rural areas had.  Also, we reduce, in my judgment below  the need to do it, both the WIC and nu tritional program and the emergency  food program. I hope at least we have  an opportunity to look at the amend ment.  All in all, this is a good bill. It is a  bill that not only does a fair appropria tion of our scarce resources for a wide  range, but we have an opportunity to  right a wrong. Righting that wrong is  to  afford  all Americans  the  oppor tunity  to use our resources for agri culture and growing. The black farmers  who have been denied that opportunity  want  to  say,  through me,  they cer tainly appreciate  this opportunity  to  have that remedy in court.  ",1998

273,House,105,0.396,1075,9,Mr. SMITH of Oregon.," Mr. Chairman,  I thank the gentleman for yielding me  the time.  Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 4101, the agriculture appropriation  bill.  I wanted  to,  indeed,  thank  the  gentleman  from New Mexico  (Chair man SKEEN) and the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for bringing up this  very important legislation. I wanted to  commend both of them and their staffs  for their hard work in achieving bal ance with limited resources.  I want to particularly commend the  gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr.  NETHERCUTT)  for  his  hard work  to  eliminate  an  immediate  threat  to  America's  farmers.  The Nethercutt  amendment included in the bill fixes a  problem that was created by, I think,  an  erroneous  interpretation  of  the  Arms Export Control Act.  The Nethercutt amendment clarifies  that USDA credit, credit guarantees,  or other financial assistance  for  the  purchase or provision of food or agri cultural commodities are not included  in the sanctions provided for in section  102 of the Arms Export Control Act.  Mr. Chairman,  this bill, as reported  by the Committee on Rules, also deals  with an  issue  that has directly con cerned me and other members of the  Committee on Agriculture for the past  2 years, providing access  to  judicial  and administrative  remedies  to hun dreds of black farmers who have been  the victims of racial discrimination in  the operation of the Department of Ag riculture programs.  Because of a  statutory  limitation,  these  farmers have been barred from  seeking appropriate relief. An amend ment worked out by the Committee on  the Judiciary and other interested par ties, and that is contained in this bill,  would  allow persons who  have  filed  complaints of racial or other discrimi nation to seek redress in the Federal  court system.  Mr.  Chairman, Congress  passed  a  monumental reform to our Nation's ag ricultural policy in 1996. At that time  we  eliminated depression-era produc tion controls and subsidies. Congress  promised American  farmers  that we  would replace these outdated programs  with a new emphasis on research, on  risk management, and regulatory re form. Three weeks ago Congress passed  the Agricultural Research, Extension,  and Education Reform Act of 1998  in  which we  voted  overwhelmingly  to  shift spending from bureaucracy to the  cutting edge of research.  Just a  short  term ago,  today,  the  President signed that bill into law. Due  to  tremendous  resource  constraints  and  competing  priorities,  the Com mittee on Appropriations was forced to  offset  the cost for existing programs  and other new  initiatives by  elimi nating this new and vital research pro gram.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to strong ly encourage my friend and colleague,  the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr.  SKEEN)  to work with his counterparts  in the Senate to reprioritize programs  so  they can restore  these  important  funds. I understand that this will be a  difficult challenge, but it is essential  that this program be funded.  Mr. Chairman, I would ask to enter  into a  colloquy with  the gentleman  from New Mexico, ",1998

275,House,105,-0.491,1088,9,Mr. SERRANO.," Mr.  Chairman,  move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman,  first of all,  I would  like  to offer my  thanks both  to  the  gentleman  from  New Mexico  (Mr.  SKEEN), chairman of the subcommittee,  and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  KAPTUR),  ranking member, as well as  the  leadership of the committee,  the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. LIVING STON)  and  the gentleman  from Wis consin (Mr. OBEY) on the work that has  been done on this bill.  These days it is not easy to put a bill  like this together with all of the cuts  that we are facing in this Congress and  throughout our government. So when,  in fact, we set out to try to help the  very people who  need help,  and we  move  on  the  road  to accomplishing  that, it is something that we have to  be commended for.  While it is a difficult bill to put to gether, I  think  the final  result, with  yet some minor changes, may, in fact,  address the needs of so many people in  this country.  Most  importantly,  I would  like  to  thank the leadership on both sides for  accepting into the rule an amendment  that I worked on for many months this  year  and which many  people were  working on which would deal with the  issue of African American and minor ity farmers.  This action was necessary because  the  Justice Department  had  deter mined that the statute of limitations  prevents  the USDA  from  providing  compensatory damages  to  individuals  who  allege  discrimination  in USDA  programs if those  individuals did not  file  a  complaint  in Federal district  court within 2 years of the alleged dis crimination, even if they had filed a  complaint  in USDA's administrative  process.  In fact, a Civil Rights Action Team  report,  issued in February, 1997, con cluded that USDA had not been effec tively resolving civil rights complaints  from 1993 to 1996. Since then, USDA has  new civil rights  leadership and, with  the help of Congress, has rebuilt  the  civil  rights  investigatory and settle ment infrastructure.  USDA now has  in place a  process  where each case is investigated, com pensation claims are subjected to inde pendent economic analysis, and offi cials from the office of civil rights and  the office of the new associate general  counsel  for civil rights  issue written  findings of investigations and prepare  and review settlements.  But without addressing the issue that  is addressed in this bill, USDA would  not be able to effectively resolve discrimination complaints filed against it  by a group of farmers who deserve our  attention. So it is important to under stand what we have accomplished here  today.  I think it is also most important to  understand that it was done on a bipar tisan  fashion. We  have  for  so many  years wanted very much to move in the  direction of being fair with everyone.  These  farmers had been  treated un fairly, and, yet, there was no way to  deal with this issue.  So  today  I  think we have accom plished a lot, and it is a great day. We  have solved, and we are on the road to  a very serious solution of this problem.  I know  that this  issue will come up  again in conference, but I wanted  to  thank the gentleman from New Mexico  (Mr.  SKEEN),  the gentlewoman  from  Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), and the leadership  of  the  committee  for  allowing  this  amendment to be part of the final prod uct.

277,House,105,0.326,1101,9,Mr. LIVINGSTON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, a  lot has been said  about this ""Byzantine"" procedure, as  described by my friend who preceded  me. The fact is we are dealing with an  the  arcane set of laws that go back to the  1930's. They may have had great wis dom and sense back then in a different  age, and perhaps they have lost their  rationale  since all of  that  time has  gone under the bridge.  The fact is, as I understand the origi nal intent, Wisconsin was the center of  the universe. Eau Claire was  the pri mary designated place for the produc tion and pricing of milk. And, for what ever reason back in  those days,  they  decided that the farther we get away  from Eau Claire, pronouncing it cor rectly  this  time,  the more could be  added on to the price of milk for trans portation.  So obviously the objective was to get  fresh and clean and safe milk in the  hands of the consumers all over Amer ica. If the center of production was in  Wisconsin, by the time it got to Flor ida the price of milk was substantially  higher. By  the  time  it got  to New  York, it was substantially higher. By  the time it got to California, perhaps it  was substantially higher.  That trend is represented in this par ticular chart, presented according  to  figures of the USDA. At any rate, there  is no real consensus that can be drawn  from this chart except to show that at  Wisconsin begins the trend, and as we  get farther and farther away, the prices  through 1996 when the farm bill took  place went up as we got away from  Wisconsin.  So the farm bill came along and they  said, look, make some sense out of this  program. We  in the Congress told the  Secretary of Agriculture come up with  a plan that simplifies it, that hopefully  reforms  the program,  that moves  to wards  the goals of a  freer market.  Come up with a  plan  that provides  some continuity for the milk farmer.  Now, bear in mind, whether the dairy  farmer is in Wisconsin or Minnesota or  in New York or in Maryland or in Lou isiana, where I used to have 500 dairy  farms and now have about 370 because  they were forced to go out of business,  the dairy farmer is probably one of the  hardest working people on earth. He  gets up early in the morning; goes out  to milk his cows; goes about the rest of  his chores. By the end of the day, goes  out to milk his cows and goes to bed,  because there is no time left in the rest  of  the day. And come hell or high  water, rain or storm, freezing or heat,  he has got to milk those cows. His fam ily chips in, his wife, his children. And  they participate in trying to make a  living, a very meager living, whether it  is in Wisconsin or otherwise.  In Wisconsin and Minnesota, 80 per cent of what they produce goes to hard  products which is not fluid milk, but ter fat or to powdered milk or cheese.  But this argument is about fluid milk.  Wisconsin and Minnesota only put less  than 20 percent of their product in fluid  milk.  But these are farmers in New York  and Maryland and the Southeast and  Louisiana. Most of their product goes  to  fluid  milk.  They  are  getting  squeezed. They are getting squeezed to  the point that they cannot meet the  costs of production and they are get ting  thrown out of office, or  rather  thrown out of work. Excuse me. That is  us that get thrown out of office. They  get thrown out of work. They lose their  farms. We  can find another  job, but  they can only find one farm.  So, the Secretary of Agriculture was  given the responsibility of coming up  with a plan that would simplify  this  procedure. Well, according to the milk  marketing order reform proposed rule,  again the USDA's own figures,  this is  an analysis of the option 1-B plan that  Secretary Glickman was  coming up  with.  0 1430  In case Members want to find waves  and continuity here,  I do not  think  they will be able to do it. Numbers all  over the lot.  The CHAIRMAN. The  time of  the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. LIVING STON) has expired.

279,,105,0.52,1166,9,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker,  I submit for the  RECORD a copy of correspondence between  myself  and  Congressmen  BoucHER  and  CAMPBELL on the WIPO Copyright Treaties Im plementation Act.  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,  Washington, DC, June 16, 1998.  Hon. TOM CAMPBELL,  U.S. Representative tor the 15th District of Cali fornia, Washington, DC.  Hon. RICK BOUCHER,  U.S. Representative for the 9th District of Vir ginia, Washington, DC.  DEAR TOM AND RICK: Thank you for vis iting with me in my office recently regard ing H.R. 2281, the ""WIPO Copyright Treaties  Implementation Act.""  I appreciate the con cerns you expressed with respect to H.R. 2281  as  it was  reported  from  the House Com mittee on the Judiciary.  I expressed to you that I would consider  your thoughts and respond to you in detail,  and am pleased to do so in this letter.  I  believe  that many of your  concerns,  which are enumerated  in your  substitute  bill, H.R. 3048, have been addressed already  in a  reasonable manner in amendments to  the bill adopted by  the Subcommittee on  Courts and  Intellectual Property and  the  Committee on  the Judiciary  in  the House  and by the Committee on the Judiciary and  on  the  floor  in  the Senate (regarding  the  Senate companion bill, S. 2037). Others have  been  addressed  in  legislative  history  in  House Report 10fr-551 (Part I) which accom panies the bill, as well as in Senate Report  10fr-190, which accompanies the Senate com panion bill. Still others may be addressed as  the House Committee on Commerce exer cises its sequential jurisdiction over limited  portions of the bill and as I work with inter ested members on developing a manager's  amendment to be considered by the whole  House.  I anticipate  including many of the  amendments made by the Senate in the man ager's amendment, along with other provi sions. I anticipate that a conference will be  necessary to reconcile the House and Senate  versions of the bills.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  While I am unable to support the specific  provisions of H.R. 3048, for reasons I will ex plain  in  this  letter, I am willing  to work  with you in the coming weeks to address ad ditional concerns  regarding  the  impact of  this  legislation on  the application of  the  ""fair use"" doctrine  in the digital environ ment and on the consumer electronics indus try. I wish to stress, however, that I believe  the bill, as amended by the House and Senate  thus far, and explained by both the House  and the Senate Judiciary Committee reports,  already addresses these issues in several con structive ways.  I believe it is important, in order to recog nize properly the efforts undertaken by the  Congress and the Administration to address  the concerns of the consumer electronics and  fair use communities, to review the history  of H.R. 2281 and to evaluate all of the provi sions that have been either added to or de leted  from  the bill  since  its development  leading to introduction in this Congress. As  I am sure you will appreciate, I am sensitive  to your concerns and have worked diligently  with members and all parties  involved  to  create a balanced and fair proposal that will  result in the enactment of legislation this  Congress.  In  February,  1993,  the Administration  formed the Information Infrastructure Task  Force to implement Administration policies  regarding the emergence of the Internet and  other digital  technologies. This  task force  formed  a Working Group on  Intellectual  Property Rights to investigate and report on  the effect of this new technology on copy right and other rights and to recommend any  changes in law or policy. The working group  held a public hearing in November, 1993, at  which 30 witnesses testified. These witnesses  represented  the views of copyright owners,  libraries and archives, educators, and other  interested parties. The working group also  solicited written  comments  and  received  over 70 statements during a public comment  period. Based on oral and written testimony,  the working group released a ""Green Paper""  on July 7,  1994. After releasing the Green  Paper, the working group again heard testi mony from the public through four days of  hearings held around the country. More than  1,500 pages of written testimony were filed  during  a  four-month  comment period  by  more than 150 individuals and organizations.  In March,  1995,  then-Chairman  Carlos  Moorhead solicited informal comments from  parties who had submitted testimony regard ing the Green Paper,  including library and  university groups, and computer and elec tronics groups, in order to work effectively  with  the Administration on  jointly devel oping any proposed updates  to U.S. copy right law that might be necessary in light of  emerging technologies.  In summer, 1995,  the working group  re leased a ""White Paper"" based on the oral and  written testimony it has received after re leasing the Green Paper. The White Paper  contained  legislative  recommendations  which were developed from public comment  in  conjunction with consultation between  the House and Senate Judiciary Committees,  the Copyright Office and the Administration.  In September, 1995, Chairman Moorhead in  the House and Chairman Hatch in the Senate  introduced  legislation which embodied  the  recommendations  contained  in  the White  Paper and held a joint hearing on November  15, 1995. Testimony was  received  from  the  Administration, the World Intellectual Prop erty Organization and the Copyright Office.  The House Subcommittee on Courts and In tellectual Property held two days of further  June 23, 1998  hearings  in February, 1996. Testimony was  received  from  copyright owners,  libraries  and archives, educators and other interested  parties. In May, 1996,  the Senate Judiciary  Committee held a  further hearing. Testi mony was received from copyright owners,  libraries and other interested parties. These  hearings were  supplemented with negotia tions in both bodies  led by Representative  Goodlatte (as authorized by Chairman Moor head) in the House and by Chairman Hatch  in  the Senate. Further negotiations were  held by the Administration in late summer  and fall of 1996.  During consideration of the ""Nil Copyright  Protection Act of 1995,"" Chairman Moorhead  requested that Mr. Boucher and Mr. Berman  of California  lead negotiations between in terested parties regarding the  issue of cir cumvention. While  these negotiations were  helpful  in streamlining and clarifying  the  issues to be discussed,  they ultimately did  not result in an agreement.  It is important to note that shortly after  its establishment,  the Administration  task  force's working group convened, as part of  its consideration, a Conference on Fair Use  (CONFU) to explore the effect of digital tech nologies on the doctrine of fair use, and to  develop guidelines for uses of works by  li braries and educators. Because of the com plexities involved in developing broad-based  policies for  the adaptation of the fair use  doctrine to the digital environment, and due  to much disagreement among  the partici pants (including within the library and edu cational communities), CONFU did not issue  its full report until nearly two years after it  was convened. An  Interim Report was  re leased by CONFU in September 1997 on the  first phase of its work. No consensus was  reached on how to apply the fair use doctrine  to the digital age. In fact, the CONFU work ing group on interlibrary loan and document  delivery concluded in a report to its Chair  that it is ""premature to draft guidelines for  digital  transmission of digital documents.""  The work of CONFU continues today and a  final report should be released soon with no  agreed conclusions. As you can see, devel oping sweeping legislation, rather than rely ing on court-based ""case or controversy"" ap plications of the doctrine, is exceedingly dif ficult to do.  Since before the debate began with the es tablishment of a  task force  in  the United  States in 1993,  the international community  had  also  been  considering what updates  should be made to the Berne Convention on  Artistic and Literary Works in order to pro vide adequate and balanced protection  to  copyrighted works  in the digital age. This  culminated  in  a  Diplomatic  Conference  hosted by  the World  Intellectual Property  Organization at which over 150  countries  agreed on changes needed to accomplish this  goal.  This goal was not reached easily,. however,  and many of the issues being debated by the  Administration  and  the Congress  in  the  United States concerning fair use and cir cumvention were aired at  the Diplomatic  Conference, with significant changes made  to accommodate fair use concerns and the ef fect on the consumer electronic industries.  Representatives of both groups participated  in the Conference and aggressively sought to  maintain proper  limitations on copyright.  They succeeded. For example, language was  added to ensure that exceptions such as fair  use could be extended into the digital envi ronment. The  treaty also originally  con tained very specific language regarding obli gations  to outlaw  circumvention.  It was  ",1998

281,House,105,-0.213,1179,9,Mr. MINGE.," Mr. Chairman, the spon sors of  this amendment are arguing  that a  1-cent-per-pound  reduction  in  the loan rate is minimal and insignifi cant. Nothing could be  further  from  the truth.  Here is the truth, plain and simple:  The  amendment  is  a  $150 million  heist from the pockets of thousands of  struggling family farmers in 16 States.  Unlike the sponsors and supporters of  this amendment, I know many of those  farmers, and they are fighting to sur vive.  The  truth is the amendment would  reduce the 1985 raw sugar price level by  5.6 percent. Are  the sponsors of this  amendment willing to return to their  1985  salary  levels and  take an addi tional 5.6 percent reduction? Now that  is a reality check.  We have an economic crisis that is  brewing  in  rural America.  Farmers  want and need more alternative crops  to grow and add value locally. Sugar is  an alternative  crop  that provides  a  flexible supply of sugar to consumers.  We need to continue this program espe cially  in  the upper Midwest  that  is  being hit by an agricultural recession.  ",1998

290,House,105,-0.325,1387,9,Ms. STABENOW.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman from Massachu setts (Mr. McGovERN)  for yielding to  me.  I  first want  to  thank him for very  quickly moving, when this was brought  to our attention, to put in his bill, H.R.  3205.  I was very pleased to be an original  cosponsor with him  to delay  the  in terim payments system, as he has indi cated there are other bills as well that  change the formula.  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  PAPPAS)  has  a  bill  that also would  right many of the wrongs, and there  are certainly a number of options for  us.  I rise also, coming from a State that  is extremely efficient. We have, as a  State,  been  serving  people  in  their  homes for a little over $3800 per user,  which is less than the national average  of a little over $4600, $3800 versus $4600.  And we know that there are providers  that are using as much as $9000 per  user, per patient.  One of the difficulties with the way  that the Health Care Finance Adminis tration has begun  to  implement  the  changes in the balanced budget agree ment is by doing it across the board, as  opposed  to  looking at  the high-user  States or the high-user providers and  addressing them.  Instead they are penalizing everyone.  In States like Michigan, where we have  very dedicated small businesses, non profits,  visiting  nurses  associations,  Easter Seals,  that have been working  very diligently to keep costs down and  yet provide very high quality care,  they are being penalized. We are going  to see a reduction of some 27 percent,  and we are looking at possibly as high  as 80,000 people in my home State over  the next 2 years that will not be able to  receive service.  This is a critical issue. As you have  indicated, this is one that needs to be  addressed now. It needs to be addressed  tomorrow. As soon as possible. We have  changes taking place July 1 that will  greatly impact these home health care  providers, and we need to make this a  top priority.  I want to speak for a moment, if I  might, about  the kinds of responses  and the kinds of conversations I have  had with families in my district, not  just now around home health care but  over the last 2 years representing the  people of the 8th district.  0 2100  When I first was campaigning 2 years  ago,  I was amazed at the number of  homes as you walk down  the street  that had ramps on the front of their  homes. The number of people that were  asking me about home health care for  their mother,  their father, their hus band,  their wife,  another  loved one,  this  is one of the  top  issues on  the  minds of the people that I represent.  We all know of loved ones who need  care. It is not only better for them and  for  the  family  to  support  them at  home, but we know it saves tax dollars.  So it is really amazing to me that we  would be  looking at  these kinds of  drastic cuts  in something  that saves  money as well  as providing quality  care for families, for individuals. This  just makes no sense at all.  I  supported  the  balanced  budget  agreement. I want to have the budget  balanced.  I support going after fraud  and abuse, but I can tell my colleagues,  in Michigan, with my home care pro viders, they are not the folks that we  ought to be focusing the attention on,  because they are providing quality care  at very low cost.  I did want to mention one other issue  as well, and that is the whole issue of  surety bonds. This is something that  HCFA  can  address  themselves  right  now if they choose to do that tomorrow  morning. I would call on the adminis tration of HCF A to do this.  We put in place a requirement to pro tect,  for  new home health  agencies  that were opening, requiring a surety  bond  of  $50,000  or  15  percent. The  maker of  that amendment  indicated  that she meant whichever was less.  Instead, we are seeing efforts  that  have gone into place that are requiring  people  to  go  for  a  higher  amount,  whichever is more, 50,000 or 15 percent,  whichever is more rather than which ever is less.  What does  that mean? Right now,  only 41 percent of the home health care  agencies across our country have been  able to get a surety bond. The rule re garding having to have a surety bond  takes effect July 1.  Time is running out. We have got to  see some kind of a response that is rea sonable  to  those  that  are  on  the  frontlines providing home health care.  We have got to make sure that it is  done in a timely manner.  So  I  join with the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGOVERN) calling  on the Speaker of the House. There are  vehicles. We have the gentleman's bill.  We have other bills. We do not care if  it is a Republican bill. We do not care  if it is a Democratic bill. We just need  action now because the people at home  are going to be feeling the effects. We  are going  to  see businesses  closing,  home health care not provided. And  this is one of the most critical issues  facing our families.  So I am pleased to join with my col leagues tonight, calling for action.  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the gentlewoman for her com ments, and she raises two points that I  think deserve to be emphasized again;  and that is that if we are truly trying  to save money, and that is what one of  the goals of the balanced budget act  was about, this is not the way to do it.  You do not need to be a mathemati cian or an expert  in health care  to  know that it is a lot cheaper to provide  somebody good quality care at home  than  to have  that person  in a  long term nursing care facility or a nursing  home.  The other thing that my colleague  raises, which I think is very important.,  and that is this whole issue of how do  you encourage efficiency and cost ef fectiveness. Massachusetts has  some  great home health care agencies, vis iting nurse associations who have been  very good, who have been very effi cient.  But  the way  this whole  thing has  been put together, in essence, we are  punishing those who have been good. It  is almost as if we are saying to these  people you should have been bad. You  should have padded  the books. You  should not have been cost efficient and  effective; because if you violated all of  the things that we asked you to do, you  would be okay right now, because you  would only be trimming the fat.  It is the good agencies that are being  put out of business. I think that is sad,  and it goes against and it contradicts  what this Congress is supposed to be all  about. It contradicts what this admin istration says its goal is in health care.  So I commend the gentlewoman for  her comments. We are going to make  sure we work together; that something  happens. We are all dedicated in this  here. We need to convince our leader ship in this Congress that this issue is  important enough to have a vote now.  I sent a  letter to Speaker Gingrich,  which I would like  to enter into  the  record now, saying maybe we can bring  this up during  the  technical correc tions billion. We need to do this quick ly. Clearly, this issue is of such impor tance that I think it takes precedence  even over some of the things we have  been doing in this Congress. So I thank  the gentlewoman for her comments.  Mr. Chairman,  I yield  to  the gen tleman  from  Rhode  Island  (Mr.  WEYGAND) who has been an effective  leader in this issue. I was with him at  Warwick, Rhode Island in a health care  agency, and it was a great rally with  over 200 people all protesting these cut backs and demanding that Congress fix  it.  ",1998

I  was sitting in my office going through  some mail, and as well, I was listening  to  the gentleman's  comments about  education. That, of course,  is a very  important issue for me and the people  of my district.  Indeed, it is a personal issue for me,  as well. My mother was  a  school teacher, and some of the sentiments  the gentleman was were sharing in the  letter that he was reading were senti ments that my mother had shared with  me; that though she was a member of  the NEA when she taught, she thought  that the NEA had lost its focus and had  moved away  from quality education,  and simply had become a  labor union  pursuing the traditional goals of most  labor unions, which  is higher wages  and benefits for their members and job  security, and  that quality education  for children is a side issue for the NEA.  I  think some of the  things that we  have seen going on in Washington, par ticularly regarding issues like dollars  to the classroom, I want to thank the  gentleman for his  leadership on  that  issue and the work that he does to pro mote that issue. I think the people in  the  gentleman's district  should  be  proud of freshmen like the gentleman,  and the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. JOE PITTS), who have been really  trying  to  push  that  legislation  through.  We spent here in Washington, I think  we spent over $30 billion on education,  but a disproportionately large amount  of it does not end up in the classroom.  It does not end up helping the kids. It  gets sucked up by bureaucracy. This  legislation I think is a piece of legisla tion that is long overdue, because it di rects  the dollars away from bureauc racy in Washington and in our State  capitals and to the classrooms.  I do not know what the gentleman's  experience  has been  in  visiting his  schools in his district or talking to his  teachers, but my experience has been it  is  just very, very tight at the class room level. We have a lot of classroom  teachers in my district who use their  personal monies,  these are their post tax dollars coming right out of their  wallets, to buy things like supplies, pa pers, and special materials that are not  offered by the school district. I really  think that is a shame.  Let me furthermore add that the cl.e cline in education in the United States  and the falloff in performance I  think  is a great tragedy. It is a testimony to  the  fact  that Washington's  involve ment in education has not been helpful  at all.  ",1998
292,Senate,105,-0.123,1413,9,Mr. BREAUX.," I thank the Senator.  Mr. President,  I  congratulate Sen ator COVERDELL for his work and Sen ator TORRICELLI, on our side, who has  contributed so much to this debate. It  gets down to basics: Are we interested  in helping kids and families or helping  buildings? I  think the clear argument  is that we should be helping students  and helping families educate their chil dren, wherever they attend school.  One of  the arguments against  this  bill I have heard is that, well, it gives  some type of Government assistance to  private or parochial schools. I want to  address that issue because I think it is  not a legitimate concern. I have a book  here that is put out by the Department  of Education, our Federal department  here in Washington. It is a book of all  the  programs  that  exist  currently  where Federal tax dollars are used to  help students regardless of where they  go to school, as long as it is a  legiti mate school. This book is full of pro grams. It has about 70 pages of Federal  programs  that go  to children. If you  are poor, if you are disadvantaged, or if  you have a disability, you can use that  assistance to go to the school you want  to go to.  Now, the largest program we have in  the Federal Government is Title I of  the Elementary and Secondary Edu cation Act.  It has been  federal  law  since 1965. Let me read where Title I  funds go:  Elementary and  secondary education as  originally passed by Congress in 1965. Under  this legislation, private school students, pri vate school  teachers, private school other  personnel are included in the program.  ",1998
293,Senate,105,0.356,1439,9,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," I  ator.  I would just say to the distinguished  Senator  from Virginia  that we have  had benchmarks that are clearly not  achievable in any lifetime that we are  going to have. We have had deadlines  that have failed to be met. I think it is  time that Congress stand up and say we  are looking at the facts. The facts are  we are having a harder time recruiting  for the military. We are having a hard er time funding the modernization and  the  technology. We haven't even ad dressed missile defense  systems. And  yet we know now that two more coun tries have joined the nuclear club; that  we  are  talking  to  troops-at  least  I  am-who are very low in morale, and  people who not only are not coming  into  the service, but our experienced  people are  leaving, and I  think it is  time that Congress take the responsi bility to address these concerns. One of  them is a mission with no exit strat egy, which  is,  I  think, an  ill-defined  mission, and no clear policy that shows  our enemies or our allies where we  would go in the future.  Kosovo  is another  issue. There are  problems erupting in India and Paki stan. Certainly, Iraq is still on the ho rizon,  not  to mention Korea.  The  United States has the unique responsi bility in the world to provide a secu rity umbrella in a lot of places, and I  want to make sure that we are going to  be  strong  enough  to  respond when  there is a threat to U.S. security. And  if we continue to sit back and let dead line  after deadline  and  benchmarks  that do not hold water go  forward,  I  think we are abdicating our responsi bility.  ",1998
294,Senate,105,0.439,1465,9,Mr. BROWNBACK., That is correct.  The Senator from Virginia is correct.  ,1998
295,Senate,105,0.091,1465,9,Ms. SNOWE.," Thank you, Mr. Presi dent.  I appreciate this opportunity to ad dress this body on the subject of an im portant issue and what it means, I be lieve,  to  the  future  of our Armed  Forces.  The participation of women  in  the  armed services  today  is very  impor tant. As the Secretary of Defense said  recently in reaffirming his support for  gender-integrated  training,  and  the  recommendations of the services with  respect  to gender-integrated training,  he said clearly that the military de pends upon women.  Women now represent 14 percent of  our armed services. So their role and  their well-being is an essential ingre dient  to upholding the importance of  certain standards with respect to our  national security and performance of  our Armed Forces and personnel.  I offered a second-degree amendment  to the amendment offered by the Sen ator from Kansas, because it will reaf firm the judgment that was made first  in the Armed Services Committee last  year  to  the DOD  1998 authorization.  The amendment that was offered cre ated a congressional commission to ex amine many of the  issues  that were  raised by the Senator from Kansas. Ob viously, they are not new issues. They  are ones in which we have been wrestling with  time and  time again, not  only here  in Congress but, of course,  within the Defense Department.  There are no simple solutions. But  what I find amazing in hearing the dis cussion with respect to women in the  military  and  the  gender-integrated  training and the problems that have re sulted from gender-integrated training,  no one seems to raise the issue as to  what about the responsibilities and the  moral authority of those people who  are  in positions of  leadership within  our military?  I have had the opportunity to visit  many  installations,  including  Fort  Jackson,  the one which  the Senator  from Kansas referred to and that his  staff visited. I also visited that facility.  I well remember the facilities that are  there  that separate men and women.  Men and women are separated within  the Army, within the Air Force, within  the Navy.  They  have  separate  en trances. They have separate wings, sep arate bays, separate bathrooms, sepa rate  alarms.  They  have  security  guards, security cameras. So there are  certain security measures that are al ready in place. Now the question has  arisen as to whether or not we should  have separate barracks.  With all the misconduct and sexual  harassment that has occurred that we  have heard so much about over the last  few  years, much of  it,  interestingly  enough, has occurred in advanced inte grated  training  programs,  not with  basic training. But nevertheless, one of  the critical areas that we must focus  on is developing standards and uphold ing and enforcing those standards that  are consistent with the well-being of  both men and women who serve in our  Armed Forces,  the basic rights of all  human beings, whether they are in the  military or in the private sector.  And these questions have to be con sidered as  proposed by  the Senator  from Kansas through a simple disposi tion of an amendment? We in the com mittee last year said no, and, frankly,  I was prepared to debate and fight this  issue in the Chamber with respect to  gender-integrated training, whether or  not to have separate barracks, and so  on and so forth. But in the good judg ment  and  the wisdom  of  the  com mittee, we decided  to create a  con sensus-based amendment that was of fered by  the  chairman of  the Sub committee  on  Personnel,  Senator  KEMPTHORNE, Senator BYRD from West  Virginia, and myself. We knew that the  Department of Defense had already cre ated its own commission to evaluate  these questions and many more. We de cided that it was also important to cre ate a commission that was independent  to evaluate these issues as well.  Now we have to decide in this Cham ber whether or not we should subjugate  the recommendations of the commis sion that will be coming forward next  spring  to  the amendment that is of fered by the Senator from Kansas. I say  ",1998

297,Senate,105,-0.351,38,15,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, as  the  second largest economy, Japan's poor  economic situation is going to have a  very significant effect on our economy  and the economies of most other coun tries.  Again I quote Fred Bergsten, a very  respected expert in international eco nomics. He  urges  that  ""the United  States  and European Union  should  globalize the strategy of cutting their  own interest rates. This would encour age capital reflows to the crisis coun tries, reduce their debt burdens and improve  their  competitive  position by  promoting a  stronger yen.  It would  also  ensure  continued world growth  and help prevent further stock market  declines.''  Mr. Bergsten went on to note the fact  that the 30-year bond interest rate is  below the Fed funds rate and urged a  cut in this rate by a  full percentage  point.  Chairman Greenspan  recently  said  that the U.S. can't ""remain an oasis of  prosperity"" in ""a world that is experi encing greatly increased stress.""  Again, this statement does appear to  be a  significant and positive shift in  the views of the Chairman of the Fed.  However, I am concerned that there  are members of the Federal Open Mar ket Committee who both refuse to con sider the global economy when deter mining monetary policy and are still  worried  that  low unemployment will  automatically trigger inflation.  The  financial crisis  in Asia, Latin  America, Russia and many other areas  of the world poses a serious threat to  our economy and, to date, the United 1  States has not established the appro priate monetary policy to minimize it.  The FOMC,  through its control of the  federal  funds rate, has  the ability to  take decisive action against  the eco nomic problems that face us.  Many economists note that devalued  currencies in several countries will not  only reduce  the rate of inflation but  also sharply increase our trade deficit,  eliminating many  jobs  and  slowing  growth in the process. Worldwide com modity prices are at their lowest level  in decades.  With regard to our record trade def icit, on September 18,  the Christian  Science Monitor reports  that ""So far  this year, the trade deficit in goods and  services is running at a record annual  rate of $185 billion, 68 percent higher  than last year's record deficit of $110  billion. America's deficit with Pacific  Rim countries hit $87.8 billion in the  first seven months-42 percent above  the imbalance for the period in 1997.''  The September 7  issue  of  Insight  Magazine, says  that ""Santa Claus  is  coming to America, only his goods are  making  the early . trip by sea rather  than sleigh-in huge freighters filled to  capacity.''  What will  this mean  for  the U.S.  economy? Most importantly, it means  a  significant  loss of  jobs, perhaps as  much as 1.1 million.  In  fact, Wilbur  Ross, the senior managing editor of the  Rothschild. Investment Group, believes  that ""the loss of American jobs due to  decreased domestic production for ex port will outweigh any short term ben efits of lower prices.""  Experts  on  balance-of-trade  issues  say nearly every major industry will be  affected: automotive, steel, electronics,  appliances, machinery, textiles and ap parel.  ",1998
298,Senate,105,-0.37,51,15,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, I rise  today in support of the Reinstatement  of the Medicare Rehabilitation Act of  1998,  introduced by Senators REID and  GRASSLEY. I have always been a strong  advocate for the senior citizens of our  nation and I believe this bill will help  provide a  safety net for some of our  sickest seniors.  I was pleased  to  re cently join my colleagues as a cospon sor of this bill for two reasons-it re peals  an  unnecessary  $1,500  cap  on  Medicare  outpatient  rehabilitation  services and will allow seniors  to re ceive  treatment services that are es sential to their health.  Every year our elderly are  threat ened by strokes, multiple injuries, and  diseases.  Seniors  who  suffer  from  strokes  and multiple  diseases  in  a  given year often have complex health  care needs  that require costly, com prehensive  treatment. One study has  estimated that almost 13% of all Medi care beneficiaries or 635,000 seniors who  receive rehabilitative services outside  of a hospital setting will exceed  the  $1,500  cap. The  treatment  that  they  desperately  need would  exceed  the  $1,500 cap and require seniors  to pay  out of pocket for services or seek treat ment in a hospital outpatient depart ment  in order for Medicare  to cover  their treatment.  How  could  our  senior  citizens  be  treated this way? How did this come to  be? Well let me tell you, in 1997 Con gress passed the Balanced Budget Act.  Within that Act we placed a $1,500 cap  on outpatient rehabilitation services.  Limits on the cap were adopted with out adequate committee hearings and a  detailed analysis was not conducted by  HCF A to determine the likely effects  on  beneficiaries'  ability  to  obta:in  medically necessary services.  This was a mistake, but fortunately  we can correct it by passing this legis lation. The Reinstatement of the Medi care Rehabilitation Act ensures senior  citizens the right to receive the med ical  services  they  need  to  recover.  ",1998
299,House,105,0.316,467,15,Mr. EHLERS.," Mr. Speaker, I first of  all want to commend the sponsor and  cosponsors of this bill as well as the  committee members. It is an excellent  bill. It will serve the Great Lakes well.  I  particularly  commend  the  gen tleman from Ohio  (Mr. LATOURETTE)  for continuing in his efforts  to be a  conservator of the Great Lakes. He has  done  a  tremendous amount of good  work here on that score. I hope he con tinues.  There  is one point in the bill I do  want to raise because it might create  some problems for Michigan. I simply  want to get this on the record and per haps get some assurances from either  the  gentleman  from  Ohio  (Mr.  LATOURETTE) or  the gentleman  from  Maryland  (Mr. GILCHREST)  regarding  the language here. The bill says that  there  is established  the Great Lakes  Fish and Wildlife Restoration Proposal  Review Committee which shall operate  under the guidance of the Council of  Lakes Committees. The Review Com mittee shall consist of representatives  of all State directors and Indian tribes  with Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife  management authority  in  the Great  Lakes Basin.  The language in the report is similar  to  that  in  the  bill but  also  adds,  ""* * * nothing in this bill shall be con strued to enlarge or diminish the au thority of any Indian tribe with respect  to the management of fish and wildlife  in the Great Lakes Basin.""  There is a problem relating to this  that just came to my attention during  a call I  received from  the Governor's  office in Michigan. As some of my col leagues may be aware, there have been  several court cases on the issue of In dian fishing rights in Michigan, result ing in a substantial number of court  decisions. And my concern is that this  language  in  the bill might be  inter preted to say that those tribes which  have been given certain rights in court  cases would be regarded as having man agement authority. If that were true,  then we might well have 5 or 6 times  more representatives of Indian  tribes  than from  the State of Michigan on  this commission. That would mak'e it  somewhat unbalanced.  I assume  the intent was not  to do  that and I want  to get  that on  the  record. Perhaps both the chairman and  the sponsor of the bill' can assure me  that that is not the intent, and that in  fact we will use and interpret the lan guage as it was originally intended.  ",1998
300,House,105,-0.513,493,15,Mrs. MINK of Hawaii.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of H. Res. 505.  The South Pacific was one of the major the aters of World War  II. During  that time,  the  United States and  the  island nations of  the  Pacific established strong bonds that endure  even after the passage of over half a century.  Yet, while the United States has developed  and maintained a strong economic, political,  and strategic interest or presence in  the Pa cific,  the same cannot be said of the United  States diplomatic  presence  in  the  region,  which has diminished considerably over  the  decades. This resolution expresses the sense  of Congress  that  the United States should  strengthen  its diplomatic presence with  the  Pacific island nations.  This  resolution,  by encouraging a greater  U.S. diplomatic presence in the Pacific, recog nizes that while the United States should promote and support its commercial and strategic  interests by encouraging Pacific island nations  to become more fully  integrated  into  the  re gional and global economy, it is equally impor tant that such integration be accompanied by  the promotion  and  consolidation  of human  rights  and  democratic  values. And,  these  broader developments can better be realized  by  reestablishing America's diplomatic pres ence in the South Pacific.  ",1998

307,,105,-0.582,675,15,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, a month  long celebration beginning on September 15,  and lasting until October 15.  America strives on the diversity of its peo ple. As a nation, we pride ourselves on  the  fact that our national character is magnified by  citizens who assert and respect cultural cus toms  brought  from  other  lands. Hispanics,  nearly  five-hundred years ago, came  to  this  country in search of democracy, freedom and  a better way of life.  Throughout  history,  Hispanic  Americans  have immensely contributed to the well-being  and  advancement  of our  nation.  Through  science,  business,  government,  agriculture,  academics and  the Armed Forces, Hispanic  Americans have made their presence known  in American history. They have undauntedly  fought  to preserve democracy  in America,  having served  in  the United States Armed  Forces  in dimensions much  larger than  their  percentage of the population.  Hispanic Heritage month  is a  time  to ac knowledge  the  contributions  that Hispanic  Americans have made to our country, and are  continuing to make. Communities all over the  nation  are  celebrating  Hispanic  Heritage  Month, each  in  their own distinct manner. In  Cleveland, the Cuyahoga Community College  Hispanic Steering Council  is coordinating  the  Festival  Hispano,  featuring  performances,  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  workshops and  lectures celebrating Hispanic  culture and tradition.

308,,105,0.585,675,15,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Chairman,  Today I want this Congress to focus on a gov ernment that has spent years practicing torture  on  its own people. However, when you go  home and  turn on  the evening news, good  luck trying to find any story that reveals this  particular human rights issue. And better luck  getting this administration to pay any attention  to the plight of thousands of innocent civilians.  We speak of tragedies all over  the world  this time of the year. We speak of the strug gles in Africa, Cambodia, and Burma. We rep rimand China  for  its draconian abortion poli cies and illegal human organ sales. We threat en  to  stop  international military and  edu cational  training  (IMET)  from  Indonesia  for  abuses in East Timor. We even criticize long standing allies like Turkey for its treatment of  its Kurdish citizens without addressing the bru tal murders carried out by the PKK, a Kurdish  Marxist terrorist organization.  Unfortunately,  there  is one human  rights  issue that continues to escape the attention of  this administration, some Members of Con gress and the media. That issue involves the  plight of the Sikhs in Punjab or Khalistan; the  plight of the Kashmiris; the plight of Christians  in Nagaland; and the plight of the ""untouch ables"", the  lowest caste in  India's caste sys tem.  Mr. Speaker, the Indian Government is one  of  the world's worst human  rights abusers.  You may ask, well  if that's true, why doesn't  the world know?  Since the 1970's, Amnesty International and  other human rights groups have been barred  from India. Mr. Speaker, even the Government  of Cuba allows Amnesty into their country.  21733  In fact, there are half-million Indian soldiers  occupying Punjab,  and  another  half-million  troops occupying Kashmir. Since 1947,  India  has  killed  over  200,000  Christians  in  Nagaland;  250,000  Sikhs  in  Punjab  from  1984-1992; and 53,000 Muslims  in Kashmir  since 1988.  For the last sixteen years, I have been com ing  to  this well  to call attention  to Punjab,  where the Indian military receives cash boun ties for the slaughter of innocent children. And  to justify their actions, they are labeled ""terror ists"".  According  to our own State Department,  India paid over 41,000 cash bounties to police  for killing innocent people from 1991-1993!  Also in Punjab, Sikhs are picked up in the  middle of the night only to be  found  floating  dead  in  canals with  their hands and  feet  bound together. Some Kikhs are only so fortu nate, many are never found after their abduc tion.  Recently, the India Central Bureau of Inves tigation  (CBI)  told  the supreme court  that  it  had confirmed nearly 1,000 cases of unidenti fied bodies that were cremated by the military!  And  it does not get any better in Kashmir.  Women, because of their Muslim beliefs, are  taken out of their homes in the middle of the  night and are gang-raped while their husbands  are  forced  to watch and wait  inside at gun point.  It was hoped that the new governments. in  Delhi and Punjab would stop  the  repression  which the Indian Supreme Court describes as  ""worse than a genocide!""  Mr. Speaker, opponents will say the recent  election in Punjab of a Sikh dominated coali tion and the fact that an ""untouchable"" is now  the President of  India  is evidence of  their  democratic progress.  But, I can tell you that this new government  in  Punjab  is  closely  aligned  with  the  authoritiarian BJP Prime Minister Gudjaral of  India and  India's ""untouchable"" president  is  merely a figurehead. Mr. Speaker, would de mocracies continue the rampant campaign of  genocide?  On July 22, 1998, Baljit Singh, a Sikh youth  of Burj Dhillwan Village, died of complications  from torture-style brutality inflicted by the Pun jab police.  Also  in  July of  1998,  police  picked  up  Kashmira Singh of the village of Khudial Kalan  on  the pretext that they were  investigating a  theft. They then tortured him for 15 days. They  rolled logs over his legs until he couldn't walk;  they submerged him  in a  tub of water; and  they slashed his thighs with razor blades and  stuffed hot peppers into the wounds.  On April 1, 1998, Brother Luke, a Roman  Catholic priest was murdered  in  the eastern  state of Bihar. His body was found with a bul let hole through the head. He was a member  of Mother Teresa's world-renowned charity or ganization. This is the fourth priest in 2 years  that has been murdered in India.  On October 30, 1997, Reverend A.T. Thom as was found beheaded also in Bihar, appar ently killed  for aiding  the no-caste ""untouch ables."" Amnesty  International has  linked  the  Bihar state government to the murder of Rev.  Thomas! The Catholic Bishops conference of  India has criticized  the government for doing  nothing to protect Catholic priests and for fail ing to prosecute those responsible.  ",1998
309,Senate,105,-0.2,727,15,Mr. ROBB.," And friendship.  Mr. McCAIN. In the spirit of friend ship.  I also want to say that both Senator  ROBB and Senator WARNER have been  staunch advocates for  the people who  live in the State of Virginia who are di rectly affected by these policy changes.  I  understand  that concern and  that  commitment, and I think it is not only  appropriate but laudable. I assure both  Senators, my commitment to them and  their citizens is we will do everything  we can to see that there is not an in crease  in noise  in  the neighborhoods  surrounding  these airports. If we  re nege on  that commitment,  I will be  glad  to come back and  revisit  this  issue. If there is an increase of noise  pollution of any kind, I want to tell my  two dear friends that I will come back,  revisit this issue, so that we can repair  any damage  that  is  inflicted on  the  people of  the State of Virginia-and  Maryland as well, I might add. Mary land as well.  Both Senators  from Virginia have  been  staunch  opponents. They have  done remarkable things in preventing  even  this very modest-let's be  real istic herethis is very modest. When  we are  talking about a  total of six  round-trip  flights a  day,  it is not a  huge  increase. But  they have done a  great  job, and I commit  to  them, fi nally, we will be glad to revisit  this  issue if problems arise as a  result of  this legislation.  Also, we can put all  the blame on  Senator FORD because he will no longer  be with us at that time.  ",1998
310,House,105,0.47,792,15,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank the gentleman from New York  (Mr.  SOLOMON)  for  turning  the Com mittee on Rules into an Armed Serv ices Committee and  then a National  Security Committee.  It has  always  been,  I  think, reassuring to Members  on both sides of the aisle when we have  had our bill moving through the proc ess  to know  that  the Committee on  Rules was going  to  take up our bill  under  the  leadership of a Member of  Congress who finds that the constitu tional duty to protect this country is  of primacy. Whether he is in a Repub lican Conference,  in an  in-house con ference or speaking to the full House or  making sure that some important mis sion of the Committee on National Se curity works and is successful, the gen tleman from New York has been a real  fighter for a strong national defense.  Along those lines, I think we are in  some danger in this country. We have  been telling the President as we boost ed his defense budget every year on the  Committee on National Security and  then  in  the  full  body, we  have  in creased President Clinton's budget, we  have been telling him every year that  we do not have enough, that we are los ing people,  that we  have got pilot  shortages, that we have got technical  shortages. We now have sailor short ages in the Navy. We are losing people.  We are building a navy at a rate which  if you co~sider new construction will  give us a 200-ship navy when we had a  600-ship navy just a few years ago. We  are  seeing  the North Koreans  now  achieving ballistic missile  capability  that the CIA said they would not have  for years,  achieving  that  right now,  and we have no defense against it. We  have an army that has been cut from 18  to 10 divisions. We see a desperate need  for steal thy, tactical aircraft and we do  not have  them. Yet we are  trying to  move that program along. I  think we  have cut defense perilously. Yet  the  President has  rejected our overtures  for the last four years.  This year, I notice, if you read the  papers now, President Clinton is now  writing letters saying defense has been  cut too much, that we have to do some thing about it. Mr. Speaker, we have  done something about it in  this bill  with the very limited dollars that we  have. Our great leader the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. SPENCE) on  the Committee on National Security  has assigned us all our various areas. I  have worked  on modernization. We  have  tried  to  increase  the  tactical  fighter program. We have tried to put  money in the Joint Strike Fighter, the  F-22. We have added extra shipbuilding  money. We desperately need more. We  have moved out on missile defense. We  have tried to take steps, although they  have been small steps, in a number of  areas that are absolutely national pri ority with respect to national defense.  The best thing we can do right now is  pass this conference report and then re group and put an additional10 or 20 or  ",1998
311,House,105,-0.31,805,15,Mr. KLINK.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding this time to  me.  I always find it very interesting, the  names of the bills that come before us  during this Congress. I would venture,  if we did not have the kind of protec tions we have in speech on the floor of  the House, that we would be able to sue  our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle for false advertising.  Workforce Improvement and Protec tion Act, a bill that allows some of the  best jobs in the high tech industry to  go  to  foreign workers who we bring  into this country under a special H-1B  provision, while those very same com panies have spent the last year laying  off hundreds of thousands of American  workers. And I hope that when we get  into the general debate I will have the  opportunity to cite specific companies  and the number of thousands of Amer ican workers in the high tech field that  they have been laying off.  Mr. Speaker, this is not about a lack  of workers. It is about a lack of work ers that are the cheapest to be found.  It is about a  lack of indentured serv ants that we can bring in from other  nations who cannot complain because  there  is virtually no enforcement by  the Department of Labor.  Now I understand under the bill that  we are to take up today that we have  increased some of the oversight by the  Department of Labor, but the fact of  the .matter is that only the smallest  percentage of companies using H-1B  visas will be able  to be scrutinized.  Those will be the companies that are  called H-lB dependents.  When I first began to talk about the  problem with H-1Bs and this visa, a lot  of people across America were calling  my office, Mr.  Speaker,  and  indeed  some Members thought H-1B was some  experimental aircraft. The fact of the  matter is that this was a program that  was developed back  in 1990. The col leges and the universities and the high  tech  industries were coming  to Con gress  saying, we  are not  educating  enough people with PhDs and the kind  of degrees to take these high tech jobs.  My question still is,  if we are not  educating  them,  those  same  edu cational  institutions,  those  colleges  and universities that are complai:iling  to us, are at fault. They are the schools  that are accepting the tuition money  that is being earned and paid out by  the hard-working people of this coun try, and then they are not educating  those students to take the jobs of to morrow.  And  to my friends on the minority  side I will say at the same time that  they are attempting to eliminate the  Department  of Education,  eliminate  the Department of Commerce, elimi nate  the Department of Labor who  could monitor the needs of the work  force and could help us train the work ers  for  those  skilled needs.  Instead,  they are saying, let us raise the num ber up, let us raise the number of for eign workers that we are bringing in by  142,500, and that is what this rule does.  That is what this bill does.  D 1500  It says  to  the  hard-working  tax payers across this country, ""Your kids  are  too stupid, your schools are  too  bad, and we are not going to do any thing about it, except we are going to  bring foreign workers in to take those  good paying jobs. If you don't like it,  we in Congress don't care.""  Because you bring this bill up today,  no one has read it, no one knows what  the provisions of  this bill  are. The  White House worked this out. They did  not talk to those of us i:n the House, ex cept  to advise us what  the deal was  that they had made. No one consulted  us, no one asked us what we thought,  what we needed. We were not a part of  putting this legislation together.  I would say  that  the gentlewoman  from the Committee on Rules, the gen tlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGH TER), who yielded time to me, is abso lutely right. We come here today blind ly, not knowing what it is we are vot ing for. What are the specific protec tions in there? I defy one Member on  either side to tell us exactly what that  language is, because we have not had a  chance to scrutinize it.  That  is not  the way  the House of  Representatives should work. Over 80  percent of the people in a Harris .poll  across this country, when asked if they  favored  the program, when  the H-lB  program was explained to  them, over  four out of five workers across  this  country, voters across  this country,  said  they do not want  to see an  in crease in this program.  We are defying that. We are flying in  their face. This is not about building  up a high-tech industry. This is about  catering to high-tech industries, and a  very formidable political voice,  right  before we have an election. If it is bi partisan, then both parties are guilty  of doing it.  This is about giving away American  jobs over the next three years. 147,500  ",1998
312,House,105,0.425,818,15,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  I would just like to make the point,  again, that this is a bill that is sup ported by both the Republican leader ship and the administration. This is an  unusual conjunction of sometimes op posing forces agreeing on a bill, and  that is yet another reason why Mem bers should support it.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume  to  the gentleman from  California (Mr. DREIER), the next chair man of the Committee on Rules.  ",1998
313,House,105,-0.509,818,15,Mr. NADLER.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to enter into a colloquy with the  distinguished chairman.  Mr. Speaker, the 1990 amendments to  the Immigration and Nationality Act  created two new Visa categories, 0 and  P, which provide  for  the  temporary  entry of aliens who have extraordinary  ability in the sciences, arts, education,  business, or athletics, and for the tem porary entry of athletes  and  enter tainers with lesser abilities.  Clearly, Mr. Speaker,  the 0  and P  visa categories were created to ensure  that entertainers, athletes and support  personnel would no longer be admitted  under the broad H-1 standard of omis sion but, instead, would come in under  the 0 and P categories. It is my under standing, therefore, that this bill under  consideration today does not pertain to  the  temporary  admission  of  enter tainers and their accompanying crews.  Is  that also  the gentleman's  under standing?  ",1998
314,House,105,0.256,831,15,Mr. CAMPBELL.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the gentleman from Texas for  yielding me this time, and I welcome  him to my class any time he pays the  tuition.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to note with rec ognition of  the great  effort of my  friend, the gentleman from North Caro lina (Mr. WATT). I do understand what  he  is offering.  I  respect him and his  thinking. I am impressed by it.  I also wish to recognize what a  re markable  job  the  gentleman  from  Texas (Mr. SMITH),  the subcommittee  chairman, has done  along  the  lines  very much  of  the  gentleman  from  North Carolina's comments:  I  know  LAMAR SMITH, LAMAR SMITH is a friend  of mine, and he has gone farther than  perhaps he wished to go. I know how  far he has gone in order to bring a bill  to the floor that will meet the approval  of a majority of  this body and  the  President of  the United States. My  credit to both of these fine gentlemen.  Mr.  Speaker,  there  are  two  dif ferences between the Watt substitute  and the underlying Smith version. One  has received a lot of attention, the at testation requirement, and I will have  a word about that in a second. But the  first has not, and that is that there is  a difference in the Watt substitute in  that the increased H-1Bs come from H2Bs, so  that the net number of tem porary  immigrant visas will not  in crease. Whereas, under the Smith bill,  the H-1Bs are a net increase.  So, we  really have  two differences  and they are quite significant. If we be lieve that it is beneficial to our coun try to have a net increase in the num ber of temporary visas, then only the  Smith bill provides for that.  As  to  the attestation requirement,  the arguments that have been made are  in my  judgment missing  the  funda mental point that we are speaking of a  temporary position. That is why we do  not have an attestation requirement in  existing law for an H-1B visa. See, if we  are hiring some body to come  to  this  country on a permanent basis, that is a  green card. And for a green card, an at testation  requirement  is needed and  that is in existing law. That is because  they are coming to this country and  are going to be a member of our econ omy on a permanent basis.  But the whole idea of the H-1B and  the H-2B is that it is a temporary invi tation to this country for a  task that  needs someone now. That is why the  attestation requirement runs into such  opposition in many industries, because  the need now to go through the attes tation requirement delays the ability  to fill that need now. That is why ex isting law does not have an attestation  requirement for the H-1B visa.  We would, for the first time, be im posing into law an H-1B attestation re quirement, and that is quite a move to wards those who have expressed, with  all good faith, concern for protecting  the jobs of the American worker.  Indeed, the best way, it seems to me,  to protect it is  job of the American  worker is to guarantee a vibrant econ omy with a growing sector that relies  upon  the H-1B and permanent immi grants and American citizens.  That is my second main point. It is  essential that we remain competitive.  If as a result of what we do  today we  have  fewer  temporary  immigrant  la borers hired, but we  lose  the oppor tunity for the person necessary to the  immediate job at hand to come to this  country, we will have lost a great deal.  For the immediate need is exactly the  competitive edge, and then that tech nology,  that opportunity, will  very  well go to another country which does  have the ability to hire the temporary  worker without the delay of the attes tation requirement.  So, I observe that under existing law  we do not have an attestation require ment, and for a very good reason. I ob serve that we do have an attestation  requirement, however,  for permanent  workers and I observe that the Smith  version of the bill has an attestation  requirement where there is reason  to  'expect it. Namely, where there is are liance upon the imported, the H-1B im ported laborer above the 15 percent.  ",1998
315,House,105,0.216,831,15,Mr. LAZIO of New York.," Mr. Chair man, will the gentleman yield?  ",1998
316,House,105,0.232,844,15,Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania.," If the  gentleman will continue to yield, obvi ously, I am not authorized to divulge  information from  the select commit tee's investigation, but I can relate one   piece of information that is in the pub lic domain that I  think points up ex actly what the gentleman is referring  to very clearly.  Before 1996, China had no high-speed  supercomputers. None. The only  two  countries that manufacture high-speed  supercomputers  are  the  U.S.  and  Japan. Japan's export policy has been  very rigid and very tight. Up until 1996,  so was ours. In 1996,  things began to  change. Export waivers began  to be  issued. Presidential waivers began  to  be  issued. For whatever  reason. The  bottom line. Today, there is public in formation, on  the record,  that China  has  over  100  high-speed  supercomputers, all of which were obtained from  the U.S., which gives China, listen to  this  fact, more high-speed supercom puting capability than our entire De partment of Defense, within 2 years.  That is on the record, in public docu ments provided by this administration,  in terms of what capability China has.  Now,  I  am  not  against  engaging  China.  In fact,  I  led  two delegations  there last year.  I am for an engage ment  that  is  based  on  candor  and  strength, much like the engagement I  think we should have with Russia. But  facts are facts. They do not need over  100 high-speed  supercomputers  to do  computational  research.  They  need  that kind of supercomputer research to  design nuclear bombs, nuclear weap ons, and to be able to do testing of nu clear systems, like we are doing with  our ASCII Blue project.  The 100  supercomputers  that China  has,  I would maintain many of them  are being used in developing new gen erations of weapons that China is,  in  fact,  today working on. Prior to 1996,  they had none. From 1996 until today  they have in excess of 100. Again, more  than the entire supercomputing capa bility of our Defense Department. If  that is not an outrage, I do not know  what is.  And I thank my colleague for yield ing.  ",1998
317,,105,-0.103,896,15,Mr. CONDIT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to  pay  tribute  to California State  University,  Stanislaus on the occasion of the dedication of  the University's Professional Schools Building.  CSU Stanislaus,  located  in my district  in  California's great Central Valley, has seen a  September 24, 1998  very impressive 63 percent growth in student  population during  the past two decades and  this new Professional Schools Building reflects  a new milestone  in  the  university's strong  commitment to obtaining  the highest level of  student academic achievement.  This magnificent new building  represents  the core values of a learning-centered environ ment-not only for undergraduate students but  for  the university's credential  programs  and the professional and applied programs.  I am very proud to report to my colleagues  that standing on  the brink of a new millen nium, this new facility is designed with an eye  on the 21st Century with an advanced techno logical  infrastructure which  supports on-site  and interactive distance learning programs.  A copy of this message of congratulations is  being enclosed  in a time capsule at the Uni versity to be removed during the University's  centennial anniversary in the year 2060. It is  my sincerest hope,  that at  that  time CSU  Stanislaus will have traveled far down the path  of academic excellence and made its mark of  distinction along the avenue of Universities.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud  to be among the  alumni of this university and can say  that  it  holds a special place in my heart. I ask that  my colleagues  rise and  join me  in offering  congratulations  to  Dr. Marvalene Hughes,  president  of  California  State  University,  Stanislaus, and  in extending my best wishes  to  future generations of those who will hear  this message.

318,,105,0.382,896,15,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Speaker, this weekend,  hundreds of thousands of Americans will par ticipate  in The March-a rally to raise public  awareness in support of the fight to end can cer. A high-profile gathering led by Gen. Nor man Schwarzkopf, Vice President AL GORE,  and others will be held on  the National Mall,  and similar events are planned in communities  around the country. This week is also ""Pros tate Cancer Awareness Week,"" and October  is  ""National  Breast  Cancer  Awareness  Month.""  Cancer causes one of every four deaths in  the United States. Tragically, about 1.2 million  new cancer cases will be diagnosed in 1998,  according to the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention  (CDC). CDC estimates  that  half a million people will lose their lives to can cer this year-more than 1,500 people a day.  Despite  these  sobering  statistics, however,  there is reason for renewed hope in the ""War  on Cancer.""  A recent report by CDC, the American Can cer Society and the National Cancer Institute  showed cancer incidence and death rates for  all  cancers combined actually declined be tween 1990 and 1995-reversing an almost  20-year trend of increasing cancer cases and  deaths in the United States.

319,Senate,105,-0.326,961,15,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President, I  wish to recognize today the efforts of a  group of West Virginia citizens who  have joined together to address an im portant issue affecting our state and  the  nation.  These  individuals, who  have formed Citizens Against Lawsuit  Abuse (CALA), are working to educate  the public about how excesses in our  civil justice system can be harmful.  CALA  volunteer  spokespersons are  speaking out about how lawsuit abuse  means  people  pay  through  higher  prices  for consumer products, higher  medical expenses, higher taxes and lost  business expansion and product devel opment.  I  should note  that my own  concerns relate to abuse of the system  which comes in the form of frivolous  suits and inappropriate delays-not le gitimate use of our tort system.  CALA reports that recent studies of  liability  costs have  found  that our  State has a high lawsuit and liability  cost relative  to our economic. output  measured as gross state product. As an other example of the effect of lawsuit  abuse, CALA's own survey of all West  Virginia municipalities last year found  an  estimated  annual  lawsuit-related  cost for our municipal taxpayers to be  more  than $9 million. Nationally,  it  has been estimated that the costs of  our civil justice system averages $1200  per person per year.  Legal  reform of any kind  is not a  simple issue. The legal system is essen tial to provide justice to every Amer ican. But that does not mean that the  status quo  is perfect. When  lawsuits  and the courts can be used in excess or  result in imposing costs without reason  on the ot~er parties, from individuals  to not-for-profit agencies to businesses,  the system should be reviewed and re formed if possible.  I often have spoken about the prob lems of our product liability system.  We see the terrible consequences of our  country's  confusing patchwork,  slow,  and often unfair system of product li ability rules that need to be properly  and fairly reformed.  The leaders of West Virginia's CALA  movement should be commended here  today. Volunteers such as Robert Mauk  of Huntington; Jim Thomas, Sid Davis  and Mac McJunkin of Charleston; Cuz  Blake of Bridgeport; Phyllis Garner of  Clarksburg; Rick Pruitte of Fairmont;  and Sam Chico of Morgantown are all  working hard to ensure that our State  has a  strong,  fair and effective civil  justice system that will serve all West  Virginians and grow our economy and  job base. These people give their time  to speak  to community groups, orga nize  educational  activities  and  dis tribute materials to help us all be con scious of lawsuit costs and excesses of  the system.  Citizens  Against  Lawsuit  Abuse  groups  have  declared  September  21  through  26  to  be  ""Lawsuit Abuse  Awareness Week""  in West Virginia.  I  want  to commend  these citizens  for  their dedication and commitment and  to acknowledge  this week as  time of  public awareness on the serious issues  associated with lawsuit abuse.   ",1998
320,House,105,-0.512,1052,15,Mr. BECERRA.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker,  I,  too, will pull out  those same 10 $1 bills. I, too, will tell  the Members that if I have $10 because  I work for the government, and I got  them  because  someone  is working  every day contributing to the social se curity trust fund for his or her retire ment,  I am not going  to  tell  them,  well, I am only taking one of your $10  you just gave me for your social secu rity  investment in retirement, and I  am going to use this to give out tax  cuts, mostly to folks who are better off  and do not need to worry about your  retirement the way you maybe do. So  you keep your 9 and I get to spend your  one.  D 1200  That is what we are talking about.  And, by God, please do not tell me that  they are willing  to  tell an American  farmer that they are going to punish  them because this Congress, some here,  are willing to say that we want to help  them in time of need because of the  drought and because of floods and be cause of all that done through an act of  God.  But my colleagues on the other side  are saying to them, no, we cannot let  this Congress help them out in  their  time of need. But, by the way, we do  have money,  that $10  that  they  just  gave in their contributions out of their  paycheck every month, to take one of  those $10 and give a tax cut 6 weeks be fore the election. We can do that. Pun ish the farmers for an act of God.  Do not do  that. And please do not  punish seniors for the political acts of  men in this House.  Now, when those folks out there in  the  country  that  are  earning  this  money that they are putting into the  Social Security trust fund go to the su permarket,  they do not expect to re ceive 90 percent of the groceries they  just paid for. When we buy a home, we  do not expect  to own nine-tenths of  that home. When we pay for our child's  education, we do not expect them to re ceive 90 percent of a college degree.  Mr. Speaker, when Americans deposit  money in a bank, they certainly do not  expect that bank to give them only 90  percent back of their original deposit,  or 90 percent of the interest that their  money has earned. They expect 100 per cent.  The fact is, the budget surplus is not  a  surplus, other than Social Security  funds contributed every day by people  who work and give of that money out  of their paycheck. American workers  are doing what Republicans here are  unwilling to do in this House. They are  saving and  investing for  their retire ment.  In fact, what Republicans are pro posing through this tax cut is to take  those savings and investments because,  again, the surplus we are talking about  is created by all the trust fund dollars  that American workers  are  contrib uting. The fact that we are not using  every dollar out of the trust fund for  Social Security and paying out for to day's retirees does not mean that we  should tell those folks who are working  and contributing  that  right now we  have a surplus, because they are paying  a little bit more than we have to pay  out today, because those workers know  that tomorrow when the baby boomers  retire we are going to go in the oppo site case and we have to save now to  take care of that problem later.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues,  please do not take even one dollar out  of the $10  that American workers are  earning every day and depositing into  the Social Security trust fund to pay  for tax cuts right after an election.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind  my  colleague,  again,  the gentleman  from  I  think it is Poland, Ohio  (Mr.  TRAFICANT), I would like to remind him  that we have been at full employment  for now 3 years in a row, and that the  fastest growing component of our na tional economy has been trade. It has  been the most productive. That is what  we are putting at risk when we con template  terminating  international  trade agreements.  I would  remind my colleague also  that  the Constitution  says  that on  trade issues we are the ultimate judge.  Under fast track, we are still the ulti mate  judge. We make  the  input all  along  the way, we  look at  the final  product, and  then we vote  it up or  down, so it is exclusively within our ju risdiction. I would urge the gentleman  to reconsider his misguided policy.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my  distinguished colleague, the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. KOLBE)  ",1998
324,House,105,-0.658,1117,15,Mr. CONYERS.," I am opposed to this bill to  grant ""fast track"" negotiating authority to  the  president. The  failed  record  of  the North  American  Trade  Agreement  should  have  taught this body that it is time for us to remake  our trade policy. NAFTA has hurt workers in  America, increased poverty in Mexico and ac celerated environmental destruction along the  border.    The NAFT A disaster demonstrates not that  we shouldn't be making trade agreements, but  that we need a fully participatory policy mak ing process that protects the interests of con sumers, workers and  the environment. That  process should put Congress, a body devoted  to  responsiveness  to people back home, at  the center of the trade debate.  In my own state, NAFTA has been dev astating  to  the auto  industry.  In 1997,  the  trade deficit with Mexico was $13.9 billion for  autos and automobile parts alone! This figure  is expected to go up a bit this year because  from January through July of 1998, the trade  deficit was $8.7 billion, compared to $8.3 bil lion for the same period  last year. And keep  in mind  that before NAFT A,  in  1993,  the  United States only had a $3.6 billion overall  deficit with Mexico.  I visited the low-wage maquiladora factories  in Mexico in 1993. All the foreign-owned cor porations  told us  that  this business sector  would shrink. Instead it has increased by half  since NAFTA. This means  that polluted cor ridor along the US border is growing uncon trollably  and NAFT A's weak  environmental  protections give us almost no redress.  So Americans are not better off and Mexi cans are not better off. According to Mexico's  National Autonomous University,  the number  of people living in extreme poverty has gone  up from 31 percent in 1993 to 50 percent in  1996. This is not a fair deal for anyone except  the greedy few who have profited from slash ing American jobs and suppressing American  wages.  I know we  can negotiate a better  trade  agreement. But the first step is to keep Con gress and the American people involved by re jecting the failed fast-track approach to trade.  I urge a ""no"" vote on this bill.  ",1998

What  this debate  is about  is whether  the  most powerful nation on  the planet will .help  create a global economic system in which ev eryone has a fair share of the wealth.  Or whether we will continue to pursue trade  policies that magnify existing  inequities. That  favor huge multinationals and  ""agribusiness""  rise  I  in  ",1998
326,House,105,-0.429,1156,15,Ms. BROWN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to speak out against an other case of reverse Robin Hood. But  this time it is stealing from our seniors  to give out tax breaks in an election  year. When we talk about Social Secu rity, we are talking about one of the  most important programs in the his tory of the United States. This pro gram ensures that our seniors and our  disabled will be taken care of. The So cial Security program is the result of  hard work by working families across  this Nation. By dipping into the Social  Security cookie jar, we jeopardize the  security of seniors who count on these  monthly  checks during  their  retire ment.  Let me close with a tribute today to  the late Claude Pepper, one of the most  important  advocates  for  the elderly  and for Social Security expansion in  the United States Congress. Claude  Pepper cared about seniors across this  Nation and he fought to protect them  so that they could enjoy their elderly  years  in  life without being afraid of  where  their next check was coming  from. As a Member of Congress from  the State of Florida, Claude Pepper's  legacy  for  fighting  for  the  rights of  seniors and the poor speaks for itself.  He would not stand for election-year  gimmicks  that punished  the working  families who have contributed to  the  Social Security trust fund. In the name  of decency and in the name of Claude  Pepper,  the  leadership of this House  should vote  to  save Social Security  first. This is a mean-spirited attack on  the needy. We have a responsibility to  today's seniors and to tomorrow's sen iors to protect this valuable program.  ENDING MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  BOEHLERT).

329,House,105,0.316,1286,15,Mr. RAMSTAD.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday we  took steps to bank 90 percent of the budget  surplus to save Social Security. Today we will  give back a small portion to help people who  gave us the surplus in the first place-Amer ican taxpayers.  The marriage penalty tax relief will help 24  million American couples-875,000 people  in  my home state of Minnesota alone. Seniors  will be able  to earn more before the govern ment confiscates  their  social  security pay ments. Countless farmers and small busienss  entrepreneurs need our help with estate taxes,  health insurance costs and expensing. Farm ers need  the added  relief of permanent  in come averaging, an expanded Net Operating   Loss carryback period and market  transition  payment help.  And aside from  the tax relief  in  real dollar  terms, we provide needed  tax simplification.  Fewer Americans will have to itemize because  of the doubled standard deduction for married  taxpayers. Millions of other Americans will be  able  to fill out a simple EZ  form because of  the small  interest and dividend exemption-a  provision that will help 1.4 million Minnesotans  keep more of their savings. And many-more  Amercians will be spared  from paying death  taxes and making the excruciating calculations  required by the Alternative Minimum Tax.  This bill also provides critical assistance for  school districts and state and  local govern ments  through  the school construction bond  provisions and the  increase in the private ac tivity bonding cap. The community  renewal  provisions will  provide hope  to desperately  hurting communities.  We also extend expiring provisions crucial  for American competitiveness,  for charitable  giving, and  for moving Americans off welfare  and into the-workforce.  Mr. Speaker, the government is taking more  taxes from Americans today than at any time  in U.S. history. Families know better what to  do with their own money than the federal gov ernment.  lfs time  to  let  the  taxpayers who  need it most to keep more of what they earn.  f~r  ",1998
330,House,105,0.554,1286,15,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, in the ""90-1 0  tax cuf' Mr. ARCHER uses 1 0% of  the pro jected surplus  to provide  relief  to  farmers,  married couples,  seniors,  small businesses,  savings account-holders, and students, while  preserving 90% of the surplus of Social Secu rity.  Ideally,  I would  favor  funding Mr. AR CHERS's  tax cuts by eliminating wasteful pro grams  in  the budget. They are money pro grams we could eliminate to reduce spending,  such as: $3,500,000 for facilities at Delaware  Water  Gap  National  Recreation  Aref,  $3,000,000 for the  International Fertilizer D~­ velopment Center  (IFDC), and $250,0QO  production of ammunitiqn guides b,y  thEf-A TF ..._  However, the 90/10 plan ,a.chieves ahd  im portant goal-this bill eliminates oppressive  tax code sections while preventing wasteful  surplus spending.  The surplus belongs  to  the  taxpayers, not  Washington. This money should be  returned  to Americans as Social Security funds and tax  cuts.  Twenty-one million Americans are slapped  with an average of $1,400  in higher  taxes  every year because of the marriage penalty.  H.R. 4579 amends the tax code to make the  schedule of standard deductions allowed  for  single and married taxpayers more equitable and effectively ends the ""marriage penalty.""  The bill supports community renewal by au thorizing 20  tax  incentives  for communities.  Tax incentives such as the Work Opportunity  Tax Credit and the R&E Tax Credit would be  extended. Military personnel would receive tax  relief-it would be easier for them  to qualify  for the exclusion of gain on the sale of a home  under  the bill. Education and  infrastructure  would be improved with greater participation in  privately pre-paid tuition plans, relaxing the ar bitrage rebate, and  increasing private activity  bonds caps.  Mr. Speaker, with all of these benefits going  to deserving, hard-working Americans,  I sup port H.R. 4579. Americans want and deserve  a break-let's give it to them.  ",1998
