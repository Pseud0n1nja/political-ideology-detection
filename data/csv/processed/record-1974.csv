0,Senate,93,-0.296,15,3,Mr. JACKSON.," Mr. President,  there  has been much discussion in the last few  days about the danger of rolling back  prices to a  level which would diminish  needed petrolewn supplies. It is clear  that, at some level, prices could be set so  low as to discourage future exploration  and development. It is also clear that  there  is  a  point at which  crude oil  prices  become  excessive,  unreason able  and  serve no  rational  economic  purpose. Incentives are needed for ex ploration and development of future en ergy resources. The clear majority of ex pert opinion  in Government,  industry  and the universities agree that present  prices of uncontrolled oil are far in ex cess of levels which are necessary for the  further exploration and development of  additional domestic energy resources.  In the past few months, the industry  has presented a number of estimates of  the price needed  to elicit an adequate  long-term supply of energy  resources:  these estimates range from $3 to some. what under $7.  Industry's own :figures  prove that a meaningful price rollback  can be affected without diminishing sup _ply. According to the highest studies and  estimates that I have received, a price  ceiling of about $7 would be more than  adequate to encourage a sufficient long term domestic supply of energy resources.  As recently as February 4, 1974, the rep resentatives of the Federal Energy Of fice testified that:  It is reasonable to assume that after about  three  to five years, and allowing for some  inflation,  if  the price of oil  increases by  about 50 percent from mid-1973, supplies  should fiow  to satisfy about 85-90  percent  of our demands. Accordingly, we have for  planning purposes estimated that the ""long term supply price"" is about $7.00 per barrel.  A number of other recent studies have  .focused on determining the long-run sup ply price of crude oil needed to elicit adequate domestic supplies of oil. A sum mary of the :findings of these studies fol lows:  Federtd Energy Office  (January  1974):  "". . . The long term supply price of bringing  in  the alternate sources of energy in this  country, as well as drilling the Outer Continental Shelf and the North Slope ... is $7  a barrel, current 1973 dollars.""  the Treasury  Department of  (December,  1973): ""No one knows exactly what the long term supply price is, as no one can predict  the future that clearly. Our best estimate is  that it would be in the neighborhood of $7  per barrel within the next few years.""  Petroleum  Association  of  Independent  America  (1973 projections):  ""In  terms of  constant 1973 dollars ... an average price of  about $6.65 per barrel  for  crude oil ...  would be  required over  the  long  run  to  achieve 85% self-sufficiency in oil and gas by  1980.""

Petroleum Independent (November 1973):  ""There's no doubt that prospects are for in creased drilling. Everybody I know is plan ning on it. With new oil priced from $5.30 to  $6.00 per barrel, there's incentive now to go  looking for oil.""  The conference report provides for a  rollback of all oil prices-new oil,  re leased oil, stripper well oil, and State  royalty oil-to a maximum of $5.25 a  barrel on a national average. The con ference report also provides that these  are ceiling prices and the President may  establish lower prices ""if he determines  that lower ceiling prices will permit the  attainment of  the objectives"" of  the  Emergency Act and the Petrolewn Allo cation Act.  The conference report provides a pro cedure  whereby  the  President may  , specify a higher price  for  reas01iable  classificatiorn of crude oil, such as oil  from stripper wells,  if he finds  that a  higher price is necessary to permit the  attainment of the objectives of the act.  The procedure for specifying a higher  price requires a detailed analysis justi fying the need for a higher price. This  analysis must deal with the impact of  price on supply, demand, the economy,  .consumers, employment, and competi tion. This analysis must be ttansmitted  to the Congress, and no proposed price  increase may take effect during the first  30 days after date of enactment until  Congress has received the analysis and  _had 15 days to review the stated justifi cation.  Finally, the conference report provides  that the price for domestic crude oil may,  under no circumstan .... es, exceed 35 per cent of the rollback price of $5.25-which  means a national average price of $7.09  a barrel.  Any price in excess of this would re quire an act of Congress to amend the  rollback  provision  of  the  conference  report.  The pricing procedure established by  the report is subject to administra.tive  review and a requirement for hearings. It  is also subject to  judicial review on a  standard of substantial evidence.  Mr. President, price increases in the  oil industry have far exceeded average  increases in all other commodities in the  economy in 1973. From January to Oc tober 1973, percent changes in the Whole sale Price Index  included  increases of  79.6 percent for fuel oil, 53.8 percent for  gasoline, 22.2 percent for crude products  and 55.8 percent for all refined petroleum  products. In contrast, the WPI increase  for all commodities during  this period  was 16.4 percent. By December, fuel price  increases accounted for 40 percent of  the increase in the Wholesale Price In dex. A year ago, crude oil was selling for  $3.40 a barrel. Today, prices in excess of  $10 a barrel are common for new oil and  oil produced from stripper wells; old oil  sells for a ceiling of $5.25 .a barrel.  By the time these costs are passed on  to the conswner in the form of increased  rates  for. electricity and  for gasoline,  heating oil and other products, the im pact is even greater. The Federal Energy  Office estimates that every-dollar cost in crease for a barrel of crude translates  into 2.5 cents increase in a gallon of gaso- line or heating oil. In 1974, the Consumer  Price Index is expected to rise by about  8.5 percent. The cost of living is pro jected to increase about 5.5 percent. Oil related cost increases alone will account  for 3 percent of the increase in the cost  of living.  It is difficult to justify today's soaring  fuel prices, despite the current worldwide  petroleum shortage. Long term benefits  may accrue to conswners in the future  if price-related profits are used to de velop new sources of energy, but there  are indications the current price levels  are far greater than those needed to pro mote domestic  energy  self-sUfficiency.  Clearly, a balance must be struck be tween the need for new energy sources  and the present health of the economy.  Reason must prevail in the petroleum  pricing system.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  THE SHORTAGE OF PETRO CHEMICALS  ",1974
2,Senate,93,0.278,41,3,Mr. TAFT.," Mr. President, I have be~  come extremely concerned about the in ability of chemical firms, plastics and  rubber processors, and other small fabri cations to obtain the petrochemicals they  need, despite the existence of the man datory allocation program  for  refined  petroleum products.  I have supported from the beginning  of debate the priority position assigned  in the allocation program to the petro chemical industry. In recognition of this  industry's tremendous importance to the  economy, that position has been refiected  in the Federal Energy Office regulations  which allow petrochemical producers to  receive 100 percent of current petroleum  requirements. However, the congressional  concern for the welfare of this industry  extended not just to the producers and  first purchasers of petrochemicals, but  to all of  the  industries ""downstream""  which need them. Our efforts to generate  continued production in the petrochemi cal sector will be considered successful  only if these operations, as well as those  directly receiving an allocation of petro leum products, benefit from more ade quate supplies of their raw materials.  Unfortunately, that does not appear  uniformly to be the case. Those who have  been able to buy polystyrene and other  petrochemical feedstocks have, in many  cases,  increased  their  internal use of  these  feedstocks  rather  than making  them available to the processors which  I  have  historically  relied  upon  these  sources of supply. That these companies  can expand their production significantly  while those who have relied on them for  petrochemical supplies are forced to lay  off workers and consider shutting down  is evidence of inequitable distribution of  the feedstocl.r..s. Because of this situation,  the jobs of hundreds and perhaps thou sands of my constituents in fabricating  plants are presently in danger.  The drastic increase of late in the ex port of petrochemical  f eedsoocks  is a  further source of irritation. Even though  a small amount of f eedstocks is involved,  I do not see how anyone can blame the  work:.ers in the industry whose jobs are  endangered if they have trouble stom aching  these  increased exports.  I am  pleased that the Commerce Department  has now imposed a monitoring system  to assess the volume and effect of the  exports.  understand  that  the Federal En ergy Office has now agreed to amend reg ulations to direct that ""to the maximum  extent practicable"" recipients of petro leum product allocations in the industry  should  conduct  sales  Policies which  foster competition. Because the distribu tion problems seems  to  revolve more  around the action of ""middlemen"" who  buy the feedstock products than the com panies  actually  receiving  petroleum  product allocations, this change in the  regulations, although welcome, may have  a limited effect. The Cost of Living Coun cil's action last week to lift price controls  from nearly all petrochemical f eedstocks  should be of much more consequence.  The Cost of Living Council hopes that a  sufficient increase in petrochemical sup plies will result, mostly because the price  rise will increase the relatively profit ability to refiners of producing necessary  feedstock materials rather than gasoline.  We are all hopeful that such an in crease in the supply of petrochemical  feedstocks will be of sum.cient magnitude  to alleviate  the present problems and  thereby obviate the necessity for full al location of petrochemicals. An allocation  program of that type would be extremely  difficult  to administer effectively and  should be avoided if at all possible. I am  willing to wait a few weeks before ad vocating a full petrochemical allocation  program to detennine whether the Cost  of Living Council's action is adequate.  If the serious shortages continue, how ever, we will have no choice but to face  up quickly to the possibility that the al location program will have  to be ex panded. This would be necessary  for  the sake not only of saving our constit uents' jobs, but also to insure that high priority chemical needs such as medical  needs will be fulfilled despite the short age.  LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY FLOOD  CONTROL PROJECTS  ",1974
3,Senate,93,-0.056,41,3,Mr. STENNIS.," Mr. President, the fiscal  year 1975 budget for :flood control proj ects in the lower Mississippi Valley re flects  the fact that we had a  tremen dous fiood in that area last spring. The  amounts request~d for  the Mississippi  River and tributaries project are greater  than those shown in the budget submission last year. Howeyer, they fall short,  in my judgment, of what will be needed  in that area, and I intend to explore this  aspect very thoroughly in the hearings  that I soon will conduct as chairman of  the Public Works Subcommittee of the  Senate Appropriations Committee.  The necessity for maximum progress  on :flood control work in the Mississippi  . Valley is amply justified by the tremen dous damages that were prevented last  year by those projects, and the flooding  and hardships that existed, because the  projects had not all been completed.  If any additional emphasis is needed,  however, it certainly is provided by river  conditions this year.  The situation in the lower Mississippi  Valley is such that it should be watched  very carefully with respect to flooding,  but it would be premature to actuallY  predict a flood of the magnitude of last  year. What  happens will  depend  on  whether there are heavy storms in the  next 3 or 4 months.  At present, on the minus, or bad side  of the situation, the Mississippi River is  higher now than it was last year. The  predicted high at Vicksburg, on Febru ary 7, will be 45  feet above mean low  water, or 7 feet higher than on February  7 last year. The river is now 2 feet ove1  bankfull at Vicksburg, so it has started  to back up into the Yazoo River, and will  continue to back up until February 7.  Streams in the Yazoo Basin are bankfull  or slightly out of banks. There is con siderable flooding of low-lying farmlands,  but with a  few exceptions most home~  are still out of water and people are not  evacuating.  On the plus, or good side of the situa tion, the river should crest at Vicksburg  February 7 and start falling, and if the  heavy  local  rainstorms of March and  April last year are not experienced this  year, the :flood situation in the Missis sippi Delta will be troublesome but not  extremely serious. We need good weather  and a falling river to dry out the ground  for spring planting.  The present high crest in the Missis sippi River comes  from unseasonable  early snow melt in the upper basin and  the Ohio, so we are getting rid of some  water that could otherwise have hit us  all at once in the early spring, when the  danger of flood  is at its annual maxi mum.  The district organizations of the Corps  of Engineers in the lower valley are con centrating on flood preparedness, and re pairing damages to flood control struc tures.  So it is clear that the budget submitted  to the Congress is going to have to be very  carefully examined to see if it provides  the money to do all that should be done,  in view of the seriousness of the situa tion  in  the Mississippi Valley.  The  budget  requests  million  for  the  Mississippi  River  and  tribu taries project. This is an improvement  over the $95 million that was requested  for fiscal 1973 and the $110 million re quested last year. However, it falls short  of the $157 million the Congress felt was  needed and provided last year.  This year the budget asks for $8.5 mil lion for the Yazoo Basin, including $3.5  million for the Yazoo backwater project.  $130  ",1974

Our home was aglow with love and with cheer  And we three had each other so precious and  dear.

Then we kissed each other and each took his  seat-We never had much but our lives were com plete.  Like the fallen snow the tablecloth so white  And  everything around us was heavenly  bright.

5,,93,-0.513,67,3,Mrs. MINK.," Mr. Speaker, as the spon sor of one of two primary bills to facili tate adoption of Vietnamese orphans I  believe the time has come for a full dis cussion through congressional hearings  of the problems facing  these children  and their prospective adoptive parents.  My  personal  correspondence  from  Americans throughout the Nation and  from social workers within Vietnam is  overwhelmingly in favor of speeding the  adoption of these innocent orphans who  still suffer from  the results of a war  which we once considered our highest  national priority.  However, from other branches of this  Government I have received questions  about the general advisability of Viet namese-American adoptions. Over  the  next 3 days I am presenting a  list of  these points and rebuttals from  ''The  Children,"" a book on Asian-American  adoptions written in 1969 by Jan de Har tog.  I am most grateful to Atheneum  Publishers  for granting permission  to  reprint these copyrighted excerpts:  SOME COMMON OBJECTIONS TO THESE  ADOPTIONS  (By Jan de Hartog)  1. ""ADOPTION IS NOT THE SOLUTION""  I  The first  time I heard this one was  in  Saigon, during the summer of 1967. I had  just come back  to  the hotel, sick  to my  stomach after visiting my first Vietnamese  orphanage, haunted as I  entered the lobby  by the faces o! dying infants in iron cots  and by the vision of hundreds of toddlers ly ing apathetically on the hot concrete of the  courtyard in the scorching sun, some mas turbating in vacant boredom, one lapping his  own urine to slake his thirst. On my way to  the elevator a war correspondent whom I had  met the day before invited me for a. drink in  the bar.  had to do something to banish  those  images from my mind;  thls was as good a  diversion as any. I followed him into the bar,  crowded with officials and officers;  there he  introduced me to a man in his early forties,  a government social worker whom I shall call  Andrew Hopkins. The  three of us had a  drink together and  talked about the war,  the sufferings of the civilians, especially the  children;  soon  found myself  telling  the  two men in terms that must have been fairly  emotional what I had seen that afternoon.  They listened courteously; wnen I had fin ished, the correspondent said, ""I can imagine  that what you saw must have upset you, but  let me tell you that the place you have seen  is nohing compared to  .  .  ."" and he men tioned an orphanage in another part of the  city.  ""You are upset because you're new  here,"" he added. ""Once you have been in  Vietnam for a  few weeks you'll see  things  more objectively.""  ""But I don't want to see the suffering of  these children objectively,"" I protested. ""Only  by looking at it subjectively can I hope to  keep the sense of urgency I'll need if I want  to get some of them out.""  ""How do you mean, out?"" Hopkins asked.

6,,93,-0.396,80,3,Mr. PATMAN.," Mr. Speaker, when Sar gent Shriver served as the director of  the Office of Economic Opportunity, he  told me that credit unions were one of  the most effective  tools in the war on  poverty. He pointed out that low-income  credit unions were helping many fam ilies  to better themselves and had en couraged habits of thrift where none had  existed before.  Among the most outstanding low-in come credit unions in the country are  those .operating in Washington, D.C. AI -though these credit unions received some  .Government funding t.o help meet man _ag~al expenses, all of the lending funds  were achieved through member savings  and shortly even the subsidized mana gerial funds will be withdrawn in a plan  to enable credit unions  t.o operate en tirely on their own.  The December 4 issue of the Washing ton Post carried an outstanding article  about the low-income credit unions in  Washington. Rather than place the arti cle in the RECORD at the close of the first  session, where because of the press of  closing business it might be overlooked  by Members, I have withheld the inser tion of the article until  t.oday so that  every Member will have the opportunity  to read the article. Hopefully it will lead  t.o additional low-income credit unions  in other congressional districts through out the country:  NEIGHBORHOOD CREDIT UNIONS Am POOR  IN CITY  (By Barbara Bright-Sagnier)  Last year Amiel Summers lost his job. For  10 months he and his family lived off savings  while. he  learned  the real estate business.  Then money ran out. The rent was overdue  and his first commission from a house he'd  sold would not come through until Decem ber.  ""Last year I'd been helping underprivileged  people solve their problems,"" said Summers,  50, previously a counselor for Training Corp.  of America, a  Job Corps contractor. ""This  year-ker-plunk-I found myself with prob lems of my own.""  Summers knew he couldn't get a loan from  a bank or loan company. ""I'm strictly on  commission,"" he said, ""and no one was in terested in how productive I'd been in the  pa.st had I gone to a conventional lender, it  just wasn't there.""  But from the People's United Community  Credit Union, Summers, who lives at 1815  Kalorama. Rd. NW., got a. loan for $250 to pay  his overdue rent. He will repay it in 12 in stallments at 12 per cent interest prorated  monthly on the unpaid balance, or $22.21  per month.  Amiel Summers ls one of thousands of Dis trict residents who have turned for financial  a.id to the 10 community savings and lending  cooperatives that are part of Washington's  American Federation of Community Credit  Unions.  Traditional banking and lending organiza tions have long held that low-income wage  earners are a bad credit risk, said William G.  White, managing director of the D.C. Credit  Union League, Inc. ""The poor are generally  forced  to pay higher interest rates if they  want to borrow money,"" he said.  It was to remedy this situation, said White,  that the Credit Union National Administra tion broadened its charter base in 1964  to  allow for  the establishment of community  credit unions.  Most credit unions-financial cooperatives  that do business only with their members ha ve been set up in industry, government,  business or commerce, said White, and the  common bond of their members had been  where they were employed.  Community credit unions, on  the other  hand, drew their membership from the res idents of a single neighborhood. In 1965 the  Office of Economic Opportunity struck on the  community credit union idea as a method  to alleviate poverty in inner-city neighbor hoods. By channeling OEO funds through the  District's anti-poverty agency,  the United  Planning Organization, 9 community credit  unions were set  1p. With  the addition of  Peoples' United, the newest financial cooper ative, the number grew to 10.  ",1974
7,House,93,-0.347,93,3,Mr. HANNA.," Mr. Speaker, I take this  opportunity  to make  some  remarks  about the announcement in the news paper this morning that I will not be  seeking reelection.  I would like to make three points, if I  may, under this 1-minute speech;  the  first one is directed to the Members. I  hope to see each of the Members indi vidually to tell them how badly my de cision weighs upon me because I will be  leaving so many good friends.  . Mr. Speaker, I shall also admonish the  Members that in the future what I think  they will need more than my presence is  their sense of humor. With all the losses  we have had in the cowitry, the least we  can afford  is the loss of our sense of  humor which is so finely nurtured and  sustained.   Second, I would like to make the point,  Mr. Speaker, that I appreciate the ef forts of  the wonderful people  in and  about  this Capitol who have  the  re sponsibility for the care and feeding of  Congressmen. I direct this  to my own  staff, which is a wonderful group of dedi cated people, to those in the offices of  other Members, and to the many others  around here, both in this great room and  in the many other places where Con gressmen perform their duties. They are  a  sustaining, helpful group of people  who have made being a Congressman  worthwhile. They are going to be missed  by me, I am sure, even more than some of  the individual friends I have made.  The third point, Mr. Speaker, is di rected to the new Members who are going  to be coming into this House. My an nouncement is hallmarked by a complete  lack of uniqueness, since  I  anticipate  there are going to be a lot of new Mem bers.  I would like to say that when I  first  came to Congress, I made a predfotion in  my district that no one would come to  me and say, ""Thank God, young man,  you are here."" And that was very true.  It is equally predictable now that there  are not going to be a lot of people say ing, ""Please do not leave."" So there is a  humility about being in service here.  When I came to Washington, I put a  lot of time and energy into finding out  what was going on and some additional  effort into trying to fit in.  To those who will be in the new group  next January, they should put all their  time and attention into finding out what  is going on. If they find out, they will not  have to worry about fitting in, because  they will have already reached the elite  group in this House.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that during the  remaining period of my service I can  be of some assistance to my fellow Con gressmen and to this House and to my  district, and it is with great sorrow that  I have made the decision not to be one  of those who will be sitting here in the  next Congress.

Mr. Chairman,  rise  in  opposi tion  to  the amendment and  in sup port of H.R. 11864,  the Solar Heating  and Cooling Demonstration Act  and  urge its adoption. I believe that it offers  real hope for a practical and viable alter nate source of energy and opens an ave nue for at least partial solution of our  energy crisis.  During the past 5 days, I have been 1n  northwest  Iowa discussing  the many  issues which confront us with the people  I have the honor to represent in Con gress.  In many question and answer  sessions and personal interviews in 10  of the 22 counties which make up the  Sixth District, I found the energy short age to be uppermost in the minds of my  constituents. They are convinced  that  our Nation must rapidly develop alter nate sources of energy  to relieve our  present dependence on petroleum. es pecially oil imparted from foreign coun tries. They expressed great interest 1n  solar  energy  as  one  such  alternate  source, and encouraged me to press for  the speedy adoption of H.R. 10810. a bill  whose introduction I cosponsored with  the gentleman from Ohio <Mr. VANIK)  I  9,  1973,  similar  or any  on October  legislation.  Inasmuch u  the bill now before us  includes provisions closely correspond ing to H.R. 10810, I am confident from  these recent discussions that the people  of northwest Iowa would want me to give  it my wholehearted support today.  H.R. 10810 would authorize and direct  the Secretary of Commerce to study ap plications of solar energy, establish a  system of grants for solar energy re search, and establish the solar energy  data bank. This bill was referred to the  House Science and Astronautics Com mittee's Subcommittee on Energy. On  October 23, I cosponsored with the chair man of the Energy Subcommittee <Mr.  McCORMACK)  and other colleagues  the  introduction of H.R. 11056, a bill to pro vide for the early commercial demon stration of the technology of solar heat ing by  the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration  in  cooperation  with the National Bureau of Standards,  the National Science Foundation,  the  Secretary of Housing and Urban Devel opment,  and other Federal  agencies,  and for the early development and com mercial demonstration of technology for  combined solar heating and cooling.  On November 3,  I  called upon  the  House Science and Astronautics Commit tee to expedite action on these proposals.  I pointed out the need for early action  on this legislation which would provide  for a $50 million multiagency program to  develop and produce solar heating and  cooling units for thousands of American  private and public buildings during the  next 5 years. Enactment of this legisla tion would enable installation of solar  heating and cooling units in about 2,000  residences on military and other Fed eral property and in about 2,000 private  residences in order to demonstrate the  use of solar energy as a means of heating  and cooling the average American home.  Mobile homes, apartments. and  town houses would be included in this .com mercial  demonstration. The  also  provided for research, development, and  demonstration of heating and cooling of  commercial and industrial buildings with  solar energy,  The project would demonstrate that  we can put the Sun to work for us now,  providing a critically needed and vir tually inexhaustible source of clean en ergy for heating and cooling for homes  and public buildings.

Although the initial research, testing,  and monitoring will be done by Federal agen cies, the overall program is to encourage the  use of solar energy by the average American  homeowner and to help create a viable pri vate enterprise solar heating and cooling in dustry. We must lose no time in getting solar  energy legislation enacted into law and ln  getting  these demonstrations  imple mented.  fully  I  However,  believed  that still other  approaches,  through  legislation before  other committees, could also prove to be  of value in promoting research, development, and utilization of solar energy de vices. On December 20, I  therefore in troduced H.R. 12064, the Solar Energy  Act of 1973, which was referred to the  House Committee on Banking and Cur rency. As  I  explained  in a  statement  made December 26, my bill would au thorize Federal housing agencies to in crease ceilings on home mortgages where  the homeowner  utilizes  solar  energy  heating or cooling devices.  In spite of  limited funding  for  re search and development, solar devices to  heat homes and water and to cool homes  have been perfected to function through out the country year-round. A major ob stacle in preventing installation are the  present ceilings on housing loans made,  insured, guaranteed, supplemented or as sisted by the Farmers Home Administra tion,  the Federal Housing AClministra tion, and other Federal agencies, or by  lenders whose deposits or accounts are  insured by a Federal agency or which is  regulated by a Federal agency.  H.R. 12064 directs  the Secretary of  Commerce to conduct research into how  solar energy can be used effectively and  feasibly  to heat and cool buildings in  various  regions of  the United States.  The Secretary would also develop and  test new building designs and construc tion methods  utilizing  solar  energy  equipment and prescribe standards and  specifications for such design and con struction, after consulting with Federal  agencies engaged in housing and build ing regulation, wlth National Aeronau tics and Space Administration and the  National Science Foundation, as well as  the construction industry.  H.R. 12064 would also enable a pros pective homeowner who is interested in  utilizing solar energy devices which meet  such standards to have the maximum  on his Federal housing loan increased by  the amount that the cost of utilizing  such a device exceeds the cost of utiliz ing conventional building design or con struction methods. This should provide  considerable incentive for increasing di version  from  conventional  fuel-eating  heating and cooling systems to a virtu ally inexhaustible source-the sun. This  proposal,  pending  before  the House  Banking and Currency Committee, was  complementary to the solar energy bills  before  the House Science and Astro nautics Committee and the various tax incentive proposals before  the House  Ways and Means Committee.  In the meantime, the Energy Subcom mittee under its able chairman <Mr. Mc CORMACK) held hearings on November 13,  14, and 15, on the various solar energy  bills before it, including the bills I had  cosponsored-23 witnesses from Federal  agencies, private enterprise and uni versities, as well as environmental and  consumer groups, all generally supported  the concept of this legislation and oft.en  were quite enthusiastic. The testimony  and statements from others provided a.  valuable source of excellent ideas, many  of which the subcommittee incorporated  into the final version of the bill, H.R.  11864, the bill now before the House.

18,,93,-0.384,223,3,Mr. ROONEY of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, it is indeed fitting that as we  all paid tribute this past Tuesday, Febru ary 12, to Abraham Lincoln we include  a similar homage to the equally beloved  and  illust1ious patriot Gen. Thaddeus  Kosciuszko.  Both  these  true  heroes  served America with distinction  in  its  hours of greatest need. Both were of high  courage and po.ssessed deep moral con victions; both were dedicated to the task  of serving their fellow men without res ervation as to race, creed, or national  origin.  President Lincoln sought in vain  to  prevent the sundering of our Nation over  the question of slavery;  then devoted  himself to the task of binding up  the  Nation's wounds after  tragic years of  brothers fighting against brothers. Gen eral Kosciuszko fought valiantly to help  American patriots  to  free  themselves  from the yoke of British rule and to es tablish themselves as a free and inde pendent nation.  So it is that on the birthday of these  great men we cannot honor one without  honoring the other. Lincoln gained the  name  of  the  ""Great Emancipator.""  Kosciuszko justly deserves the name of  ""Great Liberator,"" for the role he played  in aiding Gen. George Washington and  the Continental Army in defeating the  vastly  superior  forces  of  the British  crown.  We honored Abraham Lincoln  last  Tuesday for his deep compassion for the  enslaved black man and for his constant  efforts to liberate all those in bondage.  We honor General Kosciuszko  for his  great humanitarian act of  requesting  Thomas Jefferson to dispose of his Amer ican possessions to buy the freedom of  slaves and to provide them with educa tion and adequate  training  to become  good neighbors, good fathers and moth ers, and good husbands and wives  in  order that they might become defenders  of their own freedom and the freedom  of their country.  Whereas Lincoln was born in a  log  cabin desperately poor and with  little  opportunity for formal education, Ko sciuszko was born of reasonably well-to do parents and access  to  the best  in  formal education and military training.  Neither was deterred either by poverty  or by affiuence from developing in child hood the highest in moral values and a  dedication to service to mankind. Both  had deep loyalties to their own commit ments and great allegiance to their fel low  citizens, yet both  recognized  the  shortcomings of their governments and  dedicated themselves to the elimination  of these defeats.  Abraham Lincoln's fervor for freedom  and the liberation of his fellow Ameri cans really was not manifested until he  became a man and was plunged into the  great political issues of his days, whereas  young Thaddeus Kosciuszko even as an  adolescent boy possessed a keen discern ment of right and wrong plus an un swerving determination to do something  about the wrongs he encountered. Thus,  it was that before he came of age he  was  thrust  into  the  leadership of his  fellow countrymen who were fighting to  prevent the dismemberment of his be loved Poland by Russia, Prussia, and  Austria. For his zeal and fearless efforts  he was exiled from his native land by  the Czarist regime which exercised cruel  dominion over his homeland.  It is  small wonder  that Kosciuszko  with his passion for freedom so great,  found it easy to adopt the cause of the  American patriots as his own; easy for  him to take a ship for America and off er  his services to Gen. George Washington  and the Continental Congress who ac cepted him with alacrity. No single officer  and no American-born citizen contrib uted more to the successful winning of  our war of independence than did this  skillful and dedicated Polish officer. His  engineering accomplishments were both  timely and lasting. He shared the dis appointments and the bitter hardships  that befell the undisciplined, ill-fed, and  ill-clothed Continental Army. So dear  were his passions for freedom and so ef fective were his efforts to gain America's  independence, Thomas Jefferson referred  to him as ""the purest son of liberty I  have ever known.""  Mr. Speaker, in much the same manner  in which the Congress on October 13,  1783, showed General Kosciuszko its own  and  the Nation's appreciation of his  magnificent service by awarding him full  American citizenship, a land grant, and  promotion to the rank of brigadier gen eral, I feel all of us in this body should  show once again this Nation's gratitude  by expressing anew our personal appre ciation of this revered patriot and friend.  He is truly worthy of the type of honor  with which we  acclaim our beloved  Abraham Lincoln on this the birthday of  both. In these dark days when we en counter so many distressing examples  of greedy and self-serving public serv ants, it is indeed refreshing to all of us  to recall the selfiess and dedicated serv ice which  these two great heroes per f armed in our behalf-services performed  without  thought of monetary gain or  rewards, but wholly motivated by love of  country and the preservation of the joy ous freedom of mankind from tyranny  and oppression.  THIS IS A FARMER  HON. DAWSON MATHIS  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 7, 1974  ",1974
19,,93,-0.04,223,3,Mr. MATHIS of Georgia.,"  Mr.  Speaker, as our society becomes increas ingly  urbanized  and  the American  farmer becomes  increasingly  removed  from our everyday lives, the inevitable  result has been that the farmer is too  often misunderstood, or worse yet, sim ply ignored.  In January,  I had  the privilege of  meeting with a dynamic group of young  farmers  in  south Georgia  and was  handed a copy of an article which  I  think reveals something about the com plexity and humbleness of  the great  farming profession. So that we will not  take the farmers for granted, I am in serting the text of  the article  in the  RECORD:  THIS Is A FARMER.  (Author Unknown)  Farmers are found  in fields plowing up,  seeding down, returning from, planting to,  fertilizing with, spraying for and harvesting  if. Wives help them, little boys follow them,  the Agriculture Department confuses them,  city  relatives visit  them, salesmen detain  them, meals wait for them, weather delays  them, but it takes Heaven to stop them.  When your car stalls along  the way, a  farmer is a considerate, courteous, inexpen sive road service. When a farmer's wife sug gests he buy a new suit, he can quote from  memory every expense involved in operating  the farm last year, plus the added expense  he is certain will crop up next year. Or else he  assumes the role of the indignant shopper,  impressing upon  everyone within earshot  the pounds of pork he must produce in or der to pay for a suit at today's prices.  A farmer is a paradox-he is an ""overalled""  executive with his home his office; a scientist  using fertilizer attachments;  a purchasing  agent in an old straw hat; a personnel direc tor with grease under his  :finger nails;  a  dietitian with a passion for alfalfa, animals  and antibiotics; a production expert faced  with a  surplus; and a manager battling a  price-cost squeeze. He manages more capital  than most of the businessmen in town.  He likes sunshine, good food, state fairs,  dinner at noon, auctions, his neighbors, Sat urday nights in town, his shirt collar unbut toned, and above all a good soaking rain  in August.  He is not much for droughts, ditches, west  Georgia tollroads, experts, weeds, the eight hour day, helping with the housework, or  grasshoppers.  Nobody else can remove all those things  from his pocket and on washday still have  overlooked:  :five ""steeples,"" one cotter key,  a rusty spike, three grains of corn, the stub  end of a lead pencil, a square tape, a $4.98  pocket watch, and a cupful of chaff in each  trouser cuff.  A farmer is both Faith and Fatalist-he  must have  faith  to continually meet  the  challenges of his capacities amid an ever present possibility that an act of God  (a  late spring, an early  frost,  tornado,  flood,  drought) can bring his business to a stand stm. You can reduce his allotments but you  can't restrain his ambition.  Might as well put up with him-he is your  friend, your competitor, your customer, your  source of  food and  fiber, and self-reliant  young citizens to help replenish your cities.  He is your countryman-a denim dressed,  business-wise  fast-growing  statesman  of  stature.  And when he comes in at noon having  spent the energy of his hopes and dreams,  he can be recharged a.new with the magic  words: ""The Market's Up.""  ",1974
20,,93,-0.171,236,3,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker, under  leave  to  ext.end my  remarks  in  the  RECORD,  include my newslett.er,  as  follows:  I  THE PRESIDENT'S PROGRAM-(PART I)  The President's State of the Union address  and his budget message are the most impor tant documents he sends to the Congress.  Together they outline the President's views  on the needs of the country and what he  thinks should be done about them. The Con gress received both messages this week, and  this and next week's newsletter will comment  on them.  In my view President Nixon's State of the  Union address was one of his better addresses.  He spoke boldly, stressed peace, prosperity  and hope, projected the image of an active,  energetic leader, set forth a sound national  agenda, and declared that he  intended to  lead for three more years. It was not an easy  speech for him to deliver (the most impor . tant of his career, he later said) and one had  to admire his capacity to deliver the speech  before Congress and a nation that had strong  doubts about his leadership.  The highlights of the speech were:  Watergate:  ""One year of Watergate  enough.""  Economy: No recession and no new taxes.  Budget: Expenditures $304.4 billion, reve nues $295 billion, with a $9.4 billion deficit.  Energy: Self-sufficiency by 1980.  Health: A comprehensive health insurance  program.  .  Welfare: An income floor with . emphasis  on cash assistance.  Privacy: A review of abuses by government  and the private sector.  To  strong applause  the P1esident said,  ""One year of Watergate ls enough."" One day  of it ls too much, of course, but the ques tions surrounding the series of crimes and  unethical conduct known as Watergate can not be put to rest by the Congress in a gov ernment of law, as Senator Mansfield sug gested. More investigations, indictments and  trials lie ahead, and they are the province  of the courts. not Congress. As for impeach ment, it is a Constitutional process that has  now begun and cannot be abandoned.  The President's budget  the first $300  billion budget in the nation's history. Presi dent Nixon submitted his first $200 billion  budget only four years ago, which suggests  is  ls  in  increase  government  the  astounding  spending.  A striking difference of tone is noticeable  on the economy between the State of the  Union speech, as delivered, and the written  message on the State of the Union. In his  speech the President stated boldly, ""There  will be no recession."" But in the written mes sage his assessment  ls more cautious. He  acknowledges an economic slow-down in 1974,  and emphasizes  the economic uncertainty  the nation confronts with the twin dangerl!t  of recession and inflation. He pleads for the  flexibility to deal with both and it is apparent  that his economic policy for 1974 will be de termined by the status of the economy, and  whether it is  tending  toward recession or  inflation.  He did express his dissatisfaction with di rect controls over prices and wages, but there  were no new approaches to inflation. the na tion's most pernicious economic problem. At a  time when many persons are seriously ques tioning  the policy of continued economic  growth, the President argued, rightly I be lieve, for increased production.  Most State of the Union addresses, includ ing this one, sound more like cheerleading  than an assessment of the nation's strength  and weaknesses. Some day I hope to see a  President confident enough of his leadership  to speak with more candor. The Wall Street  Journal commented editorially this week, ""We  yearn for a State of the Union message that  admits failures as well as boasting of suc cesses."" The result of the lack of candor is  that people find no real relationship between  what  they are experiencing and what the  President  is describing as the State of the  Union. It is hard to persuade Americans that  they never had it so good, when they have  lost  jobs because of  the energy shortage,  formed  long  lines at the gas stations and  found shortages in high prices at the grocery  store.  The President's message contained no sur prises, and proposes, as previously indicated,  two pieces of major social legislation: com prehensive health insurance with protection  against catastrophic illness, and welfare re form featuring an income floor in cash as sistance. He proposed  these  reforms with  no additional  taxes, which will be a neat  trick if he can pull it off.  Although there was a touch of irony that  the man who  taped  the conversations of  visitors to his office without their knowledge  should lead a crusade for individual privacy,  his strong plea for controls on invasion of  privacy was an important initiative in the  speech and deserves support in this day of  awesome electronic eavesdropping capabili ties and computerized data banks of infor mation about individuaLc;.

21,,93,0.272,236,3,Mr. HUNT.," Mr. Speaker, I call to your  attention a letter written by a constit uent of mine questioning the wisdom of  the Watergate investigation. While not  condoning the affair, Mr. Albert would  11ke to see the Congress get on with the  major issues confronting our Nation:  COLLINGSWOOD, N.J.,  February ~ 1974.  NIXON BEING PERSECU~ED?  To the Editor:  I don't know whether President Nixon is  guilty .of the crimes imputed to him. But I  am willing . to -believe him  innocent until  proven guilty. Isn't that the American way?  Amid all the clamor for resignation and  impeachment, I smell political profit. Those  yelling the .loudest for -Nixon's hide are ad vancing their. own int;erest.s;  they are fully  aware that their remarks will get free radio  and TV. coverage. A look into their ""closets""  would net us many e, skeleton hiding there,  we would wager.    I found it particularly obnoxious that the  clamor got even louder during the past sev eral crisis-filled weeks. The world ""is on  fire""-a man who is still our president, try ing to make momentous decisions, is harassed  by a bunch of ""me-tooers."" The horn blow ers in Washington reminded me of a  lynch  mob out for blood. We need water to quench  the fire, but we wol}'t find it in Watergate.  I call for a moratorium on Watergate until  the Mideast crisis is over. It is the utmost  folly to delude ourselves that Israel is just a  Jewish question. In a nuclear a.ge every flare up should be of grave concern lest someone  push that fatal button. It's simply a. matter  of survival.    Incidentally, Mr. Nix~ns excellent han dling of the crisis gave the  lie  to  the  prophets of doom who were so sure he could  not govern under pressure. He did a better  job than anyone I could think of. So I say,  ""Good luck, Mr. President. May you continue  to give us more of such leadership.""  .  a.11  MICHAEL ALBERT,  LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY FEBRUARY 16, 1974  HON. JOHN J.

22,,93,-0.514,249,3,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker. with all  the debate going on over the failures of  the present welfare system, it is hearten ing  to note  that James R. Dumpson,  dean of the Fordham University Gradu ate School of Social Service, has been aP pointed Human Resources Administrator  of New York City.  Throughout his career, Jim Dumpson  has committed himself to improving the  quality of social services and the de livery of  these services  to  the public.  Both  in and out of government, Jim  Dumpson has stood for the concept that  things can be better. His sensitivity to  the needs of the poor, coupled with his  experience as Director of the Bureau of  Child Welfare  and Welfare Commis sioner, guarantee that he will continue  11is fight to overhaul the welfare system  and make it work. He will also be giving  high priority to the development of job  opportunities-an  especially  critical  task in view of the exodus of many bttsi nesses from New York City.  I would  like  to share with my col leagues  an  article  on Commissioner  Dumpson.  The article follows:  MAN IN THE NEWS: JAMES R. DUMPSON: TOP  MAN AT WELFARE  (By Stephen Gayle)  On Monday morning, the man who was  the second black commissioner in the history  of the city will once more head downtown,  this time to a world where color has ceased  to be spot news; and in his characteristically  softspoken style, he will begin to take apart  the most elaborate of  the edifices created  during  the Lindsay era-the Human Re sources Administration.  u1 don't like the word 'dism.antle,' .. James  Russell Dumpson, Mayor Beame's new HRA  commissioner, said this week in his office on  the Manhattan campus of Fordham Univer sity, where he has been dean of the Graduate  School of Social Service.  ""I'd :mther say reorganize or realign. Dis mantle could mean that the pieces are going  to be done away with-and rm not sure of  that at this point.'' (The HRA Will pay $43,255  a.. year. and even after the present agency is  no. more, Dumpson is expected to retain the  Welfare Commissionership.)  There is one thing Dumpson can be sure  of, though: the trip from his Fifth Av. coop erative apartment on the fringe of Harlem  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to the HR.A office at 250 Church St. won't be  just another subway ride to the latest in a  long chain of increasingly better jobs. It wm  be the most challenging in a 40-year career  spent trying to help poor people enter the  mainstream of American life. And it will also  add another to the growing tally of Bea.me  appointments from the ranks of Wagner Ad ministration officials.  ""I prefer to think of myself as the head,  or sculptor if you will, of a real social service  delivery system,"" Dumpson said. ""The Mayor  indicated during his campaign that he was  going to take the superagencies apart-and  I'm in agreement with him. The administra tive spread  is  too enormous for one indi vidual.  ""The superagency concept is very sound,  but not for New York. It breeds an adminis trative distance between the commissioner  and the chief executive of the city, and if I'm  running a program I want to know what the  Mayor thinks. And I don't want to know it  through an administrator.""  James Dumpson is an acknowledged expert  in the field of social welfare. In 1959, when  Mayor Wagner named him Welfare Commis sioner (the salary then was $22,500), he be came the first black man in the country to  head a major social agency and the second  in New York to head a city department. (The  first was Water Supply Commissioner Ford.)  ""At times, it was a very lonely business,"" the  quietly elegant Dumpson recalls, pursing his  lips.  The  importance of ""supportive environ ment"" is something well understood by the  new commissioner. One of five children, he  was born April 5, 1909,  in a. Philadelphia  ghetto so riddled by poverty it was called  Hell's Half-Acre. When he was 12, the fam ily .moved to West Philadephia, 4'where we  were not overcrowded and there was  true  neighborliness.  ""We were poor,'' he said, ""but we were  part of a. closely knit community where an  the parents cared about everybody's chil dren. We were nestled in, and there was a  sense of sharing the goodies, no matter how  limited they were.''  Perhaps this is when Dumpson's lifelong  drive to help others, and especially childre~  was born.  ""I had an advantage,"" Dumpson  con tinued, ""that hundr.eds of other black kids  in my neighborhood didn't have: a mother  who was a. schoolteacher and a father who  had a.  full-time  job, as a bank messenger.  I can't tell you how important that is.''  Like his mother, Dumpson planned  to  teach and he enrolled at Temple University,  earning most of his  tuition by working  summers as a waiter at a hotel in Cape  May, N.J. But the stock market crash of  '29 had the effect of reducing tips. so Dump son transferred to the then-all-black Cheney  State Teacher's College, which was run by  Quakers and cheaper to attend. There, he  was elected president of his class and play ed organ for chapel services. He graduated  in 1932, but the experience at Cheney had  given him much more than a degree.  ""I didn't know anything about black cul ture before  I went  to Cheney,"" Dumpson  said, observing that his image of ""militancy""  is recently acquired. ""There, I had an op portunity  to become acquainted with my  past and it was  the beginning of solving  my identity crisis. I could have easily be come  separated  from my people and my  community.''  After college, Dumpson taught five years  in a segregated school  in Oxford, Pa., but  he was discouraged by the lack of intellec tual stimulation. Returning to Philadelphia.  in 1937, he went  to work  for  the Public  Assistance Dept. and soon became a super viso;t at $1620 a year.  ~t was  the beginning of Dumpson's  social work career, and the dawning of the  realization that administration was no bed  3043  of roses. Welfare recipients organized in the  Workers Alliance, and to protest the drop ping of one of their number from the re lief rolls, they would lock Dumpson in his  office overnight.  In 1940, stm wanting to work with chil dren, Dumpson came to New York to be a  caseworker for  the Children's Aid Society.  ""I changed jobs for a difference of $60 more  a year,'' he said with a smile. In 1947, Dump son went to work for the Community Coun cil of Greater New York. Eight years later,  he became  the director of the Bureau of  Child Welfare, a post which led to the Wag ner appointment.  Almost  immediately,  the  short,  slightly  built, bespectacled commissioner was thrust  into controversy when he tried some innova tions,  and  these  days, when  a  problem  arises, he leafs through a scrapbook o! clip pings and digs out a parallel from the past.  ""We were  just a  inept in the Dumpson  era as we are now,'' he laughed. ""Whenever  I hear about 'relief-chiselers' or the inspec tor-general  [the state's examiner of  local  welfare operations] sounding off, I go back  and it's all there.''  The  six years he  served under Wagner  were often tempestuous, and Dumpson re members  the  then-State Senate majority  leader, Walter Mahoney, as ""one of my arch  antagonists. The World-Telegram came out  with an editorial 'Dump Dumpson,' and the  Daily Mirror was relentless in its attack on  welfare. I was the great public philanthro pist.''  Indeed,  shO'rtly before  he was  named  commissi-0ner, one editorial warned him to  open his eyes to the morals of relief clients,  .citing  ""ladies having babies by  assorted  gentlemen so as to keep  the relief checks  growing fatter every year.""  1961, Dumpson recalled, ""was my big year I was raising all kinds of Cain. That was the  year I was fighting the welfare legislation the  state had put in when they tried to pass a  residence requirement for public assistance.  I've always been unalterably opposed to that,  and every time a bill was proposed, I was out  advocating against it.''  In 1962, Dumpson, who  is a Catholic,  ""started talking about the need for family  planning services to be incorporated in my  department. That was  an anathema ...  people said it was revolutionary for a We,1fare Commissioner to do that.''  By 1965, Dumpson had :aad his fill, what  with the White Citizens' Councils of Georgia  and Mississippi paying the fare for Jobless  blacks to bring their fam111es  to the ""wel fare paradise"" in New York, and the strikes  by caseworkers and Social Services security  personnel. When Dumpson told Wagner he  was going to resign, he said, ""I want to live,  not get sick.''  The next years were spent on campus, first  as professor and associate dean at the Hunter  College School of Social Work and,  from  1967 until now, dean and professor at Ford ham. They were busy years, teaching, lectur ing and consultantships in various areas of  s-ocial welfare.  Last week there was a quiet farewell party  for Dumpson  in  his  seventh-floor  office  decorated with art collected on his  travels  in Asia and the Middle East. In the corridor  outside,  a  group of Fordham  sophomores  described  their relationship with  the man  they considered to be their friend as wen as  their teacher.  ""We're so special  to him,"" said Marilyn  Bartlett, ""that last night he chose to have  dinner with us instead of Mayor Beame.""

23,,93,0.035,288,3,Mr. BIESTER.," Mr. Speaker, despite  a massive  infusion of basic foodstuffs  and other forms of assistance into the  drought-stricken areas of central Africa,  the famine continues to spread and take  its toll. The grain shortage has destroyed  livelihoods and has taken hundreds of  thousands of lives in past months with  prospects for relief which are less than  encouraging. The situation increasingly  and progressively worsens, and interna tional relief efforts-of both a short-and  long-range nature-are frustrated by the  magnitude of the problem.  For the benefit of my colleagues who  may have missed a timely update of what  is occurring in the Sahel and other areas  of drought-ravaged Africa, I am insert ing into the RECORD a recent Washington  Post article on this tremendously diffi cult question:  AFRICAN DROUGHT SPREADS-U.S. FOOD GOES,  BUT LONG-TERM Am Is STALLED  (By David B. Ottaway)  The worst drought of the century 1n West  Africa.  is  continuing  unabated,  and  in  Ethiopia, where  thousands died  last year  from  famine,  the  situation  is  steadily  worsening.  International relief agencies and African  leaders are warning of mass starvation later  this year if preventive steps are not taken  in the next few months.  American black groups and U.S. church  relief organizations have been beating on  congressional doors  to  indicate  their high  interest  in  the situation. and  the United  States has become the largest food donor to  meet the stricken regions' pressing immedi ate needs.  But U.S. officials concede that Washington  has so far been far more reserved about com mitting itself to long-term development aid  projects to get at the drought area's funda mental problems.  Reports  indicate  that  conditions  have  worsened 1n four of the six West African  countries already seriously affected last year.  For  the  first  time,  the drought has also  reached crisis proportions  in the northern  regions of Nigeria and Cameroon.  In East Africa., the drought is spreading in  Ethiopia and now  is a  serious problem 1n  neighboring Kenya.  The West African intergovernmental relief  coordinator, Upper Voltan Agricultural MinEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ister Antoine Dak.oure, is warning that with out fast emergency relief 200,000 people may  die of starvation in remote corners of the  Sahel, the 2,600-mile semi-desert strip across  Africa below the Sahara.  International relief groups estimate that  between 50,000 and 100,000 persons have died  in northern Ethiopia from drought or fam ine-related diseases. No estimate has been  made of the death toll 1n West Africa, but  thousands of nomads are known to have died  last year.  About 2 million persons have been left  destitute by the drought in West Africa and  another 1.2 million have needed emergency  assistance  in Ethiopia, with as many  as  63,000 living in relief camps at one point.  The U.N. Food and Agricultural Organiza tion believes that more than 3.5 million head  of cattle, worth $400 mlllion and about 25  per cent of the total cattle population, per ished last year in the six affected West Afri can  countries-Senegal, Mali, Mauritania,  Niger, Upper Volta and Chad.  Dakoure said that the total grain shortfall  in the West African famine area will be 1.2  million tons this year, compared to 850,000  tons in 1973. He estimated that 660,000 tons  of emergency food will be necessary in the  next few months to prevent a disaster.  FAQ director Addeke Boerm.a, on an 11  nation African tour pressing an appeal for  more international aid, said at a press con ference Jan. 23  in La.gos, Nigeria, that only  about 300,000 tons of food had been promised  and ""practically no money"" was pledged for  the $30 million drought relief fund.  But officials of the U.S. Agency for Inter national Development say here  that about  530,000  tons of grain and foods have been  pledged. according  to  their  reports. They  place the total need for grain and supple mentary high protein foods at about 715,000  tons.  The U.S. government has committed  to  the West African states 350,000 tons of food  grains for the 1974 fiscal year, bringing its  total donations to 500,000 tons, and the value  of  its emergency  relief assistance  to $100  million. over the past 18 months. The U.S.  also has pledged 22,250  tons of grains for  relief efforts in Ethiopia.  The U.S. contribution last year, and again  this year, will be a.bout 40 per cent of all  international  relief  aid  pledged  to  the  stricken West African countries.  Under unusually  intense pressure  from  the black and church communities. Congress  also has approved $25 million for recovery  and rehabilitation programs in West Africa  and has appropriated, although not yet au thorized, another $50 million.  The  drought  has  aroused  enormous  sympathy and concern in the United States.  particularly among American blacks. U.S.  officials say they have not seen such mobiliza tion for an African issue since the civil war  in Nigeria which ended in early 1970.  Africare, a private and largely black 'Wash ington-based organization, has so far raised  $230,000  for  its Famine Relief Fund from  contributions-namely as small as $5 or $10from more than 10,000 persons, according to  program director John Grey.  The  three-year-old group has received a  32,000 grant from AID and $250,000 from the  Lilly Endowment of Indianapolis for drought  relief and recovery programs in the Sahelian  region.  Another New York-based group, Relief for  Africans in Need in the Sahel (RAINS). has  raised $50,000, mostly from black organiza tions and private citizens  throughout  the  country.  As American  involvemnt  in drought re lief and rehabilitation programs grows, so  does concern about how the U.S. government  February 14, 197 4  is spending the $25 million earmarked for  economic recovery programs in West Africa.  Rep. Charles Diggs  (D. Mich.), chairman  of the House Subcommittee on Africa and  author of  the amendment for $25 million  in  recovery assistance,  toured West Africa  last December with a  congressional group  and has since called on the U.S. government  to support a  ""major,  long-term"" economic  development program for the six countries.  Robert E. Bates, an aide to Sen. Edward  Kennedy  (D-Mass.)  and a member of the  touring congressional group, criticized  the  U.S. relief and recovery program as being too  preoccupied by a  ""cost-benefit  ratio"" ap proach toward helping people there.  ""We're not spending anything on ways to  make this area viable,"" Bates said. ""Every body will go along with providing food, but  the governments there realize they need more  than just shipments of grain, and our gov ernment hasn't made up its mind to respond  to these kinds of needs.""  AID officials counter  that  the  first pri ority has been to improve the West African  governments' ab1lity  to deal with  the im mediate crisis and ""to do the maximum pos sible  to avoid another costly airlift,"" such  as was necessary last summer to send food  to isolated towns and starving nomads.  Most of the $25 million in recovery assist ance is going into schemes to increase agri cultural production immediately, according  to Fermine J. Spencer, AID's West African  director. ""If the new techniques being used  take hold, it will have an effect that will go  way beyond the next harvest,"" he said.  But AID officials readily admit  they are  taking  a  ""wait-and-see  attitude""  toward  multi-million dollar projects being proposed  to build dams on the Niger and other rivers  elsewhere  in  the drought-affected  region.  They are awaiting a $1 million study of the  region's ""development options"" by a Massa chusetts Institute of Technology team whose  project is not expected to end for two yea.rs.  Present  conditions  in  the  inland West  African states of Chad, Mali and Niger as  well as in Mauritania on the coast generally  are described as grim. Food stocks have been  exhausted and many animals that last year  provided milk and meat  for hundreds of  thousands of nomads and peasants now are  dead.  Only Senegal and Upper Volta are in some what better straits than last year 1n terms  of rains and crops, according to AID officials.  But Senegal has lost 50 per cent of its major  foreign exchange earner, the peanut crop.  In Ethiopia, the U.S. government has ac cepted a United Nations estimate that the  need for emergency  food  relief w111  reach  150,000 tons, of which the Ethiopian govern ment probably will be able to provide less  than 30,000  tons.  Pledges  from  foreign  governments  and  international relief agencies now total about  93,000 tons of food gralns, and the U.S. gov ernment is being pressed to contribute an other 30,000 tons to fill  the gap.  Press reports have questioned whether the  Ethiopian government has done enough for  its starving people and whether the situa tion  is  as  serious  a.s  described  by U.S.  agencies.  AID officials now have reports that the  drought has spread into large areas of south ern and eastern Ethiopia and still is a seri ous problem in the two northern provinces  of Tigre and Wallo, where thousands of peas ants died last year from famine.  This has led AID officials to conclude that  the U.N. 1:1.-gencies' reports are essentially cor rect in their assessment of the need for out side emergency relief.  But one AID official quickly added: ""There  is also stlll a need for the Ethiopian gov ernment to increase the mobilization of its  O'h'll resources.""  ",1974
24,,93,-0.253,301,3,Mr. OWENS.," Mr. Speaker, we are con stantly bombarded with public opinion  polls asking questions on a variety of is sues. Sometimes we tend to overlook their  significance. Two polls rele.ased this past  week, deserve careful consideration. The  latest Harris survey published on Feb ruary 12 shows that Congress popularity  is at an alltime low.  Only 21 percent of those polled feel  that Congress is doing a good to excellent  job in handling the a:ff.airs of the Nation.  On such  issues as  the economy, con fidence in Government, and control of  inflation we received from 6to 11-percent approval. I think these are rather  significant and distmbing statistics.  On February 9 the Deseret News, a  newspaper in S.alt Lake City, published  a Utah poll on the energy situation which  I  think deserves the attention of Con gress. Almost three-fourths of the people  believe that the fuel shortage is con trived. Although  the  blame  for  the  energy crisis  is divided among several  groups, I think we should realize that the  lack of information on the severity and  extent of the cw-rent energy crisis has  provided the general public with no reli able statistics with which to maim their  own conclusion on  the nature of  this  c1isis. It is  time to acquire  the facts.  Only through a close examination and  compilation of all information pertain ing to this crisis will we be able to deter mine the real significance of the situation  and gain the respect and confidence of  the public which desperately needs to be  restored. I submit a copy of the Deseret  News poll for your information:  [From the Deseret News, Feb. 9, 1974]  FUEL CRISIS IS PHONY, UTAHANS  Almost  three-fourths of  the people of  Utah believe the fuel shortage  is phony.  They place most of the ble,me on the oil  companies, politics and government controls.  These are  the central conclusions of a  3095  Deseret News poll conducted by Dan Jones  Associates, of Logan.  Of the 600 persons  interviewed by tele phone in the survey, 74.8 said they feel the  shortage  is ""contrived,"" while 20.2 percent  believe  it  is ""real'', and 5 percent ""don't  know.""  The blame was pinned on the petroleum  companies by 44.8 percent with 17 percent  placing  responsibility on politics  (Water gate) , and 15 percent on government con trols.  ""Public misuse"" was singled out as  the  cause by 7.7 percent, ""underdeveloped r~­ sources"" by 6 percent, ""Arab-Israeli war"" by  4 percerut ""other"" factors by 3.3 percent, and  2.2 percent answered they ""didn't know.""  Interviewers asked two questions: ""Do you  believe that the current fuel shortage is real  or created?"" and ""The current fuel short age is caused by whom?""  The tendency to believe the shortage  is  contrived was overwhelming in almost every  strata of Utah society. The people of South eastern Utah where most oil activity is con centrated were more prone to feel that the  shortage ls real.  In that area 28.3 percent felt the short age is real, while 71.7 believe it was created.  People  in Cache and Box Elder counties  voiced similar opinions.  The  greatest  skepticis!ll was  found  in  Weber, Davis and Salt Lake counties where  less than 17 percent believe the shortage is  genuine. In Salt Lake almost 80 percent feel  it's a hoax.  Peculiarly, there is a rather sharp division  of opinion along religious lines of Catholics  interviewed, 40.5 percent believe the short age is real, while 57.1 percent a.re suspicious.

Salt Lake County displays the least con fidence in the industry's veracity with 52.6  percent placing the blame.  When broken down into age groups, a pe culiar pattern develops  in  the survey.

Referred to the Committee  on Public Works.  FLOOD LOANS  ",1974
27,Senate,93,-0.38,327,3,Mr. EAGLETON.," Mr. President,  the  National Weather Service has reported  that record floods could plague the Na tion again this year. Rainfall is up 75  percent above normal along the Missis sippi River. High tides are threatening  both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The  water level in the Great Lakes  is  the  highest it has been in 200 years.  Last week, in my own State of Missouri,  the Mississippi River was 5 feet over its  banks. The flood  threat exists all  the  way downstream to Louisiana, where the  river also is above its banks. The spring  thaw, coupled with continuing heavy  rain, could create a potentially cata strophic situation affecting hundreds of  thousands of Americans, including those  living in the Missouri-Mississippi flood  plain.  What is particularly distressing about  this situation is that many flood-prone  communities will have  less protection  and assistance than they have had in  previous years. This is a result of two  separate, but related, factors. First, ad ministrative and jurisdictional obstacles  will delay full  implementation of  the  Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973.  which expands the national flood insur ance program. Second, President Nixon  vetoed legislation last year which would  have provided loans to disaster victims at  lower interest rates than are currently  available.  The Flood Disaster Protection Act be came effective on December 31, 1973.  I supported the effort to substitute flood  insurance for costly disaster assistance  programs. The act doubles the amount of  flood  insurance available  to owners of  residential and business properties, but  it requires communities, in turn, to re strict building in flood-prone areas. Pro vided a community adopts those land use restrictions, residents would be eli gible  to buy flood  insurance at a  low  rate of 25 cents per $100 of coverage, with  the Government paying  the other 90  percent of the premium.  To qualify for the flood insurance pro gram, a  flood-prone  community must  certify to HUD's Federal Insurance Ad ministration in Washington that it has  adopted minimum land use measures to  abate damage from future floods. How ever, despite  the recent efforts of FIA  to publicize the flood insurance program  nationwide, certain local conditions pre vail which probably will delay applica tions from some communities for many  months.  Of the 456 flood-prone communities in  the State of Missouri, for instance, only  96 currently are eligible for Federal flood  insurance. I am certain that number will  increase before the spring flood season,  but many will not qualify by then.  One reason for that is that some of  these communities are unincorporated.  Among other things,  that means  they  have no land use authority to regulate  building in the flood plain. The Missouri  State Legislature is currently considering  measures which would permit State au thorities to regulate building in the flood  plain in unincorporated areas, but this  will take time. In the meantime, residents  of these communities are ineligible for  coverage.  Other programs would prevent flood prone communities from applying for the  program in a  timely manner. In some  cases, public notice must be given  order to execute the FIA required reso lution by which  the flood-prone com munity certifies it has adopted minimum  land use standards. In other instances,  both a public notice and hearings are  necessary. In any event, it appears there  will be some unavoidable delays which  neither the community nor the individual  residents can control.  What happens if flooding occurs while  flood-prone  communities  are making  every effort to comply with FIA regula tions? Flood disaster victims who have no  insurance coverage would be eligible only  for 5-percent interest loans with no for giveness features.  These are  the stiff est disaster  loan  terms in 5 years because last year Presi dent Nixon vetoed  a measwe which  would have made disaster  assistance  loans  to  homeowners,  farmers,  and  small businesses at 3 percent  interest  with  the first $2,500  forgiven or at  1-percent  interest  rate with no  forin  giveness. It does not make sense to me to  reduce assistance at a time when it ap pears it will be needed most.  Today,  I am  introducing  legislation  which is designed to bridge the gap which  now exists in the benefits available to  flood disaster victims. It is designed to  ease the transition between reliance on  disaster loans to full implementation of  the Federal Insurance Act. The measure  would make 1 percent disaster  loans  available to those residents living in com munities which are eligible to participate  in the flood insurance program but whose  application had been delayed because of  difficulties  in complying with  local or  State regulatory requirements.  Section 3 of the bill would extend the  same 1 percent loan terms to residents of  communities which have been admitted  into the flood insurance program under  the  emergency application provisions.  Residents of these areas are eligible only  for the lower limits of subsidized cover age until such time as their communities  adopt more comprehensive zoning meas ures  restricting building  in  the  flood  plain. This could take several years. The  bill I am introducing today would permit  low interest loans to be made to these  individuals for uninsured losses up to the  maximum limits of subsidized insurance  coverage or to the maximum allowable  disaster  loan under existing FHA and  SBA regulations.  This  interim disaster  loan program  would be available to flood victims until  June 30, 1975, which should be a sufficient  time for most communities to meet neces sary local administrative and regulatory  requirements  for participating  in  the  flood insurance program.  I fully support efforts of Congress and  the administration to substitute flood in surance for disaster loans. However, a  program of this magnitude takes time to  implement. My bill would provide some  limited relief to those caught up in this  transition.  By Mr. PROXMmE:  S. 3006.

32,,93,-0.284,418,3,Mr. GRAVEL.," I think that is what we  are talking about, because I for one rest  my case on the argument of free enter prise and the movement of capital. Be cause we do not have what we consider  a  real free enterprise system domesti cally or internationally, we  then must  have a free enterprise system that has  some government involvement. When we  talk about the cheap energy of the sixties  and early seventies, that is a free market.  Then all of a sudden when  the Ara.bs  have  control  of  the market,  having  driven out the competitors, they have a  monopolistic situation, and jack it up.  In order to assure continuity of the situ ation, we must, therefore, have govern ment involvement.  I  think that is where many of us go  askew philosophically.  We had the ""cheaper gas"" problem  given  to our Committee on Finance,  where the instigation of our energy prob lem was tracked back to this regulation  of gas in 1954. It was interesting to see  the machinations that took place in the  marketplace as a result of that first in trusion by government into the domestic  situation.  I  think we can arrive at, within cer tain boundaries, a very competitive sit uation within the Nation, and then, when  we go abroad, we have to look at a differ ent type of problem. But essentially our  problem is one of capital.  When I made  the comparison with  wheat, I was trying to get across to my  colleague that we have problems with  infiation in all parts of our society, and  that, to my mind, that inflation is caused  primarily by a lack of understanding of  what has to be done  in our economy.  That is the reason why many of our col leagues stand here and say, ""We are go ing to roll back the price of oil.""  You cannot roll back the price of oil,  and you cannot roll back the price of  wheat. You must pay what it costs. If you  try to avoid the cost, you skew and dis tort the system, and then you have to dis tort it again and again and again.  So I advocate fighting inflation, and  hope that it might sell here in Congress,  so that we can try to return to some fun damentals of this business.  What we are talking about, when we  say we are going to roll back the price  of oil, is not going to decrease inflation;  it will actually cause infiation. The price  of oil will be higher by  the month of  July,  if this legislation passes, for  the  very simple reason that we cannot put a  to everyone's head; and what in vestor in these United States of America  is going to take his money and invest it in  oil in this country, if his investment can  only return a price of $5 a barrel, when  he can go to Canada and sell his product  for $10?  gun  There is no one in his right mind who  will take his money and do that with it,  and there is no way to pass a law to take  money away from the people and force  them to make the investment, unless we  make this a socialistic country.  My colleague from Wyoming remarked  that we may see the Government go into  the oil business. That has happened in  the last few :::nonths. It is happening at  Elk Hills, and it is happening in Alaska,  where the NavY sits on the national re serves thP,t the people have in oil. The  Navy is sitting on that oil, and if we de veloped  that oil,  it would depress  the  market. Likewise, it would cause the in flationary prices in energy  to subside;  and do not blame the oil industry for  that one. Blame the Navy and the Mem bers of Congress who insist on keeping  that 33 billion barrels of oil in the hands  of the Government.  I would be happy to continue the dia log with my colleague, because I  find  him very expert in these areas.  ",1974
33,,93,0.433,418,3,Mr. BARTLETT.," That is what I was  going to add. Because the point that the  Senator made earlier about gas being  underpriced on a Btu basis as much as  one-tenth, but at least a third compared  to oil, and because of its attractiveness  as an environmentally acceptable .fuel,  that it did keep the price of oil and coal  down; and also the mandatory import  program and the manner in which it was  administered was  the depletion allow ance plus the effort to do away with the  mandatory import program in 1970, so  that the price of oil has also been con trolled  both  directly  and  indirectly,  which has followed the same pattern.

CHET will long be remembered for his  service as chairman of two great com mittees of Congress, the Government Op erations Committee and the Joint Com mittee on Atomic Energy. He has estab lished a record of which any Member of  Congress would be proud.  I can understand why, after 30 years  of service, he now chooses to take a little  time for himself and his family. He has  earned it. So has his lovely wife, Cam,  who has been so helpful to him through out his distinguished career. I am sure  both of them will enjoy the opportunity  to be with their children, grandchildren,  and great-grandchildren more often.  Though  the chairman  is  retiring,  I  hope that he will continue to maintain  an active interest and participation in  matters of crucial  importance  to our  country.

38,,93,0.287,444,3,Mr. PARRIS.," Mr. Speaker, I am read ing from a press release of the Federal  Energy Office dated February 9, 1974,  which redirected gasoline stocks in 22  States, in which it says in part that the  program to redistribute some of the oil  supplies around this Nation was done to  ""achieve a more equitable balance  ln  supply."" Supplies in my district and in  my State were to be increased some 2  percent. The directive also stated that  the FEO would ""take further steps to  redirect supplies if severe shortages per sist."" I am informed that that program  is being scrapped by the Federal Energy  Office as of today. This action is rem iniscent of  the Cost of Living Coun cil's on-again-off-again administration  of the programs that drove prices of beef  upto the highest levels in recent history.  The Federal Energy Office administra tion of the crude oil allocation program  under  the Mandatory Allocation Act,  which was passed by this Congress some  few months ago, has brought about an  unprecedented fuel crisis. The individual  capabilities of refineries around the Na tion have been ignored and equal crude  oil supplies ordered t.o each regardless of  its design or capacity. As a result, this  administration has brought down  the  average  refinery utilization across  the  country  from an average of approxi mately 93 percent to 76 percent. Under  this bureaucratic mishmash, we have  reduced our refined supplies of fuel prod ucts by almost 20 percent and substan ..  tially worsened  the cwrent situation.  This condition cannot be permited  to  persist and I call on the FEO and the  Congress to take remedial action in the  immediate future.

39,House,93,-0.291,470,3,Mrs. GRASSO.," Mr. Speaker, we must  insure  that Vietnam era veterans are  provided with educational benefits that  compare  favorably with  those made  available  to  their fathers after World  War II and the Korean war.  If the veterans education assistance  program is to remain responsive to those  it is designed to serve, then the level of  assistance must be expanded to cover es calating costs !acing the veteran. The  continued rise in the cost of higher edu cation and the cost of living has placed  too many of our Vietnam era veterans in  financial difficulties. Without relief in the  form of an  increase  in GI education  benefits to cover inflationary increases,  the effectiveness and participation level  of the current program will be impaired.  As a member of the Education and  Training Subcommittee which helped  draft this legislation, I am giving my  strong support to H.R. 12628, the Veter ans  Education  and  Rehabilitation  Amendments of 1974. The bill improves  many existing assistance programs, two  of which are of particular interest to the  Vietnam veteran. First,  it provides a  13.6-percent increase in the monthly ed ucation assistance allowance to help meet  the added cost-of-living expenses  in curred over the past 18 months. Under  the provisions of H.R. 12628, a single full time student will receive an increase from  $220 to $250 a month. A married, full time student with two dependents will  have his monthly assistance  increased  from $298  to $339 a month. Naturally,  comparable  increases will be given  to  other categories of veterans. Second, the  bill increases from 8 to 10 years the time  period after discharge during which vet erans must utilize their GI benefits.  Mr. Speaker, studies conducted by the  Educational Testing Service-ETS-and  the National League of Cities-United  States Conference of Mayors  indicate  that the current level of benefits is in sufficient to meet today's education ex penses. Only by providing an adequate  increase in benefits  to compensate for  inflation and rising tuition will our pres ent  veterans  receive  the  assistance  needed to meet their career objectives.  As for the increase in the time period  for using GI benefits, I have received nu merous comments  from veterans who  are faced with a  loss of eligibility this  coming May. Many of these veterans be gan working after their discharge and  have only recently begun utilizing their  education benefits. By expanding the pe riod of eligibility,  the veteran will be  allowed more freedom to design a pro gram better suited to his individual goals  and circumstances. In this way the pro gram's :flexibility and responsiveness will  remain while the veteran's education de .sires are fulfilled.  For the 95,000 Vietnam era veterans  1n Connecticut, H.R. 12628 offers an op POrtunity for greater access to institu tions of higher education. Nothing less  than the provisions of  this legislation  will enable our veterans to meet their  present and future education needs.  This important bill must be approved  by the House today.  ",1974
40,House,93,0.188,470,3,Mr. HARSHA.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to express my strong support of H.R.  12628, the Veterans' Education and Re habilitation Amendments of 1974.  The GI education bill  is without a  doubt one of the most important and  most effective pieces of social legislation  ever enacted by the Congress, and it has  profoundly affected  the lives and for tunes of thousands of veterans and their  iamllies.  Since  this educational program was  initiated in 1944. hundreds of thousands  of veterans who would not have been able  to further  their education or training  without their financial -a.ssistance have  been able to do so. In addition to benefit ing personally, veterans educated under  this program have contributed immeas urably to our country and our economy,  and the investment our Nation has made  in educating them is clearly evident and  eminently worthwhile.  When discharged from the service, a  veteran is generally faced with the choice  of going to work or continuing his edu cation or training. If he cannot afford  the schooling, he is forced to seek em ..  ployment and is unlikely to pursue his  education at a later date.  Since the GI bill was originated, the  eost of living has increased tremendously  .and  the cost of higher education has  soared astronomically. As a result, vet erans of the Vietnam era are not receiv ing assistance comparable to that pro vided veterans of World War II. While  benefits have been increased a number  of times, they still fall far short of the  benefits older veterans received, and if  our efforts today to provide a reasonable  increase in benefits are not successful,  many veterans may have to leave school  and abandon their hopes for a better  education and a more meaningful and  more rewarding future.  The Vietnam war was a most contro versial and unpopular war, but the young  men who were called upon to serve their  country in this confiict made the same  sacrifices and suffered the same incon veniences  and  interruptions  in  their  normal lives as did the veterans of pre vious wars. As a nation, we owe them  the same gratitude,  the same  respect,  and the same benefits enjoyed by pre vious veterans.  The bill before us today seeks to cor rect the inadequacies of the present GI  bill and bring benefits up to a level com parable  to what  they were  followtng  World War II. While it will not increase  benefits as much as many of us would  like, it will ease the financial strain many  veterans are feeling and enable them to  continue their schooling and bett-er pre pare themselves to serve their Nation in  what will hopefully be an era of lasting  peace and prosperity. By investing in ou1  veterans and their future, we are invest ing in our future -a.s a nation.  I urge all of my colleagues to join with  me in support of this important and most  worthwhile proposal.  ",1974
41,House,93,0.183,470,3,Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speak ..  ~r~ I rise in sup1>0rt of H.R. 12628. In the  past few weeks I have been contacted by  many  <>f my  constituents  concerned  about veterans educational benefits.  One of these letters is typical in th~  sentiments it expresses and I would like  to share it with you. Mr. Pete Calgaro of  Rockford, Ill., is a veteran of 6 years in  the U.S. Navy. a policeman, and a father  of five children who attends Rock Valley  College in my district. In order to defray  costs of education, Mr. Calgaro currently  works 48 hours a week and his wife baby sits to make ends meet. He tells me that  because of the almost daily increase in  the cost of living, he may not be able to  finish his education, without the support  envisioned in this measure.  An increase of 13.6 percent in educa tional assistance allowances will. as Mr.  Calgaro points out, just barely compen sate for the rise in the cost of living since  the last rate increase. This does not tell  the whole story, as the costs of tuition  have risen steadily and at a great rate.  A major study, commissioned by the  Veterans' Administration concluded that  todays edtlcational benefits, on an ad justed basis, compare unfavorably with  those of post-World War ll. At  that  time, a $500 payment that could be made  for tuition covered tuition not only at  public colleges, but also at 89 percent of  the private institutions of higher edu cation.  In addition,  the World War II era  veteran received a $75 per month sub sistence allowance which represented at  that time 35 percent of the average U.S.  monthly wage. Today's veteran receives a  lump-sum payment to purchase an edu cation and pay living expenses. This $220  a month also represents 35 percent of the  average U.S. monthly wage. but it does  not cover living expenses.  The increase in educational assistance  is therefore needed at this time, but it is  by no means the only worthy provision  in this bill. Many veterans who served  before 1966, because of the pressures of  family life or financial necessity, were  able to recommence their educations only  recently. If this bill is not enacted, they  will be  left high and dry, willing, but  lacking the money to continue their ef ..  forts at self-improvement.  Almost all of  the constituents who  wrote me mentioned the sacrifices they  and their families are making in order  to continue  their studies. We owe  to  these young men and women the chance  to achieve the goals they have set for  ",1974

44,House,93,0.189,496,3,Mr. QUIE.," Mr. Speaker, within  the  next several week:::  the House will be  considering H.R. 69,  the bill  reported  by the Education and Labor Committee  to amend and extend the 1965 Elemen tary and Secondary Education Act.  One of the most controversial sections  of that bill during the first session of the  93d Congress was the formula for  the  distribution of title I funds among school  districts throughout the Nation.  In its deliberations  in late January,  the Education  and Labor Committee  adopted a new formula for title I which  I believe rectifies many of the problems  with the old formula. Let me tell you  briefly about the elements of the new  formula and how those elements insure  that a more equitable distribution of  funds will emerge.  First, the bill improves upon the old  law by adopting a more flexible and real istic approach to the definition of low  income. Since 1965 when ESEA was first  to  enacted, we have used  the set dollar  :figure of $2,000  to identify low-income  people. That figure remained the same  through 1974 and did not reflect such  obvious variables as the size of family  in income requirements. Because of that,  it made no difference whether a family  had one child and a $1,950 income or five  children and an income of $2,050.  Above the $2,000 line one did not get  counted, below the line all were counted.  The committee bill for the first time  moves to the use of the so-called Orshan sky definition of poverty. That definition  was utilized by the Bureau of the Census  at the time of the 1970 census and is  now regularly used by almost all Fed eral agencies concerned with programs  in the human resources area. It is this  definition which is used when one hears  reports that last year so many million  people were below  the poverty line or  that a certain pro.gram  is directed  assist those in poverty.  At the time the 1970 census was taken,  the index ranged from $1,632 for a farm  family of one  to $5,820  for an urban  family of eight. Clearly this sort of fiexi bility is much more equitable than use of  a single income figure which does not  permit refinements for family size.  Two. The committee bill reduces the  reliance of  the formula on the AFDC  caseloads in a particular area or State.  In the past as much as 70 percent of  the money a given State has received  has been because of the size of the AFDC  caseload and the payments which are  made under that program.. The recent  HEW validity check of all 50 States in dicates that nationally 10.2 percent of  the caseload is not eligible under the law  for assistance. Another 22.8 percent re ceives payments in excess of eligibility  and 8.1 percent are underpaid. In total,  the error rate in the AFDC program in  the period from April to September 1973  was in excess of 40 percent of the total  caseload.  If that error rate were equitably dis tributed, the problems would not be as  great. Regrettably, the error rate runs  . from a low in Maine of less than 13 per cent to a high in New York of over 60  percent making it totally impossible to  devise some simple way to discount the  error rate.  In addition to this problem, it is well  known that the AFDC program is not re flective of need in areas with high con centrations of Chicanos and orientals.  A study done last year by the Los Angeles  schools clearly shows  that areas with  high concentrations of very low-income  people from either of these racial back grounds did not reveal AFDC caseloads  in proportion with other types of popula tion. That is apparently because in those  communities there  is a stigma against  going on welfare and a  feeling  that  friends, neighbors, and relatives will help  out. In certain areas it may also be be cause of  the presence of  illegal aliens  who wish to conceal their status.  AFDC is also a program that is biased  against  rural areas. Testimony before  our committee by officials of the Social  Rehabilitation Service at HEW confirms  the fact that people in rural areas are  more reluctant to accept public assist ance.  Finally, AFDC  is a program with a  unique  administrative  structure. Al though most of the money  is Federal,  the rules are made to some extent in  each State. Because of that, 26 States  have programs where the father can be  present in the home, and the family can  still receive assistance. In the other 24  States, that is not true. Hence, in some  States one rewards a school system for  the presence of broken families.  In a  neighboring city in a different State, just  the opposite situation may hold true. It  is also up to each State to set payment  levels and to determine eligibility. That  means that poor States have lower pay ments, and some States  require  little  verification. Hence, error rates like the  60 percent in New York.  In order to reduce double-counting, the  committee amendment counts two-thirds  of AFDC above the eligibility line. Fur ther reduction of reliance on AFDC is  accomplished by moving the threshold  above which AFDC children are counted  from  the $2,000  figure  in current law  to the dollar :figure which is adjusted  each year to reflect the poverty line. In  1973 that figure is about $4,200 for an  urban family of four.  Third. The old law reimbursed States  at one-half their State cost or one-half  the national cost, whichever was higher.  This led to situations where some very  low spending States, particularly in the  South, were utilizing the national aver age and getting a much greater payment  rate than anyone else. Alabama with a.  1971-72 per-pupil cost of $563 was using  one-half the national cost of $970 and,  therefore, was eligible for a payment of  $485 per child. Illinois on the other hand,  with a per-pupil cost of $1,075 was using  one-half of its cost or $537.50, only $52  more than Alabama even though the act ual differences in cost were more than  $500 per child. At the other extreme New  York was using one-half of its totai cost  of $1,513 and, therefore, becoming eligi ble for per-pupil entitlements of almost  $756.  In regard to this last point, it is inter esting to note that although New York's  average per-pupil cost is more than 150  percent of the national average its aver age salary for classroom teachers is only  about 120 percent of the national aver age--$11,803 versus $9,705. The extra  costs in New York are apparently due to  large degree to the very rich pension  system which that State maintains.  The new  law proposes  to pay each  State 40 percent of its actual State per pupil costs with a proviso that no State  would receive less than 80 percent of 40  percent of the national average nor more  tha.n 120 percent of 40 percent of the na tional average. What this means is that  under the new formula Alabama will be  entitled to $310, Illinois $430, and New  York $465. Since the current law is only  funded at 36 percent of entitlement, the  actual difference to any State is not as  great as might be indicated by these :fig ures.  Use of a payment rate of 40 percent  instead of the former 50 percent rate also  decrea.ses the authorizations for the pro gram to a realistic level. Under the old  law authorizations in fiscal 1974 were  more than $5 billion for title I. Under the  a  ",1974

47,Senate,93,0.499,548,3,Mr. BUCKLEY.," Mr. President, the re tirement of Mark Trice at the end of  last year marked the end of an era in the  U.S. Senate. For 53 years he served the  Senate in important capacities, ending  his career as Secretary to the Minority.  In a city that has a superabundance of  institutions, Mark Trice is a  rarity: a  living institution whose 53 years of serv ice to the Senate and to this country are  all but unique in their dedication and  devotion to duty.  Like most freshmen Senators, I bene fited from his wisdom and his guidance  when I first began the difficult adjusi; ment of entering into important and, to  a newcomer, often very confusing duties  of a U.S. Senator. His guidance, his un derstanding and his knowledge of the  Senate helped  to make my  first  few  months of adjustment easier to bear and  the rest of my time until his retirement  more efficient and more pleasant. I, for  one, shall always be grateful to him for  the understanding and kindness  that  made my own transition from citizen to  Senator so much easier than it might  otherwise have been.  In this city of monuments, perhaps the  most lasting monument is that which ex ists in the hearts of those who remember  a person who has really made a real dif ference,  for  the better,  in  their  lives.  Mark Trice is such a person.  LEAA HALTS BEHAVIOR MODIFICA TION FUNDING  ",1974
48,,93,0.099,561,3,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, on Jan uary 21  I announced to my colleagues  that I had received assurances from the  Social Security Administration that seri ous consideration would be given to pro viding. by means of an administrative  change, medicare  coverage  for breast  prosthesis for mastectomies. Since that  time a number of bills have been intro duced in Congress to provide such cov erage  through  legislative acUon.  I am  confident  that one way or  the other,  medicare will  eventually provide such  assistance.  But more than :financial assistance is  needed by mastectomies and by all other  cancer patients as well. People who have  cancer or who have been cured of cancer  have tremendous emotional needs that  often can be filled only by contact with  others who have had similar experiences.  I was, therefore, very pleased to learn  that in Chicago, a group known as Can cer Call-PAC, or People Against Cancer,  has been formed to meet just such needs  of cancer patients. With the help of the  American Cancer Society, the Columbus CUneo-Cabrini Medical Center, and an  amazing woman named Georgia Photo pulos, this group is currently providing  much-needed  emotional  support  !or  thousands of cancer patients.  I ask unanimous consent that an arti cle  from  the Columbus-CUneo-Cabrini  Quarterly, describing the courage of Mrs.  Photopulos and  the dedication of  the  Medical Center stat! to  the success of  Cancer call-PAC,  be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  GEORGIA PHOTOPULOS  llf you live in the Chicago area you may  have been fortunate enough to have ""met""  her,  though not  in  the usual sense. Last  spring she was featured in a week-long spe cial series on the ABC-TV evening news, and  an article written by her appeared in the  Chicago Tribune Sunday Magazine. If you  saw the series or read the article, you know  that she is far from a woman without prob lems. Georgia is one of several million people  in this country who live daily with cancer.  ""My cancer is not cured, nor is it arrested,""  she explains, ""I am living today, each day,  one day at a time, free from symptoms."" She  has chosen to meet the enemy headlong, how ever, and she has refused to let it disturb  her remarkably positive attitude.  Georgia has been through surgery nineteen  times. She has undergone a  total of 120  cobalt and deep x-ray treatments in Colum bus Hospital's  radiation  therapy depart ment--far more  than  the average number  of treatments usually required. She has lost  both her breasts, most of her hair, most of  the sensation in her right hand and arm,  and much of her formerly endless reserve  of physical strength and energy. But in her  estimation she has gained something  far  more valuable-a new awareness and appreCXX--212-Part 3  elation of life. Her already very close family  has been brought even closer together be cause of her illness.  Georgia's battle with cancer began  five  years ago when,  in a  routine breast self examination, she discovered two small lumps  in her right breast. One of these proved to  be malignant. This came on the heels of  other health problems which in themselves  would have been enough to stop a less deter mined person. She has always been bothered  with allergies and asthma, and at the age of  11 she contracted polio, which left her with  a curvature of the spine and a crooked pelvis.  She  had  also  suffered  two miscarriages  (Georgia and her husband Bud have  two  adopted children)  and several bouts with  fibrocystic disease  (a non-cancerous condi tion) in both breasts.  Following a  radical mastectomy on  the  right breast and  the beginning of a pro longed  series of  radiation  treatments  at  Columbus, Georgia  underwent  a  simple  mastectomy on the other side which showed  a microscopic new malignancy beginning in  that breast.  When she first found out that she had can cer, she said that she felt a desperate need to  talk with someone about it. But she quickly  came to realize that there was such a wide spread fear and lack of understanding about  cancer-what it is and what it does-among  lay people  that most of her  friends were  reluctant to even talk about it. She found  the fortitude that she needed to cope with  her fear through her family and her faith  in God.  She found that it was important to her to  keep her appearance up no matter how bad  she might feel at any given time. ""I found  that if I looked good, I felt better. So I al ways made it a point to fix my make-up and  my hair whenever I was going out. And I  refused to go to doctors or to the hospital  wearing my bathrobe."" Then when friends  saw her looking so good they assumed she  was well and ceased offering her the helping  hand that she often could have used but  was reluctant to ask for. She said tha.t when ever she met her husband's friends who ltnew  that ""Bud's wife has cancer,'' they always  thought, because they saw her  looking so  cheerful, that: ""One, Bud knew but I didn't  know what was wrong with me; or two,  I  knew but I didn't comprehend the serious ness of it; or three, that the Mrs. Photopulos  with cancer bad died and I was Bud's sec ond wife.""  As the course and treatment of her disease  progressed, Georgia met many more cancer  patients and found that there was a very  strong  feeling  of  identity  a.nd  fellowship  among them. She told of one time when she  entered the dressing room in the radiation  therapy department at Columbus and saw a  woman struggling with an artificial  limb.  ""When I  first tried to help her she was very  hostile, but then when I began to undress  and she saw the scars of my radical mastec tomy her attitude immediately changed.  was then 'one of us,' I  too had lost some thing.""  She found that among cancer patients the  need to talk with someone about their dis ease, about  their hopes and  fears, was  a  commonly felt need and one which was not  being satisfied in many cases. Friends and  family were often unwilling or unable to of fer any emotional support other than the  most common cliches. Doctors were often too  busy or sometimes feared that the patient  would not be able to ""take it,"" and so were  reluctant to discuss the details of the case.  Many times patients never really even met  the surgeon who operated on them because  of heavy sedation and anesthesia. So in her  mind, Georgia began to formulate a plan in  which cancer patients themselves could help  one another through their times of crisis and  fear.  I  I  Georgia had been actively working as a  volunteer with the Chicago Chapter of the  American Cancer Society for some time when  one day a little more than a year ago she was  asked to address a meeting of the chapter. ""I  was asked at the last minute to fill  in for  someone else who couldn't make it. I guess  they were used to hearing celebrities and doc tors and nurses speak, but I  just got up an  told my own story of my fight with cancer. By  the time I finished there wasn't a dry eye in  the audience.  think people were able to  identify with me more because I wasn't a  celebrity or anyone rich or famous. I'll always  believe that people are able to identify more  with me and my family not so much because  o:: what we are or what we have, but because  of what we don't have. We don't have domes tic help, mothers who can drive,  teenage  children who can pretty much take care of  themselves. We've had to fend for ourselves  and do for ourselves, to learn to live with  and around the problems and inconveniences  that having cancer causes. Of course, our  friends and neighbors have been a  tremen dous  help,  and without  them we  just  couldn't have gotten along.""  Following her speech to the Chicago Chap ter of the American Cancer Society, Georgia  was barraged with requests to speak to other  chapters and other organizations.  In  the  early part of this year she was  invited  to  speak at  the National Convention of  the  American Cancer Society  in New Orleans.  About that same time she was asked to write  the article for the Chicago Tribune and to  appear in the series on ABC-TV.  Each time that Georgia gave a speech or  appeared in the media, she took the opportu nity to urge the American Cancer Society to  organize the project of emotional support for  and by cancer patients which she had con ceived. It was to be a ""hot line"" type tele phone service in which volunteers, all can cer patients themselves, would be available  24 hours a day to talk with other cancer  patients and their families to offer them en couragement and hope.  In October, 1972,  the American Cancer Society asked Georgia  to become project coordinator and gave her  a small grant to cover the expenses of re searching and starting the program in the  Chicago area. The project became known as  Cancer Call-PAC.  It  stands  for  ""People  Against Cancer."" It was  launched  in  late  June, and it will be the pilot for a similar  project which will hopefully be offered on  a nationwide basis.  The service does not provide medical ad vice, nor does it attempt to interfere in any  way with  the doctor-patient  relationship.  The volunteers are simply called upon  to  offer emotional support to cancer patients  and their families. This is the support which  can often be the turning point in their deci sion not  to give up but  to determinedly  fight the disease with all the resources they  can muster.  ,  There are a  total of 120 volunteers who  staff Cancer Call-PAC. Fifty-two of these are  cancer patients who speak with callers. They  represent people from all walks of life, and  are patients With most of the major types  of cancer. Among them they speak a  total  of eleven languages. The rest of the volun teers serve as advisors in various specialized  areas of cancer care or in the delicate posi tions of intermediaries who help connect the  callers with the most appropriate listeners.  Many doctors, nurses and others in various  areas of the medical profession serve in ad visory capacities with the Cancer Call-PAC  staff. There is also a  large group of clergy men of all faiths and psychologists who ad vise the staff on matters relating to pastoral  care. Dr. David Lochman and Mr. John Porter  from Columbus-Cuneo-Cabrini Medical Cen ter's department of  therapeutic  radiology  are among those in the first group, and Sis ter Marie Louise De Antonio, M.S.C.,  from  ",1974
49,Senate,93,0.446,574,3,Mr. HRUSKA.," Mr. President, Dr. Gil bert M. Grosvenor, the distinguished edi tor and vice president of the National  Geographic  Society.  has  been  kind  enough to send me an advance copy of  the March issue of his splendid publica tion which contains an engrossing article  entitled, ""Nebraska--the Good Life.""  It is written by a native Nebraskan,  Robert Paul Jordan, an assistant editor  of the National Geographic, and is strik ingly  illustrated with Lowell Georgia's  beautiful photographs.  Author Jordan tells his story sympa thetically, even  lovingly, weaving his tory and modem-day events together. He  writes of Nebraska's cities and its plains)  its villages and its scenery,  its people  and its industry, its football team and  its weather. He finds that:  Nebraskans dwell easily with their past. It  has formed them, abetted by place and vagar ies of weather,  into a hardy,  independent  breed. These a.re the bedrock Americans, be lievers  in work,  thrifty, conservative, and  religious folk with  the pioneer spirit still  strong. It serves them well.  Mr. President, Editor Grosvenor tells  me that some 9 million families are mem bers of the National Geographic Society  so  the article will be  read widely. In  order that the readers of the RECORD may  share in this story of Nebraska and its  people, I ask unanimous consent that it  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  NEBRASKA-THE GOOD LIFE  (By Robert Paul Jordan)  Across  the wide Missouri at Omaha  the  sign announces, ""Nebraska  .  .  .  the Good  Life."" Continuing west  on  Interstate  80,  travelers pass the good life by.  The prairie comes right up  to peaceful  hamlets and friendly cities and embraces  them. Windmills spin beside picture-book  red barns and  silvery  farmhouses. Cattle  graze on rich pastures; An upstart breeze  ruffles tawny wheat fields; corn stands knee  high  in dark-green  ranks,  though  tt  isn't  yet the Fourth of July.  How pleasant, and how soon monotonous.  The concrete ribbon stretches away, shim mering. Trav,elers press on: Cheyenne or bust  by 6 p.m. After more than 450 miles of deep  sky, cloud kingdoms, and endless horizon,  the land changes its name to Wyoming.  Now,  I go a more fortunate way. I  turn  off  the  superhighway again and again,  a  long-absent native  son  rediscovering Ne braska's plains and people. ""We are what  we are,'' they tell me, and I like what I see.  On the southern fringe of the Sand Hills  a  flotilla of pleasure craft courses a great  man-made lake. At the immaculate south central town of Minden, gay costumes whirl  in Danish Day festivities. Southeast, Brown v1lle, a cameo of steamboat days, lolls with  its lavender memories. Northwest, forty-mil  lion-year-old fossils lie strewn like seashells  on moonscape badlands.  Even Interstate 80 proves special. Many  times I watch the ca.rs heading west along  it. And I wonder: Do those people conjure  up prairie schooners rolUng to empire along  this broad Platte River Valley? Can  they  glimpse a ghostly pony express rider gallop ing beside them into eternity?  I  remember a morning when I cut south  from  the prosperous cl ty of North Pla. tte,  swinging through Frontier and Red WUlow  Counties,  past  nodding  steel muleheads  pumping oil beside fields of waving grain.  I  rounded bright and busy McCook  and  promptly at one o'clock-punctuality is a  Nebraska virtue-knocked on a  farmhouse  door near the Kansas border.  Arthur Carmody was expecting me. Level  of gaze, ruddy, booted and cowboy hatted,  he seemed a proper Westerner even to a last  touch: He was strapping a  revolver on his  hip.  ""Might stir up a rattlesnake or two where  we're going,'' he explained.  ""You lead the way,'' I  said, politely.  Mr. Carmody, '74, a  former state senator,  is an authority on Nebraska. history. On a  little-known battleground a few miles from  his  home,  the  hapless American  Indian  warred on his own kind in major battle one  final time, a century ago last August 5.

51,Senate,93,-0.408,587,3,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, on this oc casion which marks the 56th anniver sary of Lithuania's independence. I take  pride in joining with my colleagues to  salute  these gallant people. The con tributions which they have made in the  areas of education, literature, the arts,  as well as the example of their heroic  struggle for  independence, have added  immensely to the richnesess of our coun try and its promise of a haven for those  who have been deprived of a democratic  homeland. But before Lithuania was  forceably  incorporated  into  the Soviet  Union, the world was also made a little  richer for the cultural and artistic con tributions which the Lithuanians as a  people were able to off er.  We know the tragic story of how Lith uania fell victim to the aggressive de signs of Hitler's Germany and Stalin's  Russia. As an ""Autonomous Republic""  on the Soviet periphery, the citizens of  Lithuania have been  threatened since  the Red army  takeover of August 3,  1940, with a form of social organization  which goes beyond mere political con trol. The socalled ""nationalities policies""  which are being pursued by the Soviet  Union are directed at destroying  the  basic cultural identities of the 180 ethnic  and racial groups which populate  the  vast expanse of Soviet real estate. And  it could well be this aspect of the Lithu anian people's plight that is the greatest  tragedy for its implications extend be yond the borders of her own  territory  to the frontiers of men's minds.  During the past several years on this  occasion, it has been customary to reaf firm our pledge of support for Lithuania's  struggle to again realize her self-deter mination. It is vital that we who have  built a free society use our freedom to  make clear to those who have destroyed  the hopes of millions that we find their  policies of political dehumanization com pletely inconsistent with what the Amer ican people believe in or will accept. And  I believe that the stirrings of dissent in  the Soviet Union at the present time sig nal that we are not alone in this con viction. Expressions  of  deep  concern  about the dehumanizing impact which  these and other policies are having on  Lithuanians,  Ukrainians,  Armenians,  Byelorussians, Georgians and other na tions  in  the U.S.S.R. have been pub lished in the West'. In this connection, I  believe that the exiled Alexander Solz henitsyn has summed up the relation ship between our freedom and the free dom of  these nationalities best in his  letter accepting his Nobel Prize for Lit erature. On this occasion I request that  this letter be read into the RECORD as a  demonstration of our support for his  struggle as I  think he may well have  expressed his support for Lithuania and  other nationalities by observing that:  In recent times it has been fashionable to  talk of the levell1ng out of nations, of the  disappearance of different races in the melt ing-pot of contemporary civlllzation.  I do  not agree with  this opinion. . . Here  it  ls  merely fitting to say that the disappearance  of nations would have  impoverished us no  less than if all men had become alike, With  one personality and one face. Nations are the  wealth of mankind, its collective personali ties;  the very least of them wears its own  special  colours and bears within  itself  a  special fM:et of divine intention.  These great words by a great author  remind us of our obligations as  free  men-the duty to condemn political re pression  from  the  left as well as  the  right. That Lithuanian  Independence  day has called  these duties  to mind  bestows perhaps the greatest tribute to  the courage and commitment to liberty  of the Lithuanian people and our link  with their struggle to be free.  I ask unanimous consent that the let ter of acceptance ref erred to above be  printed in the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection,  the letter  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  A. SoLZHENrrSYN ACCEPTANCE  IN FORM OF  LETTER TO THE ACADEMY-NOBEL LECTURE  IN LrrERATURE 1970  Just as that puzzled savage who has picked  up-a strange cast-up  from  the ocean? something unearthed  from  the sands?-or  an obscure object  fallen  down  from  the  sky?-intricate  in  curves,  it gleams  first  dully and then with a bright thrust of light.  Just as he turns it this way and that, turns  it over, trying to discover what to do with it,  trying to discover some mundane function  within his own grasp, never dreaming of its  higher ""function.  So also we, holding Art in our hands, con fidently consider ourselves to be its masters;  boldly we direct  it, we  renew, reform and  manifest it; we sell it for money, use it to  please those in power; turn to it at one mo ment for .amusement-right down to popular  songs and night-clubs, and at another grabbing  the  nearest  weapon,  cork  or  cudgel-for the passing needs of politics and  for narrow-minded social ends. But art ls not  defiled by our efforts, neither does it thereby  depart from  its  true nature, but on each  occasion and in each application it gives to  us a part of its secret inner light.  But shall we ever grasp the whole of that  light? Who will dare  to say  that he has  defined Art, enumerated all its facets? Per haps once upon a time someone understood  and told us, but we could not remain satis fied with  that for  long; we  listened, and  neglected, and threw it out there and then,  hurrying as always  to exchange even  the  very best-if only for something new! And  when we are  told again the old truth, we  shall not even remember that we once pos sessed it.  One artist sees himself as the creator of an  independent spiritual world; he hoists onto  his shoulders the task of crea.ttng this world,  of  peopling  it and  of  bearing  the  all embracing  responsibUity  for  it;  but he  crumples beneath it, for a mortal genius ls  not capable of bearing such a burden. Just  as man in general, having declared himself  the centre of existence, has not succeeded in  creating a balanced spiritual system. And if  misfortune overtakes him, he casts the blame  upon the age-long disharmony o! the world,  upon  the complexity of  to-day's ruptured  soul, or upon the stupidity of the public.  Another artist, recognizing a higher power  above, gladly works as a humble apprentice  beneath God's heaven;  then however, his  responsiblllty for everything that is written  or drawn, for the souls which perceive his  work,  is more exacting than ever. But, in  return,  it ls not he who has created  this  world, not he who directs  it,  there  ls no  doubt as to its foundations;  the artist has  merely to be more keenly aware than others  of the harmony of the world, of the beauty  and ugliness of the human contribution to  it, and to communicate this acutely to his  fellow-men. And in misfortune, and even at  the depths of existence-in destitution, in  prison, in sickness-his sense of stable har mony never deserts him.  But all the  irrationality of art,  its daz zling turns, its impredictable discoveries, its  shattering influence on human beings-they  are too full of magic to be exhausted by this  artist's vision of the world, by his artistic  conception or by the work of his unworthy  fingers.  Archeologlsts have not discovered stages  of human existence so early that they were  without art. Right back in the early morn ing twilights of mankind we received it from  Hands which we were  too slow to discern.  And we were too slow to ask: For what pur pose have we been given this gift? What are  we to do with it?  And they were mistaken, and wlll always  be mistalten, who prophesy that art wm dis integrate, that it will outlive its forms and  die. It is we who shall die-art will remain.  And shall we comprehend, even on the day  of our destruction, all its facets and all its  possibilities?  Not  everything  assumes  a  name. Some  things lead beyond words. Art inflames even  a  frozen, darkened soul to a high spiritual  ",1974
52,,93,-0.293,678,3,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, it is  with distinct pleasure that I call up for  approval by  the Senate  today Senate  Resolution 222  authorizing a national  ocean policy study by the Committee on  Commerce. A study of our Nation's needs  and how they can be met, in whole or  in part, from the vast resources of the  oceans is long overdue.  Sixty Members of the U.S. Senate have  joined together in supporting this res olution. Personally, I am unaware of any  similar undertaking which has received  such a broad, bipartisan outpouring of  assistance from the leadership of both  parties and from all of the chairmen of  the standing committees of the Senate.  Senator WARREN G. MAGNUSON,  chair man of  the Committee on Commerce,  and principal author of the resolution,  is to be personally commended for his  continuing tireless leadership on matters  of ocean policy.  It is a matter of history that recent  administration budget policies and prior ities have had a serious impact on our  Nation's effort to achieve a sound oceans  policy and program. During the past 5  years, and to a certain extent during the  previous administration as well, it has  been congressional initiative which has  maintained the identification of ocean  policy as an important national goal. Of  course, economic and political necessity  would seem t.o demand that the United  States be a major world ocean power.  Congressional policy has  always  sup ported such thinking. But in the past  few years, we have developed a ""no-pol icy policy"" toward the oceans and coastal  al'eas. Such a  lack of policy has had  disastrous results, not only in the all important field of coastal zone manage ment, but in reduction of valuable stocks  of fish, deterioration of water quality in  the ocean,  and  inaccessibility  to  raw  materials.  Our  present  energy  crisis  can  be  blamed partly on our refusal to develop  an adequate national policy toward the  oceans. The sea can, indeed, be an im portant source, not only of petroleum,  but of new types of energy. But frankly,  too few of our Nation's leaders have been  aware of the promise of the oceans. That  must be changed. Senate Resolution 222  can help bring about meaningful change  in our approach to ocean programs by  elevating ""ocean thinking"" to a higher  plateau here in the Senate and in the  Congress. Congressional leadership has  brought our national ocean program to  where it is today. Congressional leader ship can give our national ocean program  the  stimulus  necessary  to make  the  United States the world leader. We in the  Senate can prove to the Nation that the  oceans are critical to solving our national  problems.  As I said on December 19, when Sen ator MAGNUSON  introduced this resolu tion, the United States must make a com mitment. Part of that commitment must  be to open the resources of the sea to  American capabilities. But equally as  important is the protection and preserva tion of the ocean and its coastal lands  and waters.  Today, the Senate of the United States  takes the all-important first step toward  this new commitment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the names of all cosponsors be  printed at this point in the RECORD.

53,,93,-0.457,691,3,Mr. RONCALIO of Wyoming.," Mr.  Speaker, I am proud to enter into the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  the  text of  the  speech written by Mr.  Jeff Williams,  which won the Veterans of Foreign Wars  of  the United States, Department of  Wyoming's annual Voice of Democracy  Contest.  Jeff is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Glenn  A. Williams, of Cheyenne, Wyo. He is a  junior at Central High School, and ex cells in both scholastic and extracurricu lar pursuits.  I  congratulate Jeff for his achieve ment, and am heartened by his belief  tbat the events of the last year have  served  to strengthen citizen  loyalty to  our Nation.  The text of the speech follows:  MY RESPONSmILITY AS A CrrIZEN  ""I pledge allegiance  to  the  flag of  the  United States of America"", to this country I  pledge allegiance,  this being my responsi bility as a citizen. In those few words from  the American Pledge of Allegiance, I discover  resp.:msibility to  that I as a. citizen have a  fulfill.  In as much as  this country has granbd  me numerous civic rlght3 since the day I was  born,  I,  as  a  true citizen owe  allegiance  through responsibility for  theze wonderful  gifts.  I am living in a time of scandal and criti cisms,  there are  those who have degraded  the image of America as never before in the  history of this nation. It b my responsibility  as a citizen to speak out against this nega tive pessimism toward our country. True, I  must be concerned with finding out what's  wrong with America, but more important, I  should find out what is right about America..  For it is not my duty to overly react to the  calamities of the nation, on  the contrary,  it is my responsibility as a citizen to provide  optimistic support and provide  a.  solution.  As part of the solution I must keep the in tegrity of this country by not downgrading  it because of its political trials and tribula tions. America will stand, and its affairs will  be carried out, regardless of  these misfor tunes.  Individuals may  fall, but not  the  nation.  It is therefOll'e my responsibility as a citi zen to support my government and obey its  laws which have been so specifically outlined  in the Constitution and the Declaration of  Independence. James A. Garfield once said,  ""A Law is not a law without coercion behind  it."" I  too, feel it necessary to provide our  laws with that needed enforcement by re specting  the statutes of  this nation. Ob Viously then, being a. citizen does not mean I  can a.ct as I please however, but rather I  should decide how I will act by understand ing and completing my civic duties with a  sense of responsibility.  This responsibility lies in individualism. I,  being that individual, am a citizen of thj,s  nation. I have a share here, and a part to  bear, a character to form, frame and present  to the United States. I will present my char acter, caITying out my responsibility as a  citizen, by accepting a  challenge. America  has al ways had  the challenge of building  something entirely new, with each individual  having a  task,  a.  responsi:billty. So  I will  thrust forwwrd, testing, trying the new, fail ing and trying again and again by using my  own individuaJ.ism..  Carrying <YUt my individual responsibility  as a citizen I must not assume an apathetic  attitude. I cannot, as the cliche goes, ""stick  my head in the sand and ignore what's go ing on around me"". I will not be like Phil lip Nolan, Edward Hales ma.in character in  The Man Without A Country, who because  of general lack of concern did not wish to  hear a.bout his country any more, only to  have that wish become reality. I maintain  to properly fulfill my responsibility. I must  train myself to a.ct responsible by gaining the  true facts on any given matter. This entails  a total commitment on my part to study, in quire of the present proceedings, and get a  good education.  Since I have a place in the pattern and  perfection of the United States the final suc cess, or failure lies in my hands. Ever since  this nation was founded, each generation of  Americans has been given the responsibility  to become  loyal citizens. I, a. 20th century  American, must take my place in history by  carrying out my responsibility as a. citizen,  through the acceptance of duties.  It is my duty and responsibility to have a  place in my heart for all those Americans  who have carried out their citizenship to the  utmost by giving their lives to preserve my  freedom. I commit myself to follow in their  footsteps by pledging my allegiance as a. citi zen to the maintaining of the civic rights  of this country. I accep-t this responsibility as  a. citizen to set an example, for  if I don't  who will?  ",1974
54,,93,0.34,704,3,Mr. TREEN.," Mr. Speaker, each year  the Veterans of Foreign Wars conduct  a  ""Voice of Democracy Contest."" The  contest theme for this year was: ""My  Responsibility as a Citizen."" Over 500,000  students  from  over  7 ,000  secondary  schools participated in this year's 27th  annual ""Voice of Democracy"" program.  The competition for  the five national  scholarships is consequently very fierce.  This year Mr. Larry Broussard, one of  my  young  constituents, who  attends  Catholic High School in New Iberia, La.  had the distinction of giving the winning  speech for the State of Louisiana. And  he will come to Washington in March,  with the other State winners, to compete  for one of the national scholarships.  At a  time when the viability of our  political process is under a barrage of  critique, I  think we could all do well to  reflect on the  ideas presented by Mr.  Broussard in his speech: ""My Respon sibility as a Citizen."" Mr. Speaker,  I  therefore,  insert  this  speech  in  the  RECORD at this time:  MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A CITIZEN  ""When we speak of patriotism, we gen erally  think of soldiers carrying our  flag  . through gunfire to destroy our enemies. But  there are other kinds of patriotism. I think  a man or woman who ls willing to give time  and energy for the betterment of our demo cratic system is a patriot!""  By these words, attorney Ralph Richards  expands the concept of allegiance to coun try. To him,  true citizenship  is returning  something to a country which gives so much.  Steadfast service is patriotism.  All good citizens know  that when  they  ha.ve  rights granted by our Constitution,  they also have equal responsib111ties. Rights  always carry parallel responsibilities.  Perhaps the greatest responsibility of any  good citizen ls to inform himself concerning  the rights, liberties, and duties given him by  the Constitution. He should understand the  meaning of ""individual liberty"" as defined  by our Founding Fathers. He should under stand that these truly great men established  a constitutionally limited power.  A basic principle of our Constitution  ls  that our government is to be limited in its  power and duties-limited in its control over  the liberties of the people. It was the intent  of the Declaration of Independence and the  Constitution  that  the  rights of  citizens  should be secure, and the Federal Govern ment was given ""just powers"" by consent  of the governed. ""Just powers"" are the powers  that the Government should ""justly"" have  because they are given to the Government  by the people-by its citizens.  All of us need  to understand what the  Constitution  says about  the  preservation  of rights. It is one's responsibility to under stand the intent of the framing Constitu tional Convention-to understand this great  document as it was explained by Alexander  Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay in a  series of essays known as  the Federalist  Papers.  The Government created by the Constitu tion was a Republic. In this form of govern ment, power rests with the Nation's voters  and is exercised by representatives elected by  the voters and responsible to them. Nearly all  adults are eligible  to vote  in the United  States. Having a  ""voice""  in one's govern ment ls what we call a democracy.  Individual  liberties and rights are cher ished in our country, but these are balanced  by our responsib1lities. In return for rights  and privileges of citizenship, we, as young  citizens, have certain duties  to perform;  moreover, we have a  responsibility to pre pare ourselves for duties which will be ex pected of us when we reach maturity.  One of our duties is education: we have  to take. our studies seriously and apply our selves to the best of our abilities. Another  duty is finance: when we become adults, we  will have to pay taxes for the support of our  National, State, and local governments. We,  therefore, have a duty to study accounts of  how public money is spent. This is a phase  of economics one should understand so that  he wm be prepared to support sound pro grams and vice versa.  This ""two-way partnership"" idea fits into  citizenship in our home, our school, church,  local community, State, and Nation. It is  our responsibility to live up to the duties,  as well as the rights, of a citizen.  ALEXANDER SOLZHENITSYN  HON.

55,,93,-0.443,704,3,Mr. EILBERG.," Mr. Speaker. Alexan der Solzhenitsyn 1s an inspiration to all  of us who believe people should be free  to speak their minds and express their  opinions.  Mr . . Solzhenitsyn has been expelled  from the Soviet Union because the Gov ernment of that country does not dare  to let people say what they believe. The  leaders of the Russian people are afraid  . of freedom and they do not know how to  deal with a person who refuses not to  be free.  Alexander Solzhenitsyn deserves our  admiration and applause and we, as a  people should do everything we can to  make sure he does not suffer any more  harassment.  Mr. Solzhenitsyn must now  decide  where he will live. If he chooses to re side in the United States or to visit this  country, I believe we should permit him  to enter without delay.  As  the chairman of the House Sub committee on Immigration, Citizenship  and  International Law,  I  have asked  Attorney General William Saxbe to proc ess any application for entry into this  country as quickly as possible. At this  time I enter into the RECORD my letter to  the Attorney General:  FEBRUARY 13, 1974.  '  Hon. WILLIAM B. SAXBE,  Attorney General, Department of Justice,  Washington, D.a.  DEAR MR. ATI'ORNEY GENERAL: The press has  reported today that Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn  has been  forcibly  exiled  from  the Soviet  Union and is presently in West Germany.  Mr. Solzhenitsyn, a Nobel prize winner, has  been the object of severe persecution and  harassment by  the Soviet Government for  expressing his beliefs about the actions of  that Government.  In the event Mr. Solzhenitsyn applies for  conditional entry to the United States under  the provisions of se<:tion 203(a) (7) of the  Immigration and Nationality Act, I request  that your office consider this request as ex peditiously as possible.  I believe that the circumstances surround ing Mr. Solzhenitsyn's situation bring him  within the purview and intent of this sec tion of the Immigration and Nationality Act,  to offer entry into the United States to per sons who have been forced to depart from a  Communist country ""because of perseeution  or fear of persecution on account of race,  religion, or political opinion:   With best wishes,  Sincerely yours,  JosHuA EILBERG, Chairman.

61,,93,-0.597,834,3,Ms. ABZUG.," Mr. Speaker, the Wash ington Post has just reported the results  of a study conducted by Drs. Richard C.  Hall and William C. Simmons on the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  psychological disturbances suffered by  Vietnam POW wives. The doctors dis covered guilt feelings among the wives  about their own ambivalent feelings con cerning their husbands' return.  Hall and Simmons said:  Any expression of negative feeling toward  their husbands was  treated  by  families,  neighbors and  the military community as  signs of unfaithfulness or cruelty.  They said the suppressed anger and  resultant guilt were channeled into vari ous medical complaints that increased  their sense of inadequacy and hopeless ness.  In view of the results of this study,  I urge those of my colleagues who have  not yet joined in cosponsoring the Viet nam Veterans and Dependents Psycho logical Readjustment Assistance Act to  do so now. The act directs the Adminis trator of Veterans' Affairs to initiate and  carry out a special psychiatric, psycho logical, and counseling program for vet erans of the Vietnam era, especially for mer prisoners of war, and their depend ents who are experien~ing psychological  problems as the result of  the military  service performed by such veterans. We,  as a Nation, cannot a:fford to delay aid to  those who so selflessly sacrificed yea.rs of  their lives to the service of their country.  For the benefit of my colleagues, I am  inserting the Washington Post article,  ""POW Wives Shown in Severe Stress,""  and my bill, H.R. 10882 in the RECORD:  [From the Washington Post, Feb. 17, 1974]  POW WIVES SHOWN  IN  SEVERE  STRESS  (By Al Rossiter. Jr.)  A study of 11 prisoner of war wives who  sought psychiatric help showed they felt os tracized by both the military and civilian  communities.  Drs. Richard c. w. Hall and William c.  Simmons said their research indicated that  the POW family was often in need of psy chiatric help but that it was only reluctantly  offered by  their physician and seemed  to  have a significant stigma. attached to it.  The two psychiatrists, then attached to a  naval hospital and writing in a recent issue  of the Archives of Genera.I Psychiatry, said  the 11 women studied exuerienced increasing  psychic disturbances as the Vietnam war be gan to wind down.  Their major concern, the report said, was  their ambivalence concerning their husband's  return and the subsequent guilt that this  feeling caused. Their conflicts were high lighted by their inab11ity to express, even to  one another. the anger they felt.  ""Any expression of negative feeling toward  their husbands was  treated  by  fa.mllles,  neighbors and  the military community as  signs of unfaithfulness or cruelty,'' Hall  and Simmons said. They said the suppressed  anger and resultant guilt were channeled  into various medical complaints  that  in creased their sense of inadequacy and hope lessness.  The report said a wife's opposing feelings  about her husband were  compounded by  the uncertainty of what he would be like  when he returned home. She wondered 1f he  would stlll find her desirable and she him,  would he support the major decisions she  had made  in his absence, and should she  have gotten a divorce?  All of the POW wives studied faced severe  problems of sexual role adjustment, Hall and  Simmons said. They said  the women were  not viewed as individuals but as stereotypes.  ""The military community was most likely  to regard them as vamps,"" the report said.  February 20, 1974  ""Fellow military wives viewed them with sus picion and in many cases overt distrust. All  of the wives in this study reported that after  an initial period of 'social mourning,' which  lasted a.bout six months, they were politely  dropped from the mllitary's informal social  rolls.  ""They differed from the war widow since  male companions could not be  invited  to  parties as their dates. Men who chatted with  them in more than a cursory manner were  considered by the rest of the group to be out  of line. Other wives considered them 'on the  prowl.'  ""The civilian community tended to regard  the POW wife as an a.sexual superwoman,  virtuous  to  a  fault, honest,  trustworthy,  frigid, and unaffected by  loneliness in  the  case of honor. This image persisted, however,  only so  long as the POW wife refused all  male acquaintanceship.''  Hall and Simmons said the wives sought  treatment as a group and set strong taboos  against members seeking  individual  treat ment. One group sought help when one wife  attempted suicide and the other sought treat ment when one woman was hospitalized  when she no longer was able to cope with her  problems.

As what we like to call civilization con tinues to encroach upon the habitats of  many endangered species, many of these  species will become extinct, and their few  survivors will be found only in zoos. We  have the responsibility to see that zoos  become more than ""a few feet of con crete and steel,"" and that animals are  given the space they need in order to  live and breed.  My bill, H.R. 12047, would provide  funds for the proper development of zoos  and aquariums into appropriate homes  for these creatures, many of whom will  no longer be able to. exist elsewhere.

'  In my effort to get straight answers and  prompt action to enq this problem, I have  me~ with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger  on the complex global energy picture, with  Energy Chief William Simon and many of  his subordinates on the details of the fuel  allocation, with Governor Byrne  on  the  State's responsibility in this crisis, and with  hundreds of my  fuel  supplying and con suming constituents in the Second District.  My mail is almost exclusively related to  the energy crisis with communications about  impeachment a.nd other Congressional activi ties  taking a back seat to this overriding  public concern on energy matters.  First, though, I a.m just as suspicious as  everybody else that greed and political mo tives by a handful of powerful people  is  involved somehow in our present sad energy  situation,  there  is no doubt  that energy  shortages exist a.nd that it will be some time  before things get back to normal, whatever  that is.  ARAB OIL EMBARGO  There is also no question that the Arab  oil embargo ha.s aggravated our energy short age problems. I am fortunate to have had the  opportunity to confer once again with Sec retary of State Henry Kissinger on Thurs day, February 14th, which was the morning  after he  completed  the  historic meeting  of the fourteen leading oil consuming na   tions of the world here in Washington, D.C.  Mr. Kissinger was very much to the point.  He restated our national position that we  cannot, should not and will not submit to  international blackmail, which  is precisely  what the Arabs are now attempting with the  oil embargo.  I strongly support this foreign policy. We  must never alter our foreign policy just be cause  some nation  threatens  to or actu ally does cut oft' the supply of a raw material  or product that we need. To do so wo:uid open  the door to a logrolling contest around the  world that would destroy America's peMe keeping  in:fiuence  and  our  economic  integrity.

I  in clude the editorial in the RECORD at this  point:  Every boy who ever went barefoot, then  ate and ate while he got thinner and thin ner, knows what a  tapeworm  is. Webster  says a tapeworm is a parasite that feeds from  the energy meant for man. The United States  has an 18 minute tapeworm. It is a parasite  in the gut of the nation, eating away at the  energy of confidence of our people.  It is difficult to understand the unhealthy  :fascination we have with the missing 18 min ut~s on one White House tape. Less than one  year ago we c""'dn't even know such a  tape  existed. Out of literally hundreds of tapes,  public attention has zeroed  in on one especially  the 18-minute  segment of one  tape.  Watergate was quieting down, people were  becoming bored with the entire affair. Then   the nation caught its tapeworm again. Fur ther  indictments o:f  former White House  staffers became a certainty and talk of im peachment of the President revived. This is  an  interesting bit of psychology. The tape  existed before. The hum was there before;  But  six  experts  say  the  record key was  punched five and maybe nine times and all  at once the whole deal is big again. No doubt  the entire affair has been bungled politi cally-and by the President. But there has  not been one shred o:f solid evidence that  would tie Richard Nixon to either Watergate,  the cover up nor the 18 missing minutes on  the  tape. Should  the fate of The United  States hang on 18 minutes of tape? We said  editorially one year ago, that Mr. Nixon was  wrong in the way he was  trying to ignore  Watergate. But being wrong politically  is  not a crime.  Scholars a.re arguing whether or not the  President can be indicted. This is a symptom  of how sick our tapeworm has made us, for  up to now there is no evidence that he has  committed an indictable offense. Even if such  were proven, he could not be indicted. Under  the Constitution, the President is above ordi nary law in his conduct of the Presidency.  The Constitution provides a special avenue  of impeachment by the House of Represent atives and then a  trial by  the Senate for  Presidents.  But such has been our deadly preoccu pation with possible wrong-doing  that we  ha:ve the cart before the horse. Even a com mon  criminal  is protected by  law prior to  and during grand jury proceedings. We have  not extended that courtesy to the President.  Night after night, the American people are  bombarded with new suggestions  that he  resign, be indicted or impeached. If he can not be solidly connected to a crime, if he  does not resign, if he is not impeached, the  national press  corps,  especially TV  comEMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES  HON. LEE H. HAMILTON  mentators will be sick at heart. They have  tried to make it so-heaven knows, they have  tried.  Mr. Nixon has mismanaged his relations  with the press. He has mismanaged the after math of  the Watergate affair. Perhaps he  mismanaged his campaign. But mismanage ment  is not an  impeachable offense. Mis management is a crime against Mr. Nixon  himself in which the penalty will be a blot  upon his page in history.  In the meantime, the nation should get  rid of its tapeworm, lest it sap the energy  we  so desperately need  to solve our  real  problems.  No more than 10 percent of ambulance  personnel have completed a basic 80hour training course considered by the  Department of Transportation to be es sential  for  ambulance workers. One  worker  in 20  has not  even  received  training in basic first aid.  In some States, doctors and other pas sersby are reluctant to off er assistance to  the injured because, if unsuccessful, they  are liable to suit.  In short,  the nationwide picture of  emergency medical services emerges as  woefully  inadequate. These  examples  could be multiplied, and  they demon- .  strate . the challenges confronting our  system of emergency medical care:  More planning and coordination of  EMS systems between local communities,  States and the Federal Government, and  between health agencies within the com IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  munity,  to  avoid  fragmentation  and  Wednesday, February 20, 1974  duplication.

Because Congress was in recess,  the  Members of this great body were unable  to properly observe the day. We ought,  nonetheless,  to  call  attention  to  the  plight of the people of Lithuania and its  sister republics, Estonia and Latvia. The  lights of freedom for the Baltic nations  were  extinguished  in 1940, when  the  Communists seized their lands.  In theory these countries are still free  members of the family of nations, be cause the United States has never recog nized  their forcible annexation by  the  Soviet Union. In cold reality,  they are  colonies of international communism.  Mr. Speaker, let us hope and pray that  independence will some day soon become,  not a fiction, but a reality. Lithuania and  its people have suffered greatly through  the centuries. May God speed the day  when their anguished cries for deliver ance from oppression will be answered.  VICE PRESIDENT? HIS FANS GO FOR  IT, BUT NOT H. B. G.  HON. OLIN E. TEAGUE  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 20, 1974  ",1974
66,,93,-0.102,873,3,Mr. TEAGUE.," Mr. Speaker, I submit  to you the second in a series of five arti cles about Congressman HENRY B. GON ZALEZ. My friend and colleague was f ea tured in the San Antonio Express and  News between January 7 and January  10 by Mr. Jim McCrory.  The second of five parts follows:  VICE PRESmENT? His FANS Go FOR IT, BUT  NoT H.B. G.  (By James McCrory)  Henry B. for V.P. !  When 8a.n Antonio businessman Bill Sin kin lofted a  trial balloon this year in that  direction, it drew a quick rejoinder from the  congressman.  ""What have you got against me?"" ""I didn't  even know you were mad at me.""  Bumper stickers urging Gonz.alez for Vice  President had surfaced in both 1968 and 1972  in Texas and Arizona, and Gonzalez killed  the boomlets in both yea.rs.  NOT HIS CALLING  While the congressman may not hold the  Vice Presidency in the exact same light as  former Vice President John Na.nee Garner  who more than once compared it to ""a pitch~  er of warm --,"" he doesn't feel the Vice  Presidency would be his bag.  ""I wouldn't have it on a bet,"" Gonzalez  reports.  In  the wake o!  former Vice President  Spiro Agnew's <Usabllity, Gonzalez !eels the  Vice Presidency is even less appealing than  at its unappealing best.  ""Legislative advocacy  ls my field,"" Gon zalez assesses. ""I'm trained for it, and happy  in it. It is the height of honor.""  The height of his ambition. Gonzalez as serts, was the Texas Senate, but he couldn't  live with the pay, $4,800 a year. But even at  that, it beat the $1,040 a year he was draw ing as a city councilman prior to moving  on to the Senate in 1956.  THE PAY IS BETTE&  ""The pay in the Senate ts piece work pay,""  Gonzalez says, ""while the pay in the U .s.  House is union scale.""  The Senate, with 31 members, 1s small  3667  enough to allow individual members with  :flair, personality, and even ability, to shine,  certainly a more difficult feat in a national  House body with 435 members.  When Gonzalez went  to  the House  in  1961, the pay was $22,500 a. year. It was since  raised to $42,500 a year, and Gonzalez this  year voted for a bill, which  failed, which  would have hiked the pay by some $10,000.  It is not generally known, but Gonzalez  had decided that he wasn't going to stay in  the State Senate past 1962. With a wife and  eight children, he  just couldn't affo1d the  luxury, much as he liked the work.  ALMOST QUrr POLITICS  to  It was  the third time he came close  quitting politics and moving into business.  The other two times ca.me while he was  serving on the City Council in the mid-50s,  trying  to sustain himself, a wife, and six  children on $1,040 a year.  If Gonzalez had been  less successful  in  his first venture into politics in 1950 for the  Texas House, he probably wouldn't have been  bitten by the political bug and continued in  politics at all. But  in that race,  running  countywide, he managed to get into a runoff  with Stanley Banks Jr., losing by about 2.000  votes.  He ran that race largely on a $200 bank  loan on the family jalopy, $100 of which went  to pay his filing fee. He ran for Place 3  for  the good and simple reason that his birth day fell on May 3, just as he was to announce  for  the State Senate later on his fortieth  birthday.  His  largest  single  contribution  ca.me from an American of Japanese descent,  Tony Kawazoe, a restaurant owner who do nated. $50.  in 1950  NO VOTES IN BARS  It was  in that campaign  that Gonzalez  decided it was neither healthy, nor produc tive,  to campaign in bars.  Dropping in to see a  tavern operator who  had voiced some interest in putting up some  Gonzalez campaign signs, Gonzalez  intro  duced  himself. A  patron  sitting  nearby,  brooding over a succession of beers about a  brother recently dispatched to the peniten tiary by Dist. Atty. Prosecutor M. c. Gon zales, mistook Gonzalez for Gonzales.  He whipped out a switchblade knife and  started after Gonzalez, and the candidate de parted  the premises  through  the  screen  door-without opening the door.  While Gonzalez was campaigning in an other bar, an impromptu survey showed that  only a. small percentage of the people in. the  bar even had a poll tax.  BAN ON POLL TAX  (When Gonzalez raised his right hand to  take the oath of om.ce as Congressman of the  2oth district in 1961, he had in his left hand  a b111 to abolish the poll tax. That proposal  subsequently was incorporated into the Vot ing Rights Act of 1965, and the poll tax has  been abolished as a prerequisite for voting,  not only on the national level but the state  as well.)  Three San Antonio millionaires-Al Jer gins, Strauder Nelson, and Morris Kallison sought him out to run on a  ticket tor the  City Council in 1953. It was the first, and  the last time he was to run on a  ticket.  Gonzalez was the only Mexican-American  on the San Antonians ticket, and he was  running against George de la Garza, a mem ber of the Citizens Committee  ticket. The  Citizens also had a second Mexican-Ameri can on its 9-member slate, Ruben Lozano.  WITHOUT RUNOFF  When the dust. had settled after the first  election, Gonzalez and Mayor Jack White  had been elected without a runotf. The other  seven won the runoff, with Gonzalez helping  Mrs. E.

I note this bill does not get into the  question of how much we are cutting or  methods of forest land cutting now  in  litigation.  However, forests that are not replanted  will not produce new trees. Not only is  the Forest Service budget insufficient to  increase the growth of timber on land  previously cutover or burned, but the  funds are also insufficient to keep plant ing and stand improvement apace of cur rent levels of cutting.

71,,93,0.459,1120,3,Mr. HUBER.," Mr. Speaker, the Febru ary 10, 1974. Chicago Tribune contains  excerpts from an excellent speech by  the Honorable Julius Hoffman,  senior  judge of the U.S. District Court in Chi cago. Judge Hoffman takes note of the  decline of great oratory in this country.  This is partially true because, in this day  and age, it seems that a speech has to be  ""with it"" and use popular catch words  and phrases. The answer. says Judge  Hoffman, is for our speechmakers to stop  being so condescending toward their au diences and, instead, give them due credit  for their native intelligence.  Since all of us here often have to give  speeches, I would highly recommend that  my colleagues pay particular attention  to Judge Hoffman's remarks. I have al ways believed that the best speeches are  made with the simplest words, and Judge  Hoffman's comments once again prove  the validity of that claim:  FROM  !rHB MOUTHS OJ' NEARLY EVERYBODY:  GABBLE  ls excerptecl from a  young  (By Julius J.

This notion which seems to be prevalent  today, may have sprung from an unflattering  estimate of the intelligence of +.he average  audience and a peculiar feeling that the use  of fine language is a form of snobbery. Collo quialism seems to be equated. with democ racy and used. like a too-familiar slap on the  back, to convey the idea that a speaker and  his listeners are buddies.  There are other possibilities, of course. It  may oo that speakers do not choose to be col loquial and commonplace but that they have  no choice since they never learn,ed. to be any thing else.  Our schools, in other words, have not done  enough to help future speakers acquire the  broad background, the literary appreciation,  the ha.bits of mind, and the verbal skill that  went into many speeches in the past.  It cannot be  said  that no memorable  speeches have been made in r~cent years. The  trouble is that there have been too few and  that the national average has dropped  too  low. Surely it is time for a revival of an old  a.rt.  There is no reason to believe that Amer icans today are inferior to their ancestors and  unable to produce speakers worthy ot being  called orators.  Given enough good speeches we might de velop a national taste for them.  There  is nothing wrong with either the  hope that the public will aga.in begin to ex pect good oratory or faith in the innate abil ity of Americans to cultivate 1t, but copious  charity might reduce the incentive.  We have a right to expect good sense and  comparative eloquence on the part of speak ers from the elementary school valedictorian  to the headliner at a university commence ment. We have a right to expect great words  from men who occupy places of great impor tance.  exactness, cla.rity, and grace. It 1s neither a  medley of sweet sounds nor a composition  that cannot be fully comprehended. until it  '8 analyzed in a. graduate sem1nar4  Ore.at oratozy combines grandeur or nobil ity of thought with grandeur or nobility of  expression. The  thought 1s paramount, of  . course, but stirring thoughts are robbed of  their power when clothed in weak words and.  trite phrases. This is easily demonstrated by  rewriting any pie.ce of fine prose in pedes trian language.  See what happens when we paraphrase  Churchill's ""I have nothing to offer but blood,  toil, tears, and sweat."" Would. he have stirred  the British people, if he had said, ""I can't  promise  you  folks  anything  except  that  you're going to have to fight, work, cry, and.  perspire?""  To be sure, few men have Churchill's gift  of words; but any statesman or other leader  should speak at least as eloquently as a man  who broadcasts a weather report.  Campaign speeches are only a small part  of our annual output of oratory, pseudo oratory,  a.nd.  plain  gabble.  Lawyers  and  judges along talk so much that libraries are  obliged to build additions to hold the printed  records of their words.  If the churches should undertake to place  all  the  sermons delivered.  in  the United.  States one on top of the other the pile would  soon reach the pearly gates. And then there  are all of those speeches that are  injected  into that continued story called.  the Con gressional Record.  It is unlikely that the most careful search  of  all  these works would  reveal many  . speeches that would do credit to Henry Clay  -or Patrick Henry. Today,  instead of  their  lucid English, many speakers talk some pro fessional jargon or outrageous combinations  of jargons interspersed with popular catch words and ready-made expressions.  These  labor-saving devices that relieve a  speaker of the chore of ferreting out just  the right words and putting them together  with precision. They also enable the speaker  to demo µstrate  his familiarity with high-style speech; but in their inexactness and.   ostentation the cliches and reuse of phrases  are not very clifferent from the old. Fourth  of  July speaker's resounding but hollow  words.

Many others  write that they want to continue their  way of life, but want assurances that the  free enerprise sysem still works. I hope  all my colleagues will consider the plight  of many who are willing to put out the ef fort to succeed-if given the chance.  The following letter expresses this type  of attitude:  DEAR Sm: This  letter  is written after I  realized that only the silent will feel empty.  I,  for one, have been patient and silent  for far too long.  Having been raised as a middle class Chris tian I have always felt, and still do, that our  leaders are to be trusted and respected. I  have always strived to make educated deci sions at the election polls.  My wife and I, both under 30 with two  young children, have owned and operated a  200-head dairy in Sparr for  just under a  year. The preceding eight years, since grad uating with an economics degree,  I  have  managed an export business and large dairies  with extensive travel and exposure to thou sands of people and have got to know them  in their earthy ways. In that time I have  seen slow but distinct changes.  As a people it appears that we have lost  respect for other humans and their rights.  A recent visit with numerous teenagers was  an awakening experience to their lack of re spect for others as well as their own personal  self. They also seemed to have an uncanny  sense of the wrongs in our world and are  all too ready to indulge in escape. There can  be little doubt as  to the growing  lack of  faith in our system and the people acting as  executors of the system.  As an economic state, there would appear  to be many shortcomings and much  lack  of confidence.  I am daily confronted with  people who are disheartened because hard  work and honesty have resulted in little, if  any, gain and for some, failure. In my own  industry, dairymen have killed cows at an  alarming rate: 350,000 less cows in one year  with a  total of only 1-0 million. Total milk  production was down 4% for the :first time  in seventeen years. Many dairymen across  the nation have simply closed down and sold  their cattle or, worse yet, butchered them to be lost forever! American dairymen have  established practically every bench mark in  dairying efficiency, production, and quality  of cattle. Almost every  foreign country  is  eager to buy our breeding cattle. One Amer ican political move that bothers me greatly is  our wheat sales to Russia and other coun tries. We lower our wheat reserves to noth ing, the bakers raise bread prices, and house wives and workmen demand more pay. With  wheat gone all other grains compete at high  prices to produce milk, meat, eggs, etc. our  3927  feed costs have gone up nearly 35 % in five  months. In order to cover our fixed costs we  have had to add more cows and work harder,  with the result being we are continuing to  make  less  return on more  investment  in  money and labor.  I have a wish that America will continue  to be the greatest of all nations; my wife and  I love America. We are also proud to have the  official highest producing herd in the state.  We're striving to show confidence in our sys tem of government; we publicly show that  confidence by not shrinking. We want  to  grow, and we're putting our money where  our mouth is.  I have a dream that my son, if he wishes  to, will someday own our dairy and continue  to serve his fellow Americans. Can my dream  come true or are all the people who are down  on our system  right? If you dare, please  answer.  I remain respectfully yours,  JAY PATRICK LANCASTER.  Too many of our small farmers, dairy men cattlemen are selling out  to  the  bigtime operators. Every tax break pos sible;  every consideration necessary should be given to the preservation of the  small farmer. Never should we be in the  position of having to depend on just a  handful of huge farm corporations for  our necessary food supplies. Mr. Speaker,  I hope all my colleagues will join me in  promising Mr. Lancaster and thousands  like him across  this country  that his  dream for his son will come true-that  we, the the representatives of the people  will allow no less.

74,,93,-0.028,1133,3,Mr. GUDE.," Mr. Speaker, February 24  marks the 56th anniversary of the decla ration of independence of the Republic  of Estonia, now under Soviet control. Let  me take this opportunity to salute the  bravery of the Estonian people, so long  under an illegal Soviet occupation.  Although Estonia's most recent period  of independence dates from this century,  the history of the people is far older, oc cupation of the Baltic coast going back  several  thousand years. These  years,  however, have been stormy ones as Es tonia and its sister republics of Latvia  and Lithuania have constantly had to  struggle against  invasions  threatening  the very existence of the three nations  against invasions  threatening the very  existence of the three nations. Long sub jugation to Czarist Russian was finally  broken by Estonia's declaration of inde pendence in 1918.  This was followed by the swift creation  of a modern, viable state and economy,  only to have peace and prosperity again  shattered by the Russian occupation of  1940.  Throughout these many onslaughts on  their country the Estonians have fought  bravely. What is most remarkable has  been their ability to maintain their cul ture and national integrity against all  odds.  ",1974
75,,93,-0.477,1146,3,Mr. HARRINGTON.," Mr. Speaker, the  plight of our Nation's fishing industries  is indeed critical. Productivity in the in dustry has declined, while, at the same  time, consumption of seafood has  in creased. As a result, there is a serious  impending shortage of seafood.  The National Commission on Produc tivity published a pamphlet which points  out the gravity of this problem and the  immediate need  to establish  research  and development projects.  I insert that publication in the RECORD  at this time for the information of my  colleagues:  PRODUCTIVITY  IN THE FISHING INDUSTRY  Man has harvested the fruits of the sea  almost since the very beginning of mankind  itself. Since that time we have considered the  wealth of  the  seas  to be  free  and  inex haustible resources--just there for the tak ing. The sea was a  limitless ""farm"" from  which we could reap many crops without  ever having to sow or even cultivate them.  As the world's population increased so did  the a.mount of fl.sh, shellfish and crustaceans  Which were harvested.  Indeed,  the  total  world catch of seafood more than doubled  between 1950 and 1970, expanding from 18.1  million metric tons to 42.8 million mertic  tons. During  the same period  the world's  population  increased by only 46 percent.  There has seemed  to be no  limit  to  the  bounty of the sea..  However, it is increasingly apparent that  this rate of increase cannot continue. The  maximum sustainable yield,  i.e.,  the most  fl.sh which can be harvested without de pleting the breeding stock, ls being reached.  or even surpassed for the desirable and even  some of the less desirable species. We are  rapidly approaching a  time when we will  have  to make conscious decisions  to  in crease  the supplies of sea.food or else be  prepared  to  accept  limited  consumption.  This problem has already confronted  the  fisheries industry in the United States. Dur ing  the  same period  in which  the world  catch of fish was increasing, our domestic  catch of edible sea.food has actually been  decreasing. The  total  domestic  catch  of  edible sea.food in 1950 was 1.5 million metric  tons;  the  figure  for 1972 was 1.0 million  metric tons.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  February 21, 1974  THE IMPORTANCE OF PRODUCTIVITY  In  light of  this problem of decreasing  domestic catches of seafood, productivity in  the fisheries industry assumes an importance  it has never held before. Productivity for this  industry can be defined in three basic ways.  First, the amount of seafood harvested by  an average fisherman during a year's work  gives a major indication of how productive  this industry is. For example, if he now har vests less fish than he did 20 years ago, for  the same amount of effort, then his produc tivity has decreased.  The second measure of productivity in this  industry is the amount of capital which it is  necessary to invest to harvest a given amount  of seafood. If the average fishing vessel opera tor used to be able to harvest 27 tons of sea food per year with an investment of $50,000,  but now must  invest $100,000  simply  to  maintain the 27 ton harvest, then the pro ductivity of his capital has been halved.  Third, we can consider the productivity of a  given area of the sea. For example, the num ber  of  pounds  of  blue  crabs  harvested  annually per acre of the Chesapeake Bay is  an important measure of how well we are  utilizing that area.  These then are the three major ways of  measuring the productivity of the fisheries  industry. And if the available data. and in formation are examined, it quickly becomes  apparent that our fisheries performance by  all three measures has been declining at a.  time when such performance can be  least  afforded.  The  figures  for man-year  productivity  accurately  reflect  the  overall  decline  in  production of seafood which  the U.S. has  experienced. Following  a.  period of steady  improvement in the 1950's and early 1960's,  man-year productivity decreased by 20.2 per cent between 1962 and 1971. In other words,  in 1971  it took six man-years of work  to  harvest the same amount of fish brought in  with five man-years of work in 1962. Maine  lobsterman, for example, now use three times  as many  lobster  traps  to catch  the same  number of lobsters as before. These extra  traps mean more time and money expended.  Although similar hard data on the produc tivity of capita.I  in this  industry are not  available, some observations can be made.  While the annual catch of seafood has re.  mained fairly stable during the past 7 years,  the costs for many types of fishing vessels  have doubled during that period. In 1965 an  average-sized tuna vessel cost approximately  $1 million; a tuna fishing vessel operator can  now expect  to pay about $2 million.  In  addition  the  introduction of  such  tech nological advances as sonar and other fl.sh  locating devices, as well as  improved nets  and other harvesting  improvements, have  substantially  increased  the capital  invest ment which our commercial fishing vessel  operators must make. The productivity of  the capital employed  in this  industry has  declined.  It is even more difficult to try to assess the  productivity of a given area of the sea. How ever, weekend  fishermen  from Sheepshead  Bay on Long Island, to Panama City, Florida,  to San Diego, California, know that they now  travel farther from shore to catch the same  amount, or less, of fish. Oommercia.l fisher men have also experienced this. New England  ground, or bottom, fish fisherman must now  fish a larger area for longer periods, and they  stiH have trouble maintaining  their catch  of the desirable ground  fish such as cod,  haddock and flounder. The productivity of  the closer-in areas has declined.  THE U.S. BITE OUT OF WORLD SEAFOOD  PRODUCTION  While the productivity and production of  the U.S. fishing industry has declined, the  consumption of seafood has increased ste.ad ily. In 1960 we ate 1.94 million metric tons  of sea.food; in 1970 we consumed 2.82 million  metric tons-an increase of almost 45 per cent. Because our production of seafood was  only 1.15 million metric tons in 1970, it is  obvious that we had to buy the rest from  other countries.  In fact we imported 59.9 percent of our  seafood in 1971. In 1950 we imported only  23.4 percent of it. Although the U.S. is less  than 6 percent of the world's population  and catches a.bout 2.5 percent of the total  world catch of seafood, we consume about 7  percent of the world's seafood production.  The American appetite for seafood  is fur ther illustrated by looking at our consump tion of the more desirable species. In 1970  we ate: 66 percent of the world lobster catch,  60 percent of the clam, 79 percent of the  scallop and 43 percent of  the world  tuna  catch.  We like our seafood and have been willing  to pay the prices for it in the world market.  This willingness to pay, however,  led to a  seafood  trade deficit of approximately $1.1  billion in 1972. That is, we  imported $1.1  billion more of seafood than we exported.  This area alone accounted for one-fifth of  our total balance of trade deficit  in 1972.  While not a new situation-in 1950 we had a.  seafood trade deficit of $139 million-it is a  worsening one. Improvements in our fishing  industry could have a positive effect on our  trade balance.  PRICES  Another result of the rising demand in the  face of a fixed supply has been rapid price  increase for fish, especially since 1960. Fish  used to be an inexpensive meat substitute,  but in the last several yea.rs many species of  fish have increased in price so rapidly that  they have risen above beef prices. For ex ample, in 1960 chuck roast sold for around  $.62 per pound and frozen haddock fillets  were about $.56 per pound. By 1973 the price  per pound for the chuck roast had risen to  $1.01 while the price per pound for the had dock had more than doubled, re.aching $1.21.  As we have become more affluent and pop ulous, our demand for all types of food has  increased rapidly. And, although the prices  of all foods have risen substantially in the  last several years (19.2 percent between 1968  and 1972)  the prices of seafood have risen  twice as fa.st  (39.7 percent during the same  period). While  farm  foods have benefited  from the steady increase of agricultural pro ductivity which has helped offset the rapid  increase in demand, the productivity of the  fisheries industry has not performed as well.  On an annual average, productivity in agri   culture increased by about 7 percent a year  between 1960 and 1971. In the fisheries in dustry, productivity declined by about 2 per cent a year during that time.  But the rest of the food  industry is not  faced with the problem of trying to meet  soaring demand from a  fixed supply base.  If demand for wheat goes up, the farmers  can always plant more wheat (though it may  take a while for this supply increase to have  an effect on the market). Fishermen, at least  at this time, have no such option.  Thus, our fishermen are working harder,  investing more and producing less. The re sults have been ever-increasing reliance on  imports and rapidly increasing prices. One  major problem  is supply. It  is harder  to  harvest fish because there is less to harvest- less, that is, of the species we like and less  in our coastal waters. There are two basic  approaches  to solving  this problem of  in   creasing the supplies of seafood: first, there  is the exciting potential of mariculture, the  cultivating of shrimp,  lobster, salmon and  other species in controlled environments in  order to  increase their survival rates;  sec ond, we can begin to explore ways of ex   panding consumer acceptance through mar ket development for other species which are  currently underutilize~.  The second major problem is the existence  of inefficient practices in the fishing Indus  ",1974

It is very fitting that so many of my  colleagues in the Congress have taken  the time to commemorate this day. It is  a day when we should take time to com mend the Lithuanian people, and to re mind the world that the struggle  for  freedom and justice continues in this be leaguered nation, as it seeks to reestab lish independence and self-government.  On February 16, 1918, the Lithuanian  nation declared its independence. This  is  the goal  for which  the Lithuanian  people had been striving throughout a  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  long period of Russian domination. Yet  after only  two short decades of inde pendence, Lithuania again  fell under  Russian domination when it was declared  a constituent republic of the U.S.S.R. on  August 3, 1940. Then following the Ger man attack on  the Soviet Union 10  months  later, Lithuania. was  in Nazi  hands until  reoccupied by  the Soviet  Army in 1944. Since that time, Lithu ania has been considered by the Soviet  Union as a component republic.  Propaganda from the U.S.S.R. would  try to assure the West that the Lithu anian people a.re delighted with  their  satellite status and the Soviet methods of  farming and industrial techniques have  brought about economic growth never  dreamed of in Lithuanian history. The  citizens of the free world know that this  is but a sham. We know the Lithuanians  like so many Russian satellite nations  consist of people yearning to be free of  this oppressive yoke of the Russians.  The spirit of Lithuanian independence  is not dead, and with the emergence of  a new era of peace and cooperation in  the world, the Russian nation may yet  begin to yield their grip on the Lithu anians. We honor and salute the brave  people of Lithuania, and assure  them  that we in the United States share and  support them in their efforts  to taste  freedom.  ADDRESS AND POEMS BY HON.  WILLIAM S.

77,,93,0.08,1159,3,Mr. CARTER.," Mr. Speaker, each week  it is my distinct pleasure  to  join my  colleagues at the Congressional Prayer  Breakfast and to benefit from their many  insightful experiences and  thoughts. I  want to take this opportunity to share  with the Members of this body a. parti cularly inspiring address delivered by the  distinguished  gentleman  from Maine  <Mr. COHEN) at the Congressional Prayer  Breakfast on December 6, 1973.  I  especially want  to point out, Mr.  Speaker, that at the conclusion of the  address are a number of poems authored  by ",1974
78,,93,0.1,1159,3,Mr. COHEN.," I believe that these poems'  expressions and creative use of words  tend to add new depth and meaning to  our senses and perceptions. I am sure  that my colleagues will treasure the beau ty of these poems as much as I.  The material follows:  ADDRESS BY CONGRESSMAN WILLIAM S. COHEN  BEFORE TBE CONGRESSIONAL PRAYER BREAK   FAST, MEMBERS DINING ROOM, DECEMBER 6,  1973  Last week, a young political science student  called and asked me a series of questions as a  part of a survey he was doing. He asked me if  I considered myself to be a religious person.  My answer was yes. He then asked, ""Do you go  to church every week?"" I answered no. He  then finally asked, ""Does your political career  take precedent over your religious beliefs or  practices?"" My response was and is: No, be cause  they a.re often one and  the  same.  I  remember what Thomas  Jefferson once  wrote in a letter to a friend.  3953  ""I never did, or countenanced in public  life, a single act inconsistent with the strict est good faith; having never believed that  there was one code for a public and another  for a private man.""  The same principles that we believe in as  private men serve us no end if we do not  practice  them as public officials and  it  is  within this context that I would like to talk  to you this morning.  On the way into Washington this morning  I thought of a need to try to gain some per spective on  the seemingly  insoluble prob lems, governmental, social as well as theo logical, that confront us.  I was reminded of the legend about Rabbi  Schneur Zalman, a great Hassidic rabbi of  the late 18th century who was imprisoned on  false charges. While awaiting trial, he was  visited by the local chief of police. Impressed  with  the  rabbi's calm confidence and de meanor, the police chief frequently engaged  him in conversation and asked a. number of  questions that had puzzled him in reading  the Scriptures. Why was it, he asked, that a  God who was so omniscient, so omnipotent,  had to call out when Adam was hiding and  ask him, ""Where art thou?""  ""You do not understand the meaning of  the  question,'' Rabbi  Zalman  answered.  ""This is a. question God asks of every man  in every generation. After all of your wan derings, after all of your efforts, after all  your years, Oman, where art thou?""  Indeed, it is most appropriate, as people  in Washington like to say at this point in  time,  to ask the question as to where we  are-where we are going-as a nation, as  individuals.  We live in an age of doubt and disillusion ment, one in which we engage in self-criti cism almost daily, magnifying our errors  while muting our accomplishments. There is  a growing despair and distrust enveloping  our Government a.nd the men who serve in it.  recall that Warren G. Harding (I hesitate  to pluck his name from the pages of his tory) once said that government ls after all  a very simple thing. Supreme Court Justice  Felix Frankfurter  later noted  that ""there  never was a more pathetic misapprehension  of responsibility"" than in Harding's superfi cial conclusion. We  indeed know that gov ernment is not a simple thing, it's a. very  complex thing and it is one which requires  the dedication of our most gifted, idealistic  and capable men a.nd women. Indeed if a.ny  definition of government 1s  necessary,  it  seems to me that Governor Reagan was far  more accurate when he suggested that gov ernment is like a baby's alimentary canal.  It has a healthy appetite at one end and  little sense of responsibility at the other.  I speak in earnest and not in jest for never  in the history of this country have our peo ple been more concerned about, more crit ical of, more disenchanted with, or more  alienated from the very institutions which  exist to bring order, etllciency and service to  those whose dollars support them than they  are right now.  Prior to Watergate, if there ever was such  a time, national polls showed that on a. scale  of 20, the public ranked politicians 19th in  terms of trustworthiness and honesty, just  one cut above a used car salesman. This year  we have the distinction of being ranked 20th.  We are 11v1ng 1n ditllcult  times    the  bright light cast by the promise and  the  principles of America in a world so often  filled with darkness a.nd oppression suddenly  has been dimmed in the eyes of millions of  Americans and of those abroad. As noted by  one political observer, there seems to be a  ""spiritual plague"" spreading across our coun try. A recent survey disclosed that a major ity of people believe that America is in seri   ous trouble.  Thirty percent of those college students  interviewed said that things have gotten so  bad that they would prefer to live elsewhere.  I   ",1974

82,Senate,93,-0.483,1263,3,Mr. METCALF.," Mr. President, despite  all the problems associated with energy  shortages, and the Federal Government's  difficulty in dealing with them, there are  a  few heartening indications of  long overdue improvements in the regulation  of electric utilities. I ref er to action in  the various States, where much of the  regulatory responsibility rests.  Actions in the States on these mat ters often do not receive much atten tion here in Washington. They should,  and  today I wish  to call attention to  some of them which merit attention:  First. The chairman of the Wiscon sin Public Service Commission has picked  up  the ball on utility billing practices  which has been dropped by the National  Association of Utility Regulatory Com missioners. Members of this body may  recall that in April 1972, I withdrew my  amendment to apply provisions of the  Truth in Lending Act apply to regulated  utilities, after NARUC asked for deferral  and inferred that the State commissions  would study and rectify improper prac tices.  The NARUC study committee headed  by Oregon's Commissioner Diarmuid F.  O'Scannlain made an excellent report  and recommendations. Two NARUC con ventions having come and gone without  action, it may be necessary to provide a  Federal remedy-unless the State com missions follow the leadership of Com missioners such as Wisconsin's Chairman  William F. Eich.  Second. On this same point, the Mich igan Public Service Commission has pro posed  comprehensive  rules  governing  utility billing practices.  Third. Texas and South Dakota, which  along with Minnesota do not regulate  electric utilities, are attempting to set up  effective State regulatory bodies.  Fourth. The Public Utilities Commis sion in Ohio has ordered electric power  companies to cease promotional and ad vertising activities which  increase de mand for electric service.  And here in Washington at the Fed eral level-almost unnoticed in the other  energy stories-the Office of Energy Con servation is reported considering promul gation of Federal  lighting  standards.  They would  replace  the widely used  standards recommended by the Illumi nating Engineering Society,  the  lobby  composed of utility and appliance sales .men which has overlit and oversold en ergy consumers for decades.  These are  significant developments,  and I believe Members and other readers  of  the RECORD will be  interested and  heartened by details regarding these de velopments. Therefore, I ask unanimous  consent to print the following items in  the RECORD:  An article by Chairman William F.  Eich of  the Wisconsin Public Service  Commission,  ""Electric Utility  Credit  Practices Are Under Attack,"" which ap peared in the November-December 1973  issue of Public Power;  The January 10, 1974,  letter to me  from Michigan Public Service Commis sioner, William R. Ralls, and his enclosed  memo  regarding proposed revisions  in  billing and payment practices in Michi gan; and  Three articles in the February l, 1974,  issue of  the Electrical World, entitled  ""New Try for a Texas PUC,"" ""Did the  Ohio PUC Mean What It Said?"" and  ""Office of Energy Conservation Considers  Setting Federal Lighting Regulations.""  There being no objection, the material  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  ELEcTRrc UTrLrrY CREDrr PRACTJ:CES ARE  UNDER ATI'ACK  (By William F. Eich)  A great deal of attention is presently being  focused on utility credit practices involving  customer deposits, disconnections, late pay ment penalties and collection charges. Regu lat-ory commissions throughout the country  are being asked  to  take a new and fresh  look at the manner in which they, and the  utilities under their jurisdiotion, have tradi tionally approached these matters.  Just a few examples:  A complaint by a  76-year-old widow  Brooklyn, N.Y., has resulted in Consolidated  Edison Co. completely revamping its service  in  fi termination policies. Although the company  had discovered that the widow's landlord had  been diverting current through her meter,  Con Ed continued to bill her at the higher  rate. She refused to pay, and her service was  cut off. The Legal Aid Society took the mat ter to court, and Con Ed eventually agreed  to a new termination policy. Under the court approved agreement, notice of disconnection  must be given at least 10 days in advance.  The notice must specify the reasons for the  cutoff and inform the customer of the right  to an informal hearing by the company, as  well  as  the  right  to complain  to a  state  agency.  In North Carolina, the Utilities Commis sion conducted a  thorough investigation of  billing praictices and subsequently promul gated a Uniform Rule. Under the rule, all  regulated utilities  (this does not  include  municipals)  a.re  limited  to  imposing a  nance charge of 1 % per month on late pay ments, and the ""due and payable period"" is  increased to 25 days. Disconnections oonnot  be initiated until 15 days after the due date.  In Wisconsin, we recently announced the  start of a Commission investigation into the  deposit, guarantee and disconnect policies of  all public utilities-water, electric, gas and  telephone  (including municipal utilities).  Two petitions pending before our Commis sion, both filed by the State Attorney Gen eral, concern utility billing practices. One  asks the Commission to investigate the prac tice of net-gross billing, and the other asks  us to look into the matter of using one bill  for both utility service charges and mer chandising charges. Apparently, the feeling  is that this latter practice may deceive the  customer into believing that his utility serv ice may be shut off if he fails to pay a bill  for merchandise.  Several court cases, in Wisconsin and else where, have raised constitutional challenges  to the authority of a utility to terminate serv ice without a hearing. The judicial responses  in these cases has been anything but con sistent.  These are just a few examples of the various  fronts on which  the ongoing  assault on  utillty credit praictices is taking place.  Unquestionably,  this assault  is an out growth of the consumer rights movement;  but if the consumer advocates appear to be  particularly aggressive in the utility field, I  think it is understandable. Utility services  a.re no longer the luxury they were in Edi son's time. They are essential to our health  and safety, and yet they are so often taken  for granted-taken for granted, that is, un til we face possible loss of service. Then we  look around and realize that the utility we  are having  the dispute with  is  the only  available supplier of these essential services.  Confronted with such a situation, people  feel  helpless and  frustrated. The govern mental agencies created to protect the pub lic interest in the utility field are seen by  many  to be philosophically  indistinguish able from the utilities they are supposed to  regulate. And it is true, particularly in the  area of customer service policies,  that the  utilities have generally been permitted  to  exercise a great deal of discretion in formu lating  their own ground rules. Regulatory  guidelines,  to  the extent  they  exist,  are  usually phrased in broad, frequently vague  terms.  The  absence of detailed and published  credit rules and the apparent wide latitude  used in applying unwritten rules frequently  make  it difficult  to determine  just what  policy does exist in these areas. In Wiscon sin,  for  example, utilities may  require  a  deposit if they feel a particular customers'  credit standing  is not ""satisfactory."" That  deposit, by the way, need not be returned  for  three years-unless the customer (who  usually is totally unaware that he has such  an option) asks for it back after one year",1974
83,Senate,93,-0.42,1289,3,Mr. HARTKE.," Mr. President, there are  many  i5sues before  the Congress  this  year that are extremely important to the  people of the United States. The people  cry out for leadership which is commit to meeting  their needs, and  that  leadership can come  just as well from  the Congress as it can from the Presi dent.  Recently, I spoke before the legislative  committee of the Association of Private  Pension and Welfare Plans, Inc. My re marks were addressed to what I believe  to be some of the most important items  of unfinished business on the agenda of  Congress this year-private pension re form, social security reform, and the es tablishment of a national health insur ance program. These are issues which  affect every American.  There is a great fear among our popu lation  that  there will not be enough  money available to provide for retire ment years or that one major  illness  will bankrupt a family. These are fears  we can eliminate if we take advantage  of the legislative opportunity to provide  the type of leadership demanded of us  by the American people.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent  that the text of my  remarks be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the remarks  were ordered to be printed in the REC ORD, as follows:  STATEMENT BY  SENATOR VANCE HARTKE  CONGRESS AT THE CROSSROADS: OUR UNFINISHED  BUSINESS  Introduction  Nineteen seventy-four promises to be an  exciting year  in Washington, and the rea son for that excitement is by no means lim ited to Watergate.  Th~s is the year that there a.re many sub jects awaiting Congressional action including  the energy crisis, budget reform and aid to  education. But, most important of all, Con gress has the opportunity to enact legisla tion which deals with two long-unmet needs  of tens of millions of Americans. The first  of those two needs encompasses those public  and private programs which assure adequate  income for retired people; and the second  would ensure quality health ca.re for every one. What remains to be seen is whether or  not we will enact meaningful legislation.  On the first front, the Senate has already  passed private pension legislation, and the  House now appears on the brink of action.  I would like to share with you some of my  thoughts a.bout legislative proposals now be fore the Congress and what I would like to  see come out of the conference committee  on pensions.  The need for adequate pension reform  over the past nine years, I have introduced  a number of proposals aimed at providing  a degree of security for the millions of work ers enrolled in pension plans. Beginning with  termination  insurance  legislation and  in cluding the ""Federal Pension Plans Protec tion Act of 1973"", I have been motivated by  the conviction that every working man and  woman in the country deserves the dignity  and security of adequate means of support  for his or her retirement years.  I  am deeply disturbed  that some many  people still consider pension a  form of in surance  in which most must lose so that  some may gain. The proposals passed by the  Senate and pending before the House appear  based on this concept. In rejecting this no tion, I maintain that a. pension should not  be a game of chance.  Every year, millions of employees change or  lose jobs. They also lose the value of pension  credits unless  their pension plan provides  tha.t such credits ""vest"". Roughly one-fifth  to one-fourth of all plan participants have  no vesting rights at all. Although vesting is  very common, it usually requires ten or fif teen years of unbroken service with one com pany or one multi-employer plan. As a Sen ate  labor  subcommittee  study  showed,  ninety-three percent of employees separated  from plans requiring fifteen years for vest ing, seventy-eight percent of employees sep arated from plans requiring  ten years for  vesting and nothing to show for their pen sion participation.  Pension reform should rectify that dismal  showing-but the Senate-passed bill is weak  and the ways and means proposal weaker yet.  THE SENATE-PASSED BILL  Under the Senate-passed bill, an employee  separated under five years of credited service  would vest to the extent of twenty-five per cent of a regular retirement benefit, for ea.ch  additional year, vesting would improve five  percent until it reached fifty percent after  ten years. According to a recent survey, the  retirement benefit under typical blue collar  plans would be between four and six dollars  per month per year of service. Thus, an em ployee with a. plan paying five dollars per  month for each credited year of work who  was separated after five year, would be en titled to a benefit of twenty-five percent of  Twenty-five  dollars--or  six  dollars  and  twenty-five cents. That adds up to seventy five dollars a year-a rather paltry amount  by anyone's standards.  White collar plans tend to be figured on a  percentage of final or high average salary typically one or two percent times years of  service. So a person separated after five years  at a fifteen thousand dollar a. year job would  earn a vested credit of-not quite twenty-four  dollars a. month.  These  are  not  extreme  examples. The  amounts involved are small so as to cushion  the introduction of mandatory vesting. But,  as if that cushion were not enough, the man datory standards do not take effect before  1976 for any plan. For collectively bargained  plans, the effective date is the expiration of  a pre-enacted pension agreement or 1981.  Meanwhile, millions of employees will be  separated from pension-covered jobs.  The House Ways and Means bill  The ways and means bill embodies all these  delays but  incorporates  additional weak nesses of its own. Instead of one vesting for  mula, it permits the choice from three ap proved  formulas-the Senate version,  the  straight ten-year vesting, and the ""rule of  forty-five"" under which fifty percent vesting  occurs when age and credited service equal  forty-five and goes by ten percent annual  increments to one-hundred percent for com bined age-service total of fifty.  Such a choice enables a. company to pick  the lea.st expensive and lea.st protective for mula. With the ""rule of forty-five"" and a  purposely young work force, vesting could be  defeated at the additional cost of job oppor tunities for older Americans.  Beyond  that,  the ways and means bill  phases in vesting so that by 1976 only fifty  percent of the formula need apply. With ten  percent more each subsequent year. In other  words, the $6.25 and the $24 in benefits which  I described a moment ago could be cut in  half in 1976. And, as if that were not enough,  multi-employer  plans  could  seek  delays  beyond the described effective dates without  any specific time limit.  Pension plans now cover  less  than half  the civilian work force, seldom pay benefits  to widows, pay small benefits to those who  achieve vesting,  lack adequate protection  against diversion to uses other than benefits  to the elderly, and non-union employees do  not have protection against firing to defeat  their rightful pension claims.  The bills now before Congress all fall short  of rectifying these shortcomings. What was  once the bright promise of pension reform  has now become but a dim hope.  The Hartke solution.  The Hartke approach would  require full  vesting after five years and would establish  a bureau of experts in the Department of  Labor  to help  those unfortunate workers  who have been dismissed from employment  for  the  sole  purpose  of making  them  ineligible for their earned, vested credits.  I firmly believe that widows are deserving  of fifty percent of the retiree's annuity bene fits without any  reduction  in his  initial  benefits.  I would also make it compulsory  that participants  in  the pension program  waive  the survivor's benefits  in writing  if  they so desire.  In order to buttress the more progressive  vesting provisions of my approach,  I  am  calling for the mandatory establishment of  a  portabillty  fund and national clearing house.  I also propose pension credit for pa.rt-time  and  part-year  employment. Hundreds  of  thousands  in our work force fall  into this  category. Women have been the major losers  of pension benefits  in  this group of em ployees. They have earned, and thus deserve,  pension protection.  The American people know that private  pensions need reform. They know that they  cannot get by on social  security benefits  which are  their mainstay. They know that  more than half the working people in the  country do not have any  type of private  ",1974

86,,93,0.265,1328,3,Mr. HINSHAW.," Mr. Speaker, once in  a great while a  truly  touching tribute  emerges above the hundreds directed to  a famous person upon his death.  While Murray Chotiner was in the hos pital fighting for his life, his stepdaugh ter thought to cheer him up by showing  him a composition she had prepared on  October 13, 1973, for her Flint Hill High  School English class. The teacher had  asked the students to write a paper on  their hero. She passed up  the usual  heroes who occupy the thoughts of the  average 16-year-old and wrote the trib ute quoted below. Her grief at this un timely death did not prevent her from  reading it at the funeral services which  included President  and Mrs. Richard  Nixon and many other distinguished per sons and family friends:  MY HERO  I have sort of an odd hero. Hts name is  Murray Chotiner-my dad!  Actually he's my stepfather, but I consider  him my real father and hero.  He's had an interesting life, and has been  active in many things. I could ask him just  about anything on any subject and he'd give  me a very logical answer--or very wise advice.  The subject I think he knows most about,  besides law, ls politics.  Politics ts one subject that interests me  greatly, and I hope to get involved with it  someday. He's been very involved in politics,  and it is through him that I've been able to  see what it's all about. And the fact that  he's been in such close contact with the gov ernment, that he knows what is going on in side the government-ts also important.  Since he and my Mom have been married,  I've been active 1n  the Presidential Elec tion, local elections, the Inaugural and, most  important to me, my job on the ""Hill"" last  Summer.  I've learned so much in the past two years  of my life that, I know, will be an asset to me  someday.  My father has also been a long time friend,  counselor and campaign aide  to President  Nixon; and I  know he will defend and do  anything in his power to advise and aid him. no matter what happens.  My dad has very many great traits about his  personality. He  is fun! And he is fair,  everything and anything-(even when I get  ln trouble and he sets a punishment  :for  in  me).  February 2'5, 197 4  He's honest, and I know if he were ever in  an investigation for any reason, no one could  possibly find any bit of dishonesty.  His secretaries say that though he's hard to  work for sometimes, he is the fairest and  most honest man that they have ever worked  for.  These to me are his two best traits.  The only bad thing that I can think o:f to  say about him is that my dad has a very bad  memory, especially  for names! And  if he  didn't have my Mom around at social func tions, he'd really have problems!  As you've probably gathered from this pa per, I respect my dad greatly. He is my hero,  and  I  think he  is one of  the best men  around!!  Mr. Speaker, I join with the many who  are saddened at his passing from  this  earthly life. His accomplishments in his  chosen profession of the law and his deep  interest and participation in the field of  politics will not be soon forgotten. How ever, I believe Murray Chotiner would be  pref erred to be remembered by his friends  and associates as his family remembers  him-a loved and respected father and  husband-and a fair and honest person.  -LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY  HON.

90,,93,0.322,38,7,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, this morn ing the Senators and Congressmen were  hosted  to  the annual wheat breakfast  sponsored by Western Wheat Associates,  Great Plains Wheat, Inc., and the Na tional Association of Wheat Growers.  This year's event was an outstanding one,  highlighted by an address, ""Market De velopment in a Seller's Market"" by Mil -ton Morgan, chairman of the board of  Western Wheat Associates.  M:r. Morgan's comments call attention  to the improvement in our wheat exports  and  the  importance of -wheat  in  the  search  for world peace. To give  this  speech maximum exposure and distribu tion, I ask unanimous consent that it be  printed in the RECORD.    There being no objection, the speech  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  MARKET DEVELOPMENT IN A SELLER'S  MARKET  Mr. Chairman, Senator Bellman, Ladies  an,d Gentlemen, it is my pleasure to talk to  you for a few moments this morning regard ing the need to continue and strengthen our  wheat market development program even  during this time of a seller's market. Voices  have been raised during the past few months  urging an embargo on United States wheat  exports. Consumers are complaining about  the  rapidly  increasing prices of  food,  in cluding bread. This  is understandable but  there are many good reasons why wheat ex ports must continue.  Indeed, our two regional market develop ment organizations, Western Wheat Associ ates and Great Plains Wheat, have not locked  the front door, sat in the back room with  the bUnds down and left the phone off the  hook. Instead we have placed even greater  emphasis on strengthening  trade relation ships .with our foreign buyers to assist them  in resolving the difficulties  they are facing  in obtaining the quantities of wheat  they  need under conditions of tight world food  grains supplies and higher prices.  SEARCH FOR WORLD PEACE  It is difficult to arrange the priority of the  many reasons that the United States should  continue to export wheat and other agricul tural commodities. ~erhaps the most impor tant overall reason is the positive influence  these exports have had on the ""search for  world peace."" It is now clear that agricul tural exports played a very important role in  the detente that has been developed between  the United States and both the Soviet Union  and  the Peoples Republic of China. The  President's mission to Moscow that led to a  new era in U.S.-Soviet relations was preceded  by overtures in the field of agriculture. Vir tually all of the trade that has resulted !rom  our warming relationship with the Peoples  Republic of China has been in agricultural  products.  Our t;radi tional trading partners and allies  have also recognized the importance of the  productive capacity of United States agricul ture ~nd our abllity  to deliver. This was  clearly evident in the uproar that followed  the  temporary control of soybean exports  imposed last spring. Sufficient supplies be come more important to our customers than  higher prices.  Perhaps more important is the fact that  people around the world are becoming aware  of  the  interdependence  between  nations  which ts necessary to improve their standards  of living. People everywhere are finding they  need some things that only other countries  can supply in sufficient quantities at rea sonable prices. They need grains, food and  fiber from  the United States, oil from the  Middle East and rubber from the Far East.  We all need each other as markets for what  we all can produce so that we all can afford  to buy what we all want and what we all  must have to survive.  BALANCE OF TRADE  Another vital  reason  the United States  must continue to export wheat and other  commodities 1s  to regain and maintain a  favorable balance of trade. We must export  agricultural commodities  if our consumers  are to have oil, compact cars, TV sets, coffee,  tea, bananas and spices. Agricultural e?Cports  during fi,scal 1973 amounted to 12.9 b1llion  ",1974
91,Senate,93,-0.284,51,7,Mr. GRAVEL.," Mr. President, the more  that people understand about nuclear  power today, the less they want it. The  following groups have recently endorsed  a nuclear power moratorium, and this is  just a partial list of recent additions:  Chapter 727 of the American Assn. of Re tired Persons, Tuckerton, N.J.  Local 5503 of the Communication Workers  of America, Milwaukee, Wis.  Women's International League for Peace  and Freedom, Philadelphia, Pa.  U.A.W. Oomm.unlty Action Council, Lima,  Ohio.  The board of the Sierra Chlf'.>, San Fran cisco, Calif.  I  The Greene County Legislature, N.Y.  The Ulster County Legislature, N.Y.  Local 525 of the Amalgamated Meat Cut ters, Asheville, N.C.  The Catawba Central Labor Union, Rock  Hill, S.C.  The New Jersey Friends Council, Love ladies, N.J.  Kansas Farmers Union, McPherson, Kans.  Opposition to the use of nuclear fission  for energy is-clearly not limited to ""the  environmental movement.""    If the moratorium movement could  match the millions of dollars which ad vocates of nuclear power spend on public  education, there is no doubt in my mind  that the American public would rapidly  reject nuclear power. Informed people  readily understand the grotesque impli cations of nuclear energy for the Ameri can way of life.  While Congress continues deferring to  ""experts"" in the AEC and the Joint Com mittee on Atomic Energy, the public is  consulting its own decency anj common sense,  and  discovering  that  nuclear  power means  a  high  probability  of  irreversible radioactive pollution, misery,  and fear.  Persuasion is not a probl ... ::1 for mora torium advocates. Their problem is un equal access to the public's mind. In one  word, the problem is money.

93,Senate,93,-0.091,77,7,Mr. TALMADGE.," Mr. President,  I  defer  to no one  in acknowledging  the  need for election campaign reform  in  many areas. As a Member who has served  on the Select Committee on Presidential  Campaign Activities, the so-called Wa tergate Committee, I can vouch for that  firsthand.  I have supported legislation designed  to achieve campaign reform,  including  limiting amounts of money that may be  contributed and spent in political cam paigns, reporting and disclosure of cam paign  contributions  and  expenditures,  and provisions for enforcement of the  law to insure that the election process  in our free society is not subverted.  In fact, even before Watergate and  campaign reform became highly charged  household words, I sponsored legislation  to allow tax credits or tax deductions for  modest contributions  to political cam paigns in an effort to broaden the base  of public political support.  However,  I draw  the  line on public  financing of Federal election campaigns.  This is not campaign reform. It is another  blatant attempt to poke the long arm of  the Federal Government  into an area  where it has no business.  It is an effort to destroy the freedom  of the American people to choose in the  election process.  It is an effort to deny the American  people freedom of expression in the sup port or nonsupport of candidates  for  public office.  It would constitute a raid on the Fed eral Treasury, at a time when our coun try  and  hard-working  taxpayersare  caught in the grip of rampant inflation,  when we are unable to even come any where near balancing the budget, and  when we cannot make both ends meet on  programs that are needed in our society.  What we have before us  today is a  program that is neither needed, desira ble, or in the best national interest.  The right to vote is as sacred a right  that the American people have in our  free society. Voting is an expression of  support of a particular candidate for  public office and an endorsement of his  views at the ballot box.  A citizen's contribution to the election  of a particular candidate is likewise an  expression of support. To make such a  choice and to give such a contribution is  in my estimation also a sacred right_  How a free citizen casts his vote and  how he supports a candidate of his own  choosh1g is a decision only that citizen  can make. No one has a right to make  that decision for him.  A citizen can support this candidate  or that candidate. Or, he can choose to  support no candidate. That is his right  in our system of free elections.  I know of no American taxpayer who  fully understood the situation who would  agree to having his tax money spent on  the political candidacy of a person whose  views were totally repugnant to him. I  certainly do not want my  tax money  spent that way.  Yet, that is precisely what would result  from public financing of Federal election  campaigns.  It is unthinkable that the Federal Gov ernment would presume to tell voters and  taxpayers how they ought to contribute  to political campaigns. Yet, that wr uld  be the effect of this legislation.  It would cut both ways. If I were an  arch conservative, I would not want my  tax dollars going to the candidacy of an  arch liberal. If I were an arch liberal, I  would not want my taxes supporting the  candidacy of an arch conservative. Such  an idea as this flies in the face of every thing  I understand about  freedom  to  choose in the electoral process.  Under this proposal, the Federal Gov ernment first forces the American tax payer to fork over his money. Then, the  Federal Government takes that money  and turns it over to the election cam paign of a candidate who perhaps could  not get even his wife  to vote for him.  The only way this could be avoided, would  be for the citizen to evade the tax collec tor.  Virtually anyone can file  for public  office  these days. I do not think hard working people want their taxes spent  to finance the campaigns of every crank  or crackpot that comes along.  I  join efforts to improve the election  campaign process and  to bring about  needed reform. But, the last thing we  want is for politicians to put their hands  in the Public Treasury to finance their  election campaigns.  I hope the Senate will kill this legisla tion.  ",1974
94,Senate,93,-0.443,77,7,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, with re gret, I  find it necessary to oppose the  McGovern amendment. I believe it would  be an unfortunate backward step in our  progress toward reform.  Contrary to some reports, the public  financing provisions of S. 3044 are in  no sense mandatory. The bill does not  prohibit private financing, and it cer tainly does not prohibit small private  contributions.  In fact, it provides strong incentives  for  small  contributions  in primaries,  since it offers matching public funds only  for the first $250 in private contributions  for Presidential primaries and the first  in primaries for  the Senate and  House.  Private contributions also have a role  to play in general elections, since major  party candidates will have the option of  relying entirely on private funds, en tirely on public funds, or on any combi nation in between.  And  in both primaries and general  elections,  the bill provides new  incen$100  3044  tives for small private contributions by  doubling the existing tax credit and tax  deduction available for such contribu tions.  In these respects, the bill recognizes  the vigorous differences of opinion on  the proper role of small private contri butions. Some feel that such contribu tions are an essential method for bring ing citizens into the system and encour aging popular participation in p<;>litics.  Others,  like myself,  feel  that  there  are better ways to bring a person into  the system  than by  reaching for his  pocketbook, and that the best way to a  voter's heart is through his opinions on  the issues, not  through  the dollars  in  his wallet.  As it should be, the bill accommodates  both views,  letting each candidate ""do  his own thing,"" without forcing any can didate into a rigid formula for financing  his campaign.  In this respect, S. 3044 is an improve ment over the 1971 dollar checkoff law,  which prohibits a person who accepts  public funds from accepting private con tributions. Under  S.  there  is  greater flexibility-a candidate can se lect the mix of private and public funds  he wants for his campaign, such as 50-50  or 80-20, and is not obliged to accept  public funds on an ali-or-nothing basis.  For that reason, I am opposed to alter native proposals such as the McGovern  amendment, that would turn public fi nancing for general elections into a com pulsory ""mixed"" system of partial pub lic funds and partial private contribu tions, with or without matching grants.  Last November, in the floor debate on  the public financing amendment to the  Debt Ceiling Act,  the Senate voted 52  to 40  against a  proposal  to cut  the  amount of public funds in half and to  require  the remainder  to be  raised in  private contributions. As Senator JoHN  PASTORE succinctly put it in the floor de bate, in opposing such a mandatory mix ture of public and private financing:  Either we are going to have or not going  to have public financing. If we are going for  public financing, let us go for publlc financ ing. If we are not going to have it, let us  not have lt. What we have here (in the pro posal for a mixed system]  is a hermaphro dite.  If participation  in politics  through  small private contributions is the goal,  then  the  dollar  checkoff  is  already  achieving it. More than 4 million tax payers have used the checkoff so far in  1974. At the current rate, 12 million tax payers will have used it by the time all  returns are filed on April 15. That's a  world record for public participation in  campaign  financing,  a  tribute  to  the  workability of the ""one voter-one dollar""  approach to public financing enacted in  1971.  Further, it is by no means clear that  it is feasible for a large number of gen eral election campaigns across the coun try to be run on small private contribu tions.  The Goldwater campaign 1n 1964, the  McGovern campaign  in 1972. and  the  Democratic National Committee's tele thon in 1973 are good examples of suc cessful fundre.ising  through small pri",1974

105,House,93,-0.422,168,7,Mr. DRINAN.," Mr. Speaker, prospects  of national health insurance legislation  in the immediate future are obscured by  fundamental disagreements in the Con gress over the extent of benefits to be  provided, the degree of Federal involve ment, the means of financing and cost  sharing and  the mechanism  for pro viding protection from catastrophic ill ness. Older Americans face the highest  incidence of illness and disability. Their  population is increasing faster than the  rest of the population. At present they  represent 10 percent of the population  and an astonishing 20 percent of the  poor. Their median income is less than  one half of their younger counterparts  and 85 percent of them have at least one  chronic condition. Older Americans can not and should not wait any longer for  congressional action to resolve  the in ability of the present medicare program  and c;>ther programs to pr ~vide COJ11pre hensive quality health care.  For the past 2 years  the American  Association of Retired Persons and the  National Retired Teachers Association  which have the largest membership or ganizations  representing older Ameri cans, have devoted their efforts to the  need for comprehensive quality health  care as a matter of basic entitlement of  the elderly. I am today introducing the  Comprehensive Medicare Reform Act of  1974 which  incorporates  their recom mendations and represents a culmina tion of efforts  to provide  full health  insurance to older Americans.   This legislation builds upon the exist ing medicare program with the aim of  improving  and  extending  it  from  a  limited program to a national health plan  for  the aged and disabled. I  feel that  this legislation w111 serve as a model for  future national health  insurance pro grams.  The bill provides  for unlimited  patient and outpatient hospital coverage,  unlimited skilled nursing facility serv ices,  intermediate care facility services  and home health care services. Taking  into consideration the fact that dental  problems, eye trouble and the need for  prescription drugs all increase in old age,  the bill would include coverage of dental  in care, prescription drugs, medically neces sary devices such as eyeglasses, hearing  aids, prosthetic devices and walking aids  as well as the services of optometrists,  podiatrists, and chiropractors. It would  also include the cost of ambulances and  other emergency transportation.  I have been particularly interested in  securing the coverage of outpatient pre scription drugs under medicare. At pres ent total charges for prescription drugs  run three times higher for older Ameri cans than for the younger population.  This represents the need for expensive  maintenance drugs by the elderly who  more than any other segement of the  population suffer from heart conditions,  strokes, arthritis, diabetes, and cancer.  The out-of-pocket payment for health  care costs  in 1972 by  the elderly was  three  times  the amount paid by non senior citizens. In 1969 medicare met 46  percent of the elderly's health bill but  today it meets only 42 percent of that  cost. The decline is due to infiation and  weaknesses  in  the medicare structure  which need to be strengthened.  The Comprehensive Medicare Reform  Act would provide a new structure. It  would broaden the program to include a  full  range of medical services and 1t  would improve the administration of the  medicare progam while attempting  to  control health costs.  Parts A and B of medicare would be  combined into a single integrated pro gram With a single trust fund. Financing  would come out of general revenue. The  requirement for premium payments and  the deductable would be eliminated.  Coverage would extend for  the first  time to all persons over age 65, including  public  employees,  teachers, policemen,  and firemen.  The legislation includes an innovative  provision for the coverage of catastrophic  illness based upon an  income  related  ceiling.  The legislation incorporates aU present  medicare cost control and utilization re view provisions with payment being made  only to participating providers who have  filed an agreement with the Secretary of  the Depatment of Health, Education, and  Welfare.  The additional cost of the medicare  reform measure upon enactment would  be approximately $3 billion in increased  Federal cost. This could be met by gen eral revenues. In his health message to  the Congress the President indicated that  the $6 billion Federal costs of his na tional health insurance program could be  financed out of general revenue with no  additional taxes. The cost of this pro gram would be met in the same way.  Enactment of  this  legislation would  provide a security to which the aged are  entitled. No period of life requires such a  spectrum of health services as that of  old age. The current Federal and State  efforts are unable to provide many of  these vital health components. The Com prehensive Medicare Reform Act of 1974  is designed to meet these pressing needs.  60 MINUTES: ON THE MILITARY  DISCHARGE SYSTEM  ",1974
106,House,93,-0.578,168,7,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to  take this opportunity  to commend  the  excellent special report on our military  discharge system which was aired on  CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" March 24, 1974.  This is an important and topical issue  which deeply affects  the lives of hun dreds of thousands of Americans. With  27 of my colleagues I have introduced  H.R. 12144 to remedy many of the cur rent inequities so clearly demonstrated  by ""60 Minutes."" I urge my colleagues  to read the following  transcript of the  broadcast, to become more familiar with  this issue and to join me in sponsoring  legislation  to  remedy  the  lack of due  process  and  the abundance of harm  which is part of current discharge pro cedures:  OFFICER. Good morning, Privates.  PRIVATES. Qood morning, sir.  OFFICER. At ease, Privates. Keep your eyes  on me. Privates, your Marine Corps careers  are at their very beginning. Nevertheless, it  is essential that you are aware of the various  ways that it can eventually end.  WALLACE. The mllitary itself takes pains to  warn the soldiers, like these Marine recruits,  about the value of an honorable discharge.  OFFICER. There are five types of discharges  given by the Marine Corps. They are: Honorable ... General ... Undesirable ... Bad  Conduct ... and Dishonorable. The only type  of disch-arge  that you should be actively  seeking is an Honorable one. Any discharge   other than Honora1:>le could adversely affect  you for the rest of your life.  WALLACE. One way in which a  less than  honorable discharge can plague a man is by  giving him a tough time in the job market.  Most Government agencies and many large  companies  ask veterans  about  their dis charges. Some employers look on a bad dis charge as tantamount to a prison record.  Then as recruits also learn they may one  day want veterans benefits. Most men with  undesirable or bad conduct discharges, and  all with dishonorable discharges are cut out  of all VA benefits. And that means every thing from unemployment  insurance right  after they get out of the service to the GI  Bill for Education, to medical benefits.   Most bad discharges it turns out are hand ed out to the men who can least afford the  economic_ consequences, the poor. the high  school dropout,  the Chicanos and blacks  . . . like Thomas Aiken who  lo.st an eye  fighting in Vietnam.  In 1968, Private Thomas Aiken who had  already won a Bronze Star ~n Vietnam was  hit by shrapnel in his eye and chest during  bloody fighting like this around Khe Sanh.  According  to  the Army, once back in the  United £tates, Aiken persistently refused to  obey orders. But according to Aiken, a piece  of shrapnel, st111 lodged in his right eye, was  giving him serious trouble. Over the follow ing months Aiken went AWOL seven times.  AIKEN. I left because! couldn't take it no  more. After coming back from Vietnam, being  wounded, almost dying, to be harassed the  way I was. Sergeants kicking my bunk, pull ing me out of bed, officers challengdng me  knowing I can't strike them. Like if I strike  them I could go to jail for a year. All these  things. And after. a whlle lt got to a point  where I was like losing my mind, And if I  didn't get away from the Army, from that  type of life, I felt myself-! would go crazy  or hurt somebody or hurt myself. So I had  to leave and come home and get my mind  together.  WALLACE. Finally, after three court-mar tials, Aiken  accepted an undesirable dis charge. But that time his right eye could only  distinguish day from night. Over the months  that followed he applied to the Veterans Ad",1974
107,,93,0.012,181,7,Mr. MILFORD.," Mr. Speaker, on March  24, 1974, the Dallas Times Herald printed  an outstanding editorial authored by Mr.  Felix R. McKnight. It is entitled ''The  Worst Watergate Scar.""  I feel strongly that this editorial has  a significant message for every Member  of this Congress. I am including it in  the RECORD for each to read:  THE WORST WATERGATE SCAR  Of all the scars to be left by Watergate,  none will be more permanent than the ir responsible violation of institutions and dis ciplines designed to safeguard the rights of  individuals.  In prejudice some  treasured old corner stones of justice have crumbled.  Grand jury proceedings have been openly  leaked;  prosecuting staffs have spilled  in criminating  information  to  their  favorite  newsmen;  erstwhile respected congressmen  have succumbed to the electric lure of net work television to prejudge before the fact.  No one, including once irreproachable Rep.  Wilbur Mills, wants to wait for orderly proc essing of facts before constituted bodies in  pressing the case against Richard M. Nixon.  If Nixon were any other lowly defendant,  he would have a gut cinch for a change of  venue because of the unceasing flow of pre trial accusations and insinuations made on  the hour by government officials, members  of the Congress and some elements of the  media.  But Richard Nixon has no other place to  go. The House of Representatives files  the  charges;  the U.S. Senate conducts the trial.  The San Francisco Examiner reminds that  all members of the House of Representatives  are in effect prospective grand jurors. If this  Judiciary Committee decides  to press  peachment  proceedings  against  President  Nixon, it will be up to the Congressmen to  weigh  the evidence and vote or reject an  indictment in the form of specific charges.  Will those congressmen who have been go ing around telling newspapermen and tele vision  interviewers  they believe  the Presi dent should be removed from office, or re sign-which amounts  to the same thing will they be allowed to vote on the indict ment in spite of their recorded advance bias?  They will.  And so w111 U.S. senators, who will be sitting  as a  trial jury if the House votes an indict ment. Including those you have seen on tele vision  solemnly  insinuating guilt of  the  President.  There is something dreadfully wrong in the  prospect, something quite alien to the tradi tional spirit of American justice. Those mem bers of Congress who have been prejudicing  the President are reminiscent of the outlaw  kangaroo court that vowed ""a fair trial be fore the hanging.""  We do not speak  in defense of Richard  Nixon, who will have  to speak  to alleged  improprieties,  tax violations  and  lack of  control and discipline of a wayward statr.  We speak in defense of a system, of institu tions, that are far bigger than an individual.  Vice Chairman M1lls of the Joint Commitim EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tee on Internal Revenue Taxation, the body  investigating Nixon's challenged income tax  returns, went on the CBS Face the Nation  show and predicted that the President will be  out of office by November-shoved out by  the tax investigation and pressure.  And  then Rep. M11ls charges that Nixon  owes some $350,000 in back taxes because of  improper  deductions--citing  Sen. Russell  Long of Louisiana, chairman of  the  joint  committee, as the source of the information.  Whereupon, Sen. Long promptly denied it,  saying, ""I have never attempted to fix a fig ure on the amount of taxes the President may  owe on his returns."" Further, Sen. Long added  that there has been no ""proof of fraud on  the part of the President.""  But all of it had been said on national  television and reported in every daily news paper. The pre-trial knife had slashed again.  Out of respect for the badly battered judi cial process and its presumption of innocence  until guilt  is proven, congressmen should  keep  their opinions  to  themselves or dis qualify themselves as jurors. The rest of us,  the majority, stm have respect for constitu tionally ordered rights under law-whether  it be the accused Nixon or Joe Blow.  CHARLE~ HADLEY AND OPERATION  BIG VOTE  HON. WILLIAM LEHMAN  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 27, 1974  ",1974
108,,93,-0.483,181,7,Mr. LEHMAN.," Mr. Speaker, recently  citizens  and  leaders  of Miami,  Fla.,  gathered for a  testimonial luncheon in  honor of the father of ""Operation Big  Vote."" A civic effort put together to sell  the citizens of Miami on two recent bond  issues by Charles Hadley.  Those who attended were paying hom age to a man who volunteered and then  performed over and beyond the call of  duty.  In the words of one of Hadley's co workers on the campaign, Alva Chapman,  president of the Miami Herald:  He is an extremely competent, dedicated  Miamian and rendered great service to this  community in helping the civic committees  explain the importance of these bond issues  to the future of this great community.  Without Hadley's participation and leader ship,  it  is unlikely  that any  significant  amount of the $120 million in bonds passed  by the City of Miami in recent years would  have been approved.  He is an outstanding Miamian and I was  proud to be his associate in these civic en deavors.  Prominent attorney Bill Colson was  the master of ceremonies and told of the  difficulties he had convincing Charles  Hadley  to agree  to help. Colson ex plained:  Charlie feared the bond issue would pass  and all of the monies would go to beautify ing downtown Miami, Flagler street in par ticular. The Committee then sat down and  re-wrote the priorities for the Bond issue ....  After this was done Mr. Hadley took the re sponsib111ty for the bond issue in the pre dominantly black precincts.  .  .  . The bond  issue passed 3 to 1 in all of his precincts.  When I am asked by executives seeking to  save their decaying cities who have recently  had bond issues defeated what they should  do. I  say simply, Find you a Charley Hadley.  For over a year Charles Hadley worked  without pay to pass the issue. He was  8561  successful and  the city of Miami re ceived a needed financial  transfusion.  Without men like Charles Hadley, Miami  and this country would be in very bad  shape.  Perhaps  the most fitting  tribute  to  Charles Hadley is the last line on the  plaque he was presented at the luncheon.  ""Thank you from the city of Miami.""  OHIO INAUGURATES WOMB TO THE  TOMB WELFARE STATE  HON. JOHN M. ASHBROOK  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF' REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 27, 1974  ",1974
109,,93,0.612,181,7,Mr. ASHBROOK.," Mr. Speaker,  fol lowing a recent decision by an Ohio Fed eral court, a pregnant woman 1n Ohio  can now collect aid to dependent chil dren-ADC-for her unborn child. Ac cording to the Mansfield News Journal,  an expectant mother, from the time of  verification of pregnancy to the time of  delivery, can collect more than $700 in  ADC payments.  This incredible decision brings to frui tion a goal  long sought after by our  liberal social planners. As  is stated in  the News Journal:  I\ welfare state based upon a concept of  assistance ""from the womb to the tomb"" is  now reality.  Following is the complete text of the  March 17 news article:  WELFARE PAYMENTS START AT PREGNANCY  (By Joan Brown)  A welfare state based upon a concept of  assistance ""from  the womb  to  the  tomb""  is now reality.  The Ohio Department of Public Welfare,  in complying with a December, 1973, Ohio  federal court decision in Stuart vs. Canary,  can pay pregnant mothers as much as $100  each month in Aid to Dependent Children  for a child conceived but not yet born.  From the time that a pregnancy is medi cally verified, which may be as early as six  weeks, untn the time of delivery, a pregnant  woman can collect more than $700  in Aid  to Dependent Children  (ADC) .  Miss Ruth Strong, director of the Richland  County Welfare Department, explains that  before  the Stuart-Canary decision an ex pectant mother with children would not  have  received any special ADC  allowance  because of her new pregnancy. When  the  child was born, however, she could apply  for additional assistance.  The opinion of  the court, however, was  that ""the absence of other living children  shall not bar a pregnant woman from eli gib111ty for Aid to Dependent Children.""  ""What this means is that any woman of  any age who can provide a medical statement  verifying her pregnancy and meet all other  eligibilty requirements, may receive Aid to  Dependent Children,"" says Miss Strong.  Specifically, this can mean a mother may  receive funds under the federal program for  a ""child"" that not only is unborn but may  not  yet  have  indicated  ""life""  through  ""quickening.''  Miss Strong, who  indicates she has  just  received a guideline from the state welfare  department, says a  single pregnant woman  with no children and no income could re ceive an ADO grant of $73 a month a.nd an  additional $20 for nutritional needs.  A married. expectant couple could receive  an ADC grant of $141 a month plus an ~ddi",1974
110,,93,-0.505,194,7,Mr. WALDIE.," Mr. Speaker,  the oil  from .the Middle East is apparently on  its way again. Production levels are be ing increased by the Ara~ suppliers. and  tankers are either steammg for Middle  Eastern ports or leaving them bound for  U.s. refineries~   President Nixon has told us that the  ""crisis"" is over, but the ""problem"" re mains . .  There  is serious question  in many  minds however, whether or not the crisis  did u{deed occur-or, was it in fact a  contrivance designed to boost gasoline  and fuel oil prices in order for oil com pany profits to increase markedly.  As if to dramatize 'the dichotomy of  views on the ""oil shortage""  there ap peared in today's newspapers two widely  divergent opinions on the state of the  Nation's petroleum problems now  that  the Arab embargo is over.  One view  is  that of Christopher T.  Rand, of Kensington, Calif. Writing in  the New, York Times today, Mr. Rand  questions  the severity of  the shortage  this past winter.  .  on the other hand, we have the v1ews  of Keith J. Fanshier, publisher of tl~e  Oil Daily, who warns that the ""crisis"" 1s  far from over.  Mr. Speaker, I think it instructive .and  informative to read  these  two art1cles  and I wish to submit them for the RECORD:  [From the Oil Daily, Me.r. 26, 1974]  SUMMER Wn.L HAVE ITS OWN PROBLEMS  (By Keith Fansher)  The 1973-74 Winter is turning out to be  one of those perverse late and delayed ones,  in which a considerable run of relatively low  temperatures strikes after the season as a  whole has been mild, and after the industry  had just about written o:lf the soo.son as re gards any further strong demand for fuel  oil.  Although now the industry has plenty of  fuel oil to finish out the season, maybe too  much,  these stocks are now being drawn  down more rapidly than was true in much of  the main part of the season. To some extent,  this might be regarded as good in the in dus try because some suppliers are reported  to have too much fuel for efficient, economic  handling, owing to the hitherto slower-than expected-earlier demand.  Stocks of distillate fuel in primary storage  are now some 143 milllon barrels, which ex ceeds a. year earlier by 28 million barrels, or  20%.  Meanwhile,  the great enigma  is whether  stocks of ga,soline-in fact, . total petroleum  stocks-will take a sharp fall-o:lf in the next  few months from the feared over-reaction of  the public to the Arab embargo lifting. If  'the public drops its conservation perform ance as a  result of  this easing,  then any  help that supply would get from it would  rapidly evaporate. Both public and industry  need to maintain their . conservation stance.  So does the government, in its on position.  It should be remembered constantly that  the government still has not enacted any  long-range  national  energy pollcy, and urgently needs to do so.  In other words,  legislators as well as  the  common citizen, and  the  industry  itself,  fundamental~  T~al  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  should follow constructive patterns in thls  whole energy problem, especially now and in  the next few months.  Psychologically, Utera.lly everybody,  from  low to high, has been so eagerly seeking a  ray of light on the problem that there 1s  danger of being too ready to accept a mod erate action  as being  the answer  to  the  hopes. This is what make the new Arab move  dangerous. It could make  this nation  too  complacent. Better we  should  all  remain  cautious and wary, even at the cost of con tinuing discomfort.  It should be kept  in  inind  that what has  happened before arbitrary cut-o:lf action from Persian Gulf  courses-could be repeated.  Stated otherwise, there are no miracles, and  literally no security, ln depending on other  nations and peoples. The lesson of what has  happened is that the U.S. must be the master  of  its own fate  in energy-that vital an swer to survival in the world of the present  and the future. Complacency in this context  could be our worst enemy. In fact, hasn't the  country been too complacent about future  energy needs and resources already, and for  years?  And isn't this exactly the element which  has caused us  to be  too unready and has  brought us trouble when the long approach ing crisis became reality?  It seems appropriate in this situation to  paraphrase a famed quotation from Shake speare's great play, King Richard III: ""Now  is the winter of our discontent made glorious  summer by this new Arab action."" We would  submit that it should not be expected too  easily that our winter's problems should turn  too  easily  into  summer's  solutions.  For  summer is sure to bring its own problems.  The prime difficulty seen at present is that  production of all  this country's petroleum  products  is  currently  considerably  below  what it should be, owing  to the fact that  much of the total refining capacity  is not  being utilized as a consequence of the re quirement  that considerable crude oil be  shuttled  from  the  refineries of numerous  companies  that  are  crude-comfortable  to  other refining companies in serious need of  crude.  How  long  this dislocation wlll continue  it is dlftlcult to be sure. It is just one more  of the many intangibles, unsettlements and  unknowns that are plaguing the general pe troleum supply situation of the U.S.  [From the New York Times, Mar. 27, 1974]  AFTER THE OIL EMBARGO  (By Christopher T. Rand)  KENSINGTON, CALIF.-During  the Winter,  when Americans endured bitter cold and  parked in long lines at the few gasoline sta tions  that  remained open, production of  domestic crude oil and natural-gas liquids  was running at a  reasonable level,  imports  of on products averaged 2.8 million barrels  a day, and crude oil imports were up 11 per  cent from the previous winter.  Despite the Arab embargo,  this nation's  crude oil and oil products situation hardly  worsened, contrary to the more pessimistic  predictions.  On March 1, the United States had almost  805 million barrels of crude, unfinished and  finished oils in stock, an increase of 7.8 per  cent above figures for a year ago.  United States demand for crude oil has  been  increasing by only 6 per cent a year  and the nation's refineries have been running  so close  to  the supply of crude  that they  could not have used up more than 8 million  barrels, or 3 per cent, of the nation's crude  on stocks between Dec. 7 and March 1, ac cording  to American Petroleum  Institute  statistics.  During this period one real lapse of sup ply did occur,  in the middle of February,  when American crude oil  imports, which  had been averaging 2.4 million barrels a day  in January, dipped  to a daily rate of 1.8  March 27, 1974  million barrels. This  is curious  in that it  did not occur at Thanksgiving, when  the  Liberian vessel Sidney Spiro steamed  into  San Francisco laden with the last shipment  of pre-embargo Arab oil to America. Nor did  the  lapse  occur  gradually.  The  imports  dropped off sharply, then picked up age.in  just as sharply.  This suggested that the supply problems of  the United States consumer had nothing to  do with the Arab embargo.  Evidence  to support  this suggestion has  been provided by  the International Long shoremen's Association, which has demon strated  through a  study of  tanker move ments that the Persian Gulf countries must  have been exporting at least 20.73 million  ba.rrels of crude oil a day in December-over  a mlllion barrels more a. day than industry  sources were claiming.  What the Arabs have apparently done, suc cessfully,  is  to use, primarily for political  and commercial ends in Europe, the threat  of an embargo rather than a real one. They  have helped influence Europeans, and Presi dent Nixon,  to exert diplomatic efforts  in  favor of an equitable peaceful resolution of  the Arab-Israeli conflict.  They have driven  a. wedge between  the  major  international  oil  companies  and  France, Italy, West Germany, Great Britain,  Japan, India and other oil-importing coun tries, all of which in the last four months  have greatly accelerated the dispatching of  officials, quasi-governmental and private delegations to Iraq, Iran, Libya, Kuwait, Saudi  Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Algeria in quest of  oil for cash, weapons, spare parts, expertise  and industrial plants.  Now the Arabs have gained substantial if  ephemeral financial success, have largely set  aside the threat of embargo, have shown ap preciation to Western governments for their  evenhanded approach  to  the dispute with  Israel, and have relegated the quibbling and  haggling to on-poor Syria.  Western European countries have gained  stature,  too, by showing that they do not  need  to go  through  the  international oil  companies to acquire Middle Eastern on.  President Nixon has preserved his status  as an  international peacemaker. American  oil companies continue to enjoy deluxe co operation from the Government, and those  oil concerns that possess shares of Middle  Eastern oil concessions as well reaped very  good earnings  As a group, except for the Gulf Oil Corpo ration their profits have grown by more than  9 per cent per year  since 1967 and  they  seem destined to do even better this year.  Only the consumer, especially the Ameri can consumer, has really suffered from this  winter's exercise in international commercial  diplomacy. He  has  finally won back  the  gasoline he had in October but he is pay ing  the companies 30 per cent more  for  it.  In fact,  the only unfinished business of  the so-called crisis is for the Administration  to do something for the consumer, to honor  some of the consumers' specific wishes.  Although  the Government has neglected  to form a cohesive and just energy policy  over  the past generation, although  it has  utterly f.aned to take any initiative to ac quire and thoroughly audit oil industry costs,  reserves and inventory data, it has the ca pacity to do so now.  At  the very  least, President Nixon and  the Federal Energy Office must  roll back  crude oil and petroleum-product prices  to  pre-October levels. They must give up the  campaign to end regulation of the price of  natural gas piped across state lines, because  this is the only area. of domestic petroleum  activity in which the Government is not sub servient ~ the oil industry.  They must also become prepared to enter  the business of importing, storing and re fining crude oil-as European governments  are doing-if crude-on imports and refinery  runs do not pick up.  in 1973.

111,,93,-0.509,207,7,Mr. BINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, readers  Of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD may be in terested in the following article which  was published in the March 1974 edition  of  the Democratic Leader,  the ofilcial  publication of the New York State Demo cratic Party. It contains my assessment  of the increasing importance and effec tiveness of  the House Foreign A:ffairs  Committee.  THE GROWING RoLE OF THE HOUSE FOREIGN  AFFAIRS COMMITI'EE  (By Jonathan B. Bingham)  Item: One of  the moot  important bills  passed by the 93rd Congress in its first term  was the War Powers Act. The House Foreign  Affairs Committee played a major role in the  development of  this legislation; as worked  out  in Senate-House conference,  the final  version of the bill was much closer to the  bill as drafted in the House Foreign Affairs  Committee than it was to the Senate bill.  Item: On December 4th, the Foreign M fairs Committee reported out the $2.2-billion  military aid bill for Israel by a vote of 31-1  having previously beaten back an effort to  cut the authorization some 2-5%, by a vote  of 16-5. The House, and later the Senate,  went along with  the Committee's recom mendation.  Item: In its draft report the special House  committee headed by Dick Bolling of Mis souri which  is reviewing House committee  jurisdictions, recommended that the Foreign  Affairs Committee handle foreign trade and  tariff  legislation,  instead of  the uniquely  powerful Ways and Means Committee.  Item: During 1973 several visiting prime  ministers and heads of state, including Mrs.  Golda Melr, King Hussein of Jordan and the  Shah of Iran, met privately with the com mittee, thus paying their respects.  These four items suggest how far the For eign Affairs Committee has come since the  pre-World War II days when it was con sidered one of the least desirable committee  assignments  in  the House. By  the time I  was elected to the House in 1964, Foreign M fairs was already sought after (it took me  four years to get the assignment), and today  it is even more so. Because of our keen in terest in its work, there are four New York  Democrats  in  the Committee, Ben Rosen thal, Lester Wolff, Ogden Reid, and myself.  ",1974

App. 2166(a)),  is further amended by striking out the date  ""June 30, 1974"" and inserting in lieu thereof  the date ""June 30, 1976.""  GENERAL SERVICES  ADMINISTRATION,  Washington, D.C., March 1, 1974.  Hon. GERALD R. FoRD,  President of the Senate, U.S. Senate, Wash ington, D.C.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: There is forwarded  herewith a draft bill ""To amend  the De fense Production Act of 1950, as amended.""  The bill would extend  the Act  for  two  years, changing  its  termination date  from  June 30, 1974, to June 30, 1976.  The Defense Production Act is important  and time-tested legislation supporting pro grams vital to our national security. In the  Defense Production Act  the Congress ad dressed the need to divert certain materials  and facilities from civilian use to military  and related purposes,  to develop prepared ness programs, and to provide for  the ex pansion of productive capacity and supply.  Title I of the Act provides authority to  give priority treatment to vital defense con tracts and to allocate materials and facili ties for defense programs. It is under this  authority that  the Defense Materials Sys tem and the Defense Priorities System have  been established. The regulations for  these  systems not only serve current defense needs  in  the short-supply conditions that char acterize  today's market but  also  provide  basic arrangements that could be extended  as required by any foreseeable national de fense emergency.  Continuing operations under these regu lations also provide a corps of experienced  specialists who would be a nucleus for the  rapid and efficient expansion of the priori ties and allocations system that would be  needed  in  time of any  future  industrial  mobilf:aa tlon.  Title III of the Act provides needed au thority  for  the expansion of  the Nation's  productive capacity to meet its defense needs.  It includes authority to make loans and loan  guarantees  to private business enterprises  for the expansion of capacity, the develop ment of  technological processes,  and  the  production of essential materials, including  the exploration, development, and mining of  strategic and critical metals and minerals.  This Title also authorizes the guarantee of  loans to finance the performance of defense  contracts.  One provision of Title VII  the basic  authority for the National Defense Executive  Reserve-a pool of individuals with proven  executive talents who have undergone spe cial training and have agreed to enter Gov ernment Service if ever an emergency should  require  their rapid mobilization.  Title VII  also provides authority under  which defense contractors may, with  the  approval of the President, enter into volun tary agreements  serving defense purposes  without violating the antitrust laws.  The Defense Production Act is the corner stone of the present legal structure for in suring preparedness to meet crises requiring  the moailization of the Nation's industrial  and material  resources.

120,Senate,93,-0.592,311,7,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. President, the Con gress, in recent years, has made historic  advancements  in legislation  for a  co ordinated national program  to control  the disease of alcoholism. However, even  the best conceived and funded national  program would be foredoomed to failure  without strong leadership in the field at  the community level.  In the progressive city of Cedar Rapids  in my native State of Iowa, one of the  outstanding leaders in that community's  program to control alcoholiBm is a highly  successful businessman and civic leader,  :r,u. Sutherland Cook. Sud Cook has a  special understanding of this disease and  a special compassion for  those afflicted  because  he  is  himself  a  recovered  alcoholic.  On January 10 of this year, Mr. Cook  presented a paper on alcoholism to the  Linn County,  Iowa, Medical  Society.  This was no dull lecture, but a deeply  personal  statement,  full  of  first-hand  knowledge, wisdom and understanding. I  would like to share it with my colleagues  who  have  repeatedly  evidenced  their  concern  about  this  grievously  serious  problem in our society. I  therefore ask  unanimous consent that Mr. Cook's re marks be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the remarks  were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  MR. COOK'S REMARKS ON ALCOHOLISM  Sometime in the late 1950's the American  Medical Association  officially  declared  al coholism to be a disease. Since that time,  although there has been a growing accept ance of the disease concept, there has been  no generally agreed-upon description of the  etiology of the malady nor of its treatment.  The medical profession tends to treat it  chemically with tranquilizers and sedatives,  and is dismayed to see its alcoholic patients  get worse.  Psychologists  and psychiatrists  tend  to  search for the childhood trauma that pro duced the deviant behavior, but fall to get  their patients to put the cork in the bottle  and are dismayed to see their patients get  worse.  The clergy tend to moralize with their al coholic parishioners, and when they invoke  God's help through prayer, they are dismayed  to see get them get worse.  What kind of a disease is this then that  does not respond to a straight medical approach, nor to a straight psychological ap   proach nor to a straight spiritual approach?  Well, Alcoholics Anonymous believes it is  a  triple disease, a disease of the body, and  of the mind, and of the soul, and that the  treatment of only one part of the malady to  the exclusion of the other ...two parts is not  only unproductive but counter productive.  Although  it is  thought that the alcoholic  is physically allergic to alcohol, there is no  known medicine or chemical  that can be  used with benefit. Medically, the only thing  you can do for the alcoholic is to ""get the  booze out and the nutrition in"". The drink ing alcoholic  typically  is nervous, anxious,  and may have trouble eating and sleeping.  ""Can't we at least relieve his symptoms with  a tranquilizer or sedative to make him more  comfortable?"" you  ask. This  is  in accord  with medical tradition and sounds humane,  but  the  answer  is  ""Absolutely No!"" By  making him comfortable you destroy na ture's God given incentive to do something  about his drinking. Alcohol is a tranquilizer  and a sedative. This is exactly how the al coholic has been treating himself for years.  His motto has been like Du Pont Corporation's ""Better Living Thru Chemistry"", and  he wlll welcome the addition of new mood  altering substances that don't smell, that he  can carry easily with him on his person, and  that have the full authority of his new en",1974
121,Senate,93,-0.163,324,7,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, during  the congressional debate in 1971 over de velopment of a U.S. supersonic transport,  a great deal was made by SST proponents  over the challenge posed to U.S. aviation  by the Concorde SST being developed by  France and Great Britain.  I was not  persuaded by this argument at the time  and I believe recent events have shown  that it has even less currency today.  Those of us who argued against the  SST felt that if it could not meet the  test of securing private financial support  for its development costs then it was not  likely to meet the test of winning avia tion industry support necessary for its  production. The Anglo-French Concorde,  I believe, is a good case in point. The  British and French Governments have  sunk more than $2.5 billion into develop ment of the Concorde and to date the  only customers for the production model  have been Air France and British Air ways-two  state-owned  airlines  that  seem  to have very little choice in the  matter.  When one considers the state of the  U.S. airline industry today-with the new  wide body jets actually being retired from  service by many airlines-we can only be  thankful that our airlines are not faced  with the additional burden of attempting  to capitalize the purchase of a new super sonic transport.  The decisions of the marketplace may  seem harsh at times, but I believe that  the private sector has a proven record of  providing the United States with the best  technology, at an affordable price and  in harmony with the all-economic forces  that are played 1n a free economy.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent  that a recent editorial on the SST from  the Houston Post and an article from the  March 23 issue of Business Week maga zine may be printed 1n the RECORD.  There being no objection, the articles  were ordered to be printed in the REc oRD, as follows:  [From Business Week, Mar. 23, 1974]  MORE TuRBULENCE FOB THE CONCOBDB  The Anglo-French supersonic airllner, the  Concorde, seems headed for its biggest crisis  since 1964, when Harold Wllson's Labor gov ernment tried to cancel the plane on first  taking ofH.ce. Now, Tony Benn, Secretary of  State for Industry in the new WUson minor ity government, who regards himself as a  Concorde  partisan,  has  given Parllament  facts that suggest that the cheapest thing to  do with the Concorde would be to scrap it  now. Firm sales to date stUl total only nine,  all to Concorde's ""captive"" state-owned cus tomers, British Airways and Air France.  Nobody in Paris was talking for the record  on Benn's remarks, but the French did not  appear to consider them a  serious  threat.  ""The cost problems of  the Concorde have  been long known and already discounted,""  says one high French ofH.clal. Another specu lates that Benn s  remarks may be part of a  broadly orchestrated effort to get a better  deal for Britain in renegotiating its entry into  the Common Market. British haggling on the  Concorde, in this view, would put pressure  on the French to allow Britain a better deal  on farm prices. The French government an nounced on Feb. 19 that it favored continu ation of the Concorde, including production  of three aircraft in addition to the 16 now  authorized, plus new fuel tanks to increase  range.  LOST POUNDS  Benn, however, told Parllament that there  1s no hope that Britain and France will be  able to recover any part of the $2.5-bUllon  development cost of the Concorde through a  levy on sales. He added  that further de velopment spending to improve the aircraft's  performance, as urged by  the Concorde's  manufacturers, would also be lost, that pro duction of any number of Concordes sold  would result in further huge losses per plane,  and  that operation of  the aircraft could  possibly cost British Airways ""many mU11ons of pounds"" annually in lost profits.  Benn emphasized  that  the new WUson  government had made no decisions about the  Concorde's future. ""In view of the size of  the sums of public expenditure involved and  the importance of the decisions that must  now be made,"" Benn said, ""I  thought  it  right to place these facts before the House  [of Commons) and the country before any  decisions are reached."" The !allure of the  Concorde, he told a press conference, would  be ""a national  tragedy.""  RAMIFICATIONS  Despite the disclaimer, Benn's statement  sounded ominous. To Michael Heseltine, Min ISter for Aerospace in the Heath government,  which was voted out of ofH.ce on Feb. 28,  Benn's statement seemed likely to do ""the  maximum possible harm and the minimum  possible good""  to  the Concorde unless he  intended  to cancel  the project. And sea soned London aerospace industry observers  read the statement as preparing the ground  for a possible cancellation attempt.  If the Wilson government does eventually  press  for  cancellation,  a  head-on Anglo French row seezns inevitable. When WUson  last tried this tack, in 1964, he was advised  that to cancel unilaterally might violate the  treaty setting up the project.  MOUNTING COSTS  Benn's figures indicate that to cancel now  woul<l cost the British taxpayer $190-mi111on.  Merely to complete the 16 aircraft being bunt  would cost the British public purse $480-mil Uon  to $570-mlllion. The French proposal  for three additional planes and longer-range  fuel tanks would raise the ante to between  $510-million and $675-milllon. And, accord  ing to Benn's figuring, if 100 Concordes were  bunt and sold, the British share of the pro duction losses would reach $280-million to  $580-mi111on.  The  Concorde's manufacturers-British  Aircraft Corp., Rolls-Royce  ( 1971) , Aero spatiale, and Snecma-want to improve the  Concorde's engines and change its wing de sign as well as add extra fuel tanks, which  they forecast would make possible sales ot  about 130 Concordes by  the early 1980s,  Benn s  statement disputes this, nothing the  effects of both the temporary fuel shortage  and other unresolved  issues could ""reduce  sales substantially."" British Aircraft had no  comment, but the London Times summed  up: ""The gloomiest government report on  the Concorde ever.""  [From the Houston Post, Mar. 18, 1974]  SUPERSONIC  PHOENIX  Americans who assumed that the SST had  been ktlled off by Congress and who thought  that the financial flop of the Concorde had  justified  the kUling may be  interested  to  know that the government is now spending  $20 million  in a  three-year study seeking  modifications of the SST to make it environ mentally safe. Department of Transportation  scientists  report  that  the SST's environ mental problems can be overcome within 10  years ""without great cost.""  This seems to overlook the fact that DOT  is concentrating its scientists and mUUons  on a plane that will serve no more than one half of one per cent of all American&-those  few who fiy overseas and would pay double  and triple fares  to cut three hours off the  flight. The news comes at a time when Ameri cans by the mUUons are in dally, practical  need of better commuter trains and buses,  of better mass transit systems and railroads,  of motor vehicles that will use the least pos sible amount of fuel.  When the SST was voted down by Congress  in March 1971, it had already cost more than  $1 billion-86 per cent of it federal money.  Then the administration asked for another  $83.5 million  in shut-off funds  to cushion  the shock of curtailment for  the corpora tions working with the government on the  project. But by May-three months after the  vote to end the development plan-the ad ministration was  trying  to have  the $83.5  mtllion diverted to revive work on the pro totype.  Economists as well as environmentalists  were fighting the SST. Walter w. Heller, for mer chairman of the President's Council of  Economic Advisers, said then: "" ... the SST  dismally falls the fundamental tests of the  market place. The benefits wm go mostly  to the high-income and business travelers- for whom a three-hour instead of a six-hour  crossing is meaningful-while the risks and  costs wm be borne by the taxpayers, most  of whom wm never fiy the SST.""  Britain and France  forged on,  finished  their Concorde at costs running 500 per cent  higher than estimates, and have not been able  to persuade a commercial airline in this coun try to take one, even on a rental basis. The  finished Concorde-a beautiful bird-is not  economically feasible;  it wm never pay its  development costs; no single Concorde wUl  pay for itself even if flying with every seat  filled on every flight.  Now the administration ts asking for a com paratively modest appropriation for railroad  research, while Congress and DOT expect ran roads to make a comeback and become self supporting with old tracks and obsolescent  passenger cars. In contrast, Europe and Japan  have been running fast, modern trains for  years. And France  is developing the Aero train. It clocked 234 m.p.h. on a  test track  outside Orleans last week. It runs on a cush ion of air, and the French expect tt to revo lutionize ran travel.  SENATE ADOPTS NEW WAY OF  HANDLING BUDGET  ",1974

This is primarily due to the  grossly inequitable competition with our  fishing  industry by foreign fleets. The  drain on the supply of fish for the domes tic  fishermen  is  clearly  evident,  and  the effect on the American fishing  in dustry  is dramatic. The 12-mile  limit  should be extended. The News Tribune  of Woodbridge, N.J., carried a most ap propriate editorial in the March 13 issue  on this subject. When the United Na tions Law of the Seas conference con venes  in Caracas later this year, it is  hoped that an agreement will be reached  which will protect  the U.S.  coastline  from being violated by foreign fishing  vessels. Mr. Speaker, I  recommend that  my colleagues consider the following:  (From the Woodbridge (N.J.) News Tribune,  Mar. 13, 1974]  FisH NEED PROTECTION  In an effort to curb year-round fishing ex peditions by foreign  trawlers off  the East  Coast,  the Emergency Committee  to Save  America's Marine Resources is seeking sup port nationwide for a 200-mile limit.  Located in Englewood Cliffs at 110 Char lotte Pl., the volunteer com.m.ittee  includes  sport fishermen, charter boat captains and  commercial fishermen in the state. Their goal  1s passage of a pending bill in Congress to  extend the present 12-mile limit to 200 miles  for fishing only.  Later this year, representatives of 135 na-,  tions w11I gather in Venezuela under United  Nations sponsorship to discuss laws of the  sea. The American com.m.ittee said it would  be willing to accept a compromise 1f one is  agreed upon at the meeting.  Those who are campaigning for the 200mile limit hope to arouse the concern of all  Americans to the dangers posed to America's  fishing areas. The overriding fear 1s that the  fishing banks will be wiped out, including  those off the New Jersey coast, if giant foreign  fishing fleets are permitted to continue their  operations without interruption.  The danger is real, according to the U.S.  Department of Commerce. In the last decade,  the stock of edible fish has been depleted 65  per cent off the New England, Long Island  and Jersey coasts because of foreign fishing  fleet operations, including huge Soviet fish ing fleets.  More often than not, the ""fishing'' that  takes place consists of scooping up every thing without any thought to preservation of  marine life.  result, haddock have all but disappeared off the Jersey coast.  Other species also have been affected.  Fish prices have increased dramatically.  Existing agreements between the U.S. and  foreign nations--with the Soviet Union, for  example-have been denounced as all but a  joke, with the joke being played on the U.S.  I! fish stocks are not permitted to sustain  themselves, the end result wlll be the destruction of valuable fishing banks.  Extension of  the  12-mile  limit  to 200  mlles--wlth whatever enforcement measures  are needed-will  offer  needed protection.  Congress should act quickly.

129,,93,-0.462,441,7,Mr. BRADEMAS.," Mr. Speaker, the im portance of environmental education if  we are to meet successfully the chal lenges  of  burgeoning  environmental  degradation is vividly illustrated by an  excellent article in the March 2, 1974  edition of Science News.  The article focuses, Mr. Speaker, on a  project in Ohio's Cuyahoga River, which  is so choked with oil that several years  ago it burst into :flames.  The project, funded by the Office of  Environmental Education in the Office  of Education and  the Environmental  Protection Agency,  brings  youngsters  and men and women together to learn  about the biology and chemistry of the  gunk they find in the Cuyahoga and its  tributaries, and to examine the social  causes and potential cures of the water shed's Uls.  Mr. Speaker, because this article pro vides an example of the extraordinary  importance of the work being supported  by the omce of Environmental Educa tion, under its capable Director, Walter  insert it at this point in the  J. Bogan, I  RECORD:  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION THROUGH  EDUCATION'  Kids are wading in the Cuyahoga again. Now  that the river is much cleaner than the time  its oil-polluted surface caught fire, where it  flows  through Cleveland  into Lake Erie.  Rather, a  unique experiment  in environ mental education has brought students from  elementary school to the master's degree level  back to the river most people had abandoned.  With funds from the Environmental Pro tection Agency, the Office of Environmental  Education  (OEE)  and private local groups,  the Cuyahoga Heritage Project is one of a  growing number of studies in environmental  education  designed  to get  students  ancl  teachers out of the classroom and into con frontation with the practical problems of  everyday life.  Some of the high-school students that now  gingerly wade into the river and its tribu taries for samples of scum can remember  swimming in clear side streams just a few  years ago. And as they learn about the biol ogy and chemistry of the gunk they find in  these streams now, they are also  inquiring  about the social causes and potential cures  of the watershed's ills.  But important as it is, a  lot more than  just the Cuyahoga River  is at stake here.  Indeed,  the  issues involved are among the  most fundamental of education and democ racy-whether or not a generation of con cerned and technologically informed citizens  can be trained  in time to meet the grave  challenges of environmental survival that wUl  surely arise within  the  lifetimes of  these  concerned students.  Past efforts have  failed. The  traditional  disciplines of science education have  long  presented the ""facts"" of ecological fraglllty  and  the health hazards of pollution. The  encroachment of waste and development on  nature has been chronicled by many conservationists, crying from the wilderness. But  students were informed, not inspired; above  all, they never became involved.  Now, that may change. Environmental edu cation is slowly gaining ground as a spon",1974

There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the REc ORD, as follows:  Dm CoNsUMER ADvocATES TALK THE PRicE  OF FOOD UP?  ""Imagine that you own a farm  .  .  .

America is faced with food shortages. And  strangely enough, those who have expressed  the greatest concern over rising food prices  have been  those most responsible for  the  shortages and the even greater price increas es that followed.  Let me try to explain what I mean.  Trying to solve food shortaegs with a food price freeze is like trying to solve a  teacher  shortage by placing a  ceiling on  teachers'  salaries. Instead of easing the shortage, you  would create additional shortages. Problems  of shortages are  solved by programs  that  encourage production, not by those that dis courage it.  Unfortunately, many politicians  in both  the Congress and  the Administration  took  the easy way out.

133,House,93,-0.477,558,7,Mr. HARRINGTON.," Mr.  Speaker,  once again we are witnessing the annual  spectacle of  the House debate on  the  validity of  the Committee on Internal  Security. To my mind, the usefulness of  this committee--which used to gain its  notoriety as  the House Committee on  On-American Activitie&-HUAC-is no  longer even a question. Yet, once again,  we are asked to approve funds for HISC,  despite the continued inability of this  committee to demonstrate one shred of  value. I urge my colleagues in the House  to reject House Resolution 937, which  would provide $475,000-on top of more  .than $250,000 automatically received by  the committee--to continue  the exist ence of this archaic committee.  Last year, during the first session of  the 93d Congress, an average of 579 bills  were referred to each of the 21 standing  committees of the House. Of the total of  12,150, only 13 bills were  referred  to  HISC. Eight of these 13 were duplicate  bills. As for the remaining five bills, it is  uncertain whether the House Internal  Security Committee had proper jurisdic tion over them in any case.  Public hearings  and  committee  re ports by HISC are few and far between.  A total of 21 days of public hearings  were held by HISC last year, and, the  committee met only 28 times in any form.  In fact, since the committee's first or ganization-as the so-called Dies com mittee  in 1938, only six bills  reported  by the committee have become law. Of  174 contempt citations issued by HISC  up to 1970, 142 have failed in the courts.  The .truth is that HISC is a continuing  waste of the taxpayer's money, and the  maintenance of  thousands of  ill-con trolled dossiers on American citizens is  an insult-and a menace--to the civil  liberties guaranteed by the Constitution.  The funding  resolution we are now  -considering would  perpetuate--to  the  tune of nearly a half million dollars-the  -practice of this House in throwing more  :and more good money after bad. For a  c_ommittee with a legislative function just  :short of invisible--to judge by the rec ord-a staff of 42  individuals is rather  large. Principally,  this staff is used  to  maintain the committee's investigations  :and compilation of data on alleged un _American activities of  individuals and  organizations. What the committee finds,  through  its often slipshod work,  then  -works  its way  into the files for which  the committee has deservedly gained ill  repute.  More  than 25 Government agencies  .and departments use the msc files for  preemployment checks, although in re Cent years checks have diminished sub stantially. In 1967 the Civil Service Com mission used HISC files 288,000  times,  while in 1972 the number of searches fell  to 20,000. The reason for this is that 95  percent of the data in the msc files is  discarded by the Civil Service Commis sion, and the information gained from  the files is of very doubtful value.  Even if used less, the maintenance of  HISC files is open to serious criticism. In  the first instance, we might ask by what  authority the executive agencies and de partments utilize these files. There is no  such authority. In fact,  it would seem  far more proper, in view of the separation  of powers, for the executive agencies to  do their own security checks. In this re gard, I have no doubt that the Justice  Department has every necessary capabil ity to assume the functions that HISC  presently pretends to do. A further ques tion, of course, is whether a free society  can tolerate any sort of organized super vision as is at the core of HISC.  It seems to me that committees exist  to review, develop and refine legislation,  and to carry out certain oversight func tions. HISC does not fit this mold. Its  legislative output is virtually nonexistent,  and its nominal functions are best re served to the judicial or executive bran ches-as they are of a police or intelli gence character-not the Congress.  As I am sure is known to this House,  the Select Committee on Committees has  urged that HISC be eliminated and that  its functions be transferred to the Com mittee on Government Operations. I con cur in part and disagree in part. There is  little question that the need for HISC, if  it ever existed, is now long gone. But to  transfer its functions to the Government  Operations Committee-rather than the  Judiciary Committee, which would be  better equipped to consider internal se curity issues-seems more a function of  internal politics within the House than  sensible, functional division of jurisdic  tiona! responsibilities.  In view of the Committee on Commit tees report, I cannot see any justification  for pumping another $475,000 down the  drain to support HISC. I urge that mY  colleagues reject House Resolution 937.

Therefore, I offer this amendment to  S. 3044 to forbid any Senator, Congress man, Resident Commissioner, or Delegate  from using the frank to make solicita tions.

138,,93,0.038,727,7,Mr. FISHER.," Mr. Speaker, under leave  to extend my remarks I include a com munication from Col. Hubert A. Con nelly, USAF, retired, president and ex ecutive director of Federation of Com missioned Uniformed Servicemen, which  contains a position paper of that olga nization. It follows:  ""STAY STRONGER IN THE LAST QUARTER OF A  like  PERn.ous CENTUBY""  Today most Americans are sick of war and  many are only too eager to listen hopefully  to  talk of disarmament  and detente or  friendship with Soviet Russia and Commu nist China. Words  ""containment"" or  ""equilibrium of military forces"" have been  replaced by popular slogans like ""negotia tion, not confrontation."" It has become al most taboo to talk &';>Out strengthening our  Inilitary posture and keeping it strong.  We believe that the ever-growing military  strength of our potential adversaries,  the  two giant communist powers and their allies,  continues to be the clear and present dan ger to our survival. Their strategy is to lull  us into a false sense of security, a posture of  military weakness, and then strike.  There is danger now that the voice of peo ple like ourselves may be lost in the shuffle  toward Utopia. It is the voice of Americans  who now serve, or in the past have served as  commissioned or warrant  officers  of our  armed forces-a highly important group of  people, whose dedication has seen us all  through many crises in the past. It is the  voice of reason. FOCUS intends to make sure  that voice will be heard.  We shall consistently speak out for a na tional military posture that Will provide:  Superiority in strategic weapons.  Leadership  in research and development  and shortened  lead  time  to produce new  weapons.  Reliable  systems.  Continued modernization of both our ac tive forces and our back-up forces: the Re serve and National Guard components.  Maintenance or our all-volunteer armed  forces, both active and back-up, at adequate  strength  levels with professionally compe tent personnel.  intelligence and early warning  9107  We shall consistently oppose any steps to ward unilateral disarmament or unilateral  withdrawal of u.s. armed forces from for ward deployed positions overseas. We firmly  believe that any arms limitation or force re duction agreements that we negotiate must  be based on maintenance of a  I'Jalance of  m111tary strength worldwide--an equilibrium  that will offer our adversaries no temptation  for aggression against us or our allies.  We recognize that our country has entered  a new era of negotiations, but believe that  unless we bargain from strength with our  totalitarian adversaries, we face unaccept able risks to our survival. In short, we say  Teddy Roosevelt's words early in this cen tury: ""Speak softly a.nd carry a big stick""  are still wise advice for the last quarter of a  pertlous century.  CUBANS EXPORT COMMUNISM TO  THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA  HON. JOHN R. RARICK  OF LOUISIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 1, 1974  ",1974
139,,93,0.333,727,7,Mr. RARICK.," Mr. Speaker, the advo cates of normalizing relations with the  Castro Government of Cuba, those who  have been making a concerted effort to  convince the American public that Castro  has abandoned his program of exporting  Communist revolution from his  island  base, must have considered it a severe  setback for their cause to learn that a  Cuban brigade has been serving with  Syria against Israel in the Middle East  and against the Portuguese in Africa.  This  revelation certainly brings  the  credibillty of the pro-Castro Cuba apol ogists  into  serious question. This  re cent example of exportation of Castro style armed force to Africa and the Mid dle East causes even the casual observer  to wonder what possible advantage this  country would  receive  from granting  recognition and trade assistance to the  prime inatigator of world unrest.  I insert the related newsclipping:  [From  the Washington Star-News, Apr. 1,  1974]  CUBAN  BRIGADE ON LINE  IN  CONTENDS  SYRIA, DAYAN  (By Jeremiah O'Leary)  Israel Defense Minister Moshe Dayan said  yesterday that a Cuban Brigade is among  forces that have been aligned against Israel  on the side of the Arabs in the Middle East  confrontation.  Speaking on the nationally televised pro gram, ""Meet The Press,"" Dayan again  re ferred to outside assistance given the Syrians  by  Iraq  'and other Arab  countries, along  with arms from the Soviet Union. But it was  the first time a responsible leader has men tioned a Cuban presence on the Syrian side  in any strength.  U.S. officials said they have known small  groups of Cuban technicians were playing  a  role in the employment of sophisticated  weapons  tn the Middle East, but they ex pressed puzzlement at Dayan's contention  that  the Cubans  are  there  in  brigade  strength.  Israeli  sources  here  noted  that Dayan  knows  the difference between a brigade, a  regiment and a squadron and suggested the  matter was worth  looking  into. U.S. and  Israeli omclals agreed that small groups of  Cubans have appeared in Yemen and some  of the smaller Arab states such as Dhofar.  ",1974
140,,93,0.244,753,7,Mr. MIZELL.," Mr. Speaker, I am now  in the process of sending to every home  in North Carolina's Fifth Congressional  District a copy of my latest report from  Congress.  This report discusses many of the ma jor matters being considered by the Con gress, and the role which I have played  in some of these efforts.  It is my hope that my colleagues will  find this report interesting, and for their  information and consideration I am in serting it in the RECORD at this time:  CONGRESSMAN MIZELL'S REPORT  ENERGY  The nation's energy problems continue to  dominate the news and most of the attention  of the Congress and the American people.  Thanks  to a mild winter and  the  tre mendous cooperation of the American people,  we are no longer faced with a major crisis in  home heating oil which so many of us had  feared.  St1ll energy problems are very much with  us, and I want to give you a summary of the  actions that I have been taking in an effort  to solve those problems.  First,  I met  in Winston-Salem  recently  9133  in  in  with gasoline dealers who had contacted me  about problems  they were experiencing in  obtaining  adequate  gasoline  supplies  for  their customers.  Second, I met with oftlclals of the Federal  Energy Office, including Deputy Administra tor John Sawhill, to urge that FEO require  the Atlantic Richfield and British Petroleum  oll companies to resume their North Carolina  operations, which had been abandoned  1973. These arrangements are  now being  made.  Third, I met with Secretary of State Henry  Kissinger  for an assessment of when  the  Arab oil embargo might be relaxed or lifted  altogether. As this newsletter is written, Dr.  Kissinger is in the Middle East negotiating  on just this point.  And fourth, I was able to arrange for the  Federal Energy Office  to send an ""action  team"" to North Carolina on February 23-24  to investigate the gasoline shortage situation  in our state.  Action teams were dispatched recently to  twenty other states, and most received addi tional allocations as a  result of  the FEO  investigations.  I was able to arrange this FEO investiga tion for North Carolina through a series of  meetings With White House officials, after  sending a  telegram  to  the Federal Energy  Office requesting that agency's help for our  situation.  In the telegram, I pointed out the growing  loss of employment being experienced  North Carolina,  the  difficulty  that many  people are having in obtaining enough fuel  to carry on their businesses or even get to  work, and the extremely long lines that mo torists are having to endure to buy gasoline  these days.  (And let me assure you that I sympathize  with you about those lines. The situation In  Washington is as bad as it is in North Caro lina, and I've waited in lines and pump~d my  own gas right along with everybody else. My  older soil Dave got up at 5:30 In the morning  the other day just to buy some gasoline, but  by the time he got to the station a few min~  utes later, there were already five cars ahead  of him. So I understand exactly what man}  of you have had to go through in the pa.s1  several weeks.)  In response to my telegram and my meet   lngs with the White House, a two-man teant  from FEO's regional office in Atlanta met 1I1  Raleigh with representatives from the Gov.  ernor's office and the state energy office  assess the extent of North Carolina's prob   lems, and we hope their  investigation wW  speed the day when supplies wm again bf  plentiful in North Carolina.  Through my work on the House subcom.  mittee on energy, I will continue to do aU  that I can to see that goal achieved in Nortl:j  Carolina and throughout the country.  I have taken these constructive steps in aJt  effort to help solve the energy problems ilt  our district and throughout the nation.  Finally, I want you to know that I hav   appealed  to Federal Energy AdministratoJ  William E.  Simon  to  assure  the  ""small  farmer"" the availability of gasoline. A prob   lem exists for the ""small farmer"" who h8.4  been purchasing gasoline at the pump an<1  is without storage capacity.  A much less constructive step was take!\  by  the Congress with  the passage of  the  Emergency Energy Act  recently. The ma.  jority in Congress continues to deal with the  politics of the energy problem, rather thazt  the problem itself. This inevitably makes fol  bad  legislation, and I was faced with  th   choice of voting in favor of a blll that I be   lieve would actually make matters worse, 01  vote against it and insist that my colleaguell  in the Congress provide a better legislative  tool with which to work on our energy prob   lems. I chose the second course, and I will  do all that I can to see a  responsible and  truly effective energy bill passed this year.  tQ  ",1974
141,Senate,93,0.056,766,7,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President, today  I am introducing a major new tax pro posal that I have called Simpliform. The  standard deduction would be eliminated  as well as most itemized deductions of a  nonbusiness  nature.  Personal  exemp tions would also be eliminated but would  be  replaced by  a  personal exemption  credit of $250 per adult.  This would  reduce  the  income  tax  form  four  lines-the present  form  1040 has over 64  lines. The  taxpayer  would merely state one, his gross income;  two, his gross tax; three, credit for ex emptions; and four, his net tax or re fund. Everyone would be  treated  the  same. Everyone would use this form.  Rates would also be lower. They would  go  from 10 percent on incomes under  $10,000  to 50 percent on incomes over  $1 million. The present range is from  14 percent to 70 percent.  Ralph Nader's Tax Reform Research  Group said of Simpliform, ""no hocus pocus with numbers: honest reform.""  Simpliform would:  Double  the  tax base from $500 bil lion to $1  trillion:  this allows tax rates  to be cut on the average by half.  The tax form goes from 64 lines to 4.  The number of tax brackets goes from  27  to 9. The number of tax rate tables  goes from four to one.  All dollars are treated equally; each  adult receives a $250 tax credit, replac ing the present system of personal ex emptions  which  treats  persons  un equally-for the wealthy person in the  70-percent bracket, his $750 personal  exemption is worth $535 whereas a less  affluent person in the 14-percent bracket  is valued by  the Government at only  $105.  All personal  itemized deductions are  eliminated, which means a much lower  rate schedule: for a couple it means no  taxes below $5,000, 10 percent up to $10,000, 15 percent up to $15,000 and so on  with a maximum rate of 50 percent for  incomes over $1 million.  Additionally, Simpliform will greatly  reduce the cost of preparing, collecting  and enforcing  taxes from  the present  level of $2 billion annually.  That is the structure of my proposal.  The heart of the proposal lies in mak ing our antiquated tax system not only  more fair but simpler  to comply with  and to administer.  In a recent interview published in U.S.  News & World Report,  the new Com missioner of Internal Revenue, Donald  Alexander, stated:  I would like to have a. simpler tax code  and  tax form, one which  is better under stood by more people.  He went on to say:  Pressure toward simplification is going to  come  from ordinary people, not pressure  groups, who are willing to see some shifts  of a minor nature  in  the  tax burden  in  order to get real reform.  Simpliform would  achieve Commis sioner Alexander's aim.  There is little doubt that a sense of  unrest characterizes  the mood of  the  American taxpayer. Yet, efforts to adjust  the present tax code  to make it more  equitable have only made it more difficult  for the individual to determine his actual  liability. Sophisticated techniques and a  major industry have been created to cope  with  the  ever-increasing  forms  and  format. Somehow, this keeps working to  the disadvantage of the small taxpayer or so it seems to him.  Let us see how a family would come  out under Simpliform and how it com pares with current law. Let us sa;v that  a family has two young children and a  combined salary of $12,500 per year.  Under current law, the family takes the  standard deduction, four exemptions and  the parents file jointly. Tax bill: $1,300.  Under Simpliform the ""Gross Income''  on line 1 is $12,500 and the ""Gross Tax""  on line 2 is $1,375. But the family get two  credits of $250 each on line 3. Subtrac ting these from line 2, the ""Net Tax"" on  line 4 is $875-a saving of $425.  Tax Analysts and Advocates, a public  int~rest tax law and research group, has  estrmated that in fiscal year 1975 ""tax  expenditures""  for  individuals  will  amount to $78 billion. In other words,  some $78 billion will escape  taxation  through loopholes and incentives created  by Congress over the years. The distin guished Senator from Minnesota  (Mr.  MoNDALE) has recently noted one of the  effects of  this  leakage:.._the  fact  that  402 Americans with  incomes of over  $100,000 paid no tax at all in 1973. In cidentally, I was pleased to see that Sen ator MoNDALE  is also  interested in re placing the personal exemption with a  tax credit, and I have asked that I be  made a cosponsor of S. 2906, the Sena tor's bill to achieve that goal.  All of us are a ware of the erosion of  the tax base, and how it bears upon the  tax  rates  charged  to middle-income  Americans. All of us are eager  for a  thoroughgoing reform of the tax struc ture, for a system that is both equitable  and simple. Our problem is that we all  and tax breaks. Simpliform will wipe the  want to protect our own special loopholes  slate clean by eliminating them all. It  may well be that Congress will wish to  reinstate some deductions, such as that  for business expenses. But if deductions  are maintained, let it be on the basis of  their merits, and not their longevity of  service to special interests.  Simpliform would eliminate loopholes  and lay the tax burden where it belongs on those who can bear it.  Mr. President, today I am introducing  my Simpliform proposal. I also have a  copy of my 1972 statement to the Repub lican platform committee, and the report  of  the Nader Tax Reform Research  Group. I should like to direct the par ticular attention of Senators to the plat form  committee  statement,  for  it  contains a great deal of useful informa tion on Simpliform's benefits for senior  citizens,  entrepreneurs, middle-income  earners, and single persons.  I ask unanimous consent that my 1972'  Republican platform committee state ment on Simpliform, the report of the  tax  reform  research  group,  and  the  text of the bill be printed at this point in  the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the items  were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  REPUBLICAN PLATFORM COMMITTEE TESTIMONY  1972  (By Senator MARK 0. HATFIELD)  Mr. Chairman, we are all familiar with two  aspects of our Federal  income  tax system  which are wrong: it is much too complicated  and it is not as fair as it could and should be.  It is horribly complicated and confusing  when:  Nearly $2 billion are spent in filling out tax  forms and even then the more than 50 000  ""tax preparers"" cannot get it right most of  the time. In fact, former Treasury Secretary  John Connally pointed out that a. Treasury  survey of such returns found 97% inaccurate.  The income tax form has grown from 18  lines to 63 lines, not counting the multitude  of additional schedules. And the book of in structions  is so complex that even college  graduates cannot understand all of it.  A Treasury official  (quoted in the Wash ington Evening Star News, August 4, 1972)  stated that ""if we don't simplify taxes, the  system wlll fall on its own weight ... the  seeds of decay are growing.""  As a matter of fact, even the Internal Rev enue Service with its 70,000 employees cannot  complete the tax forms properly any more.  In a test by the Wall Street Journal (Aprll12,  1972)  five different IRS offices came up with  five  different  tax  results  for  the  same  taxpayer.  When  the  tax system has reached  this  point, we must all admit it is in a shambles.  Even acknowledged tax experts say ""they are  knowing less and less about more and more.""  From a. one paragraph amendment to the  Constitution, the income tax has emerged as  a. hydra-headed monster that now takes more  than a 6-foot bookshelf to contain its laws  and regulations.  We also know that the tax system is not  fair: a Harris Poll last year found that 69%  of the public had joined the ""tax revolt"" up from 43%  two years earlier. The tax sys tem is unfair when 21,317 persons in 1969  with incomes over $20,000, including 56 mll llonaires, paid no taxes whatsoever.  People with income under $2,000 paid one half of this in all forms of taxes  (federal,  state, and local), as computed by the U.S  Census Department in its 1970 Census, at  the same  time  that one multi-mlliiona.lre  paid $500 and another paid $4,500  in fed eral income taxes, which is less than they  make in one hour. The rest of us end up pay ing about 30% of our income in all forms of  taxes regardless of the income level despite  the alleged progressive nature of the fed eral income tax tha.t should rectify all this.  The Congress and the Treasury have tried  to correct these admitted deficiencies in the  tax system. It was tried in 1954, 1964, and  finally in the ""Tax Reform Act of 1969."".An  attempt was made to fill loopholes but more  were created. It seems as though an effort  was made to achieve reform through com plexity but only more complexity resulted.  The 1969 Act became so complex  it was  labeled ""The Lawyers and Accountants Re lief Act of 1969"" by the Assistant Secretary  ",1974
142,Senate,93,-0.293,844,7,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President,  last  week,  the Democratic Party of South  Carolina met in convention at Colum bia. On Wednesday, March 27,  the as sembled delegates heard one of the most  dynamic speeches it has even been my  privilege  to hear. It was  the conven tion's keynote address, and it was de livered by the distinguished junior Sen ator from Minnesota, my good  friend  HUBERT H. HUMPHREY.  The former Vice President addressed  himself forcefully and eloquently to the  issues of the day, and the South Caro lina Democratic Party responded with  an outpouring of enthusiasm, as did peo ple all across the State who learned of  the speech.  HUBERT HUMPHREY knows what Ameri ca  can do, because he  knows what  America has already done. He knows full  well  the severity of the challenges we  face, but he faces  them with faith  in  America and confidence in the future.  Mr. President, this is a speech that is  right and timely not just for a political  party. It is  right and  timely  for all  Americans. It deserves  to be read and  pondered widely. And for that reason, I  ask unanimous consent that the text of  Senator HuMPHREY's keynote address be  printed in the RECORD.  And I wish to take this opportunity  to thank Senator HUMPHREY again for  making the trip to Columbia and for de livering such an eloquent address.  There being no objection, the address  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  KEYNOTE ADDRESS BY SENATOR HUBERT H.  HUMPHREY  South Carolina is a state that brings back  some of my fondest memories. The Demo cratic Party of South Carolina has been lrind  to me. It  is good  to see  so many of my  friends again  today. I am happy to be here  with my good friend, Fritz Hollings.  South Carolina can be justly proud of his  outstanding record and reputation for hard  work in the U.S. Senate.  Do me a  favor. Do yourselves and South  Carolina and the country a favor: Send Fritz  back to the Senate in November.  It is wonderful to see such a fine crowd of  active, enthusiastic Democrats. As members  of our great party, you know we have been  experiencing a period of intense, sometimes  painful, self-examination the past few years.  We have stood in front of a mirror and  turned on a piercing light of introspection  and asked ourselves, how can we do better?  How can we fulfill our high ideals? How can  we remake our party so that it does a more  effective job of being the party of the people,  the party of the future, the party of promise  for every American?  The answers have not always come easily,  nor have they always been easy to accept.  They have occasionally divided us, caused  vigorous disagreements, intense debate. But  we have survived, we have grown stronger for  our discomfort. We have managed not only to  bring our widely different personalities and  points of view closer together, but we have  also attracted and retained people who for merly were outside the party. They have ac cepted us, and we them. They hold active and  responsible positions, and we have all been  enriched by their participation.  Our experiences have made us closer, and  will continue to draw us together. We are  like a family that has had an argument, and  after it is settled, feels more like a  family  for having shared the pain of dispute.  The currents of change that are sweeping  our party are paralleled by similar currents  across our nation.  We have experienced great dissension and  great difficulties in the American family.  We have seen the bounty of our great na tion mismanaged at home and squandered  for short-term advantage abroad.  We have seen our economy neglected.  We have seen shortages and scarcity grow  -through private greed and government short sightedness.  We have seen our Constitutional system of  delicate  checks  and balances dangerously  tilted in favor of one branch of government  at the expense of the others.  We have seen our political processes cor rupted.  We have seen political power abused, and  money abused as a means of buying power.  . We have seen highly placed  trustees of  the public confidence betray their trust, and  act as though they were above the law-in deed, they have acted as though they were  the law.  These  experiences,  following hard after  nearly a  decade of dissension within our  society at home and in war overseas, have  been a heavy burden for the American peo ple and their leaders to withstand.  I am sure that a nation of lesser character  and strength would have buckled under such  pressures.  But  the American people have not  lost  their confidence or their nerve or their guts.  We are a nation nearly 200 years old, and  in that time we have withstood other times  of difiic'ulty. We are a nation forged in trial  and weened on challenge.  The first 100 years of our existence were  spent in moving out beyond the next moun tain range, the next untamed forest, the next  desert-building and growing and enduring  and overcoming.  We built a nation that spanned a conti nent and then fought a war that threatened  to split in two what we had built, and we  went on to heal the breach and build some  more.  our second hundred years have 'been a pe riod of getting it all together, finding better  and better ways of making use of what we  gained  in our first century. We moved be yond the seas to become the world's leading  power and then shouldered the tremendous  burdens of that leadership, fighting, winning  two world wars and then rebuilding what  those wars destroyed far beyond our home  soil.  And in the midst of all that, we endured  and pulled ourselves out of a Great Depres sion that not only failed to grind us down,  but instead built up our spirit and taught  us new ways of achieving stability and a  vigorous, healthy nation of industry.  What is our secret? Why have we always  been able to pick ourselves up and jump back  into the fight?  Because Americans have by nature and circumstance always been a people that has  learned by its experiences. We are a practical  people who do it if it looks like it will work.  We live by trial and error, by experim.enta   tion.  The American way may be wasteful and at  times painful, but on the positive side of the  balance, it is a way that provides freedom  and stimulates individual initiative.  Look at what we have experienced and  what we have achieved:  Our resources were being plundered in the  last century and early in this one. We devel oped the concepts of conservation, the ma.n agement of our resources, the techniques ot.  returning when we took, so there would al   ways be more.  Our  financial  institutions  in  the 1920's  were irresponsible, and little concerned about  the public good. We created the Securities  Exchange Commission and an excellent sys tem of banking laws.  The big railroads and utllities,  in  their  early years, misused  their power and har bored corruption. We wrote regulatory leg islation to correct the problems.  Our older  citizens we.re neglected. We  wrote the Social Security Act, and the Medi care and Medicaid programs.  Some of our citizens were denied the rights  and opportunities guaranteed in the Con stitution. We passed and enforced civil rights  laws.  The  lessons we have  learned have been  learned the hard way; but pain is a teacher  whose lectures are remembered.  We might have given up many times in  the past were it not for the foundations on  which our nation is built.  :Lt  tis not a  foundation of doctrine and  dogma, but a foundation of faith and values,  reason and pragmatism.  If we are to carry this grand experiment  in democracy forward, emerge from our pres ent set of trials and traumas once more re newed, invigorated, and triumphant, we must  recapture  these old values and principles  that have served us so well in the past.  V/e must make ourselves understand  the  true,  intrinsic value of  those  ideals. They  are  just as sturdy and dependable as they  were when our nation was  founded upon  them nearly two centuries ago.  We believe  in government by  men.  We believe  in government with integrity,  an essential virtue that we demand of our  leaders, even as we demand it of ourselves,  as individual citizens.  We believe in government by public trust,  and  that means  leaders who deserve our  trust, can win it and who fulfill  it.  We believe in self-reliance, but tempered  by a  sense of humanitarianism  and com passion.  We believe in achievement; we believe  progress; we believe in work.  And we believe in justice.  Our beliefs have always been closely tied  to our aspirations. We have often believed  in what we have not yet achieved, and then  have gone on to work for it, led onward by  our beliefs.  The preamble to the Constitution spells  out the faith and aspiration of America: ""a  more perfect unio:p.,""  ""justice,""  ""domestic  tranquility,"" ""the  common  defemse,'' ""the  general welfare,"" ""the blessings of  liberty  (for) ourselves and our posterity.""

143,Senate,93,-0.314,870,7,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President,  just re cently the Senate took action on one of  the most important pieces of legislation  that it will be called to act on this ses sion, the Budget Reform Act. In its Mon day, April 1, 1974 edition, the Wall Street  Journal took note of this action in its  ""Review and OUtlook"" Column, saying:  Congress  is showing great bipartisan re solve to mend its budget busting ways. We  hope the cure it is brewing works because  the health of the nation is at stake.  In the same column, the Wall Street  Journal noted the concern of the semor  Senator from Delaware (Mr. RoTH) that  this bill adopted by the Senate be con sidered a beginning of fiscal reform 111  the Congress  and  not  the  ultimate  solution.  Mr. President, because this column is  of general interest to the Senate, I ask  unanimous consent that it be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the column  was ordered to be printed in the REcORD,  as follows:  CONGRESS HUNTS FOR A CURE  Congress  is showing great bipartisan re solve to mend its budget busting ways. We  hope the cure it is brewing works because  the health of the nation is very much at  stake.  The problem has been perceived for some  time, in Congress, the Brookings Institution  and other public policy forums: The Presi dent may prepare a reason8ibly well-balanced  budget-or at least one that is not outra geously unbalanced; but by the time individ ual appropriations are worked over by con gressional committees, and some new appro priations added,  the spending side of the  budget has ballooned. The result: huge, in fia.tiona.ry deficits and, more recently, quar rels with the President over impoundments  and other attempts to resist congressional  spending mandates.

145,House,93,-0.468,922,7,Mr. LEGGETT.,"  Based on the record developed at hear ings on those -bills held last June by the  Merchant Marine Subcommittee under  the direction of its able chairman, the  Honorable FRANK M. CLARK, of Pennsyl vania,  and on  subsequent discussions  with all interested parties, a new bill, H.R.  12208, was introduced and subsequently  considered and reported out by the Com mittee on Merchant Marine and Fish eries.  With your kind permission, Mr. Speak er, I would now like to set forth some in formation first about the Port of Sacra mento, a small inland port on the out skirts of my home city of Sacramento,  Calif., and second about a unique opera tion, called the Container Barge Service,  conceived by its port director, Mr. Melvin  Shore, and placed in operation under his  capable direction. The bill now under  consideration in this chamber would re solve a  jurisdictional ""gray"" area be tween two Federal agencies over regula tion of the Container Barge Service.  The Sacramento Yolo Port District is  a public corporation formed under the  law of the State of California to operate  the Sacramento River Deepwater Ship  Channel project.  That project, better known as the Port  of Sacramento, consists of an inland port  with a  terminal  in West Sacramento,  Calif. At that location there is a harbor  and turning basin, and a shallow barge  canal and navigation lock connecting the  harbor area and the Sacramento River.  Its outlet to the sea is a 25-mile-long  manmade ship channel connecting the  harbor and the turning basin with the  lower reaches of the Sacramento River  which empties into deep water at Carqui nez Straights and San Francisco Bay.  The port, which received its first ves sel call on June 29, 1963, was constructed  by the U.S. Corps of Engineers at a Fed eral cost in excess of $41 million. The  Sacramento-Yolo Port District, as the re sponsible local agency, provided all the  terminal facilities and appurtenances in  the harbor area at a cost in excess of $15  million.  SACRAMENTO'S CONTAINER BARGE SERVICE  The advent of containerization has  been responsible for tremendous changes  in the ocean transportation industry. In cluded among them has been the design  of gigantic  containerships which  are  both expensive to construct and operate.  In their efforts to hold down costs steam ship companies have had to limit calls to  a few larger ports on each coast. Need less to say, the consequences of this could  spell disaster for  the Nation's smaller  inland ports.  Faced with the need to serve the ship pers in its area and this challenge to its  economic well being and  in order  to  adapt itself to the new realities of ocean  transportation, the Port of Sacramento  pioneered a unique method of attracting  general cargo which it inaugurated on  January 1, 1970, and designated as its  container barge service. This new serv ice involves the movement of merchan dise in containers between the Port of  Sacramento and ports in the San Fran cisco Bay area on a barge leased by the  port. The barge is moved by a tug which  has operating rights granted by the In terstate Commerce Commission.  The Container Barge Service is used  only to transport container cargo moving  wholly by water between a port in a for eign country or a non-contiguous State  or Territory and the Port of Sacramento  under a port-to-port ocean bill of lading  naming Sacramento as the port of origin  or destination. The service  is offered  solely  to  ocean  common  carriers  by  water. The Port of Sacramento acts as  the carrier's agent in transporting the  merchandise under a Sacramento bill of  lading as part of a  single continuous  port-to-port  water  movement.  The  movement of merchandise on the barge  is offered only as a service substituted in  lieu of  the direct physical call of  the  vessel at the Port of Sacramento which  is named in the bill of lading. Since in augurated on Jantlary 1, 1970, the service  has been covered by the rate schedule  which the Port of Sacramento filed with  the Federal Maritime Commission pursu ant to General Order No. 15 under the  Shipping Act of 1916. Charges as set  forth in the port's published rate sched ule for the service are paid by the steam ship companies which find it an econom ically advantageous alternative  to  the  costs represented by the 8 hours steam ing  time,  layover  time, and other ad ditional expenses  incurred  in  sending  the vessel directly  to Sacramento  for  less than a  large volume of cargo. The  service offered includes the loading and  unloading of the containers at the Port  of Sacramento to and from the barge as  well as the land carrier. The entire serv ice is on a single per container rate basis  as proved in the published rate schedule.  By letter dated August 11, 1970, ad dressed to both the Interstate Commerce  Commission and the Federal Maritime  Commission, the Port of Sacramento re quested an opinion as to which of those  two agencies had  jurisdiction over  its  container barge service. In a reply dated  October 19, 1970, George M. Stafford,  Chairman, Interstate Commerce Com mission, stated in part, as follows:  It  is our position  that your container  barge service  is subject  to  the  regulatory  authority of this Commission.  Chairman Stafford's letter went on to  say:  The question is governed by an interpreta tion of Part III of the Interstate Commerce  Act. Transportation in interstate or foreign  commerce which  is subject  to  the Act  defined in part as transportation of persons  or property wholly by water, or partly by  water  and  partly  by  railroad,  or motor  vehicle, to or from a place outside the United  States, but (1) only insofar as such trans portation by water  takes place  from any  place in the United States to any other place  therein after transshipment at a place within  the United States in a movement to a place  is  outside thereof or (2) in the case of a reverse  movement, only insofar as the transportation  from a foreign point takes place between two  United States points after transshipment at  the first point.  The Chairman's letter continued:  The word ""transshipment"" has never been  formally  interpreted  by  the Commission.  However,  for  some  time  it has been our  informal view  that  transshipment  in  this  context means  the  transfer of  ladings be tween different lines.  In a reply dated December 23, 1970, the  Port of Sacramento advised Chairman  Stafford that it would seek a legislative  clarification of  the issue of which the  two commissions had regulatory juris~  diction over the container barge service.  THE PORT OF SACRAMENTO IN THE MIDDLE  As previously indicated, the necessity  for  this  legislation  arises because an  ambiguity exists  as  to which of  two  Federal Commissions should have juris diction over the container barge service.  The port filed a rate schedule with the  Federal Maritime Commission  in  the  belief that since all other aspects of the  movement are under that Commission's  jurisdiction, logic dictates that the tiny  segment comprising its container barge  service be under  the same  regulatory  control. The carrier itself and the ports  at both end of the feeder system are sub ject to the Federal Maritime Commis sion's regulatory authority.  It would seem that under such circum stances where only one small portion  of a continuous movement in foreign or  offshore domestic commerce is provided  as a substitute for a direct vessel call,  the portion should be subject to the same  regulatory scheme applicable  to every  other aspect of the same movement. The  facts that, first, the service is offered as  a substituted feeder service to the carrier  which utilizes it is part and parcel of his  service to the shipper, and, second, the  port serves as the prime carrier's agent  and is reimbursed by the carrier for the  services rendered, bear repreating.  DECLARATORY ORDER  In an effort to resolve the ambiguity  administratively the Port of Sacramen to filed with the Interstate Commerce  Commission a petition for a declaratory  order that its container barge service is  not subject to the Commission's regula tory jurisdiction.  By decision dated June 5, 1972,  the  Commission  found  that  the container  barge  service  ""constitutes  transporta tion in interstate or foreign commerce  pursuant  to  the  Interstate Commerce  Act and therefore subject to economic  regulation by this Commission.""  In  its decision, however,  the Com mission made the following statements,  among others:  Nevertheless, we also recognize that, to a.  limited extent, operations of the specific type  performed by petitioner  through  its Con tainer Barge Service has no more than a de  minimis effort on interstate or foreign com merce as regulated by us. And within those  lintits we can foresee no adverse effects to  the public or the  inland water carriers of  the Congress were to remove such operations  from our  jurisdiction and place  them en tirely in the hands of the FMC.

148,House,93,-0.631,974,7,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, as author of  the Right to Financial Privacy Act of  1973, a bill cosponsored by 102 of my col leagues, I am pleased to add to the dis cussion today on this most pressing issue.  I was also a plaintiff in a case on the  constitutionality of  the Bank Secrecy  Act that this blll would amend, and the  Supreme Court yesterday handed down  its long-awaited decision. The Court 1n  effect chose to skirt the issue by finding  that the plaintiffs didn't have standing and thereby threw the issue back into the  lap of Congress where it was first created.  The Congress passed  the Bank Se crecy Act in 1970 with the intention of  assisting the war on crime. Its purpose  was to facllitate the gathering of infor mation on suspected criminals by per mitting any Government omcial to have  access to individual bank records. In ad dition, banks were required to report ""un usual"" currency transactions to the Sec retary of  the Treasury as well as all  domestic transactions over $10,000. The  banks, then, were to act as investigators  for the Government-to spy on their own  customers.  I  filed suit with the ACLU and the  Oallfornia Bankers Association and got  an  injunction against  those  reporting  provisions of the act. However, since the  recordkeeping requirements were upheld,  we appealed the decision, as did the Gov ernment from the other side, and it was  thus cross-appealed up to the Supreme  Court.  The Court's decision, therefore, was in  a sense disappointing. However, in not  addressing the constitutional issues, they  left the way open for legislative remedy.  And in fact, the dissenting opinions of  Justices Douglas, Marshall, and Brennan  and the concurring views -of Powell and  Blackmun can be interpreted as urging  legislative relief to a problem that was  caused by legislation.  I am hopeful that the Banking Com mittee, of which I am a member, will soon  hold hearings on the Financial Privacy  Act. If we act promptly it will be pos sible to pass this momentous legislation  before the end of the session.  As my colleagues are well aware, this  is perhaps one of the most critical issues  of the time. Even the President has ex pressed a new-found concern  for  the  safeguard of privacy and legitimized it by  creating GERALD FORD's Commission on  Privacy. Clearly  then,  this is  the time  to pass the necessary legislation. We can not let this momentum pass us by.  For the interest of my colleagues, I  would like to include in the REcoRD some  excerpts from a statement I made last  summer on the Financial Privacy Act and  some of my own experiences with abuses  of confidence:  EXCERPTS FROM A STATEMENT BY MB. STABX ON  THE FINANCIAL PRivACY ACT  The bill I have introduced, H.R. 9424, re solves all the ambiguities in existing law re lating  to an  individual's financial  records.  It clearly safeguards the individual's right  to privacy with respect to his financial trans actions and history. Spec1ftca.lly,  the Right  to Financial Privacy Act establishes  four  means of access to private records held by  financial institutions: customer consent, ad m1n1strat1ve  subpenas  and  summonses,  search warrants, and judicial subpenas. Cor respondingly, the act places an obligation on  the financial institutions not to disclose in formation from customer records unless one  of the above requirements has been met. In  addition, it is stipulated that the informa tion obtained by the Government must be  used only for those purposes for which it was  originally solicited.  The need for this act, whlle not resulting  directly from  the Bank Secrecy Act, stems  from subsequent controversy over the precise  interpretation  of  an  individual's  fourth  amendment rights. At Senate hearings held  last year on legislation to amend the record keeping  laws,  the Secretary of  the Treas ury a.dmltted. that subpena.s are not required  !or the release o! financial information. He  suggested that as the 1970 act had not spe cifically addressed  the matter ot access to  records, the Treasury could not take arbitrary  admlnlstrative action to do so. It was there fore up to a bank to determine whether or  ",1974
149,House,93,0.204,987,7,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Speaker, among  the  Ideals  that America was  founded  upon, perhaps none is more important  than the right to individual privacy. In terwoven with the Constitution and the  Bill of Rights is the guarantee that every  citizen is entitled to the broadest meas ure of personal prltracy. Our Judicial sys tem has recognized this right and has  moved, at all levels, to preserve and pro tect it.  However,  the continued advance of  technology poses the threat of unprece dented  invasions of privacy. Sophisti cated new techniques have been devel oped which could not have been foreseen  at  the  time  the Bill of Rights was  adopted,  techniques  of  information  gathering which have become common place and are avallable  to overzealous  bureaucrats, misguided public omclals,  and aggressive businessmen.  The individual citizen, who is often  unaware that he is being victimlzed, 1s  virtually helpless to combat this unseen  enemy. It is the responsibWty of Con gress to delineate the rights of the indi vidual confronted with this threat, to leg islate protections for him and to restrict  and regulate the use of methods of in formation  gathering  and  surveillance  which, by their nature, infringe on the  right to privacy and are therefore tnimi cal to our fundamental ideals. Americans  should not come to expect that their  right to privacy will be infringed. Con gress must take the necessary action to  insure that this does not occur.  I believe there is an ominous correla tion between  the growth of huge bu reaucracies, including the Federal Gov ernment, and a growing sense  that it  is necessary and proper to optain in formation about people and their activ ities without their knowledge or approv al. Personal familarity with individuals  is beyond the capacity of most organiza tions. Consequently, they resort toques tionnaires,  computers,  data  banks,  identification numbers, credit checks, or  other impersonal means to make judg ments concerning individuals which they  consider relevant  to  their business. In  this way,  invasion of privacy becomes  legitimized and  accepted  as  common  practice.  This trend is a dangerous one. If al lowed  to continue unregulated, it will  lead to a society in which an individual's  right to privacy is all but forgotten. That  right is already under attack and we  must act now to ward off further en croachments.  As a Congressman who has been ap prehensive about this trend, I have spon sored bills to deal with specific situations  in which the potential for abuse has been  outstanding. I have sponsored legislation  to require all Federal agencies maintain ing records on an individual citizen to  apprise him of the existence of the rec ords, to permit him to inspect them and  to furnish supplemental or explanatory  information to the file. In addition, I am  sponsoring bills which would limit the  sale or distribution of mailing lists by  Federal agencies and restrict agency ac cess to Federal income tax returns. Re sponsible safeguards such as these will  provide a first step toward insuring that  the right to personal privacy Will not be  violated by the massive Federal bureauc racy where the temptation to imperson alize individual citizens, to gather often  unnecessary or irrelevant :ftles, and to  share  this  information  freely  among  .agencies, magnifies  the potential  for  abuse.  However, the problem of privacy, Uke  the principle, Is not confined to the pollcies and actions of the Federal Govern ment. It pervades the realm of business  relations as well as State and local pub lic policy. Therefore, a piecemeal ap proach to privacy protection legislation,  concentrating primarily on Federal poli cies, is destined to fall far short of the  broad reforms that are needed.  Banks and other credit  institutions,  law enforcement agencies, and employ ment bureaus are but a few of the orga nizations in which confidential informa tion is elicited and in which that infor mation may be subsequently misused.  While the Fair Credit Reporting Act of  1970 was a significant step in eliminating  some of the more glaring abuses that  have occurred, it is too narrow in scope to  implement a national commitment to the  right of privacy.  By the same token, the Federal estab lishment must take the lead to ensure  that the privacy of all citizens  is re spected if meaningful legislation is to be  enacted covering the private sector. Re grettably,  the actions of  the Federal  Government have not been exemplary.  The past year has been filled with re ports of secret dossiers, inspection of tax  returns, break-ins, and rummaging of  personal and confidential files, as well as  surreptitious electronic surveillance on  the part of Federal officials. These are  surely the most despicable violations of  the right to privacy. These are deliberate  and knowing efforts  to abridge funda mental rights and for this reason are de meaning  to  those who are a party to  them.  Perhaps the most flagrant and abused  invasion of privacy has been  the un authorized use of wiretapping. Under the  guise of national security more than a  dozen taps on the phones of high govern ment officials and newsmen have been  admitted by the Justice Department and  indications are that the actual number  may be even higher. No comprehensive  approach  to guaranteeing the right to  privacy can fail to deal with the sensitive  issue of wiretapping. Existing safeguards  enacted by Congress as part of the Omni bus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act  of 1968limiting wiretaps to investigations  of certain specific crimes and requiring  prior court authorization have not been  sufficient to curb excesses in this area and  further legislation is needed. The viola tion of civil  liberties  inherent in tele phone taps, invading the privacy of not  one but countless unsuspecting individ uals, is so severe and so repugnant to our  basic rights and freedoms as to be justi fied in only the most extreme national  security emergencies and then only with  prior court approval. The task of striking  the proper balance between the individ ual's right to privacy and the exigencies  of national security is a diffi.cult one. The  Congress can and must play an active  role in this determination.  ",1974

151,House,93,-0.332,1000,7,Mr. HUNGATE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  pleased to be able to speak today on an  issue which reaches to the very fibers of  our democratic system-the right to pri vacy. This right is both one of the most  important and most pervasive rights of  the citizen, and it is a right very often  easily overlooked by a government pur suing one mission or another. Custody of  the  individual's information  resources  now seems to be in the hands of unseen  and unknown administrators, bureau crats, and computer operators.  The issue of privacy has been in the  fort:front of governmental activity for  almost three decades now. Concern for  individual privacy has  long existed in  Missouri. In 1959, Senator Tom Hennings  of Missouri held hearings on  the en croachment of the Federal Government  into the privacy of its citizens, which  stated:  Anybody who uses a  telephone does so at  his own risk and, in effect, anyone who en gages in conversation surrenders his. right of  privacy to anyone else who manages to over hear what he  says.  .  .  . This probably  is  sound legal doctrine in any pollee state .  .  .  but neither the United States nor any of the  sovereign States have yet gone totalitarian.  In 1968, his successor in the Senate,  EDWARD V. LONG, commented:  The right of privacy encompasses the free dom of the individual to share or withhold  from others, according to his own selection,  his thoughts, his beliefs, his emotions, his  actions, and his past. It Is an affirmative  claim to human dignity-a claim to an in violate personality.  His successor, Senator ToM EAGLETON,  has a distinguished record on behalf of  individual  liberties, and protection of  their necessary adjunct, a free press. Last  year,  1973,  he  introduced  the News  Source Protection Act, which would as sert ""The privilege against compulsory  disclosure of sources of confidential in formation is not so much a privilege for  the press as it is a privilege for  the  public.""  In 1970, many people were referring to  the U.S. Census as the ""1970 inquisition.""  A concerned Missouri citizen wrote  to  Senator ERVIN concerning the census:  In a  true Republic such delving into pri vate lives would not even be considered ...  Our hope lies with a  few men of common  sense, such as yourself, and the overwhelm ing desire of the majority of the citizenry  for a return to the precepts of our found ing fathers.  It is high time legislation is enacted to  begin to guarantee the right of privacy,  as it rightfully should be. When the next  census is taken, for example, we should  be  interested  in counting people and  not toilets and televisions.  Recognizing the need of a government  for information does not recognize a gov ernmental right willfully and randomly  to invade one's privacy and then treat  such  information as another computer  file. On February 19, 1974, I was more  than happy to cosponsor H.R. 13880, in troduced by our distinguished colleague,  ED KocH. There has perhaps not been a  better time in our history to begin  to  reassert our system's values and to once  again guarantee protection  for  those  ""unalienable rights"" we often treat as  mere rhetoric.  ",1974
152,House,93,0.533,1000,7,Mr. BAUMAN.," Mr. Speaker, much is  said and written about privacy and the  degree  to which  it is abridged in this  day and age. But too little attention is  given  to the root cause of the loss of  ~o much of our individual privacy; the  mexorable expansion of Federal agen cies and bureaucracy.  From the Census Bureau to the Federal  Home Loan Bank Board, in scores of Fed eral agencies and bureaus, the amount  and type of personal, private information  which is required of an individual by the  government is enormous. Many of you  will  recall a controversy several years  ago when the Census Bureau sent out  forms to thousands of citizens across the  country requiring  them  to  inform  the  Federal Government, under penalty of  law, about how many toilets they had  in their homes, and whether they were  indoor or outdoor. Many more serious  disclosures of personal, private informa tion are required of our citizens daily  by Federal edict.  A great deal of  legislation has been  introduced  in  the Congress which at tempts to minimize the invasions of privacy which these Federal agency require ments produce. But while I would cer tainly endorse many of these efforts, I  believe we should come to grips with the  fact that they are a natural byproduct  of  the size and power of big govern ment. As government has grown, and it  has grown at a staggering rate, so too  has governmental  invasion of privacy.  One who knows well the insatiable ap petite of  the Federal bureaucracy for  personal data is the former Director of  the Office  of Economic Opportunity,  Howard Phillips. Mr. Phillips now directs  a project known as Public Monitor at the  American Conservative Union, and he  has prepared the following brief com mentary on the subject of government  bureaucracy and the right to privacy:  BUREAUCRACY A THREAT TO PRIVACY  (By Howard Phillips)  Intrusions on the privacy of each citizen  increase as the size and power of government  increase. For every ""benefit"" we receive, there  is a corresponding surrender of  independ ence.  A bureaucracy which delivers social serv ices  is in a position to insist that the re cipients of such services entrust to the agents  of bureaucracy even the most personal in formation about their medical histories and  family  l~ves. Students whose education  is  underwritten with Federal dollars must re spond to questionnaires which spell out their  inner values and aspirations. Beneficiaries  of government-backed credit must fully dis close the records of their financial history.  Further, when we  rely on government,  whether for food stamps or aspirin or legal  services, how  free can we be  to challenge  excessive intrusions? If the outreach worker  helped us get a hospital bed when we needed  it, might we not lose access to future help  if we declined  to  acquiesce  in a  recoM mended sterilization procedure?  He who pays  the piper calls  the  tune.  Whatever government  ""gives""  in  services,  it takes away from our opportunity to de fine the course of our private lives. The gov ernment which subsidizes defines the terms  on which the subsidy may be provided.  PrivB~Cy increases as bureaucratic power  declines.  ",1974
153,House,93,-0.644,1000,7,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, I con gratulate the gentlemen from California  (Mr. GoLDWATER and Mr. EDWARDS), the  gentlemen from New York <Mr. HORTON  and Mr. KoCH) and the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. MooRHEAD) for bring ing this critical issue before the Congress.  For it is up to us here in the peoples'  branch of Government to act quickly to  protect the people of this Nation from  the  already  too  numerous  encroach ments upon their personal privacy.  It is frightening enough for a public  oftlcial to realize that he is not only un der constant public scrutiny, but  that  many aspects of our private  lives are  being watched-often illegally-day and  night. But when I read of the lists and  practices of various means of keeping  tabs on millions of our constituents, then  I am indeed alarmed about the future of  the individual in this Nation which was  founded and dedicated to individualism.  Too often we hear  the claims  that  notions of privacy are inconsistent with  the  needs  of  a  huge,  technocratic,  bureaucratized society. Yet it is only be cause we have allowed  this Nation  to  become so huge, so technology-oriented,  so bureaucratized that these assaults on  privacy have increased.  ",1974
154,House,93,-0.386,1013,7,Mrs. SULLIVAN.," Mr. Speaker, I am  happy to join the gentleman from New  York (Mr. KocH) a member of the Sub committee on Consumer Affairs, in this  discussion of  the worrisome and  fre quently frightening aspects of the widen ing soope of invasion of privacy of the  American people. As our population has  1ncreased and become more urbanized,  and the management levels of business  enterprises and of Government agencies  become more and more separated from  the individuals with whom their institu tions deal--separated by increasing lay ers of public and private bureaucratics- the citizen becomes a disembodied social  security number, credit card number,  taxpayers' account number, and name  and address on a computerized mailing  list. He seldom has any personal rela tionship with the owner of any business  with which he deals; he has little or no  contact with any responsible offi.cial in a  bank with which he has his account-in  fact he may bank by mail and withdraw  by check and never set foot in the bank;  although he may have a mortgage with a  mutual savings and loan association and  thus be a member of the association, the  chances are that he never attends an an nual meeting of the association or at tempts to take any part in the operations  of the institution; on the job he may be  known only by his immediate supervisors  and the limited number of workers with  whom he comes in daily contact.  Although the average urbanized citi zen may feel that he moves in a kind of  general anonymity, except among his  friends and immediate neighbors and co workers and fellow club members and  so on, there is a great deal known about  him by a great many people he does not  know and who have no personal interest  in him whatsoever. These strangers, who  may have an occastona~ business or pro fessional interest in some aspect of his  life, know, or can find out quickly and  economically, virtually all  there  is  to  learn about his economic status, his cred it worthiness, his  reliability,  integrity,  general reputation, mode of living, per sonal habits, military record, taxpaying  experience, political inclination, religious  affi.liation, police record, medical history,  and a great many other things about him  that he may or may not be willing to  volunteer  to perfect strangers without  knowing how or when that information  might be used. And often the information  is slanted, or false, or at least incomplete  and misleading.  FROM KINDERGARTEN TO TKE GRAVE  to  The March 31 edition of Parade dis tributed with many Sunday newspapers  gave us all something of a shock when  it described the records being accumu lated in the schools of this country about  children from elementary school on up- teacher descriptions or criticisms of the  character or emotional stability or abili ties of youngsters which,  in many in stances are withheld from parents but  could be used to damage the child in later  years. Apparently, one's life becomes an  open book  from kindergarten  the  grave.  Ideally, all of us should be empowered  to protect our privacy as completely as  we would like--to have control over the  information about us we wish to allow  anyone to have. As a people, however, we  have surrendered by law-by laws writ ten by the democratically elected rep resentatives of the people--many of our  inherent rights of privacy. For instance  the  16th  amendment  to  the Consti tution  provides  the  authority  under  which the Government compels us all to  report every cent of our income and pay  taxes thereon. We are compelled by law  to  answer  census  questions  every 10  years. In applying for certain benefits  available from the Government, such as  food  stamps  for  low-income  families,  citizens must divulge the most intimate  of financial details down  to  the cash  value of life insurance. In addition, in  applying for employment, insurance, or  credit from any public or private source  the individual is called upon to lay bare  facts about himself or herself that he or  she would prefer be held confidential by  those to whom the information is being  given. Eventually, however, much if not  most of this information finds  its way  into a computer somewhere where it is  stored and held for the instant retrieval  for the information of anyone who can  establish a so-called legitimate business  interest in having the information. These  may or may not be people with whom  the individual is consciously  interested  in doing any business.  THE START OF LEGISLATIVE PROTECTIONS  The proliferation of data banks in and  out of Government has been a source of  deep concern  to numerous committees  and Members of Congress over the years.  It took concrete legislative form for the  first time early in 1968 when Congress man CLEMENT ZABLOCKI, of Wisconsin, Of fered an amendment  to  the  truth  in  lending title of the Consumer Credit Pro tection Act, as it was being debated on  the House floor on January 31 of that  year,  a  provision which would  have  limited and regulated the kind of per sonal information compiled and sold for  a  fee by credit bureaus. The Zablocki  amendment raised many questions which  could not be answered satisfactorily on  the House floor when it was offered that  day, and it was defeated. But it was re vived by Mr. ZABLOCKI in more carefully  defined legislative form in the next Con gress and became the nucleus of what is  now  the Fair Credit Reporting Act of  1970-title VI of Public Law  91-508,  which created a new title VI to the Con sumer Credit Protection Act of 1968.  The Zablocki bill itself was never acted  on in the House in the 91st Congress, nor  was a much more comprehensive bill  which I  introduced in that Congress as  chairman of the Subcommittee on Con sumer Affairs and on which we held  hearings  in  the subcommittee. Unfor tunately, when it came time to act on my  bill in the subcommittee during the :final  weeks of  the 9lst Congress, we were  never able to get a quorum of the sub committee to begin markup sessions. The  revised  legislation was extremely con troversial, and that fact may or may not  have been a factor in our inability to get  a quorum for markup sessions.  HOW  THE  FAm  CREDIT  REPORTING  ENACTED  ACT WAS  In the meantime, however, the Senate  had passed a Fair Credit Reporting Act  modeled pretty much along the lines of  Congressman ZABLOCKI's bill and  then  tacked it on as a Senate rider to a House  bill dealing with bank secrecy. That is  how we were able to get into conference  on the Fair Credit Reporting Act before  the  9lst  Congress  adjourned.  The  Democratic members of the House con ference committee, Representatives PAT BARRETT,  SULLIVAN,  and REUSS,  proposed  a  series  of  strengthening  amendments  the  Senate-passed  measure intended to bring it more into  conformance with  the bill  I had  in troduced in the House and on which our  hearings were conducted in the subcom mittee. Some of those amendments were  accepted by  the Senate conferees aii""d.  some were not. Looking back on that  MAN,  to  ",1974

156,Senate,93,-0.033,1143,7,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President, there  have been increasing signs that, despite  the recent ""green revolution"" and recent  actions by the U.S. Department of Agri culture to free additional farmland for  production, the world may soon face a  severe food shortage. This is a develop ment of the most profound consequences  for all world citizens. A widespread food  shortage would place severe strains on  international diplomacy and  the con science of all mankind.  This week's Newsweek magazine con tained a brief summary and analysis of  the probability and effects of such a  food shortage. I ask unanimous consent  that it be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  RUNNING OUT OF Foon?  Perhaps in ten years, millions of people in  the poor countries are going  to starve  to  death before our very eyes ... We shall see  them .t:Ioing so upon our television sets. How  soon? How many deaths? Can they be pre vented? Can they be minimized? Those are  the most important questions in our world  today.  When  that  apocalyptic  warning  was  sounded by British author C. P. Snow five  years ago,  it was dismissed by many food  experts as unduly alarmist. At  that time,  miracle seeds and fertilizers were creating a  global  ""green  revolution,"" and  there was  even talk that such chronically hungry na tions as India would soon become self-suffi cient in food. But today that sort of optim ism is no longer fashionable. World stores 01  grain are at their lowest level in years-only  enough to last for 27 days--and there are  grim signs that the current shortage is not  just a  temporary phenomenon but is likely  to get worse.  In the coming decades, some scholars believe, food scarcity will be the normal con dition of life on earth-and not only in the  poor countries but in the richer ones as well.  Unless present trends are somehow reversed,  says biologist J. George Harrar, ""millions of  people in the poor areas will die of starva tion. But  the affiuent societies  (including  the United States] will experience dramati cally reduced standards of living at home.""  Even Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz,  a  notorious opt1m1st on the subject of food,  concedes that Americans may have to sub stitute vegetable  for animal protein. ""We  have the technology,"" Butz told Newsweek's  Tom  Joyce  reassuringly,  ""to make better  hamburgers out of soy beans than out of  cows.""  Even now, food shortages affect the entire  world.  In  the  last  two years,  famine has  threatened  India  and  visited widespread  misery upon the sub-Sahara nations of Africa  where an estimated quarter milllon people  have died. Scarcely less shocking, half of the  world's 3.7 billion people Uve  in perpetual  hunger. The industrial nations are swiftly  buying up the dwindling supplles of food and  driving up food prices so high that poorer  countries cannot afford to pay them.  Prospects for  the future are clouded by  the old Malthusian specter of population  growth. A year from now there will be 4 bil Uon human beings on earth, and by the end  of the century that figure is expected nearly  to double to 7.2 billion. Food production is  simply not growing fast enough to feed that  many mouths, and it is unlikely to do so in  the decades ahead. A complicating factor in  the race between  food and people  is  the  burgeoning affluence  in such parts of the  world as Western Europe, Japan and  the  Soviet Union. Rising expectations in these  areas have bred strong new demands on the  world's food supplies. More and more people  want  their protein  in  the  form of meat  rather than vegetables, and this in turn has  driven up the need for feed grains for the  growing herds of Uvestock. ""Affiuence,"" ar gues economist Lester Brown, ""is emerging  as a major new claimant on world food re sources.""  To meet  this proliferating demand  for  food, insists John Knowles, president of the  Rockefeller Foundation, ""the world's basic  food crops must double in the next eighteen  years."" The more positive  thinkers among  the food experts are convinced that this can  be done-basically by expanding the area of  land under production and by raising the  output of crops on the cultivated areas. The  world has  the means to do the  job,  they  argue-if  the  underproductive  countries  would order their societies a little better, if  the  richer  countries would pump  larger  amounts of capital and know-how into the  less fortunate nations for the development  if more  of agriculture,  irrigation and fer tilizer were brought into play,  if mankind  would use its common sense.  Many students of the food crisis are far less  optimistic.  ""We have  just about run out  of good land, and there are tremendous Umi tations on what we can do in the way of irri gation,"" contends Prof. Georg Borgstrom of  Michigan State University. Economist Brown  supports  this view. ""The people who  talk  about adding more land are not considering  the price,"" he says. ""If you are willing to  pay the price, you can farm Mount Everest.  But the price would be enormous.""  Moreover, Brown and other experts do not  expect the sea to solve the world's food prob lems. Huge fishing :fleets have depleted many  traditional fishing grounds, and the overall  catch  is declining. Anchovies, one of  the  major ingredients in animal feed,  recently  disappeared  from  the waters off Peru  for  two years--largely a  result of over-fishing.  Water pollution, too, is taking a heavy toll  of  fish  life along  the world's continental  shelves. And much of the fish that is caught  each year is being squandered. ""Every year.  Americans use tons of tuna fish in pet foods,""  one food expert points out. ""But how much  longer will we be able to afford the luxury of  feeding our cats and dogs on food people  could consume?""  Fertilizer, an essential element, is also be coming prohibitively expensive. Petroleum  1s a major source of fertilizer, and the tow ering price of oil thus has a direct effect on  agriculture. Dr. Norman Borlaug, sometimes  called the ""father of the green revolution,''  has complained bitterly that Arab oil poli tics, aimed at the industrial countries, will  eventually strike most heavily at the devel oping nations. ""India,'' remarks Brown, ""is  really up the creek. As a result of the fer tilizer shortage, grain production  is  likely  to be off 6 to 9 million metric tons.""  On top of all these problems, the world's  farmers have been beset by weather con ditions that threaten to dislocate food pa.t terns around the world. According to some  meteorologists, these changes in climate will  probably be a long-range factor. For a variety  of reasons, they point out, the earth seems  to be coollng off, and this cooling process is  causing a southward migration of the mon soon rains. This in turn is producing a dry weather pattern stretching from  the sub Sahara drought belt through the Middle East  to India, South Asia and North China. Even  the U.S. could soon be at the mercy of the  weather. Some meteorologists are predicting  a  cyclical return  to droughlt in the Great  Plains States-possibly even dust-bowl con ditions. ""Even a mild drought in this tight  supply situation,"" said one Agriculture De partment official, ""could be a disaster.""  Over the years, the U.S. supplied a stagger ing $20 billion worth of food to needy coun tries under Public Law 480, the so-called Food  for Peace program. But in recent years, the  program has been allowed  to wither, and  with food demand rising around the world,  American farmers--encouraged by the Ad ministration-have :flung themselves into the  business of exporting food on a strictly cash and-carry basis. In the fiscal year ending in  June 1972, the U.S. exported $8 billion worth  of farm products; last year the figure reached  $12.9 billion; and when this fiscal year ends  in June  it  is estimated that it w111 have  zoomed to $20 billion. The U.S. now views  agricultural products not as a give-away item  but as a way of earning the foreign exchange  needed to pay for imports, including high priced crude oil. ""Food  for crude""  is  the  shorthand for the current policy at the De partment of AgricuJ.ture.  With virtually all U.S. food surpluses com mitted to trade, not aid, it is difficult to see  how the U.S. can continue to play  its old  role as provider of food to the world's hun gry masses. And  there are many people in  Washington who do not see this as such a  bad thing. ""The worst thing we can do for a  country,"" says a State Department official,  ""is to put it on the permanent dole. That  would be an excuse not  to solve  its own  problems,  especially population. Now, our  thinking is that feeding the world is an in ternational  problem, maybe  one  for  the  United Nations."" That view was underlined  last September when Henry Kissinger asked  the United Nations to call a world conference  on the problems of feeding the world. ""No  one country can cope with  this problem,""  said the Secretary of State.  In response, the U.N. plans to hold a World  Food Conference  in Rome  this November.  Among  the major proposals certain  to be  made are that the less developed nations dis courage population growth and that the in dustrial nations work together to help feed  the world's poor. Indeed, Dr. A. H. Boerma,  the Dutchman who heads the U.N. Food and  Agriculture Organization, has proposed  a  ""world food  reserve""-roughly  like that of  the Biblical Joseph, who advised the Pharaohs to store up grain in good years against  future famines. But so fa.r,  the suggestion  has been greeted with  total  lack of en thusiasm in the u.s., Canada and AustraUa,  a.  ",1974

158,House,93,0.3,1182,7,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, the  rule providing for the consideration of  H.R. 13163 recognizes an amendment in  the nature of a substitute which I intend  to offer at the appropriate time.  At this point, I should like to outline  briefly my alternative bill, so that it may  be kept in mind during the general de bate on this most important and timely  legislation.  The substitute bill  to create a Con sumer Protection Agency is, with the ex ception of seven differences, exactly the  same as the bill reported by the Govern ment Operations Committee.  Five of these differences originated as  amendments sent to the committee by  the White House as necessary for ad ministration  support.  I  should  note  briefly that, in the spirit of compromise,  the administration supported the com promise CPA bill passed by  this body  during the last Congress, only to find  that compromise seriously compromised  in committee this Congress.  The remaining  two differences orig inated as amendments which my good  friend and colleague DoN FuQuA and I  offered in subcommittee and which were  also offered in full committee. These two  amendments were considerably liberal ized versions of unsuccessful  amend ments offered by us on the :floor during  the debate on this subject during the 92d  Congress. We also saw the need to com promise  and make  our  amendments  stronger.  I hasten to point out that all these  amendments which now form the sub stitute were defeated during the com mittee process, but not necessarily knowto  ingly rejected. Many amendments were  defeated at both subcommittee and full  committee levels by the most extensive  use of general proxy voting I have seen  in all my years in the House.  At one point it got so bad that almost  one half of the committee membership  was being voted by proxy.1  My alternative CPA bill, therefore, is  offered in this chamber where it cannot  be preyed upon by proxies. The seven  differences, in brief, are as follows, the  first five having originated as the Ad ministration's amendments:  First. The exemptions section of the  Brown substitute and the Holi:fied-Ros enthal bill differ  in  two  respects. My  bill will not exclude from CPA advocacy  and appeal major interests or organized  labor, as would the Holi:field-Rosenthal  bill. My bill would also fully exempt the  Departments of Defense and State from  CPA  intervention, while  the Holifield Rosenthal bill would only grant par tial exemptions for these agencies.  Second. The Brown substitute would  allow existing agencies to deny the CPA  access  their criminal  investigation  files; while the Holi:field-Rosenthal bill  would force Federal agencies to produce  such files for CPA review.  Third. The Brown substitute would  allow existing Federal agencies to refuse  any CPA requests for them to use their  subpena power to get information only  of interest to CPA; while the Holi:field Rosenthal bill would force existing agen cies to use their subpena powers against  individuals and companies which  the  CPA, alone, is investigating.  Fourth. The Brown bill would allow  Federal agencies to refuse CPA access to  trade secrets and confidential informa tion which were voluntarily given  to  these  agencies;  while  the Holi:field Rosenthal bill would force these agencies  to disclose to the CPA virtually all such  material given to the Federal Govern ment in confidence.  Fifth. The Brown alternative would  provide  that  the  Justice Department  would litigate court suits for the CPA,  except where  the Attorney General  determines otherwise; while  the Holi :field-Rosenthal bill would require that  the CPA hire and use its own trial law yers.  Sixth. The Brown blll would allow the  CPA to seek judicial review only of an other  agency's decisions where  that  agency refused to grant the CPA access  to information to which the CPA has a  right under the bill or where the CPA  ha.s been denied party status or any other  CPA-requested opportunity to advocate  consumer  interests as provided in the  blll. The Holi:field-Rosenthal alternative  would allow the CPA to seek judicial re view of virtually any action,  including  inaction, of another agency, whether or  not the CPA appeared before it.  Seventh. And finally,  the Brown btl!  would not allow the CPA  to become a  party with equal  rights  to an agency  prosecutor in that very small number of  Federal adjudications in which a person,  who has been formally charged with a  1 March 21, 1974, Full Government Opera tions Committee markup on H.R.  Transcript pp. 113-116. ( 19 proxies cast, 22  members present.)  18163,  I  to  violation of law, is being prosecuted be-  fore a Federal agency. The Holifield Rosenthal alternative would allow  the CPA to be such a second prosecutor in  most such situations, limiting the CPA's:  right  to party status only where  the forum agency, itself, directly imposes a  fine or a forfeiture upon a person found  guilty.  Mr. Speaker, these are the seven dif ferences between the Brown bill and the Holi:field-Rosenthal bill, explained in the  briefest  terms. Seven differences, each  one rather small, but in total providing  for, I think, a more responsible new CPA.  I shall explain these differences and their  rationale at greater length during the  general debate.  ",1974
159,House,93,0.455,1195,7,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for giving me this  additional time.  Mr. Chairman, when this bureaucracy  came into being it was not much of a  bureaucracy. The budget, as I recall, was  $4 million. Today  the budget of  that  same department is $440 million.  I  told the witnesses-and they prob ably did not like what I said-but I told  them I am amazed that I have lived as  long as I have. There was no bureaucracy  to tell me when to comb my hair, when  to brush my teeth, or when to wash be hind my ears.  Here we  are,  building bureaucracy  upon bureaucracy. We have a home econ omist in, I would say, every county in  the entire United States. We do in my  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania. We  have many, many of them. We have ex tension services doing a  terrific job in  this field of consumer education. Every  high school today has home economists.  They  too are  teaching home economy  and  consumer  education  to our  stu dents. The  average  consumer,  in my  opinion, does not need  to have very  much protection. I have dealt with con sumers for many, many years, and I find  that most of them are pretty intelligent  and  that  they do not need people  in  Washington  to  tell  them what to buy  and what not to buy.  But thanks to some advocates, we have  taught consumers to believe that some  Great White Father lives in Washing ton, and only he can tell them what they  shall or what they shall not buy. As I  say, I consider this a very bad legisla tion, adding bureaucracy to bureaucracy.  I trust that the bill will be defeated.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal ance of my time.  ",1974

161,House,93,0.355,1234,7,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. Speaker,  in  both the House and the Senate, the legal  services corporation bills have come out  of the committees which dea! with anti poverty and social problems. Thus, the  House Committee on Education and La bor and the Senate Labor and Public  Welfare Committee considered the legis lation. At several points during the S.en ate debate the point was made that the  Judiciary Committee should be the one  considering the matter, since so much  of the bill dealt with matters affecting  the judicial process, the legal profession,  and law enforcement.  I also am of the persuasion that the  Judiciary Committee ought, at least, to  have  some  input  into  the bill,  some  chance  to  influence  its drafting, since  the legal profession and matters relating  to it affect the judicial branch of gov ernment first and foremost. I realize that  the Judiciary Committee, especially  in  the House, is exceptionally busy this year,  and has been for some time, and that  this has been advanced as an argument  why that committee should not discuss  legal services. I ask, Mr. Speaker, what  is the rush? If the Judiciary Committee  cannot consider the bill this month, very  well, then let us wait a few months until  they can consider it. Their suggestions  and advice would be  invaluabie, I am  sure. Remember, we are talking about a  permanent program, one that may last  as long as our lives. In such terms, a  few months matter little. Some critics  have claimed this bill has the potential  for socializing  the  legal profession  in  10 or 15 years-such charges should not  ",1974
162,House,93,-0.128,1247,7,Mr. SIKES.," Mr. Speaker, my good  friend and distinguished colleague  the  distinguished gentleman  (Mr. PEPPER)  recently received deserved  recognition in his home city of Miami.  In two events, awards were given by  Miami  organizations  for  <'utstanding  service by Mr. PEPPER  to hi~ constitu ents and for mankind during his years  of distinguished service in the Congress.  On February 24, CLAUDE was awarded  the America-Israel Friendship Bronze  Medallion Award by the Ame1ican Miz rachi Women during their Florida Coun cil Conference in Miami Beach.  This  award  exemplifies  the work  CLAUDE has done on behalf of better  relations between this Nation and Israel  and is well deserved.  On March 13, CLAUDE  and his wife,  Mildred, were jointly honored by being  named Man of the Year by the Miami  Beach Chamber of Commerce.  Mrs. Pepper was included in the award  because, as was explained by the cham ber official Arthur Courshon ""Mildred  runs the Pepper family ....  There is no doubt that both Mildred  and CLAUDE richly deserve this additional recognition for the work and sacrifice  in public service beginning in 1929 has  entailed.  I am pleasetl to join his good friends  in Dade County, in Florida and in the  Nation in applauding CLAUDE and Mildred  Pepper.

163,,93,-0.39,1260,7,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I  have just been informed by Mrs. Eunice  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Shriver, executive director of the Joseph  P. Kennedy, Jr., Foundation, that the  publisher of  the Chicago Tribune, Mr.  Clayton Kirkpatrick, and his staff have  been honored by the Kennedy Founda tion with  the  1974 Kennedy Family  Award for their outstanding coverage of  the Tilinois Special Olympics.  One of the articles which led to the  Tribune's receiving this award appeared  August 11, 1973. The article was judged  by the foundation's Sel~tion Committee  to best portray the striving,  joy, and  achievement of the Special Olympics. A  copy of  the article by award-winning  columnist, David Condon, follows:  SPECIAL OLYMPICS OPEN  (By David Condon)  (Top o' the Wake: ""I had a shot at regular  Olympic competition as a member of Pan ama's basketball team, but I've never had a  thrlll like the one these kids gave me to day.""-candleUght Singer Lee Pelty.)  Hundreds of young athletes were mllling  in Grant Park by 8 a.m. yesterday. An eve ning of banqueting, dancing, and  finding  new; friends was behind these young cham pions from the far sectors of Dlinois. Now  was a fresh morning. Now was the hour ...  the start of the campaign in track and field,  in the swimming tanks, and on the basket ball courts.  This was the rainbow hour. And it wasn't a  pot of gold dangling at the end of the rain bow that intrigued these youngsters, cham pions all.  It was a gold medal that awed them. A  medal modeled after those always awarded  the world champions in the genuine Olym pics. And believe me: No Olympian ever cov eted an international gold medal more than  yesterday's Grant Park athletes coveted their  prizes.  This was one of sport's finest moments.  The sun became warmer and the athletes  shed warm-up jackets. Some of the younger  tykes wandered off, probing here and there  around the tents and facUlties, but all were  cautiously watched by John J. McDonnell  and his security force.  Young  boys  and  girls  sprinted  thru  warm-up exercises. A few joked with sports  celebrities  like Ziggy Czarobski, Leon Hil liard, John Lattner, Mickey Rottner, or big cigared Ben Bentley. Others answered inter view questions for Mort [Son of John and  A bra] Edelstein, the columnist.  Volunteer ladies found business brisk pro viding eye-opening coffee  for visitors and  officials. Everywhere you turned there was a  smartly-uniformed member of the Chicago  Fire Department or the Chicago Pollee De partment.  The clock hit 9, and the hundreds of ath letes--in genuine gold, yellow, orange, blue  uniforms--swarmed around the officials' plat form. These kids don't run very fast, some times  they don't hear very  fast, but now  they bent all ears forward to listen intently.  Patrick  L.  O'Malley,  the  distinguished  president of the Chicago Park District, was  welcoming them to the annual Illinois Spe cial Olympics for the Mentally Retarded.  Big deal, you say; a bunch of handicapped  kids playing Uke for-real athletes.  I'll say  it was a  big deal. That's why  O'Malley stayed overtime, postponing a flight  to New York for the meeting where he wlll  be welcomed as the newest member of Trans World Airlines board of directors.  I'll say it was a big dealt That's why Rich ard J. Daley perspired 1n the sunshine while  we endured  the  routine of opening cere monies. That's why our mayor finally stepped  to the mike and welcomed the champs to this  greatest city in the world. Many, of course,  come from comers of this city and suburbs.  April 3, 1974  But for some of the young athletes, it was  their first visit to the big tent. We can excuse  them if their attention occasionally wandered  from the speeches to the Grant Park green ery, to the vast John Hancock building, or to  the planes buzzing off from Meigs Field.  Not that the speeches went into overtime.  Lt. Gov. Neil Hartigan, one of the founders  of the Special Olympics, set a new world's  record for .brevity as he welcomed the partic ipants on behalf Qf the state.  Hartigan's record was tied 1n the welcome  from Tom Meagher, president of Chicago's  Mentally Retarded Olympian Program-the  group that supervises approximately $100,000  in yearly financing for the Tillnois Special  Olympics. Mter all, these kids didn't come  to hear talk . .  they came to play.  So very quickly Mary Rose Burge  (Inde pendence Park] and Pamela McClure {Wash ington Park], both Olympians, raced to help  the u.s. Navy recruiters raise the Stars and  Stripes.  Candlelight Theatre's Lee Pelty rendered  the Star Spangled Banner, and 1,200 young  voices sang gladly, happily. Jeff Lemke, 1'7,  from West Pullman Park, ran with the Oym pic  torch. Just like  the Olympic games- except in the real Olympics they don't have  one of Commissioner Bob Quinn's snorkels  to lift the flame-bearer to the torch. You  should have seen those kids go popeyed at  seeing that snorkel. They seldom see snorkels  in Teutopolis.  There was applause  for Anne McGlone  Burke, whose  fertile mind originated  the  Olympic type competition for the mentally  retarded.  Then EdmJIDd L. Kelly stepped forward.  Ed, another ex-athlete, is general superin tendent of the Chicago Park District, which  sponsors the Special Olympics. In best Avery  Brundage  fashion, Ed  thundered:  ""I now  declare these Special Olympic games officially  opened.""  The kids raced to the pits, the tracks, the  arenas, the pools, The first gold medal win ner was W1lliam Carpenter of Wood River,  Ill., who negotiated the boys 16-18 mile in  5:17.2 He was followed to the line by John  Murphy, BUl Reinschmidt, Richard Henry,  Larry Bruce, Keith Crowfoot.  The competition was underway, for sure .    and that's what these contests are all about.

165,,93,-0.265,1273,7,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, to many  people  the chief function of  the local  fireman  is no more  than parading on  Memorial Day. But many know that the  volunteer fireman is a true man of dis tinction-not because of his advertised  preference for any particular product of  commerce--but because he is a volunteer.  Volunteers in other job areas are be coming rare, unfortunately. However, the  vohmteer fireman stands out. Not only  does he seek no pay for his great services  to the community but, in many places, he  contributes to the upkeep of the fire de partment and helps with the purchase of  equipment through his work in the opera tion of carnivals.  I have always been impressed with the  sense of civic responsibility displayed by  volunteer firemen. After reading the fol lowing article by Bill Graff I came to bet ter understand how the fireman is per ceived by the people in the community.  Bill Graff, assistant editor of the Eve ning Gazette, was  a member of  the  Blairsville Fire Department for 22 years  before retiring. He attained the rank of  assistant  fire chief before ending his  career which included seven stints as an  instructor at the Westmoreland County  Fire School at St. Vincent College in La trobe. This article is in reply to com ments he has heard from people watch ing firemen at work, and from questions  firemen hear.  It is an excellent article and one that  firefighters and non:flrefighters alike will  find extremely interesting.  Here is the article, Indiana Evening  Gazette, Thursday, February 21, 1974, by  Bill Graff:  ""What took you so long to get here?""  Most firemen have heard this comment  many times, primarily coming !rom a neigh bor or curious bystander. Occasionally the  victim of the fire will ask the same question.  But by and large . .  . firemen are on the  scene 1n a matter of minutes. For those re quiring their services, however, it seems like  hours since the alarm was turned in. That's  human nature and most firemen cast the  comment off.  Still .  .  . a g'ood question sometimes de serves a  reply and  this  is hopefully  the  answer.  Let's set up two hypothetical fires . . . one  during daylight hours ... the other in the  middle of the night. One is a summer day  alarm .  .  . the other a mid-Winter call.  The phone rings in the pollee station and  the dispatcher answers. ''This 1s Mrs. Mar garet Rathbaughn. My house is on fire. Call  the firemen. I  live along Route 217. Please  hurry!"" The dispatcher hears the click and  knows the frightened woman has hung up  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  before  telling whether  firemen  should go  north or south on Route 217. He punchel!l the  fire alarm button and starts the sirens sound ing to alert the firemen. In the meantime,  he's trying to look up Mrs. Margaret Rath baughn's telephone number  in the phone  directory.  Firemen start !or the door and their ve hicle as soon as they hear the siren. They  jump into the car and head !or the fire hall.  ""Where's the fire?"" they ask. The fire hall  phone is ringing and the first man in answers.  It is the dispatcher tell1ng them a house is  on fire along Route 217 north of Blairsville.  He successfully located the woman's phone  number and location 1n the phone directory.  The officer-in-charge tells what equipment  is to be dispatched and the trucks roll out  headed !or  the  fire. The big siren  finally  drones down to silence. Two minutes have  passed since the dispatcher pressed the but ton to activate the siren and the first two  trucks are on the way.  The route to the fire 1s relatively free of  traffic. Pollee have stopped traffic near the  fire hall and the trucks can roar around the  comer.  It's daylight. The temperature 1s  in the  50's, the time 1s 2:35p.m. and approximately  23 of the 64 members have immediately re sponded to the fire siren. I! the situation  warrants more men can be summoned by a  second alarm.  The first  truck arrives at the fire scene  within seven to eight minutes !rom the time  Mrs. Rathbaughn had  first  called  in  the  alarm.  ""What took you guys so long to get here?""  someone asks a fireman.  Now let's look at a fire alarm called in at  2:20a.m. on a January morning where ther mometers have plummeted  to 16  degrees  above zero.  The telephone rings in the police station.  The disptacher picks up the fire phone and  hears: ""This is Mike Po111tskie !rom Blairs ville RD 2. Get the firemen here right away  my house is on fire."" The dispatcher says:  ""Now don't hang up until you tell me where  your house is located."" He gets a reply like  ""I can't talk, my house is burning up.""  The dispatcher hits the siren button and  dials the fire hall phone. The first fireman  in the door answers the phone and the dis patcher relays what he has heard and says  he's trying to find a better address.  The  second  fireman  in delivers bottled  gas for living and says he knows where Mr.  Pollitskie lives. More firemen arrive and start  dressing in the warm night suits. A driver,  an officer and four men are dispatched on  the first truck as the siren goes silent. Less  than 30 seconds later the second truck rolls  out.  The roads are icy and treacherous but the  driver realizes this and also knows his job  is to get the truck and men to the blaze  safely. He knows there are men who were  awakened from a deep sleep hanging on to  the big truck now cruising along at 35-40  miles per hour. The men are still dressing as  they hang from  the p1oving  truck. Biting  cold numbs their faces and hands. Tears fill  their eyes as the biting wind never stops.  Their hearts are still pounding at a quick ened pace because  that's how  a  fireman  reacts to an emergency and danger.  A steep grade, narrow winding road, sllp pery curves, and knowledge of the human  cargo aboard tend to make the driver extra  cautious.  The truck crests a, hill and firemen take a  deep breath . . . they see the fire in the sky  and know their work is cut out for them even  before they arrive. They ask themselves: Is  anyone trapped? Are there children involved?  Is there water nearby? Is the house near a  ..  9653  road? How long will we be there? Will I make  it to work today?""  The truck pulls in at the blaze and people  start screaming. The officer in charge quickly  sizes up the fire and tells the men what to do.  The  time:  Just nine minutes from  the  time  the wall of  the  siren chased  these  firemen from their warm beds and security  of the homes and famllles.  And then the question: ""What took you  guys so long to get here?""  Then there 1s  the snide comment often  heard:  ""Well  they're volunteers, not paid  firemen."" That comment hurts.  It is doubtful whether one volunteer fire man out of the nearly 500,000 in Pennsyl vania considers hlmselt a volunteer when it  comes to fighting fire, saving lives, or risking  their own lives and livelihood.  Paid firemen do a  job and receive remu neration. Volunteer firemen do the same job,  take the same risk, hear the same comment,  and  seldom  receive  any  thanks !or  their  services.  Volunteer firemen also go around begging  !or donations to help purchase fire equip ment and even the clothing on their backs.  Paid firemen don't have to do this.  Volunteer  firemen  save  taxpayers  thou sands upon thousands of dollars each year  by providing service their city brethren must  pay for.  And volunteer firemen get hurt and are  killed, just like their paid counterparts. But  volunteer firemen are just that ... volun  teers doing their selected job to the best of  their ablllty.  They work under handicaps  their paid  brothers seldom encounter such as have to  build dams on small streams to obtain water  to  extinguish  fires;  laying  hose  across  muddy fields, under railroad tracks and to  ponds on !arms.  Yet when  these  same men  respond  alarms at all hours of the day and in all  kinds of weather .  .  . they nearly  always  hear someone ask:  ""Hey! What took y.our  guys so long to get here?""  to  CECIL R. KING  HON. EDWARD R. ROYBAL  OP CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 2, 1974  ",1974

His death last month represents a great  loss to his friends in the Congress, the  State of California and the Nation that  ",1974
167,,93,-0.139,1286,7,Mr. WHALEN.," Mr. Speaker, earlier  this week 75 of my colleagues and I ad vised the House membership of our op position to raising the $1.126 billion ceil ing which Congress has placed on mili tary aid to South Vietnam in fiscal year  1974. The Department of Defense now  wants to augment that ceiling by $474  million, a 42-percent increase.  Innumerable organizations  through out the country have written of their sup port for our efforts to defeat DOD's re quest. For the information of all Mem bers, I am inserting several of these com munications in light of the upcoming de bate on the issue:  LAWYERS  COMMITTEE ON AMERI   CAN POLICY TOWARDS VIETNAM:,  ~  New York, N.Y.  STATEMENT ON Am TO SoUTH VIETNAM  Congress 1s presently considering an Ad ministration  request  that  the celllng  for  the present fiscal year, which began last July  1, be raised from $1.26 billion (approved by  Congress late last year)  to $1.6 billion. The  arrogance of this request for an additional  $474 mlllion  In supplemental m111tary aid  for South Vietnam is particularly startling  because it corresponds almost exactly to the  amount of money Congress cut during the  regular appropriation processed last fall.  The Department of Defense witnesses have  told Congress that unless a quick $474 mti lion Is sent off  to Saigon, Thieu's mllitary  operations would have  to be sharply cur tailed. And  for  the comln~ year,  the Ad mlnistration seeks $2.4 b1llion for Vietnam  aid, plus  .another $463 m1llion  to support  American military forces based in Southeast  Asia. In the first year of so-called peace, the  United States expense for weapons and am munition in Vietnam was only 25 per cent  under the level of corresponding programs in  the heavy war year of 1972.  What is ominous is the unstated assump tion that the United States Is committed to  keep the war going on Thieu's terms. Hav ing  successfully barred direct combat  Southeast Asia, Congress should not be lured  into action which would permit a continued  drift into war by proxy. The Congress, having  called  .a ha.lt to U.S.  Involvement  in m111tary operations in Southeast Asia, must re sist the efforts by the Executive Branch to  subvert this Congressional directive.  Moreover, it must be noted that the Ad ministration's  request,  if granted, would  constitute a violation of Article 7 of  the  Paris Cease-Fire Accord which  allows  re placement of  .arms only ""on the basts of  piece-for-piece, on the same characteristics  and properties."" Instead of solemnly observin  ",1974
168,,93,-0.631,1299,7,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, when the  House considers the Defense Department  supplemental shortly,  I  hope my col leagues will consider  information pro vided recently by a Philadelphia Inquirer  editorial and a letter to the editor of the  New York Times:  [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Mar. 29,  1974]  How LoNG Do WE ~ED THE WAR?  It's 14 months since  the signing of the  Paris peace agreements bringing that cele brated ""peace with honor"" to Vietnam. Yet  there is no peace.  In 1973 alone, a Senate subcommittee re ported recently, more than 50,000 Vietnam ese were killed  in  the ""cease-fire."" That's  sUghtly more than the total American com bat deaths in eight years. In addition, more  than 800,000 Vietnamese were driven from  their homes last year alone.  All of which justifies Secretary of Defense  James R. Schlesinger's understated observa tion,  in his annual defense posture state ment to Congress, that the ""cease-fire has  not worked as well as we had hoped.""  It does not justify the Pentagon's urgent  9679  requests to spend even more to step up the  mllita.ry struggle.  For the current fiscal year, the Pen:tagon  is calling on Congress to spend an additional  $474 m11lion for emergency mil1ta.ry aid to  the Thieu regime. If the money is not forth coming, the Pentagon warns, South Vietnam ese forces must ""severely curtail"" their oper.:.  ations in mid-April.    For  the  coming  fiscal  year,  the Nixon  Administration wants Congress to give South  Vietnam about $2.4 b1llion in aid, two-thirds  military and one-third economic, about 65  percent more than Congress approved this  year.  Will it never end?  Have we learned nothing from 24 years of  involvement in that unhappy peninsula.?  Obviously, both sides in Vietnam share the  blame for falling to implement the rickety  structure of peace. Yet ""our side"" can have  Uttle incentive for coming to peace if it can  count on America's continued commitment  to war.  The U.S. cannot and will not ""walk away""  from the destruction it has wrought, but it  must not add to it. Congress can begin by  withholding funds for any purpose except to  implement the ""Agreement on Ending  the  War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam.""  [From the New York Times, Mar. 19, 1974]   SAIGON: DOLLARS FOR JAILS  To the Editor:  If there are ""only 35,139 prisoners of all  types"" in South Vietnam, as reported by for mer U.S. Ambassador to Saigon Elbridge Dur brow and others after their recent tour, why  does the U.S. stm find it necessary to budget  an estimated $20 mi111on a year for Saigon's  police system, four times the amount it gives  for hospitals in South Vietnam? And why are  there some 120,000 security peraonnel and  over 600 detention centers in a country the  size of an average U.S. state?  As for the ""ulterior motives"" and ""foreign""  connections of those who allege that up to  200,000 political prisoners have been detained  in the South-which the Ambassador's group,  the American Security Council,  suggested  should be investigated-they are ""foreign""  only to the kind of thinking which believes it  rational to contribute to the decimation of  the population, the maiming of mi111ons, the  arrest of countless thousands for trying to  improve the situation, the uprooting of one third of the population and the destruction  of much of the landscape for up to a century,  all least a.  relatively small country become  Communist at exactly the same time that our  country is making basic compromises to get  along with Communist Russia. and China..  Amnesty International, with its headquar ters in London, is proud to be ""foreign"" in  that sense. Together with many other orga nizations with reliable sources in Vietnam,  we believe that many tells of thousands will  remain in jall even if the latest efforts to  exchange a  few thousand civllia.n detainees  as called for over a year ago are completed,  an insurmountable obstacle to real peace and  a. mockery of American policy in Vietnam.  Meanwhile,  the State Department replles  to  letters of  inquiry about  specific  cases  among some 2,500  individual ""prisoners of  conscience"" worked for by Amnesty Inter national with the statement, ""It would not  be approprla.te for the U.S. Government to  interject itself into individual prisoner cases  involving either Vietnamese side.""  If so, we must also end with a question:  Why has the United States spent well over  $100 billion in the name of protecting ""free  choice"" in Vietnam, when Saigon arrests any one who tries to assert basic freedoms?

169,,93,-0.416,1312,7,Mr. MOORHEAD of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker,  another  leading  American  newspaper has praised the action of the  House in passing H.R. 12471, our blll to  strengthen the Freedom of Information  Act of 1966  (5 U.S.C. 552). The Des  Moines Register in a recent editorial spe cifically referred to the amendment that  is contained in H.R. 12471  that would  perniit Federal courts to review, in cam era, Government  documents  ordered  withheld because of security clasiftca tion markings, thereby undoing the mis chief resulting from the Supreme Court's  ruling in the Mink case last year.  As the editorial so accurateiy states:  Giving an Administration an unreview able right to hide information through the  use of secrecy stamps is tantamount to mak ing the Freedom of Information Act worth less. The House is on the right track with its  action on court review. Congress as well as  private citizens have a ""need to know"" and a.  right to assurance that ""national security""  isn't being used to hide information that be longs in the public domain.  Mr. Speaker, the full text of the edi torial follows:  [From  the Des Moines Register, Mar. 25,  1974]  LIMITING OFFICIAL SECRECY  The U.S. House has taken a step toward  lifting  the vell of government secrecy by  voting to give the courts power to look be hind the seqecy stamps placed on govern ment documents.  The Freedom of Information Act is sup posed  to give  the publlc access to a wide  range of government information. However,  the act exempts from disclosure nine classes  of  information,  including matters ""specif ically required by executive order to be kept  secret in the interest of the national defense  or foreign policy.""  This exemption enables an administration  to withhold documents simply by stamping  them secret or giving them a similar security  classification.  A circuit court of appeals ruled  in 1972  that judges are empowered under the Free dom of Information Act to examine classified  documents and order the non-secret portions  disclosed. But the U.S. Supreme Court de clared las-t year that judges are not author ized to do this under the act. The court said  the law ""makes wholly untenable any claim  that th~ act intended to subject the sound ness' of executive security classifications to  judicial  review at  the  insistence  of any  objecting citizen.""  Justice Potter Stewart agreed with the ma jority, but he was sharply critical of Con gress. Justice Stewart declared:  ""[Congress] has built into  the Freedom  of Information Act an exemption that pro vides no means to question an executive de cision to stamp a document 'secret,' however  cynical., myopic, or even corrupt  that de cision might have been ... Without dis closure  .  .  .  factual  information available  to the concerned executive agencies cannot  be considered by the people or valuated by  the Congress. And with the people and their  'Congress reduced to a state of ignorance, the  democratic process is :paralyzed.""  Justice Willlam Douglas added:  ""The much advertised Freedom of Infor mation Act  is on  its way  to becoming a  shambles. Unless federal courts can be trust ed,  the executive  [branch] will hold  full  sway and make even the time of day 'top  secret   .  .  . The executive branch now has  carte blanche to insulate information froni  public scrutiny whether or not the informa tion bears any discernible relation  to the  interests sought to be protected by [the ex emptions] of the act.""  The House has  taken  these  rebukes  to  heart by voting to give judges authority to  examine  documents whose  disclosure  is.  sought; to determine whether information is  being withheld by use of lllegal or improper  security classifications.  Giving an administration an unreviewable  right to hide information through the use of  secrecy stamps is tantamount to making the  Freedom of Information Act worthless. The  House is on the right track with its action on  court review. Congress as well as private citi zens have a ""need to know"" and a right to  assurance that ""national security"" isn't being  used to hide information that belongs in the  I?ublic domain.  ",1974

171,House,93,-0.517,160,13,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Chairman, I have  indicated that the program is opposed by  the very officials that the author of this  amendment says he is going to help by  giving revenue sharing. At the present  time, more than 42 governments are sup porting  the committee's proposal. We  have in our possession recommendations  and strong endorsements from such di verse governments as Alabama, of Missis sippi, of Alaska, of New York, and of Illi nois, and certainly of  the gentleman's  own State. I would think that if these  officials are anxious to erase this program  or are anxious for this type of so-called  local action; if these local officials are not  endorsing  this particular amendment,  but  the committee's proposal,  then  it  seems to me that the gentleman does not  have any constituency.  The present proposal is endorsed by  the United States League of Cities, the  Conference of Governors, the Conference  of Mayors, the A~CIO, and other na tional organizations. I know of no con stituency or support which has come for  this particular amendment.  Mr. Chairman, on that basis I  think  it is without substantial support except ing for a small minority of the members  of the committee. I think that it, there fore, should be rejected.  ",1974
172,House,93,0.336,160,13,Mr. STEIGER of Wisconsin.," Mr.  Chairman, I move to oppose the amend ment.  Mr. Chairman, all of the members of  this committee can refiect back on all of  the controversy  that has  surrounded  community action. At the time that we  adopted the Green amendment in 1967,  very few of  the municipalities and/or  States across the United States took ad vantage of what that Green amendment  offered to them, which was the chance  to take on a community action agency.  Now, it is interesting that in the last year  something  like 107  community action  agencies have, in fact, gone public.  That is, they have exercised the option  that is available to them under the Green  amendment to become a direct part of a  municipality. But, the Kemp amendment,  may I say to my colleague, is a very dif ferent thing. What the Kemp amendment  says is, whether or not the mayor or the  Governor wants to have community ac tion become a part of  the municipal  operation, he must do it or else there will  be no community action.  Mr. Chairman, that is a distinctively  substantially different operation, and it  is for that reason that I oppose the Kemp  amendment.  I  see no reason  to force  something  which is being done by mayors and Gov ernors across the United States as they  see fit, but the Kemp amendment would  have a very distinct and different result.  'Therefore, in my judgment, it is not the  right thing to do.  Mr. Chairman, let me suggest to you  at least two substantive problems with  the Kemp amendment. There are some thing like 30 States, and I think Wiscon sin is one of them; Florida is another,  and there are a host of others which in  effect have said to local municipalities,  be  they counties,  townships, or cities,  ""You cannot jointly carry on a program  with another municipality or another  county unless authorized to do so by the  legislature.""  In the State of Florida, if there is a  multi-county CAP agency, unless  the  State legislature specifically authorizes  the county to carry out a program in  connection with another county,  they  cannot do it.  Mr. Chairman, I hope the gentleman  from Florida, the distinguished and able  Mr. YOUNG, would confirm that because  in Wisconsin I understand the situation  is similar.  So let us understand that one of the  problems we are going to have with the  Kemp amendment is the possibility that  we will lose significant numbers of com munity action agencies, not by design,  not because  the gentleman from New  York wants to do it, but simply because  there will not be enough time for legis latures to act prior to July 1.  Second, let us go to community action  agencies in my State of Wisconsin. We  have one CAP agency that is a seven county multi-CAP agency. There is not  any way, in my view, between now and  the 1st of July, when the Kemp amend-'  ment will take effect, that we are going  to be able to see seven county boards sit  down to worry about how to deal with  a community action agency.  Thusly, I say  to my colleagues, Mr.  Chairman, that I  think the correct re sponse to this program is to do just what  the committee bill does and what the  Green amendment does. The bill au thorizes an  incentive program of $50  million for community action agencies  to encourage them to become public if  they so desire, but it does not force the  marriage. The Kemp amendment would  force a marriage between community ac tion agencies and local officials whether  or not they wanted it. It would do dam age to community action agencies, and  therefore I hope the amendment is not  agreed to.  ",1974

177,House,93,0.502,238,13,Mr. DEVINE.," Mr. Speaker, last week in  the Columbus, Ohio, Dispatch,  three  separate letters to the editor were pub lished  from  different,  and  unrelated  sources, commenting on the problems of  the President.  The mass-media of the eastern liberal  establishment does not normally record  both points of view and it is refreshing  to see how this is handled in the heart land of middle America, as follows:  COMPARISON PICTURE PAINTS NIXON TALL  To the Editor:  To whom ls Richard M. Nixon being com pared? The perfect man or other American  presidents?  I submit that he should be compared to  other presidents  (although there  is a cer tain similarity between the hate-filled ""Im peach! Resign"" crowd and the ""Release unto  us Barabbas"" crowd of 2,000 yea.rs ago).  The only two presidents since 1912 whose  private political conversations would have  caused less ""moral revulsions"" than Mr. Nix on's are Woodrow Wilson and Herbert Hoover  and they were both rejected by the electorate  1n historic landslides.  Franklin D. Roosevelt was a charmer. Mr.  Nixon never has been. FDR was also a devious  politician without peer. He took us off the  gold standard, made it lllega.l for Americans  to own gold, took us into World War II and at  the end, ill, lost the peace at Yalta. Joseph  Stalin made a fool of him.  Then we had Harry S Truman and my mind  boggles at a contemplation of the profane  expletives, s.o.b.'s, and vindictiveness of ""give  'em h---, Harry""-protege of  the  corrupt Pendergast gang.  He took us into Korea where 50,000 Ameri can men died in our first ""no-win"" war with  privileged sanctuaries for the enemy (I would  consider this an impeachable offense) .  Then came Dwight D. Eisenhower.  I doubt that Ike's tapes would have been  any higher in moral quality than Mr. Nixon's.  Ike was profane and he wa.8' far more vindic tive than his grin indicated.  And then we had Camelot (John F. Ken nedy).  Charm prevailed and the most beautiful,  inspirational political speeches of the century  were written by Ted Sorenson.  Reality was far different from the dream  propagated by the television newscasters.  Reality was that the three years under Mr.  Kennedy were disastrous. We entered Viet nam-like Korea under Truman,  another  ""no-win"" war with enemy sanctuaries.  Mr. Kennedy enoouraged the overthrow of  the Diems, chickened-out at the Bay of Pigs  and was outsmarted by Nikita Khrushchev  in the missile crisis.  Mr. Kennedy appointed his brother atstinky,  torney general. And there was no outcry by  the news media at such an unprecedented  step. The media were  too occupied pre dicting rthe end of the Vietnam War if the  Diems were  only  replaced by  a  popular  government.  And Attorney General Robert Kennedy  called out the FBI to ""get something"" on  Roger Blough on April 16, 1962.  I am titillated by the thoughts of the com bination of dirty politics and sex that Presi dent Kennedy's tapes would have revealed.  Ca:rp.elot, indeed!  And then ca.me Lyndon B. Johnson. I would  love to hear a  recording of LBJ's conversa tions with  Sen.  Sam Ervin when  they  planned the Bobbie Baker coverup.  Senator Ervin  is called folk hero. He  is  anathema to me, because I consider him a  really great hypocrite. He covered up for LBJ  in  the Baker affair and now he  is Bible quoting and sanctimonious.  Mr. Nixon brought half  a million men  home from-not lnto-a.n inherited war in  Vietnam.  All presidents have had ""enemies' lists""  and ""dirty  tricks"". N0  trick-to me-was  ever dirtier than the portrayal on television  in 1964 of Sen. Barry Goldwater as a man who  would cause death by poisoning of a darling,  blonde,  curly-haired  little girl. The news  media never protested that.  The fact ls that the television news media,  as a whole, dislikes Mr. Nixon and is grossly  unfair.  I listen each week to Washington Week in  Review. There are  five men on the panel.  All five excoriate Mr. Nixon. This ls repug nant to me.  The bias of the television newscasters was  certainly obvious when they reviewed Sen.  Ted Kennedy's Chappaquiddick speech. They  commiserated with the m-starred. Kennedy  and the most damning thing they could say  about Teddy was that his speech reminded  them of Mr. NiXon's Checkers speech of 1952.  They managed to criticize Mr. Nixon when  the subject was Chappaquiddick. That really  requires bias.  Compared with other presidents since 1912,  Mr. Nixon stands mighty tall, in my opinion.  I'm sick of the hypocrisy and the clam.or  about morality and so forth. A number of  congressmen have been involved in scandals,  themselves.  Watergate  is nothing compared to many  scandals of the past.  MILDRED CRAWFORD MURPHY.  MT. GILEAD, OHIO.  ACCOUNT DISTORTED, SAYS NIXON BACKER  To the Edf.t<Yr:  It ls extremely unfortunate for a nation  as great and strong as ours that a few people  with the powerful assistance of a news media,  so bent on printing the evil that wlll sell  newspapers or attract viewers, can turn de cent people against a man the vast majority  of whom  elected overwhelmingly  to  lead  them.  For far too long, the minds of Americans  have been forced to focus upon Watergate.  Almost all of  the energy of Congress has  been expended on this one matter.  With the skilled manipulation of the news  media,  the American people have been re lentlessly bombarded with every conceivable  innuendo, half-truth and insinuation until  the facts are so distorted that only the ideas  of a  few vicious opponents of ""American  ideals With justice for all"" are accepted by  minds too weary to understand and see the  truth.  It is one thing to slant the reporting of  activities of a  few so as to generalize. It is  one thing to publicize only the delinquency  of a  few and leave the honest to suffer for  the action of their peers. This can be cor rected with understanding.  The vicious attack upon a man who has  served his country well and who won  the  respect of a  vast majority of  the voting  public just 18 months ago may well shake  the foundation of the world.  Already the elected vice president of the  U.S.  (Spiro Agnew) has been tried and con victed without  the benefits of  judge,  jury  or evidence, and forced to resign. The same  tactics that were used on him a.re now being  used against President Nixon.  How long can this nation survive when a  few people so sk1llfully twist the truth into  their own opinions and  force  these  ideas  upon others? Who  ls  immune  from  this  calloused power of the press?  It is  time for all Americans  to reassess  the facts put before them and revitalize their  own power of reason. Now, more than ever  before, all Americans must search their souls  and review the essence of our greatness.  We need to move forward toward a better  nation and a better world. It ls time to tell  our elected officials  that we  are  tired of  feet-dragging. Now ls the time to work to gether for the good of all mankind.  Corruption will reap its reward regardless  of its source. The truth Will win out as long  as it ls permitted to be heard for what it is  and not  twisted and distorted  into what  some men want it to be.  America must be strong now more than  ever before. It needs a man who, in spite of  attack, still works toward a peaceful world  and a vibrant and strong America.  America has  chosen  its  leader and he  should be permitted  to  lead.  If America does not  lead,  it will surely  be led.  DAVID W. & PENNY MACHENSEN.  REYNOLDSBURG.

179,,93,0.255,251,13,Mr. STEELMAN.," Mr. Speaker, some  weeks ago I  introduced legislation de signed to strengthen the citizens' right  to know by making important changes in  the Freedom of Information Act.  Nothing is more inimical to constitu tional  democracy  than  secrecy,  and  where there is an overriding public need  to withhold information from the citi zenry, the Congress would be remiss in its  responsibilities if it failed to periodically  assess the operation of the Freedom of  Information Act to insure that abuses  do not develop.  Toward this end, I would like to call  my colleagues' attention to an article in  the summer 1974 Ripon Quarterly that  pinpoints some of the abuses that have  developed since the Freedom of Inf orma tion Act became law, and I include this  article in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:  THE BUREAUCRACY-REASSESSING THE  FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT  (By Larry Finkelstein)  In 1966, after 12 years of deliberation, a  federal Freedom of  Information Act was  passed by Congress to formalize the public's  access to governmental information. For the  first time, there was a statutory recognition  that citizens need not have special standing  to obtain governmental documents.  Similar  to most governmental  reforms,  neither the fondest hopes of its supporters  or the worst fears of its critics have come to  pass. The intent of the act was to provide  the press with a new tool to pry information  from the Executive Branch of government.  The press has ma.de little use of the act,  due to the nature of the FOI process. Rather,  lt 1s more the public  interest groups and  corporations who are confronting govern mental agencies  to remove the barriers of  bureaucratic secrecy.  When the act passed, President Johnson  said:  ""This legislation springs from one of our  most essential principles: a democracy works  best when the people have all the informa tion that the security of the nation permits.  No one should be able to pull the curtains  of secrecy around decisions which can be  revealed without  injury  to the public  in terest . . . I signed this measure with a deep  sense of pride that the United States is an  open society in which the people's right to  know is cherished and guarded.""  A new  law does not easily change old  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  habits. Legislators and presidents come and  go, but the career bureaucrats continue to  go about their work.  An 1857 article by Charles Dickens about  ""Circumlocution  om.ces""  shows  that bu reaucratic obfuscation is nothing new:  ""The Circumlocution Oftlce was (as every body knows without being told)  the most  important Department under Government.  No public business of any kind could pos sibly be done at any time without the ac quiescence of the Circumlocution omce. Its  finger was in the largest public pie, and in  the smallest publlc tart. It was equally im possible to do the plainest right and undo  the plainest wrong without the express au thority of the Circumlocution Oftlce. If an other Gunpowder Plot had been discovered  half an hour before  the  lighting of  the  match, nobody would have been justified in  saving the Parliament until there had been  half a score of boards, half a bushel of min utes,  several  sacks of oftlcial memoranda,  and a  family-vault of ungrammatical cor respondence, on  the part of  the Circum locution Otnce.  ""This  glorious  establishment had been  early  in  the  field, when  the one sublime  principle involving the diftlcult art of gov erning  a  country was  first distinctly  re vealed to statesmen. It had been foremost  to study that bright revelation and to carry  its shining influence through the whole of  the oftlcial proceedings. Whatever was  re quired to be done, the Circumlocution Of fice was beforehand with all the public de partments  in  the art of perceiving-How  Not To Do It.""  Well, John Peter Zengers have not been  springing up in every National Press Build ing oftlce, nor have the walls of government  crumbled before the public's greater percep tion of governmental actions.  The Federal Trade Commission no longer  refuses  to make  public  its  organization  chart. New  federal  agencies,  such as  the  Environmental Protection Agency and  the  Consumer Safety  Protection Commission,  demonstrate that public  information need  not be propaganda and  that  the public's  right to know can be institutionalized into  the job description of federal employees.  A more significant omen is the usage of  the FOIA by public interest groups to moni tor  federal programs. Thirty-seven of  the  first 40 FOI cases were brought by corpora tions. Now, public interest groups are suc cessfully winning  suits  in areas  such  as  school desegregation, contingency plans for  deployment of American forces in the Middle  East, the Department of Agriculture's com pliance with the Civil Rights Act and safety  of nuclear power plants. The Carl Stern case,  one of the few uses of the FOIA by the work ing press, has revealed the extent of FBI in filtration and disruption of alleged ""subver sive organizations.""  These cases provide encouragement and  precedent for other law suits. Federal om cials are becoming wary of ruling out of  hand the release of ""their"" records to citi zens. Nonetheless, the FOI can be regarded  as a  tool which has some great weaknesses.  Under the act nine categories of exemptions  were  established. The Statute  specifically  states that these exemptions are not manda tory. Agency oftlcials have used  these ex emptions, however, as  loopholes to prevent  public oversight of governmental actions.  The  exemptions  include: materials spe cifically required by Executive Order to be  kept secret in the interest of national de fense or foreign policy;  information related  solely to the internal rules and practices of  an  agency;  interagency  or  intra-agency  memoranda.;  and  investigatory  files  com piled for  law enforcement purposes.  Agencies such as the Department of Agri culture have steadfastly refused  to adhere  to the spirit of the FOIA. The House Oper16839  ations, Foreign Operations and Government  Information  Subcommittee  staff  believes  that 90 percent of  information refused  to  cilfiizens under the exemptions of the FOIA  should have been available  to  the public.  Moreover, William Florence, former Air Force  Deputy Assistant for Security and Trade Af fairs and a 43 year veteran of the Defense  Department has testified that 99Y:z percent  of information which is classified for nation al defense purposes should be declassified  for public scrutiny.  The bureaucracy has evolved a set of tac tics to meet public requests for information,  which is similar to techniques a basketball  team might use  to stop its opponent from  scoring.  First, zone defense. The best offense is a  good defense. The game plan here  ls  for  agencies  to hustle to apply the nine cate gories of exemptions as a mandatory ln!or mation strait  jacket. A good zone defense  forces your opponent to take  low percent age shots.  Second, the slowdown. If you can hold the  ball, your oppQP.ent  can't score. Agencies  often take between two to three months to  rule upon the availablllty of requested infor mation. Of course, since the opponent ls al ways behind in this game, once the informa tion becomes available, it is often dated and  useless. A team that can't get its hands on  the ball, can't score until it's too late in the  game to matter.  Third, goaltending. When a player pene trates close to the basket, the defender will  sometimes illegally block his shot. Similarly,  some FOI shots are blocked by bureaucrats  skillfully interwining information which  ts  not exempt with classified materials. If your  opponent goal-tends, it intimidates you from  driving to the basket and scoring.  Fourth, the home-court advantage. In or der to use the FOIA you must know exactly  which materials to request. If the index of  the material ls ""secret,"" how do you know  what  ln!ormation will answer your ques tions? The FOI process is always played on  the home court of  the bureaucracy. The  home court advantage ls worth many points  in this game.  Fifth, the doubleteam. The FOIA permits  agencies to charge small fees for public in quiries to cover costs which are not in the  budget. The Department  of Agriculture,  tried  to charge Ralph Nader's Agriculture  Task Force $89,000 for information which it  requested.  If  they can't prevent  the dis closure of the ln!ormation, then they may  try to use the doubleteam to price you out  of the market.  Sixth, secret scrimmages.  If fans would  only wait for the regular season, they would  be able to see their favorite team play. The  Circumlocution om.ces of some agencies seem  to be perpetually engaged in writing internal  personnel memoranda and  in  researching  ""working"" papers which are never finished.  You wouldn't want  to expose  the  team's  game plan before it is ready.  Although  President Nixon  has  spoken  about the importance of public access to gov ernmental  information,  the record 01' this  Administration has not been any better than  that of its predecessors. A proposed Otncial  Secrets Act would penalize people who un lawfully disclose information. Overclassifica tion of documents, a greater menace to the  national defense, is not punished. Misappli cation of the Espionage Act, the Watergate  cover-up, false and misleading statements by  government otncials  to Congress, and un bridled usage of Executive Privilege are ex amples of administrative abuses.  The Administration's record could be im proved by a Freedom of Information Review  which  is being undertaken by  the Justice  Department. The Administration could also  support  in  the Senate,  the  amendments  passed by the House of Representatives by  ",1974
180,,93,0.739,264,13,Mr. CRANE.," Mr.  Speaker,  before  reaching the age of 65, the typical young  American worker and his employer will  have paid more than $135,000 for a re tirement plan which claimed  to have  given disability protection.  Instead of this, writes reporter War ren Shore, of Chicago Today, he will re ceive:  The cheapest kind of ""term insurance"" at  three to five times its normal cost.  The cheapest, least useful kind of disabil ity protection at more than three times its  normal cost.  Incredible  discrimination  against wage  earners from a  fund entirely supported by  wage earners and their employers.  Mr. Shore concludes thatThe tragic irony of a system 100 per cent  supported by payroll  taxes punishing  the  wage earner and ignoring all other forms of  income will be compounded in the future  .  .  . the only way the federal treasury can  guarantee even this proinise is with the hope  that the next generation (our children) will  accept a stlll worse deal-that they, too, will  become a generation of victims.  In a three-part series concerning social  security, Chicago Today has challenged  many of the myths which surround the  social security system.  I wish to share this series with my col leagues and today am inserting Part 4,  which appeared  in Chicago Today of  May 2, 1974, in the RECORD. The previous  parts of this series have already been in serted  into  the RECORD  and  the  :final  part will be placed into the RECORD at a  later time.  Part 4 follows:  WHAT SOCIAL SECURITY OFFERS  (By Warren Shore)  (Is Social Security a ripoff for young peo ple? Reporter Warren Shore has spent months  exainining  the  federal  law,  talking  to  re cipients,  representatives  in  the  field,  and  insurance experts. He went so far as to set  up a special computer program from which  in.any of the startling figures in this series  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  a.re based. In fairness, Chicago Today next  week wlll make space available to the Social  Security Administration to respond with its  side of the story.)  Before he  reaches 65,  the  typical young  American worker and his employer will have  paid more than $135,000 for a retirement plan  which claimed to have given disabillty pro tection along the way. Instead he wlll get:  The cheapest kind of ""term insurance"" at  three to five times its normal cost.  The cheapest,  least useful, kind of dis abllity protection at more than three times  its normal cost.  Incredible  discrimination  against wage  earners from a  fund entirely supported by  wage earners and their employers.  To understand how so much money could  pay for so little protection, it's necessary to  know a little about how your money should  worlt for you.  For instance, if a young worker wants to  make sure that his wife and family will be  protected, should be die, with an income un til the kids are out of school, the cheapest  insurance he can buy is called term insur ance.  As an example,  a  27-year-old man can  guarantee an income for his family of $500  a month for the next 20 years for an annual  payment of $192-that's $16 per month.  George Menlow, a 27-year-old freight han dler with a wife and  two young children  is proinised a maximum of $450 a month  benefit for his family for the next 20 years  by Social Security. It's the same as  term  insurance because the money wlll stop once  the kids are out of school.  The  difference  is  that George Menlow,  like millions of others like him, pays $1,400  a year for Social Security's brand of term  insurance. He and his boss pay $60 a month  each-more  than seven  times  the market  cost of insurance.  Social  Security Administration  officials  point out, however, that George gets more  than just term insurance for his money; he  also gets disab111ty protection and a retire ment plan. Take a look:  The Social Security brand of d1sabll1ty  insurance comes with two stunning limita tions. First, it requires that a total d1sab111ty  be ""expected  to last at lea.st 12 months.""  This requirement alone, according to the  National Safety Council would  eliminate  more than 90 per cent of all total disabllities  from Social Security protection.  The 10 per cent who qualify do little better.  Social Security rules say these totally dis abled workers must wait ""until the begin ning of the seventh month"" out of work to  be paid at all.  George Menlow can buy disablllty insur ance to add to his death benefit insurance  for a.bout $10 a month. There would be no  12-month  total disabllity rule and only a  one month waiting period.  Th us Menlow could  improve upon both  Social Security's death benefit and disab111ty  plans for a  total cost of  less  than $30 a  month. Yet he and his boss pay $120  a  month-stm four times the real cost.  Does  this mean that  the other $1,100 a  year Social Security takes for George Menlow  goes  toward his retirement  fund? Menlow  had better not rely on that. The fa.ct is that  the  retirement  program  ts  the  saddest,  least defensible part of Social Security.  Consider  the case of two men who will  retire  this year. Charles Teppit and John  Singer will both turn 65 during the same  month. Both live with their wives in homes  they own. Tho the two men have paid nearly  the  same Social Security  tax, once  they  retire most similarities between  them will  end.  Teppit wlll retire as vice president of a  large manufacturing company. His salary has  been above the $40,000 level for the last 20  years and with company bond options, an  executive pension plan, and his own annuMay 29, 1974  1ties, Teppit is guaranteed a retirement in  come of more than $1,300 a month.  Singer is ending a 25-year career as a rout ing supervisor for a small trucking company.  Last year his salary was $14,900. For the la.st  10 years, says Singer,  it has been almost  impossible  for him and his wife Ada  to  save much after paying the bills. Tho they  have a small savings and some insurance, the  Singers will be  relying on Social Security.  Because maximum Social Security tax has  always been pegged at middle-class earning  levels, both Teppit and Singer have paid the  maximum, even tho Teppit has always earned  at least twice what Singer has.  How the two men wlll be ""evaluated"" by  the Social Security Administration to deter mine the size of their retirement checks.  Since Teppit and Singer paid the same tax  during their working lives and their wives  do not work, both are eligible for a family  benefit check of $440  a month. But only  Teppit wlll get the full amount.  The Social Security benefit ""earnings test""  decrees  that  for every dollar earned over  $2,400 during a year, 50 cents  is deducted  !from the benefit check.  But Social Security considers ""earnings""  to be wages--nothing else. Thus, Charles  Teppit's bond  interest,  executive pen.Sion,  and private annuity don't count; he wlll have  the full $440 a month added to his other  $1,300 per month for a $21,000-a-year retire ment  income.  ""But Ada and  I can't afford  to  live on  $440 a month,"" says John Singer. ""rt's less  than half what I used to take home."" So like  millions of others over 65, John Singer wlll  keep working to make ends meet.  In Singer's case, it's a part-time routing  job with a small trucking firm which pays  $120 a week for three days' work. The income  means  the Singers' Social Security check  shrinks to $280 a month.  ""Is it fair,"" asks Singer, ""that I should lose  the Social Security I worked for because I  can't afford to stop working?""  Mr. and Mrs. Singer have become the ulti mate victims of Social Security. If a system  can be judged by its end product, the Sing er's plight should be judged:  After 35 years in the work force, paying at  the maximum social security tax rate, Singer  at 65 will begin giving MORE to the system  than when he was working ,full time.  Since the Social Security Administration  will begin deducting BOTH  from Singer's  benefit check [$160 a month) and his part time earnings [another $24 a month], one fifth of all his income wlll be taken away.  The tragic irony of a system 100 per cent  supported by payroll  taxes punishing  the  wage earner and ignoring all other forms of  income wlll be compounded in the future.  The present generation of young workers  will pay three times what Singer paid for a  government promise worth no more to them  than Singer's.  The only way  the  federal  treasury can  guarantee even this promise is with the hope  that the next generation [our children) wlll  accept a still worse deal-that they, too, wm  become a generation of victims.

181,House,93,-0.075,277,13,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. Speaker, I take the  to $15  floor  today to call urgent attention to  the mounting crisis within our economic  system. The inflation rate is intolerable,  and every American suffers from the lack  of strong national policy dealing with  our economic problems.  One urgent step needed now  is an  emergency cutback in Federal spending,  something in the range of $10  billion at a minimum. There will be  differences of opinion where  the cut backs should be applied, but the time for  tough fiscal restraint is here.  With every family, business, and pri vate  institution  forced  implement  major cost reduction programs, the Fed eral Government must do likewise in a  serious and responsible manner.  Smaller,  leaner Federal Government  will help America and substantially re duce the runaway inflationary pressure  we are now experiencing.  1 will have more to say on this matter  in the days ahead.  to  REFERRAL OF HOUSE RESOLUTION  774 TO HOUSE CALENDAR  ",1974

183,House,93,0.277,277,13,Mr. SEBELIUS.," Mr. Speaker, accord ing to my calendar, today is Memorial  Day, although we no  longer officially  observe it as such. The same is true of  Veterans Day. However, according to our  major veteran's organizations, 41 States  now observe Veterans Day on November  11. My colleagues may also have seen  recent television coverage regarding the  observance of Memorial Day  today  in  several States as well.  The upshot of my remarks is that I  think there is significant evidence that  citizens  throughout our country want  very much to restore tradition and pur pose to our way of life. I am aware some  may think changing the date of a na tional holiday would be  frivolous and  would not represent an issue of real im portance or significance.  I would only  point out that 41 States now observe Vet erans Day on the date of the original  armistice and this movement is growing.  Several weeks ago, I filed a discharge  petition to bring up House Joint Resolu tion 126 for immediate consideration by  this body. This joint resolution would re establish November 11 of each year as  Veterans Day. To date, some 44 Mem bers have signed the discharge petition  and this effort has now received the sup port of our major veterans organizations .  During this time of national unrest, I  believe quite strongly  that our people  long for traditional American values and  goals. As it stands now, we observe many  of our national holidays as a matter of  convenience. If all of our citizens would  observe this day with the same emotion  and feeling that is in the hearts of our  World War I veterans, I feel this observ ance on November 11 could be very sig nificant in our efforts to establish a per manent framework for peace and under standing.  I ask for the support of my colleagues  in joining with me to restore Veterans  Day to its original and proper date. As I  have pointed out, some 41 States have  already taken this action. I am not op posed  to convenient holidays as such;  however,  I believe  the  time has come  when we should put aside convenience in  those special instances where rededica tion to a cause and national purpose is  so important.

186,Senate,93,-0.224,407,13,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, I would  like  to bring  to  the attention of  the  Senate some very noteworthy facts con cerning the oil crisis and profitmaking  record of the large petroleum corpora tions during the last quarter.  For years, oil corporations have prac ticed ""Dollar Diplomacy"" abroad. Now  that a  similar  scheme  is being per petrated on the American people, I think  that Congress  should  take a  forceful  stand  to  rebalance huge oil company  profits  against  the  interests  of  the  American consumer.  Mr. President, I am not alone in my  feelings.  On April 23, Mr. Fred Hartley,  the  president of Union Oil Co., testified be fore a Subcommittee of the Joint Com mittee on Public Domain in California  that the price of new domestic crude oil  should be cut in view of the considerable  profits  announced  by  the major  oil  corporations-including his own com pany, Union Oil.  Recent studies have disclosed so many  problems with oil pricing that to  list  them all would fill this RECORD.  But let us consider the fact that new  oil produced from new wells or increased  production from wells already in opera tion before 'March 1972 sells for about  $9.50  a  barrel. Under Federal  price  regulations old domestic oil sells at about  $4.50 a barrel.  The differential was designed to give  oil companies an  incentive  to develop  new domestic sources of oil.  Instead, according to Mr. Hartly, new  oil prices have risen so far and profits  have risen more than needed as an in centive for more exploration while the  increases have been passed along to the  consumers.  This is a critical point that should not  escape any of us in light of the statistics  recently released by the major oil corpo rations showing startling  increases  in  profit  levels. According  to  the Wall  Street Journal, April 24 edition, the fol lowing companies experienced gains in  profits and revenue.  EXXON CORP.  First quarter profits rose 39 percent.  Exxon's net rose to $705 million from  $.508 million. Revenue, including excise  taxes and duties, increased 59 percent to  $9.95 billion  from $6.24 billion a year  earlier.  TEXACO  The $589.4 million in first quarter prof its, up from $264 million, an increase of  97 percent, the sharpest increase of the  six major oil companies. Revenue rose to  $4.92 billion from $2.49 billion. Texaco  also  stated  that  nonrecurring  crude  ",1974

188,Senate,93,0.395,459,13,Mr. COTTON.," Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent to insert in the REC ORD  a  statement which I made  today  before the Subcommittee on Merchant  Marine of our Committee on Commerce,  opposing the bills, H.R. 8193 and S. 2089.  '.!'he bill, H.R. 8193, carries the short  title, ""The Energy Transportation Secu rity Act of 1974,"" and would require an  increasing percentage of imported petro leum  and petroleum  products  to  be  transported on higher-costing U.S.-flag  tanker vessels.  If enacted, this legislation could have  a profound, and probably adverse, effect  upon the cost of meeting our current,  pressing energy resource needs. I seri ously question whether, as reflected in  the short title ""The Energy Transportation Security Act of 1974,"" this legisla tion would provide our Nation with such  security. Rather,  I  fear  that it could  very well  render  the  availability  of  needed petroleum from foreign sources  more insecure and increase the cost to  the American economy,  including con sumers, farmers, and industries.  Of course, as  in many such cases,  there is plenty of room for reasonable  men  to differ on  the rather complex  provisions of this bill. A similar bill was  defeated in the Senate last year by a  margin of only 12 votes. However, I feel  that at this time the Senate should be  made aware of the rather far-reaching  issues involved in this measure. That is  the reason why I  should  like  to have  printed in the RECORD  the statement I  made before  the committee, not as a  speech, but as a statement, and invite the  attention of the Senate to it. I ask unan imous consent  that  the statement be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the state ment was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  I  STATEMENT OF SENATOR NORlUS CO'ITON ON  H.R. 8193 AND S. 2089  Mr. Chairman, I wish to express my appre ciation to you and to Chairman Magnuson  for granting my request for this additional  day of hearing on  the bllls, S. 2089 and  H.R. 8193.  As you will recall, in the 92nd Congress I  opposed  vigorously  a  legislative  proposal  simllar to the pending btlls. That earlier leg islative proposal was a Committee amend ment to the maritime appropriation author ization btll, H.R. 13324, of the 92nd Congress,  which would have required that at least 50%  of all ""crude and unfinished oils and finished  products"" imported into the United States  on ""a quota basts, allocation or licenses"" be  carried on board higher-costing tanker ves sels of the United States.  My principal concern  then, as now, was  the probable cost  impact upon  the con sumers of certain sectors of the country, such  as the New England and upper Midwestern  States. Although this remains my principal  concern,  do have several others, not the  least of which is my personal opinion that  at this particular time in our Nation's his tory when it is beset with the problems of  very serious energy shortages, any restriction  of any kind whatsoever that would make it  more dtfilult for us to obtain on, such as the  pending legislation, should be resisted.  Accordingly, my primary objective  is  to  ensure  the continued flow of vital energy  resources at the lowest possible cost to the  American consumer and  to  the American  taxpayer.  In expressing this opposition to the pend ing legislation, I wish to make clear that I  am not opposed to needed maritime promo tional programs. I  supported enactment of  the Merchant Marine Act of 1970. Moreover,  I have continued to support that statutory  maritime program both in this Committee  and on the Committee on Appropriations on  which I  serve with respect to annual appro priations implementing that Act which have  annually been in excess of Y:z billion dollars.  Mr. Chairman, I am not expressing oppo sition to the pending legislation out of any  deference to the major on companies. None  are located or have any fac111ties in my State.  As a matter o! fact,  those of us from the  New England region represent 6 of the 12  States in this Nation which are without any  refinery capacity whatsoever.  Moreover, as Under Secretary of Commerce  Tabor testified on the initial day of hearings  ",1974
189,,93,0.298,511,13,Mr. MALLARY.," Mr. Speaker, the House  will soon be considering H.R. 14462, the  Oil and Gas Energy Tax Act. This act  has generated a great deal of discussion  as to the competitive nature of the oil  and natural gas industries, and the ex tent of profits that are being received by  these industries as a result of the energy  crisis.  In evaluating H.R. 14452, many Mem bers may :find useful the following study  made by Congressmen FISH,  FRELING HUYSEN, HORTON, WHITEHURST, and my self, which analyzes the state of competi tion in the petroleum and natural gas  industries, giving special emphasis to in dustry structure and behavior:  COMPETITIVE ASPECTS OF EACH  INDUSTRY  Two recent trends are changing the nature  of competition in the energy industry:  the rapid transformation of single-fuel en ergy companies  into multi-fuel companies  through acquisition practices; and  (2)  the  economic collapse of many independent en ergy companies, particularly oil distributors.  In theory, competition in the energy indus tries should be having the following favor Sible effects in terms of benefits to the con sumer end the economy.  (1)  ",1974
190,,93,-0.384,537,13,Mr. DENT.," Mr. Speaker,  I am sure  that my colleagues are aware by now  of the extension of $180 million in cred it to the Occidental Petroleum Company  by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, for the  express purpose of financing a chemical  fertilizer deal with the Soviet Union.  Certainly we know that this $180 mil lion  loan  represents  the  largest such  credit ever extended by Ex-Im Bank. But  perhaps we have not all been apprised  of the current situation of Ex-Im loans,  set forth in an article in The Wall Street  Journal dat.ed May 24, 1974, just 2 days  after the Occidental-Soviet loan was ap proved.  Ex-IM BANK HEAD  SAYS LENDING  PROGRAM  FACES CUT DUE TO RISING INTEREST RATES  WASHINGTON.-Rising  interest  rates may  force sharp cutbacks in the Export-Import  Bank's lending program for the rest of this  year,  the head of  the U.S.  export-credit  agency disclosed.  The chief victims, said Ex-Im Bank Chair man William J. Casey, may be the bank's  principal customers, U.S. manufacturers of  commercial jet aircraft, which already face  steep financial and competitive pressures.  Mr. Casey said that until next January,  the Ex-Im Bank may ""face a very real pros pect"" of rejecting ""one out of every  three  or four loans we would have made in the  past."" He said the recent general escalation  in interest rates has brought a surge of ap plications for Ex-Im Bank loans, which carry  a. 7 % interest rate, much lower than the pre vailing rate from commercial banks.  a. result, the bank's loan limit of $3.8  billion for the fiscal year ending June 30 al ready has been reached, Mr. Casey said. In deed, he said, the agency already has ma.de  or received recommendations from its staff  for about $4.8 billion in loans. This means $1  billion in loans will have to be turned down  or included in the fiscal 1975 authorization,  which Congress hasn't yet cleared.  ""Unless  next  year's  authorization  is  higher than  this year's, even wtihout  the  usual and indeed the necessary increase in  exports, we would find ourselves forced  to  turn down one out of every three or four  loans and, if I'm any judge of trends, the  reality would be a  lot closer to two out of  five,"" Mr. Casey  told the Aerospace Indus tries Association of America., meeting in Wil liamsburg, Va.  Mr. Casey said  the bank hasn't yet de cided how it will respond to the loan pres sures, although he said it probably wlll have  to reject some loan applications. He said the  Al!.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  bank may have to reduce its role in loan participation or loan-guarantee programs.  He indicated the agency may have to cut  the participation in aircraft  loans  to 30%  from 45%, which would  increase  interest  costs to the purchaser of an aircraft to 9.8%  annually from about 8.6%, counting the Ex Im Bank share and the share the purchaser  borrows from a commercial bank. This, how ever,  could bring  the  interest burden on  credit sales by domestic aircraft producers  ""dangerously above""  that which Europeans  and Japanese competitors can offer.  About 26% of the Ex-Im Bank loans so  far this year have helped finance commer cial  jet exports. At  the beginning of this  year, the bank had provided $4.2 billion in  loans covering the export sales of more than  1,000 commercial  jets, valued at about $10  billion. In addition, bank loans of $275 mil lion have been made  to help  finance  t.he  sales of 748 other aircraft.  Mr. Speaker, I will simply add here  that Ex-Im Bank's loan policy  seems  curiously un-American.

191,,93,-0.422,537,13,Mr. DRINAN.," Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks  ago people around the world expressed  their horror in response to the cold and  senseless killings of schoolchildren at the  village of Maalot in Israel. Within this  outrage,  responsible voices were heard  to call not only for an end to acts of  terrorism but for an end to cooperation  with these groups by governments who  harbor and protect them.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  take note of the eloquent statement on  the Maalot tragedy issued by the Com bined Jewish Philanthropies and Jewish  Community Council of Metropolitan Bos ton Joint Committee on Mideast Policy.  It calls for a comprehensive and active  approach by the United States against  terrorism and  those governments who  support  it. The  text of  the statement  follows:  The following statement was adopted to day, (Thursday, May 16), by the Joint Mid East Policy Committee  of  the Combined  Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston and  the Jewish Community Councll of Metro politan Boston.  ""Thoughtful people all over the world have  been overwhelmed by the barbaric acts per petrated by Arab  terrorists in Ma'alot. To day's strong U.S. criticism of the Arab ter rorists' seizure and murder of Israeli school  children is not enough. Only two weeks ago,  the immoral U.S. vote in the Security Coun cil of the United Nations had the effect of  encouraging further Arab terrorist outrages.  Ma'alot was the inevitable sequel to Klryat  Shemona and the bitter fruit of the UN vote.  ""No government and no people can pre tend to moral leadership by condemning only  the criminal acts of a  few barbarians. The  Arab terrorists would not exist or function  without the encouragement and support of  Arab governments. Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and  Libya. provide essential training and staging  facllities while Saudi Arabia,  the Persian  17125  Gulf sheikdoms and others enthusiastically  finance their crimes.  ""Our government must  finally  recognize  these realities. We know to our sorrow that  terrorism once condoned knows no bound aries. The government of the United States  must  forthrightly condemn  the actions of  Arab governments that support and nour ish the criminal activities of Arab terrorists  and it must give visible effect  to our na tional revulsion. Our leadership in the cause  of world peace demands no less.""  In a statement of my own, printed in  the May 16, 1974, CONGRESSIONAL REC ORD,  I was careful to note the need to  link the current emerging Middle East  peace agreements to a long overdue sup pression of terrorism. Since then I have  been contacted by many of my constit uents urging action in support of Israel  and  against  terrorism. A  thoughtful  statement, which I have received from  Rabbi Terry R.

192,,93,-0.506,537,13,Mr. BROWN of California.,"  Mr.  Speaker, I highly recommend that every  Member of Congress read a recent article  by Howard T. Odum, Ph. D., that was  published in the January-February issue  of Industrial Development. Dr. Odum is  a noted ecologist, and is a pioneer in his  field. Ecology, as Webster's dictionary  reminds us, is the totality or pattern of  relations between organisms and their  environment.  In recent years we have heard the ex pressions of frustration from segments  of our society that ecology should include  economics. Not so  frequently we have  heard the explanation of how  it does.  Dr. Odum has done a masterful job of  explaining the relationships of energy,  ecology, and economics. His views chal lenge the assumptions of most advocate  groups, including many environmental ists. I intend to investigate many of the  questions that Dr. Odum raises  in his  ",1974
193,,93,0.679,550,13,Mr. COLLINS of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  the recent difficulties of a power com pany in New York highlight industries'  problems with government bureaucracy.  The redtape, paperwork, public hearings,  and lawsuits all combine to make it im possible for a power company to build  new facilities.  America needs more power for its in dustrial and consumer expanding  re quirements.  Last year, I sat in on a House com mittee that was working  to determine  where powerplants should be located. We  had one dedicated group that objected  to every suggestion that was made. After  several months of  this, our committee  chairman asked  them  just what  they  would recommend. They answered that  they had no suggestions as  to where  plants should go, as their position was  one of finding the objections to the pro posals made.  What we need today is to give positive  thinking people an opportunity to move  forward. One of the basic potentials of  additional power  is  the use of atomic  energy. I read an interesting article in  Industry Week, May 27, 1974, about the  Government harassment and delays that  are negating progress.  This was a good article and I would  like for you to review some of its best  paragraphs. Here is Industry Week on  nowerplant delays:  GOVERNMENT Is MAIN ATOM PLANT ROADBLOCK  Despite  the  growing  need  for  electric  power, 70 out of 95 nuclear power plant  projects have  experienced delays  ranging  from  two  to 66 months. The main cause:  the  licensing and  regulatory  requirements  of the government.  These findings come from a survey by the  Atomic Industrial Forum Inc.  (AIF), New  York, of 37 utilities with 47 units under con struction and 48 awaiting permits.  For those plants under construction, the  survey found an average delay of 24.3 months;  for  those awaiting permits, 25.9 months.  At  those plants under construction,  the  survey showed, 1,119 plant-months have been  lost in delays. By far the largest part of these  delays-471 plant-months-was due to gov ernment  licensing and regulatory  require ments. The next most  important was  late  delivery of compohents and materials: delays  of 87 plant-months. Others:  shortages of  craft  labor,  76  plant-months;  inadequate  productivity by labor, 72; and shortages of  engineers and  technical support personnel,  47.3.  Interestingly, lack of public acceptance of  nuclear reactors seems to be a very minor  cause in the delay of plants under construc tion. The utilities surveyed stated that lack  of adequate information on nuclear projects  at the national and local level did not ac count for any delay.  Tactics of public  intervenors  in the  li censing process have been somewhat more  significant in delay nuclear plants; these ac count for 29 plant-months of delay for units  included in the survey.  SPEEDUP  The survey was done at the request of the  government  to help  spot  the  reasons  for  May 30, 1974  delays in nuclear projects and to find ways  to avoid such delays.  Ut111ties  responding to  the survey stated  that 14 of the 47 nuclear units under con struction could be finished sooner if several  steps were taken immediately. Most impor tant of these would be elimination of the  public hearing prior to issuance of the oper ating license. (This would still leave a public  hearing  before  a  construction  permit  is  granted.) On the average, this move would  speeC:.  up  construction by  three  to  four  months, the utllitles said.  More significant speedups-seven to eight  months-could be made with plants still in  the planning stage, they said. Here, the re spondents suggested one cha~ge in Atomic  Energy Commission (AEC) procedures: allow  site preparation work before a construction  permit is issued. Now, no site preparation can  get underway without a construction permit.  The AEC is moving to speed up its licens ing and regulating procedures. At the same  time,  however,  other  developments  are  stretching out timetables for nuclear units.  Respondents to the survey repeatedly men tion worsening shortages of materials, com ponents, and equipment. They also foresee  growing problems with antitrust  reviews,  and redundancy in their dealings with fed eral, state, and local regulatory agencies.  SOCIAL SECURITY-THE GREAT  RIPOFF-NO. 5  HON. PHILIP M. CRANE  OF  ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 30, 1974  ",1974
194,,93,-0.269,628,13,Mr. ANDERSON of California.," Mr.  Speaker, on June 13, the many friends  and associates of Mrs. Viola Brereton  Clark Goldman are honoring this out standing educator for her many years of  dedicated  service  to  the  community  State, and Nation.  '  It is through the selfless efforts of in dividuals, such as Mrs. Goldman, that  our values, our ideals and our social fiber  are transmitted from generation to gen eration, continuously seeking to Jmprove  our society through knowledge.  Born in Lawton, Okla., Mrs. Goldman  was educated at the University of Okla homa, and received her masters degree  from  the University of Southern Cali fornia.  In 1946, she began teaching in Lyn wood  at Central Elementary School.  Later, she taught at Washington Ele mentary, also in LYnwood.  Then, after 7 years of teaching expe rience, she was appointed principal of  Lugo and Central Elementary Schools.  Two years later, in 1955, Mrs. Goldman  became principal of Wilson Elementary  School, where she was a leader in patri otic activities designed  to  instill pride  and civic awareness in her pupils.  Following the annexation of Janie P.  Abbott Elementary School from Comp ton in 1967, Mrs. Goldman was appointed  principal of that school where she was  recognized  for her skills and for her  devotion as the recipient of the George  Washington Award, and  the Principal  School  Award,  both  signal  honors  awarded for only the highest abilities.  During her outstanding career as an  educator, she received the George Wash ington Honorary Medal four times; the  Principal School Award-which,  inci dentally, is the highest award given-a  total of three times; and she was the  recipient of the Valley Forge Freedom  Foundation Award.  In addition to Mrs. Goldman's duties  at her schools, she is an active partici pant in community affairs. She is  the  President of the Lynwood Teachers As sociation, and a member of both  the  Soroptimist Club  and  the University  Women's Club.  But, most importantly, Mrs. Goldman  also found time to raise a stepson Bill  Clark, who, along with his wife Lyn, have  attained Ph. D. degrees.  Mr. Speaker, thanks to the service of  Mrs. Goldman and others like her, fu ture generations will possess the historic  significance of our country,  the social  context in which to frame ideas, and the  civic awareness needed to improve the  conditions which confront mankind.  I take great pride and pleasure in not ing her achievements in the community,  and I wish to join the many friends and  associates of Mrs. Goldman in commend ing this outstanding individual for her  many years of selfless dedication to the  betterment of our society.

197,Senate,93,-0.247,706,13,Mr. RANDOLPH.," Mr. President, on  May 16 at the Department of Agriculture's 28th annual honor awards cere mony in Washington the only recipient  of the Superior Service Award for Rural  Community Development was the West  Virginia Mountaineers for Rural Prog ress Council. This is a statewide orga nization  based  in Morgantown. This  well-deserved award is the culmination  of diligent efforts and effective plan ning. The Department of Agriculture  cited the councilFor significant achievement in obtaining  Federal, State, and County agency coopera tion in rural development efforts; and for  creating awareness and motivating loc.al citi zens, groups, and organizations into a  total  rural development program.  The West Virginia Mountaineers for  Rural Progress Council-MRP-is  the  fourth State organization to receive the  Superior Service Award for Rural Com munity Development.  The MRP and its county committees  provide  collective  leadership  through  Federal, State, and local agencies and  organizations to encourage local partic ipation in achieving various rural pro gram objectives. The West Virginia MRP  Council stresses interagency cooperation  and full resource commitment.  Four years ago West Virginia's Rural  Development Committee-with its theme  ""Mountaineers  for Rural Progress"" determined that rural progress in West  Virginia could not be effective without a  combined  and  coordinated  Federal,  State, and local effort to  improve our  State's social  and  economic  develop ment. The MRP stressed  that greater  progress can be achieved through maxi mum utilization of  existing  resources  and a  constant endeavor  to eliminate  duplication of programs already being  undertaken by other agencies.  Through  this unique organizational  framework and communications system,  rural development in West Virginia has  made significant gains. The council co ordinates rural  development activities,  reviews the monthly reports of the coun ty MRP committees, and monitors the  progress of various programs.  The Mountaineers for Rural Progress  nomination report states:  For the first time in West Virginia history,  Federal, State, and County Agencies, along  with local groups, .are meeting together and  accomplishing  rural progress  that no one  agency oould achieve alone.  Mr. President, having sponsored  the  Appalachian Regional Development Act  and the Public Works and Economic De velopment Act, I am intensely aware of  the neeed for the role being exercised by  Mountaineers for Rural Progress. Prac tical realities of limited funding and re sources demand that we approach social  and economic development on a regional  basis to the maximum extent possible.  To help achieve its objectives, MRP has  formed 10 State committees comprised of  leaders in business, industry, education,  and local and State government. These  committees are waste disposal; environ mental improvement and rural beauti fication; agriculture;  land use develop ment;  forestry; econ-environment; en vironmental education; vocational, tech nical and adult education; water recrea tion; and wildlife resources.  These committees are working toward  a comprehensive approach to solve criti cal State problems. These efforts include  the initiation of new vocational educa tion programs, a statewide land-use con ference, material  recycling workshops,  and county recreation plans. The county  MRP committees can provide increas ingly greater assistance in the planning  of such vital facilities as sewage treat ment and water systems.  It was my privilege to meeet with many  of the members of the Mountaineers for  Rural Progress State Council following  the agriculture awards ceremony. Those  able to attend the ceremonies were: J.  Kenton  Lambert,  Director,  Farmers  Home Administration; James S. Bennett,  State conservationist, Soil Conservation  Service and former chairman of the MRP  State Council; Gus R.

Other members of the State council  include Betty Dean, executive director,  West Virginia Council of Towns and  Cities; Orus L. Bennett,  research soil  scientist, Agricultural Research Services;  John D. Hurd, executive secretary, West  Virginia State Chamber of Commerce;  Carl L.

198,,93,-0.468,784,13,Mr. LEGGETT.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to relate an example of how time, initia tive, and personal concern properly co ordinated can 'Save millions of dollars of  the taxpayers' money.  Without  any  appropriate  yardstick  many times to determine whether cost  overruns are due  to legitimate, unfor seen causes or are simply the result of  waste and inefficiency, we  in the Con gress reluctantly appropriate the neces~  sary money to complete the project.  Most excessive costs are unnecessary  and can be avoided if the right people  simply do their job. Capt. David Cor many, stationed at McClellan Air Force  Base  in Sacramento,  is one man. who  does his job well.  Recently, C:aiptain Conn.any saved the  taxpayers $9.5 million. Through his own  initiative, he persuaded authorities at  McClellan to delay their order from Gen eral Dynamics Corporation for 1,306 new  wing tanks of the F-111. General Dy namics wanted $14,080 for each tank; a  total cost of $18,388,480 for the American  taxpayers.  For  15 months Captain Cormany  worked on preparing a precise descrip tion of the tank for engineers and in vestigating  to  see whether  interested  manUfacturers could  in fact meet  the  contract. In the end, his eif orts paid off  ina big way.  The company who was finally awarded  the contraot, Royal Industries of Sant.a  Ana, 0alif., agreed to build the tanks for  $6,844  each;  a  total  savings  the  American public of $9.5 million. Most in teresting of all was that General Dy namics,  the contractor who originally  wanted to build the tanks for $14,080  apiece, found that when faced with com petition from other bidders they could  manUf acture  the  tanks  for  the  lower  price of $10,000 each.  Fascinating, is it not, how a  little bit  of personal initiative and concern can  make such a big difference. I think both  the Pentagon as well as the Congress can  learn a great deal from Captain Cor many's example.  The following article from the Sacra mento Union spells out the story in Gov ernment efficiency and economy:  to  McCLELLAN  CAPTAIN  SAVES  MILLION  TAXPAYERS $9.5  (By Ed Mendel)  Capt. Dave Cormany saved the taxpayers  $9.5 million, so they gave him a plaque. He  was, after all,  just doing his job.  The time came for the Atr Force to order  June 3, 1974  1,306 new wing tanks for the Flll. The air craft  manufacturer,  General  Dynamics,  wanted $14,080 for each tank.  On his own initiative, Cormany persuaded  the authorities at McClellan Air Force Base  to put the order up for bids.  It took eight months of fulltime work to  prepare the specifications. It took another  seven months to investigate the bidders.  But  the  tanks  finally were ordered ai  $6,844 each. Cormany also had the satisfac tion of seeing General Dynamics, when bids  were called, offer to butld the tanks for about  $10,000 each.  The tanks will be stored as war reserves.  They were not used in Southeast Asia, where  the common Flll payload was large (a-bout  13¥z  tons) but the missions were short.  By mounting six of the 600-gallon tanks  under the wings, the range of the Flll can  be extended by 30 per cent. That, in other  words,  is enough to lift a full load. about  two miles off the ground.  ""By the time an Flll with a maximum  load gets off the ground and climbs to 10,000  feet,"" said Cormany, ""it has burned 3,600  gallons  of  fuel.  It's  really  pumping  it  through.""  If the wings a.re pulled back for  faster  :flight, he said, the two outside wing tanks  automatically drop off. The other four pivot  to keep pointing straight ahead.  To preserve its center of gravity, the air craft, prompted by automatic sensors, may  also shift the fuel between the three com   partments  in each wing  tank-<>r between  the wing  tanks and  the  tanks  inside  the  aircraft wings.  Like  the wing  that supports  them,  the  tank is a kind of air-foil that provides lift  in an air-stream. Made mainly of aluminum  with a once-piece fibreglass tail, the tanks  weigh about 550 pounds.  Before calling for bids, said Oormany, Mc Clellan had to prepare a precise description  of  the  tank. ""Now  that's what  takes  the  time,"" he said. ""That's the trick. When you  go out on a contra.ct, you have to tell a con tractor everything.""  }After  receiving  five bids,  the Air Force  sent teams to the manufacturers to see if  they could in fact meet the contract. ""These  were some of the most exhaustive pre-award  surveys the government has done,"" Cormany  said.  The contract was awarded to Royal Indus tries of Santa Ana. Two of the first tanks  built by Royal a.re being tested now. If they  pass, Cormany said, delivery may begin about  Sept. 1, continuing through 1975.  For his work, Cormany has received the  U.S.  Air  Force  Resources  Conservation  Award. In his own way, he has also come  to grips with the magnitude of his saving.  ""I figured it up,"" he said ... I saved my tax  dollars for the next 476 years.""  SUPPORT OF ASfil.JEY AMENDMENT  HON. WILLIAM M.

202,House,93,-0.483,940,13,Mr. LEHMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I support  Senate Joint Resolution 40 as amended,  calling for a White House Conference on  Library and  Information Services. As  former chairman of  the Dade County  School Board, I am well aware of  the  importance of good  libraries to quality  education. ""School libraries are depend ent upon the school they serve for their  funds,""  the National Commission  on  Libraries and Information Science points  out  in  its 1972-73  annual  report.  ""A  wealthy school district can afford an in spired library program. A poor district  may have no  library program at all.""  Witnesses from all parts of the country  appearing before the National Commis sion have recommended that the Com mission give  added  support  to  school  libraries and make them viable through out all school systems. The Commission  states:  Many new and  innovative programs  are under way in the schools in my own  district of Florida. School libraries, for  example, are working hard to build up  collections of books and audiovisual ma terials in career education. Not just the  traditional professions, such as teaching,  law or medicine, but many other types of  work are being featured-how to be a  carpenter or an electrician, for example,  or what kinds of jobs are done in an air port  other  than  those  of  pilot  or  stewardess.  Retired persons, too, have an important  role in schools in my district, particularly  in the area of tutoring students who need  practice in reading. On a 1-to-1 basis,  retired persons meet with students who  may be slow learners and listen while the  students read  to  them. This gives  the  studentsome special attention, a chance  to  improve  their reading skills, and it  gives the retired persons an opportunity  to make a useful and much-needed con tribution to society.  The White House Conference, and per haps even more, the conferences Senate  Joint Resolution 40 authorizes for each  of  the States before  the White House  Conference, will provide an opportunity  for parents and teachers, school admin istrators, board members and students a  chance to plan for the improvement of  their school libraries, including coopera tive arrangements with public, college  and other libraries so that all elementary  and secondary school students have ac cess to whatever information they need.  To conclude, Mr. Speaker,  libraries  of all kinds provide many needed services  in my district, throughout the State of  Florida, and indeed throughout the Na tion.  I wholeheartedly support Senate  Joint Resolution 40.  ",1974

Except  for a brief period at the end of World War II,  prices in the United States have of late been  rising faster than in any other peacetime pe riod of our history. If past experience is any  guide,  the  future  of  our  country  ls  in  jeopardy.  Mr. Speaker, that is no propagandist  on the stump. That is one of the most re sponsible leaders of the economy of the  United States.  What concerns me, Mr. Speaker,  is  whether we are taking adequate meas ures  to meet  the menace of  inflation,  which Dr. Burns says put in jeopardy the  very future of our country. I think that  subject imperatively commands the at tention of our Congress. I hope we shall  rise to the challenge of this menace and  be able  to  tell our constituents back  home, who are  so gravely  concerned  about this prospect, that we are trying to  do something effectively to curb it.  Mr. Speaker, I include the complete ad dress of Dr. Burns following my remarks  here in the body of the RECORD:  ",1974
208,,93,-0.4,1005,13,Mr. BURKE of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, the Washington Star-News has  been running an excellent series of ar ticles on social  security. Yesterday,  I  submitted for the RECORD, the first article  entitled,  ""Payroll Bite Acceptance  is  Wearing Thin."" Today I would like to  call my colleagues' attention to the sec ond article entitled ""Will Inflation Out strip Ability To Pay?""  These articles clearly indicate the need  for congressional review of the present  :financing of the system and the burden  it places on low-and middle-income tax payers.  The article follows:  WILL  INFLATION OUTSTRIP ABILITY TO PAY?  (By Ned Scharff)  Beginning in 2010-less than 40 years from  now-the babies born in the post-World War  II boom will  reach  retirement  age. All of  a  sudden,  the number of people living on  pensions will have gone from 29 million to 45  million-en increase of 55 percent.  And  the gap between older and younger  generations will be widest in the pocketbook  The younger will be  forced  to support  their elders, as they have done under Social  Security since 1937. But at that future date,  the price of support may be out of all pro portion to the abllity of workers to pay.  That is the way the Social Security system  ls beginning to look to its apparently grow ing number of critics. It takes only a  little  assumption-thalt today's inflation is likely  to continue, more or less--to convince the  critics that a crisis ls on the way.  If it comes, they say, it will be an actu arial crisis, a financial crisis, and, most of all,  a human crisis. Social Security will have be come a monster-devouring wages as never  before, and possibly killing workers' initia tive.  These are some of the consequences fore seen:  Caring for the nation's aged and disabled,  now a $67.7 billion undertaking, could in the  early years of the 21st century outstrip also rising defense as the single largest item in  the federal budget.  It could even herald the ultimate Welfare  State as the worker is taxed to the limit to  pay for public benefits, for his elders. With  more  senior  citizens and  relatively  fewer  workers (the ratio of workers to retirees will  have fallen from 3.2 to 2.2 by 2030), society  would take large amounts from the young in  order to fulfill promises to the old.  Barring a  sudden change  in population  trends, the sheer numbers of elderly people in  the  coming  century almost  surely would  transform America from a youth culture to  one of geriatric dominance.  Easy credit and free spending-now char acteristic  of  the nation's youth-oriented  ways-could become privileges enjoyed pri marily by senior citizens no longer respon sible for making a living. Such privileges are  not subsidized by'the current level of bene fits.  The grim predictions of the system's crit ics may reflect elements of exaggeration and  overextended  trend  lines but do represent  increasing concern that Social Security, lum bering into the future, will seriously disrupt  the financial and social bases of American  society.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Part of the forlorn outlook is due to a sim ple reality of politics: It is very popular well-nigh irresistible-to increase Social Se curity benefits, time after time.  Sen. Barry Goldwater found out just how  popular an ever-growing pension system was  during  his  1964  presidential  campaign.  Citing what he considered to be abuses in  Social Security, he warned that the system  was ""in danger of collapsing."" Remark was  used against him over and over, effectively.  Another Republican, Nebraska's Sen. Carl  T. Curtis, estimates that he lost 10 percent  of the vote in his state two years ago by ar guing that a 20 percent hike in benefits, the  largest  in Social Security histor;y, was  too  much for the system to bear.  In past years, Congress has managed So cial Security  in  a way  that has pleased  nearly everyone-declaring frequent benefit  increases without any sharp increase in taxes.  At the same time, the Social Security tax  remained partly  disguised. Since  employ ers pay half of it without any notation on  the workers' check stub, increases in the tax  appear to be only half as large as they really  are.  Since 1937, the real tax burden has risen  from 2 percent of the workers first $3,000 in  earnings  to  11.7  percent of  the worker's  first $13,200.  Still, until 1972, Congress was able to de clare frequent benefit raises without com parable  tax  increases by using an overly  conservative accounting method which as sumed that a man's wages would remain the  same throughout his career.  Of course, wages did rise, and so did So cial Security tax revenues. Congress simply  disposed of the surpluses by increasing bene fits. The tax schedule was recalculated and  Congress began saving up surpluses for the  next big increases.  By changing accounting methods  to as sume  rising wages, Congress was  able  to  declare the whopping 20 percent benefits in crease in 1972, capping a five-year period in  which benefits rose 60 percent.  But the change to the more realistic ac counting procedure, also assured  that any  future benefit  increases would necessitate  immediate tax hikes. That guaranteed that  future benefit hikes would generate more op positon from taxpayers.  Even  if no more benefit  increases were  approved  in  the next 40 years except  for  automatic  cost-of-living  increases,  taxes  would have to rise dramatically to meet the  population shift.  For example, William G., 22,  ls a clerical  employe earning $7,681 a year. Last year, G.  and his employer paid a  combined Social  Security tax of $898, or 11.7 percent of G.'s  earnings. In the year 2010, if G.'s earnings  have increased only with  inflation, his tax  will have to be increased to about $998  in  1974 dollars, or 13 percent of earnings.  And if G. still were working 20 years later,  his tax would have to be raised to 16.8 per cent of earnings, or $1,270 in 1974 dollars.  That would be  the average  tax rate  for  workers in the future if Congress did no more  than guarantee old people benefits similar to  those  they get under Social Security now.  But in the view of some there is a serious  gap already between benefits and those en visioned by the program's founders.  Created during  the Depression,  the pro gram was designed originally to provide small  benefits to protect the elderly amide wide spread poverty and unemployment. For all  the increases in benefits, the original view that the elderly should neither get rich from  the program nor be allowed to starve with out it-has essentially been maintained.  There are approximately 20 million people  over 65  in  the United States, and half of  them are estimated to be living on Social  Security alone. Their average monthly check  is only $181.  17593  Whether in its present state or in its po tential  future state,  the system of Social  Security has developed  increasingly harsh  critics. They focus heavily upon the highly  conservative economic notions used by Con gress  two years ago  in enacting otherwise  sweeping changes in the system.  Most  importantly, Congress chose  to as sume that for  the next 75 years,  inflation  would  average only 3 percent a year-an  assumption which seems doubtful in light  of  last year's 8 percent  inflation and  this  year's 14 percent.  Inflation simply means the rate at which  the cost of  living rises. In figuring  its tax  and benefit  tables  for  the  long  term,  the  Social Security Administration by order of  Congress assumed the cost of living would  rise 3 percent a year, while wages continued  to rise 5 percent a year.  In other words, workers' wages would be a  net 2 percent greater than their added costs  of getting by each year.  That is central to the idea, long nurtured  by Social Security supporters, that each gen eration will be able to afford still more gen erous support for its old people.  Viewed that way, Social Security is not a  way of buying insurance for one's own old  age. Rather, it ls a simple income transfer  plan-from the younger to the older.  But, the spiraling infiation of the past two  years suggests that all the income needed to  pay the benefits might not be there  to be  transferred in the future. To put it in eco nomic language, ""productivity"" as a base for  future Social Security is apparently not ris ing as fast as it once did.  And  if that base continues to grow ever  more slowly, Social St:curity could develop  serious income deficiencies even before the  ""baby boom"" workers go into retirement.  The retirees of the ""baby boom"" era wm  have the most dramatic numerical impact on  the program, but the phenomenon of extra ordinarily large numbers of survivors should  drop off just as dramatically when the ""zero  growth"" individuals reach retirement age.  Defenders of  the system, such as Social  Security Commissioner James B. Cardwell,  argue that Social Security could never get so  deficient that it alone would bankrupt the  country.  ""If you reach that point,"" said Cardwell,  "" ... the whole system will have collapsed.  If this population  cannot  sustain  itself,  other parts of the system will be badly dam aged.  I don't think this generation can or  should go  into  the  future  believing  this  could happen.""  Conservative economist Milton Friedman  does not feel that way about it. He and other  critics  charge  that Social Security, while  it is not the only burden on the economy, is  one of the heaviest.  ""If I were  in Social Security, I'd say  it  could never bankrupt the country, too,'' said  Friedman.  ""I'd say  it's a  simple  income  transfer program that does not use up any  real resources, that simply redistributes the  money.  ""The fact  is,  though, that it already has  had a significant effect. Already the faction  of workers between 65 and 70 has been vir tually eliminated because of the program's  disincentive effect, but that effect can be felt  in every age group.""  But Cardwell and Friedman agree on the  dangers which lie ahead for Social Securi.ty  as America  turns  into an  aging  sooiety.  Cardwell cans the population phenomenon  ""the big question of the moment."" Friedman  calls it ""a time bomb.""  A long-overdue Social Security trustees re port, now scheduled for publication in late  June or early July, will  take 1970 Census  data into account for the first time.  Social security actuaries long have known  about the existence of the baby boom, but  what. they have not known  is  that  those  ",1974
209,,93,-0.578,1031,13,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to bring to the attention of my col leagues one of Cleveland's most distin guished ministers and civic leaders, the  Reverend Emanuel S. Branch. The pastor  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  of the Antioch Baptist Church, Reverend  Branch will be honored at a 10th anni versary celebration June 8, 1974, at the  Cleveland Plaza.  He is an outstanding theologian and  has made many contributions in the area  of civic affairs. Accordingly, I submit for  consideration of the Members of Con gress a recent article which reviews his  outstanding career:  PASTOR BRANCH'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY  Rev. Emanuel S. Branch, Jr., pastor of the  Antioch Baptist Church, 8869 Cedar Avenue,  will be honored on the Tenth Anniversary of  his pastorate with a luncheon at the Cleve land Plaza, Saturd'i.y June 8th at 12 Noon.  The anniversary address wlll be delivered  by the distinguished minister and educator,  Dr. Samuel D. Proctc.1r.  Dr. Proctor, widely known in religious and  educational circles, is senior minister at the  renowned  .A!byssinian Baptist Church, New  York City and  is Professor of Education,  Graduate School of Education (Martin Lu ther King Memorial Choir), Rutgers Univer sity, New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Pastor Branch  is Antioch's ninth pastor  following a short stay by Rev. Kelley Miller  Smith who  returned  to  the  first Baptist  Church in Nashville, Tennessee. Rev. Branch  actually took over a flock that had been min istered by the late Rev. Wade Hampton Mc Kinney for 34 years. He led the fiock from  an old brick building on East 24 and Central  Avenue-from a membership of 750 to 3000- from lowly recognition in the American Bap tist Convention to holding some of the high est offices in the organization.  Rev. Branch is a native of Hartford, Con necticut and holds a bachelor of Arts Degree  from Yale where he also received his Master  of Divinity Degree.  His years  in military service  included a  period in the Ph111ppines and some time in  Korea.  Before coming to Cleveland Rev. Branch  pastored at the First Baptist Church of Mil ford, Connecticut and also at  the Union  Baptist Church in Hartford, Connecticut. In  Hartford he was active in many boards and  was honored with a listing in ""Who's Who"",  Vol. 5.  In 1961 he came to Cleveland to join the  staff of the Council of Churches of Greater  Cleveland,  formerly  the  Cleveland Area  Church Foundation. As the Assistant to the  Executive Director he was delegated to the  directing; radio and television, the commu nity relations department; and the spiritualt  life department.  In June 1964 Rev. Branch was called to  the historic Antioch Baptist Church. Here  he ministers to the needs of the 2700 mem bers. He  is often called upon for counsel.  With pride he has watched  the Antioch  Credit Union grow with assets nearly $800,000. Tlie building of a Credit Union Bullding  came about since he became pastor of the  church.  Some of the happiest moments of his life  were being honored  to speak at Talladega  College, Talladega, Alabama 1966, Fisk Uni versity, Nashville, Tennessee, 1970; Atlanta  University, Ma.rehouse College, Spelman Col lege, Atlanta, Georgia 1971 and recently he  was the honored omcial representative of the  American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A. to  the 150th Anniversary Celebrations of Bap tist Work in Haiti.  His activities in the community are many  and varied but he keeps abreast with city,  state and national politics and is a fighter  for civil rights.  Under Rev. Branch seed money was given  by the church for two housing units. Cur rently he  is co-chairman of the Board for  Antioch Apartment Inc. a committee to di rect the erection of 171 units for Senior Citi zen Building on the old Bolton School site,  17619  East 89 and Carnegie at a cost of $3,200,000.  This is being sponsored jointly by the An tioch Baptist Church, the Cleveland Board of  Education, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation  and the University Inc.  Co-chairmen of the luncheon are Mitchell  Toney and Mrs. Selmer E. Prewitt. The pub lic is invited.  ADEQUATE NUTRITION AND BASIC  HYGIENE ACT  HON. GEORGE E. BROWN, JR.  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 4, 1974  ",1974
210,,93,-0.055,1044,13,Mr. PEYSER.," Mr. Speaker, Govern ment payments  to growers amount  approximately  $90 million under  the  present Sugar Act. H.R. 14747 proposes  payments of approximately $27 .5 million  beginning July 1, 1975. The rationale for  Government payments appears to be two fold. First, to assure a fair and reason able profit for domestic growers, and sec ond, to assure that growers comply with  the labor and wage provisions of the act.  First. At  the present  time,  the U.S.  domestic price of sugar is about 24 cents  a pound. This price is almost three times  higher than the price at this time last  year, and is double the USDA price ob jective of 11% cents a pound. USDA of ficials claim that domestic growers are  receiving returns from the marketplace  which preclude the need for future Gov ernment payments as an income supple ment.  Under H.R. 14747 growers will receive  greater financial benefits. This  is true  June 4, 1974  for both small and large producers, but  more so  for  the  latter. Our enclosed  sample case shows that a grower who  produces 100,000 tons of sugar would re ceive $777,050 under the present act and  $989,400 under H.R. 14747, an increase  of $212,350. In this case, the $9,400 max imum Government payment allowed in  H.R. 14747  is only a minor portion of  the grower's net return.  If Government payments were elimi nated, small producers would suffer a loss  in income, even with the 49 cents a pound  increase in the price objective. However,  large growers, 45,000 tons or more, would  receive a higher return from the price  objective. An overriding  consideration  remains, when  the domestic price of  sugar is high enough to assure a profit able return to growers, should Govern ment payments be eliminated?  Second: Proponents of the Government  payment provision of  the Sugar Act  argue that payments assure compliance  by producers with labor and wage pro vision of  the act. They contend  that  growers who receive Government pay ments would not want to lose this income  supplement by failing to comply with the  labor provisions.  H.R. 14747 establishes a $9,400 maxi mum Government payment per farm.  Under the current act, $1.8 million was  paid to one producer in 1972. This dis crepancy could lead to a reluctance by  growers  to comply with the labor and  wage provisions of  the act. To protect  against  this possibility, H.R. 14747  in cludes  a  provision whereby workers  ""may recover in a civil suit any balance  due them if the withholding of the pro ducer's payment--does not make up the  entire underpayment"" of any wage due.  In other words, workers may file a civil  suit to protect their interests. The ques tion arises. should the Government pay  growers  to obey the law when workers  might otherwise be protected  through  civil action?  II. COSTS AND BENEFITS UNDER H.R. 14747  Growers.-Producers of  sugar beets  and sugar cane would gain substantial  benefits under the changes outlined in  H.R. 14747. As shown in our sample case,  the 49-cent-a-pound increase in the price  objective and the reduced Government  payment schedule would greatly increase  the return of large producers.  Processors.1-Processors must absorb  the  increase  in  the price objective  in  order to make the 49-cent-a-pound pay ment to the growers. However, the elim ination of the excise tax of 53 cents a  pound would negate the increase in price  objective. Therefore, processors appear  to suffer no financial loss or gain in H.R.  14747.  Consumers.-Because  the processor's  total price is negligible, consumers would  1 It ls my feeling that the elimination of  the excise  tax should not be  replaced by  passing on the increase in the price objec tive. Although this will not increase the cost  to processors or consumers, the elimination  of the excise tax should have resulted in a  decrease in the cost to processors and con sumers.  ",1974
211,Senate,93,0.283,1135,13,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President,  today  chaired a Public Works Committee hear ing to consider the design of the exten sion to the Dirksen Senate Office Build ing. Members of the Public Works Com mittee and the Senate Office Building  Commission heard architects, architec tural  critics  and  a  representative  of  Capitol Hill residents discuss the build ing and its setting. The hearing was val uable and the  testimony reassuring in  that there appears to be general agreement that the overall design 1s commend able.  As part of  the presentation by  the  Architect of the Capitol, scale models of  the proposal and numerous sketches and  diagrams were  displayed  around  the  Public Works Committee hearing room.  These representations were both helpful  and interesting and will remain on dis play through the end of next week. After  that time they will be available in the  office of the Architect of the Capitol, Mr.  George M. White, who will be glad to re view the plans with any Members.  Fifty senatorial offices will be housed  in the new building, so a significant por tion of the Members of this body will  have intimate contact with the extension.  I urge every Senator to stop by the  hearing room, room 4200, to assess the  design for himself.  THE SAM-D, 1 YEAR LATER  ",1974

215,House,93,-0.4,1265,13,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in opposition to the Gunter amendment.  While I am certain of the good inten tions of our colleague. I do not feel that  the amendment is in the best domestic or  foreign policy  interests of  the United  States.  The country is experiencing a serious  energy problem. And  the consumer  is  faced with  substantial  fuel  price  in creases. Steps must, indeed, be taken to  alleviate  these problems, and  to make  certain that our energy needs are met at  a cost we can afford.  But the energy problem is worldwide  in scope-and the solution must be de termined not by punitive  actions de signed to attack part of the problem, but  by action designed to solve the problem  in its entirety.  In  testimony before  the House For eign Affairs Committee yesterday, sec retary of State Kissinger agreed, in re sponse to my questioning, that the so lution to the U.S. energy problem-and  the related problems of oil pricing-can not and should not be dealt with on a bi lateral basis but should instead be con sidered in the context of the World En ergy Conference where producing and  consuming nations can work together to  develop a supply and price structure mu tually beneficial to all.  The wisdom of taking punitive action  against Venezuela is further questioned  when we examine the statements of our  own Federal Energy Office which has  stated that the increased supply of oil  from Venezuela during the last quarter  of 1973 when oil supplies to the United  States were being drastically reduced or  cut back by other suppliers played a key  role  in reducing the impact of the oil  shortage in the United States. Venezuela  supplied 27 percent of our entire oil im ports during 1973 and has proved itself  to be our most dependable and important  source of foreign oil.  To penalize our most dependable sup plier because it has raised the price of  its oil exports to the current world rate  would not only jeopardize a significant  source of U.S. supplies, but undoubtedly  be regarded by that country as an un justified  and  discriminatory  act.  would not, however, have  the desired  effect of forcing an oil price  rollback.  Mr. Chairman, for these reasons, and  for those outlined in the following letter  which I would like to be included in the  RECORD, I urge our colleagues to defeat  the pending amendment.  It  DEAR COLLEAGUE: During consideration of  the  Sugar Act  scheduled  for  tomorrow,  Wednesday, June 5, an amendment will be  offered which would  eliminate any  sugar  quota for Venezuela, as a punitive response  to  that nation's oil pricing policies. This  amendment  is completely contrary  to  the  best domestic and  foreign policy  ili terests  of the United States and  therefore should  be defeated resoundingly by the House, as it  was by the Agriculture Committee.  During  the  last quarter of  1973, when  CXX--1125-Part 13  most oil producing nations were either cut ting back or completely cutting off oil ship ments to the United States, Venezuela in creased oil exports to the U.S. by 40 % . Ac cording to the Federal Energy Office, this in creased supply of Venezuelan oil played a  key role in reducing the impact of the oil  shortage in the U.S. For the entire year of  1973 Venezuela supplied 27 % of our entire  oil imports. Thus, Venezuela has shown it self to be our most dependable and important  source of foreign oil.  It should be clear  that this amendment  could not possibly constitute a constructive  step  towards  alleviating  the  energy price  crunch. It is inconceivable that the minor  economic sanction proposed would result in  an oil price rollback:  The price of Venezuelan crude is presently  in parity with the worldwide petroleum price  structure;  A unilateral rollback by Venezuela would  not alter the world price structure; and  Venezuela's sugar sales  to  the U.S.  rep resent only a fraction of 1 % of total U.S. Venezuelan trade.  However, while passage of the amendment  would be economically insignificant to Vene zuela, it would no doubt serve  to create a  major political irritant to our relations with  one of South America's most stable and dem ocratic nations:  In 1973 Venezuela purchased over $1 bil lion worth of American goods;  A major purchaser of U.S. wheat and soy beans, Venezuela has had to pay huge price  increases  in  these  commodities  in  recent  years. As a result, Venezuela at the close of  1973 maintained a balance of payments defi cit with the U.S.;  Venezuela ranks first in Latin America and  sixth in the world in direct U.S. investment,  approximately $2.7 billion book value or 3%  of worldwide U.S. total; and  While Venezuela has in recent years pur sued nationalistic policies with regard to eco nomic issues, it has done so in a responsible  and businesslike fashion.  To punish Venezuela for selling oil at the  same price as all other oil exporting nations  would rightly be regarded by that nation as  a highly discriminatory, unfriendly and un justified act.  A unilateral slap in the face of a friendly  nation because it chooses to sell most of its  oil to the United States is a narrow and re strictive response to an extremely broad and  complex foreign policy  issue. Enactment of  this amendment would only serve to create  concern among all other U.S.  trading part ners.  Sincerely,  PETER H.B. FRELINGHUYSEN, M.C.  SILVIO 0. CONTE, M.C.  VERNON W. THOMSON, M.C.

216,House,93,0.233,1265,13,Mr. WHITEHURST.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of the amendment offered  by  the gentleman from Florida which  would  suspend  the Venezuelan  sugar  quota until such time as Venezuela ter minates its punitive oil pricing policies  with respect to the United States. I be lieve it is time that the Congress clearly  demonstrates to Venezuela and the other  members of the Organization of Petro leum Exporting Countries that it does  not intend to passively accept the rapidly  escalating costs which are being forced  upon the American public by the oil ex porting nations.  There can be no doubt that the average  American consumer is feeling the severe  effects of the high price of Venezuelan  oil. This is particularly true of the mil lions of citizens living on the east coast,  In my own State of Virginia, the impact  of Venezuela's oil policy over the past  year is dramatically highlighted by the  enormous increase in the cost of electric  power.  In July 1973,  the Virginia Electric  Power Co. assessed its average customer.  with a  surcharge of 25  cents on his  monthly bill due to increased oil costs. In  this month of June 1974, that same cus tomer will be required to pay an adjust ment on his monthly bill of $3.59 due to  the increased cost of oil. Thus, the Vepco  oil adjustment charge has been increased  by a staggering 1,300 percent in less than  1 year, and as a result the typical Vepco  customer is now paying $3.34 more each  month solely on account of higher oil  costs over the past year. Since fully 85  percent of  the oil consumed by Vepco  is imported from Venezuela,  it is clear  that the major responsibility for the high  cost of electricity for Virginians lies with  the oil pricing policies of Venezuela.  To demonstrate the effects of Venezu elan policy in another way, I shall cite  internal policies of the 32 nations which  of oH per barrel paid by Vepco during  the past 1 % years. In January 1973, the  price paid by Vepco was $2.94 per barrel,  and this increased to $3.26 per barrel in  July 1973. In January 1974, there was a  sharp rise to $7.77, and the current price  is $10.09 per barrel.  Obviously, an increase in utility rates  is but one of the many ways in which  our citizens are required to sacrifice  to  pay the ransom of high oil costs to Ven ezuela and the other oil exPorting na tions. It is also clear that Virginians are  not the only citizens affected by the Ven ezuelan pricing policies. As other Mem bers of the House have pointed out, mil lions of consumers are now being ad versely affected as a direct result of the  high cost of imported Venezuelan oil. I  would feel remiss in my duty to my con stituents and  to  the American people  generally if I did not speak out against  this economic blackmail being practiced  by the Venezuelans, and to attempt to  obtain at least some rollback in the price  of imported oil.  I recognize that there is an argument  made by some of my colleagues  that  adoption of the amendment now before  us would alienate  the Venezuelans  to  such an extent that they would be likely  to cut us off from future oil imports. In  my judgment, the Venezuelans need the  American market to insure a long term  profitable domestic oil  industry. They  also need our agricultural products and  technology to develop their na.tural re sources. In addition,  the sanction pro vided for in this amendment is a rela tively mild one, and is not likely to en gender such an extreme response from  Venezuela. The Venezuelans, after all  did  not  even  fill  their U.S.  sugar  quota last year due to the higher prices  available on the world market. But even  if Venezuela threatened to cut off our oil  supply, it would be most unfortunate if  that type of action constrained the Mem bers of this body from expressing their  displeasure with  the Venezuelan  oil  policy. The current government in Ven ezuela has made plain its intention to  squeeze every possible dollar from the  American consumer, and I believe it is  ",1974
217,House,93,-0.354,1278,13,Mr. FOLEY.,"  The committee, after a very careful  and very detailed effort, has brought  forth a bill that among other things sig nificantly  liberalizes  the benefits  that  sugar workers  receive wider  this act.  Let me remind the Members of this  body that the Sugar Act awards unique  and special benefits to sugar workers be yond the range of basic farm labor leg islation. Minimum wages  are  higher  under the present act and will be higher  still under this bill. And as we prepared  this legislation, we agreed to six specific  new benefits to sugar workers. These are:  First. Wage rate hearings would be  conducted  by  an  administrative  law  judge, rather than the Sugar Division of  ASCS of USDA with final determination  by the Secretary subject to judicial re view;  Second. The resolution of disputes be tween workers and growers would be  made by attorneys from the Office of the  General Cowisel of USDA with an appeal  procedure through the judicial officer of  USDA to U.S. district court;  Third. The criteria used under present  law  to establish wage  rates would be  specifically set forth  in the Sugar Act  and  the criterion ""sporadic and sea sonal nature of  the work"" would be  added;  Fourth. A prohibition against retalia tion by employers against sugar workers  for filing wage-related complaints would  be added;  Fifth. A prohibition against charging  sugarworkers  more  than  reasonable  costs for  items or services customarily  furnished  to workers engaged  in pro ducing sugar would be included; and  Sixth. The wage claim, retaliation, and  reasonable cost provisions would be en forced by withholding or forfeiture of  payments. Private double damage civil  suits would also be authorized for wage  claims to the extent not recovered from  withheld payments.  All six of these changes were made to  improve the treatment of farmworkers  while still trying to keep sugar producers  in the business of growing sugar.  I keep repeating this theme, but it is  worth repeating. Supply is the key to this  legislation. Without domestic producers,  we will not have the increased supply  that is needed in the years ahead.  Each of the gentleman's amendments  was considered. Each should be rejected  now.  ",1974

Mr. Chairman, this is the most crucial  vote of all we will have had today. I urge  my  colleagues  to  vote  against  both  amendments now pending.  Much has been said about  the high  price of sugar in the United States be cause of the Sugar Act, but I have some  very interesting figures here which will  show  that the Sugar Act has  in fact  worked to keep  the price down for the  consumers of America.  Over the most recent 8 years for which  figures are available, from 1965 through  1972, the U.S. retail price of sugar aver aged 12.56 cents per pound, whereas the  world price of sugar averaged 12.85 cents  per pound. In other words, because of  the Sugar Act, the American consumer  paid less for sugar in the United States  than consumers  throughout the world  have paid.  The hullaballoo about the Sugar Act  being responsible  for  the high cost of  sugar to the American consumer is cer tainly not borne out by the actual fig ures.  The statistics indicate the American  consumer has enjoyed a much better  price than those consumers who are in  areas without a Sugar Act. For example,  in 1972 while we paid a retail price of  13.9 cents in the United States, the con sumers in Japan paid 22.2 cents; in West  Germany, they paid 15.4 cents; in Can ada, right across the border, they paid  15.7 cents; and in the Netherlands they  paid 15.4 cents.  In all of  these developed countries  where they do not enjoy a sugar pro gram the consumer has paid much more  than the consumer has paid here in the  United States.  So I urge a ""no"" vote on both the sub stitute amendment offered by the gen tleman  from Michigan  (Mr. DINGELL)  and the amendment of  the gentleman  from New York (Mr. PEYSER).  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment offered by the gentle man from Michigan (Mr. DINGELL) as a  substitute to the amendment offered by  the gentleman  from New York  (Mr.  PEYSER).

223,House,93,-0.292,1304,13,Mr. CLARK.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to submit  the  following statement by  John A. Creedy, president, Water Trans port Association, in today's RECORD:  THE IMPERATIVES OF PRODUCTIVITY  IMPROVEMENT  (By John A. Creedy)  A little over two years ago, the water car riers urged that priority attention should be  given to understanding how improved pro ductivity  is achieved  in  transportation. It  has been a curiously neglected subject, de spite its obvious importance for the pricing  of transportation.  The water carriers have a useful story to  tell. In the 1960's they achieved a decade  of declining average revenue per ton mile,  despite rising inflation and rising costs. Gen erally, the same story can be developed for  the Great Lakes ore carriers, the coastwlse  and lntercoastal container operators and the  inland barge carriers. The downward curve  has now turned upward under the pressure  of rising costs and inflation, but it has not  turned up nearly as sharply as other ele ments in the economy.  Let us begin by agreeing that when we  discuss productivity we are  talking about  the efilcient use of all resources, capital as  well as labor.  For a homely illustration, let us consider  the productivity of 50 men with  shovels  digging a ditch. It may be possible to work  the 50 men harder, give them bigger shovels  or provide them with some sort of incentive  to  improve  their production. But we can  readily  see  that  improvement  in produc tivity for them would, under normal circum stances, be limited.  Invest  in a bulldozer, however, and one  man may be able to do the work of 50 men  at much less cost. Make a  large capital in vestment. Give the worker a far more pro ductive  tool than a  shovel. Output  ls up,  cost is down.  It is probably a sound generalization that  in water  transportation and also  in other  modes of transportation, we are not looking  for advances in science to promote improved,  productivity. Practically everything we need  is on the shelf waiting to be purchased. It  takes no breakthrough in technology to build  a Great Lakes self-unloader which requires  one-third less crew than its predecessor, but  which carries twice as much cargo and unloads it on the bank at 10,000 tons an hour  compared to 3,000  tons. The technology to  do that is in hand. We have built container  vessels capable of 33 knots to replace those  which can only operate at 15 knots. We have  built  river  towboats of 10,000 horsepower  to replace  those of 5,000 or  less. The new  boats are capable of pushing a very much  larger load than the old.  There  is no  technical bar  to  installing  automated classification yards for railroads,  or  improving  track  so  that  it will  take  heavier  trains at  faster  spe~d~. Practical  methods for control of utilization of freight  cars exist.  The problem  is not that improved  tech nology doesn't exist. It exists all right. Nor is  it that heavy  investment hasn't gone  into  buying  improvement  in  technology  in  the  past. The problem ls that for large segments  of transportation the cycle of earnings lead ing  to  investment  in  improved  technology,  leading  to better earnings,  leading  to st111  more investment in further improvements in  efficiency has been interrupted.  I sometimes think it would be very useful  if the salesmen who have the job of selling  their  improved and more efilcient products  to  transportation companies could change  places every six months with the trafilc man ager of their own companies whose job it is  to keep freight rates from rising. The money  isn't there to buy improved efficiency and if  the salesmen saw  this,  there might be  a  breakthrough  of  understanding  on  the  freight rate side.  The consequences of this interruption in  the cycle for the shipper are severe. Without  earnings sufficient to support heavy invest ment  in  improved  technology  and better  ways of doing things, a large segment of the  transport industry is in a  lockstep of rising  costs which cannot be offset by  improved  efficiency.  Until the regulatory agencies and the ship per focus their attention on doing something  constructive about this earnings-investment  cycle, large segments of transportation are in  for a period of rising freight rates and de teriorating service.  We need to mount a comprehensive educa tion program on the function of profit in the  profit system. Regulators and shippers do not  seem to understand what  the function of  profit is or, if we want to be charitable about  it, have forgotten. Anyone who imagines that  some alternative to the profit system, such  as government ownership, can produce efil ciences in transportation is flying in the face  of all the evidence. The regulators and the  shippers have combined to sit far too heavily  on profits  in transportation. They have so  fundamentally undermined the profit system  that efilciency has been seriously affected.  Any business operates as an equation. On  the one hand are needed revenues and earn ings and on the other hand ls the supply of  service. If the earnings and revenues are in adequate, the supply of service falls off. Solv ing that equation equitably for both carriers  and shippers is the outstanding challenge of  this decade.  As  a  contribution  to an education pro gram on the function of profit, we have de veloped some information on how it was pos sible for the barge industry's rates to decline  for almost a decade despite rising costs of  labor and materials. A similar showing could  be made for our Great Lakes members and  the ocean container operators.  We have used as an example one of the  leading barge companies operating on  the  Mississippi-Ohio river system. This ls a well managed, progressive company which has a  cargo consist typical of the major carriers. It  competes vigorously all over  the river sys tem.  We have taken information on trends in  capital input, wages, costs of barges, average  revenue per cargo ton mile,  the consumer  price  index, cargo ton miles per boat day  and cargo ton miles per man day as useful  measures  to describe changes  in efficiency.  Our first measure  shows  the history of  capital investment per crew person from 1945  through 1972, with 1945 as 100 percent.  From 1945 to 1958 the trend of increase  was relatively modest compared to the later  period. Wages per day rose at a faster rate  than  investment. Revenue per  cargo  ton  mile  rose slightly less  than the consumer  price index, but it increased. By the year 1958  cargo  revenues per  ton mile were  stable,  neither increasing nor decreasing.  Now in 1958 a sharp change takes place.  Capital  investment per  crew person had  tripled between 1945 and 1958, but in the  next 12 years,  from  a much  larger base,  capital  investment nearly quadrupled per  crew person.  The effect on the revenue per cargo ton  mile was drama tic.  Revenues per ton mile declined until by  1968 the average revenue per cargo ton mile  was actually below the 1945 level. Since then,  of course, rates have been forced up by in fiation and cost  increases, but by the end  of 1972, whereas the consumer price index  had doubled, average revenue per cargo ton  mile had  increased only 30 per cent over  1945.  What did the heavy investment buy? First  there was a switch from 500 ton barges to  barges capable of carrying 1,200 tons or more,  greater capacity per unit. Second, there was  a major breakthrough in horsepower per boat  from 2,500 to a range of 6,000 to 9,000 horse power. This made possible a dramatic  in crease in the size of tows from 15,000 tons  per tow to tows ranging upward of 40,000  tons.  But  the heavy  investment bought more  than economies of scale resulting from larger  barges and larger tows. It bought more re liable marine engines permitting fewer crew  members, better communications  systems,  better control of utilization of barges, better  training of crews and more efilcient opera tion of boats. In short, it bought all those  things an efil.cient, alert and skllled man agement can develop when the income flow  ls sufilcient.  In the period from the end of World War II  until 1958, cargo ton miles per boat day rose  from 321,000 to 686,000, about double. Barge  rates were  rising slowly,  lagging  the con sumer price  index. Between 1958 and 1972  cargo ton miles per boat day rose from 686,000  to 1,800,000, nearly  triple. A more ex pensive boat, but more powerful and with a  smaller crew was doing three times the work  of the 1958 boat.  Similarly, from the end of World War II  to 1958 cargo ton miles per man day rose  from 16,000 to 32,000, about double. But from  1958 to 1972, cargo ton miles per man day  rose  from  32.000  to  141,000, more  than  quadruple.  Wages of course rose during the period.  Cost per ton of capacity  is an interesting  measure. It has more  than doubled since  1958. Other costs also increased substantially  during the period but it is interesting that  these cost increases were more than offset by  increases in productivity until 1968 when the  average  revenue per cargo  ton mile was  forced upward.  Future productivity increases will be pur chased with much heavier investment than  in the past. In 1972 there appeared to be a  downturn  in the thirty-year trend of pro ductivity improvement. Whether this will re verse itself in response to heavy investment  remains to be seen. Certainly, if income falls  ",1974
224,,93,-0.291,1317,13,Mrs. GRASSO.," Mr. Speaker, this year  marks the 125-th anniversary of Central  Connecticut State College, which is lo cated in New Britain, Conn., a town in  my Sixth Congressional District.  It was in May 1849, that the Connecti cut General Assembly acted  to create  and to fund Central, then known as the  State Normal School. This was Connecti cut's first public  institution of higher  education. Years  later  the school was  known as the Teachers' College of Con necticut, and eventually it was given its  current name.  This great anniversary is truly an im portant milestone in the history of an  institution that has contributed much to  the education and welfare of people in  Connecticut and our Nation. It is indeed  an honor to be associated with this fine  college and to represent the people of  New Britain-the city whose  citizens  made Central's very existence possible.  Through  the generosity of 100 citi zens in New Britain, $16,250 was raised  in 1849 for the establishment of a semi nary  educate  students  and  train  teachers. Their efforts won New Britain  the right to be the location of Central the State's first normal school and the  Nation's sixth public college. Since that  time the people of New Britain have lent  generous support to the college.  From a  single building, one acre of  land, an operating budget of some $13,000, and a graduating class of five, Cen tral has grown to its present size with  a  community  that encompasses 80,000  people,  including 13,000 students. Just  last Friday, 2,332 students graduated at  the college's 1974 commencement.  From the days of the nondegree nor mal school until the present, Central has  grown to a full and diversified multipur pose educational center. Ideas, culture,  innovation,  and  enthusiasm  emanate  from  the Central campus  the sur rounding community.  Offering day and evening classes for  both undergraduate and graduate stu dents, the college includes schools of arts  and sciences, education and professional  studies, business, and graduate studies.  Always striving to better serve our State,  the college now offers a wide variety of  career-oriented programs ranging from  cybernetics to printing.  F. Don James, president of the college,  looks ahead with continuing dedication  to serving the needs of the State through  improved  educational  offerings.  He  stated:  As we reflect on the past we find one con sideration coming to the fore-the on-going  CXX--1129-Part 13  to  to  commitment of  the college  to serve both  the students and the welfare of the state  itself-a commitment made possible since  the earliest days by the support of the citi zens of New Britain. This commitment con tinues today and will even intensify in the  years to come.  to  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this  opportunity  congratulate  the new  graduates of Central and to join them  and all others who know and love this  college in celebrating a splendid anni versary.  ELDERLY TRANSPORTATION  AMENDMENT  HON. RICHARD S. SCHWEIKER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES  Wednesday, June 5, 1974  ",1974
225,,93,0.029,1317,13,Mr. SCHWEIKER.," Mr. President, to day the Labor and Public Welfare Com mittee, meeting in executive session, ac cepted my amendment  to provide $35  million  for  supportive  transportation  services for the elderly during fiscal year  1975 as an amendment  to H.R. 11105,  which extends the elderly nutrition pro gram, title VII of the Older Americans  Act, for the next 3 years.  Specifically, my amendment will help  correct one of the greatest obstacles fac ing elderly feeding programs today-the  lack of adequate transportation facilities  for participants to reach local feeding  programs.  Mr. President,  these  funds are ear marked to give priority to those feeding  programs in areas where there is no pub lic transportation or where existing pub lic transportation is inadequate to meet  the special needs of older persons. By  taking this approach, not only will the  rural areas, which are without functional  mass transit, be eligible, but also those  suburban and urban areas where trans portation is lacking or unsuitable for the  elderly.  The Senate Select Committee on Nutri tion and Human Needs, on which I serve,  has held field hearings on elderly nutri tion programs, and one of the most fre quently discussed faults of the program  is  the  lack of  transportation for  the  elderly. Currently, for every dollar spent  on transportation, one dollar less is spent  on food. My amendment provides funds  which are separate from the feeding pro gram, but which are to be used in support  of that program, thus eliminating some  of  the supportive costs which must be  covered now by needed food moneys.  I  commend my  distinguished  col leagues, Senators McGoVERN, BURDICK,  CASE, CLARK, DOLE, HUGHES, MANSFIELD,  METCALF, MONDALE, and YOUNG for their  strong support of this amendment.  H.R. 11105 will be considered by the  full Senate hopefully in the near future,  and I urge all my colleagues to support  this very necessary legislation.  WOMEN IN SPORTS  HON. PATSY T.

It ought to be clear to all Members of  the House  that reform by any other  name is not necessarily reform.  There is contained within the recom mendations of the Bolling-Martin com mittee a number of substantive issues on  which I hope the House will have an op portunity to vote favorably. However, I  want to make it clear that those beguil ing, deceptively simple ideas contained  in what is reported in the Washington  Post are not acceptable and are not  reform.  The House needs to take action;  the  House needs to have a chance to work  its will on House Resolution 988, and I  hope  the Democratic caucus will  face  up  to  its  responsibility and give  the  House that opportunity.

230,House,93,0.304,29,18,Mr. PRICE of Texas.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman,  the committee, after  1 week of hearings and after 2 addi tional days of hearings and a day of  markup in  the Subcommittee on Live stock  and Feed Grain, approved  the  language that is presently .in the bill,  section 2, which  reads:  I  The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized  and directed to estaJblish a guaranteed loan  program for eligible persons including opera tors of feedlots, who are directly and in good  faith engaged in agricultural production for  the purpose of breeding, raising, fattening,  or marketing llvestock. For purposes of this  Act,  the  term ""livestock"" shall mean beef  cattle, dairy cattleAnd so forth.  Mr. Chairman, I can sympathize with  the author of this amendment, the gen tleman from Iowa (Mr. MAYNE), and it  probably fits his area of the country. But  he, too, has feedlot operators in his part  of the country that feed 40 percent of  the cattle  that are fed  in  the United  States.  In my own district we feed, as I  said  before, over 5 million head of cattle, and  the people who operate  these feedlots  are people who feed 100, 200, or 300 head  of cattle.  If this language is adopted, it is going  to take away from those who have in vested millions of dollars in feedlot op erations. It is going to knock them com pletely out of their customers who are  concentrating these cattle and trying to  provide that beef to the American con sumer at the best price possible, because  a feedlot operator can buy feed in volume.  He can bring all of these cattle together  with his feed mill equipment and ma chinery and he can feed  those cattle  much cheaper and provide the consumer  a  product much  cheaper  than  if he  strictly relies on the person who owns  his own farm and farms com and other  things of that nature. To limit this just  to what  is considered  the family-type  farm simply will not meet the needs of  the American consumers in this country.  This morning as a member of the com mittee who was  in the committee and  stepped out for a phone call, and this was  brought up before the committee, with  about 10 members there. There was no  objection heard to that amendment, and  therefore it was said that the consensus  of the committee was for this amend ment.  That is not so at all, Mr. Chairman,  I urge the def eat of this amendment.  Mr. ZW ACH. Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the requisite number of words, and  rise in strong support of the amend ment.  Mr. Chairman, while I believe this is  basically a good bill,  it is defective in  one respect. It needs the Mayne amend ment.  In the Livestock and Grains Subcom mittee which developed this legislation,  we had a debate as to the scope of the  bill's coverage. The way it came out of  the subcommittee, the bill extends guar anteed loan benefits to any ""person di rectly and  in good  faith"" engaged  in  livestock production.  I feel this language is much too broad.  Since  the term ""person""  includes cor porate entities, the bill could bring credit  benefits to companies that are not pri marily engaged in livestock production.  For example, a packer-feeder could qual ify for a guaranteed loan under this bill.  This is true because such a packer is di rectly engaged  in  livestock production  even though that company is primarily  engaged in the processing and marketing  of meat.  Another credit beneficiary of the bill  as written could be a Chicago dentist  who has invested in a custom feedlot.  Again such a person would be directly  engaged in the production of livestock,  and if he met the other requirements of  the bill, could qualify for a $350,000 guar anteed loan.  Now, Mr. Chairman, I have nothing  against packer-feeders or Chicago den tists, but I believe this legislation should  be concentrated on bona fide  farmers  and ranchers. These are the people who  I  ",1974

233,House,93,-0.429,55,18,Mr. PRICE of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  on July 12, 1974,  the Atomic Energy  Commission  forwarded  to  the  Joint  Committee on Atomic Energy, pursuant  to section 123c. of  the Atomic Energy  Act of 1954,  as amended, a proposed  amendment to the Agreement for Coop eration with the Hellenic Republic. The  agreement will  become  effective  only  when it has lain before the Joint Com mittee for 30 days, not including periods  during which the Congress is in recess  for more than 3 days. The 30-day period  for  the proposed agreement with  the  Hellenic Republic will expire on August  13, 1974.  The new agreement provides for the  following changes, among others:  First, the section dealing with provi sion of uranium enrichment services no  longer  constitutes  an  assurance  that  such  services will  be  provided. The  agreement instead represents an enab ling document to allow contracting for  such services up to a maximum amount,  subject to capacity.  Second,  the  agreement  now  allows  transfer to the Hellenic Republic of spe cial nuclear material other than U-235,  such as U-233 or plutonium.  Third,  the ceiling on distribution  is  now expressed in terms of the amount  necessary to fuel power reactors with a  total electric capacity of up  to 3,000  megawatts. This is equivalent to a~out  60,000 kilograms of U-235. The previous  ceiling was 6 kilograms for research pur poses.  Fourth, the term of the agreement is  extended to the year 2014.  It should be noted that this amend ment is of the type which would under go strengthened congressional review un der the provisions of the joint commit tee's bill, H.R. 15582, when that bill is  enacted into law.  I would also like to point out that the  agreement will continue  to be subject  IAEA  safeguards, pursuant  the  Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nu clear Weapons.  Without objection, I would like to en ter into the RECORD a copy of the AEC  letter transmitting the agreement. The  letter describes the changes in more de tail.

234,House,93,0.793,68,18,Mr. LANDGREBE.," But  there have  been a number of Members of the Con gress who have expressed great concern  over amnesty, and yet those very same  people would never consider, and they  are certainly not on  the  floor  today,  sharing  in  this Special Order as we  probe and try to generate a continuing  interest in the fate of these men who  went to war, willingly or not, they an swered their country's call. Certainly this  Congress has  got  a  responsibility  to  those people.  ",1974
235,House,93,0.017,68,18,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker, I  certainly would like to express my thanks  to  the gentleman  from Michigan  for  taking this Special Order, and I would  like to compliment the gentleman on the  very strong statement he just made.  I might say, Mr. Speaker, that as soon  as I got to Saigon and met with those  Americans who are on this joint com mission,  that  they commented on  the  Huber resolution and how it had a great  P,ffect on  the Vietcong and  the North  Vietnamese  that  this Congress,  this  House of Representatives, would pass  such a strong resolution speaking up for  the MIAs and those Americans killed in  action, and that it passed without a sin gle dissenting vote. This had quite an  effect on them.  I think the gentleman from Michigan  should be commended again, as I have  done in private .and as I do in public to day, for his leadership on this resolution.  The gentleman touched on a subject  today, and although I know that the hour  is late, I feel that certainly there should  be some comments made on it. It con cerns what the New York Times pointed  out about the bounty hunters, and also  that CBS had something  in the news  several weeks ago about the people from  this country and people  in other coun tries going out and in effect looking for  remains.  I  talked  to many people  in Saigon  about this situation. I did not classify  these Americans and the people that I  talked  to as bounty hunters-I found  them to be sincere in trying  to go  to  these locations to recover remains. They  did need some expense money to do this.  South Vietnamese have to be paid when  they take off from their jobs and take  their vehicles  into  these areas. Other  than expenses I found no evidence where  our Government had been asked  for  large amounts of money.  However, I am concerned that there  are some organizations,  I am  told,  in  'this country, that are getting funds to  'have groups go  into different parts of  South Vietnam and Laos and try to find  some remains. I would think this would  be a mistake. We have very fine people  in the Joint Casualty Resolution Center  in Thailand, waiting  to get into  these  areas when permitted to do so. But I am  concerned about a few of these amateurs  'going into these areas for fear that they  will come out with unidentifiable  re mains. They will not come out with the  needed identification; they will not come  out with the proper evidence  that we  need  to  identify  these  remains or  to  'identify the plane.  It is a skill that has advanced in the  last few years. These people can be iden tified. In fact, we went to the American  laboratory in Thailand and saw where  they work on  identification. They use  photographs and pictures, and if these  experts can get any evidence, they can  put it together and come up with an  identification.  So I would hope that groups trying to  do good would be very, very careful about  going to Southeast Asia and looking for  remains.  In  fact,  I  think  they would  probably do more harm than good.  We have started a program in South east Asia, that centers around this cal endar  I  am holding. The calendar  is  done in the South Vietnamese language,  and these calendars have been spread all  over South Vietnam. It is given to the  farmers and villagers and it states that if  they know of any aircraft crash sites,  notify the American authorities and we  will send  identification teams  into the  areas. It is working. Frcm reports re ceived,  they have found a number of  bodies  in the last few months. By ""a  number,"" I would say 15 to 20. We have  this program going on now in Southeast  Asia.  I hope that we would continue to let  the American authorities work with the  South Vietnamese in trying  to recover  these bodies.  Moving to another subject, I think it  should be pointed out that there  is a  coalition government now in Laos made  up of Pathet Lao and Royal Laotian  Government officials.  I  think it has a  :fighting chance to make it if the North  Vietnamese will leave them alone.  There is a problem, however,  that I  want  to point out here  today. I have  checked this with the U.S. aid officials  in Laos. Since our Government recog nizes the new coalition govemme~t, all  parties connected with the Laotian Coali tion Government are eligible for U.S. aid.  I  talked  to Ambassador Whitehouse  about this. He was very cooperative, and  he agreed with me  fully  that no aid  should go into the Pathet Lao or Com munist areas until we have had a com plete accounting of the MIA's and until  we have been able to send these identifi cation teams into the Communist terri tories to find out what happened to our  Americans.  I only point  this out  to strengthen  Ambassador Whitehouse's position, and  the position of the gentleman's resolu tion, that certainly we should not give  foreign aid by building hospitals and  building roads in Communist territories  when we cannot even go  in and bring  home our dead. I wanted to point this out,  because this would be going completely  contrary  to  the gentleman's resolution  and the feeling of the Members of this  House, and the feeling, I am sure, of the  Senate and of this administration.  In closing, I should like to say that I  had complete cooperation from the Pen tagon.  I had the opportunity  to have  Capt. Jim Kneale, a Navy captain, go  with me as my escort officer. Captain  Kneale was most helpful throughout the  trip.  I  thank the Defense Department  for sending this capable officer with me.  The American Ambassadors  that  I  visited were very cooperative. The Amer ican military was most helpful and I got  an honest picture from the Americans.  It was  all above board and nothing  whatsoever under the table. They laid it  out and gave me whatever information I  wanted. They worked with me in meeting  with the Communist officials. I do feel  that I have brought back some type of  updated factual report on the sad and  frustrating situation in Southeast Asia.  I thank the gentleman from Michigan  for yielding.  ",1974
236,House,93,0.416,68,18,Mr. MILLER.," Mr. Speaker, I welcome  this opportunity to join with my House  colleagues in this special order concern ing the American servicemen listed as  missing in action in Southeast Asia. I see  this as occasion for the U.S. Congress to  again underscore its firm commitment to  direct our Armed Forces to fully investi gate the circumstances surrounding each  and every case of the MIA's, and make all  information tied to such investigations  known  to  the  families of  these brave  men.  In his colleague letter to the Members  of the House, my good friend, Represent ative SONNY MONTGOMERY  advised us  that  the North Vietnamese  read  the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD and absorb every  word printed in it regarding the situ ation in Southeast Asia.  I am glad to  know  that.  I am especially pleased  to  know  that  the Communists digest our  words relating to the search for the miss ing in action.

238,Senate,93,-0.311,159,18,Mr. TUNNEY.," Mr. President, on June  20 of this year, I  introduced S. 3680, a  bill to correct a massive tax injustice to  thousands of recent college graduates.  Under the terms of my bil:, the portion  of student loans forgiven because certain  loan conditions were met after gradua tion may not be deemed taxable income,  either now, retroactively or in the future.  I recently received a  letter from Mr.  John Crowly, the associate executive sec retary of  the Association of American  Universities, an organization represent ing some of the most prentigious univer sities in the Nation. Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent  that Mr. Crowly's  letter, the list of universities represented  by the Association of American Universi ties and the text of S. 3680 be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  ASSOCIATION OF  AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES,  Washington, D.C., July 1, 1974.  Senator JOHN V. TuNNEY,  New Senate Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR SENATOR TUNNEY: The Association of  American Universities  (list attached)  sup ports your efforts to remedy the inequitable  imposition by the Internal Revenue Service  of taxes, both retroactively and prospectively,  on student education  loans which  incor porate forgiveness provisions. The provisions  of S. 3860, as introduced by you on June 20,  would greatly assist students who hold Na tional Direct Loans, National Defense Loans,  Health Professions Loans, State Teaching  Loans, State Medical Education Loans and  Law Enforcement Education Loans. Students  who have participated in these programs in  recent years would be protected against the  sudden and, we feel, unwarranted assessment  of back taxes and interest on the forgive ness provision of their education loans, while  other students, who participated  in  these  programs in an earlier period covered by the  Statute of Limitations, will not be so taxed.  The 1973 IRS ruling defining the loan for giveness provision as taxable income imposes  an  inequitable burden and financial hard ship on many students who properly as sumed that these loans were being forgiven  in  the national  interest. A retroactive  tax  imposes  unexpected  financial burdens on  many students and arbitrarily discriminates  against individuals whose loans would have  been forgiven within the 3-year limit of the  Statute of Limitations.  The intent of  the Congress in providing  forgiveness of these loans, insofar as we are  able to determine it, was to provide incen tives to students to enter fields of particular  social need. In exchange for  their services  over a period of years the Congress provided  a forgiveness of their loans. However, it may  well be that circumstances have sufficiently  changed to warrant a reconsideration of the  national need for such student manpower  incentives. We would  respectfully suggest,  however, that such fundamental amendments  to the authorizing legislation should prop",1974

240,Senate,93,0.641,263,18,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President, in  view of the fact that labor, by the action  just taken, has been exempted from any  investigation by  the Consumer Protec tion Agency, would  this situation now  hold: Let us say that a consumer bought  an article from a store, and the consumer  was unhappy with what he bought be cause the article was inferior, there was  something wrong  in  its manufacture.  There is no way that the Consumer Pro tection Agency now can go in and find  the fault.  I might say that the fault often lies in  labor,  particularly  in  the  automobile  field, of people who do not do  the job  correctly. In other fields we find the same  thing, men working on assembly  lines  who do not put in a full day's work or a  proper day's work, and there is no way  for  these men  to be  singled out and  punished.  So what we are doing, in effect, by ac cepting this vote without any question and this is the question I pose-the Con sumer Protection Agency will have  to  find the merchant at fault, and he can  be fined and, possibly, placed in jail, his  business can be ruined through no fault  of his own at all; would I be correct in  that assumption?

My authority for  that statement comes  from an extra  large, four column news story with a 36point head, printed Saturday, June 29,  1974, in an excellent newspaper, the Buf falo Evening News.  To me, what makes this news report so  authoratative is that it bears the byline  of Ed Kelly, the News labor reporter. An  inquiry into the background of Mr. Kelly  reveals he is one of the Nation's most  knowledgeable labor editors or reporters.

243,House,93,0.255,341,18,Mr. STEELMAN.," Mr. Speaker, so far  we have spent a great deal of time in this  committee-it seems as  though almost  all of my first term on the Committee on  Interior and  Insular Affairs has been  spent  in debating  the merits of strip  mining and what legislation will be con structive. The Members will hear during  debate,  if  this  rule  is adopted-and I  support the adoption of the rule-vari ous charges with respect to the procedure  and the merits of the legislation.  I want to say that the extreme posi tions on this subject will be the Hechler  of West Virginia bill, which seeks  to  phase out strip mining entirely, and the  Hosmer  bill, which  takes  the  other  extreme.  What we have presented in this leg islation, H.R. 11500  the committee bill,  is  legislation which will allow for coal  production along with the preservation  of the environment. I think if one were  to ask any Member of this body what he  would do, he would say we want to get  coal dug to meet our essential energy  needs, but also we want to provide for  protection of the environment. That is  what H.R. 11500 does.  Once we get to the merits of the leg islation before us, I think it will be seen  that  this  is a balanced approach and  provides  for  environmental protection  and at the same time allow for the pro duction of essential coal energy.

252,Senate,93,-0.269,497,18,Mr. MONTOYA.," Mr. President, one of  the most perceptive pieces of mail I have  received in a long time has been sent to  me by Mrs. John Nalda, the secretary of  an organization called the Canyon Cow belles, a local chapter of the New Mexico  Cowbelles Association.  Mrs. Nalda has written to me about the  concerns which ranchers have over the  controversy now raging as to the pro priety of continued grazing on BLM land.  I would like to call this letter to the  attention of my colleagues and ask unani mous consent that Mrs. Nalda's letter be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the letter  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  CORONA, N. MEX.,  M<!-Y 31, 1974.  Hon. JOSEPH M. MONTOYA,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR SENATOR MONTOYA: My husband, two  sons, and I own and operate an average size  ranch near Corona, New Mexico. We are rather  typical of most ranch people in our life-style,  traditions, and in the problems that we face  day to day. Also typical are many of my fel low Canyon Cowbelle members and  their  families. Canyon Cowbelles is a  local chap ter of the New Mexico Cowbelles Association.  Most of us are wives of ranchers who a.re  themselves members of the New Mexico Cat tle Growers Association. I have been directed  by our membership to act in my omc1a1 ca pacity of secretary of our local chapter and  write to you in regard to some matters which  are of grave concern to us.  A few days a.go we all learned through the  news media that the nation's largest maker  of  steel had announced  a  price  increase.  Knowing that steel is used in the manufac turing of automoblies, appliances, furniture,  and numerous other products, we a.re certain  that it will only be a short while before the  makers of these other products will one by  one announce their own price increase. We  will be told by these manufacturers that they  are forced  to pass on to the consumer the  increase in their production cost. Those of  us who ranch for a  living have been faced  with rises 1n production cost year after year.  Despite this fact, we have never been able  to pass on to the consumer any pa.rt of our  cost increase by announcing a higher price  on our own product. We wonder how many  consumers  can  really  appreciate  the fact  that the livestock producer has never an nounced his own price. The packer and the  supermarket name their own prices, but not  the producer. We have never been ""price set ters""; we are ""price takers"". Yet ea.ch time  we shop for the innumerable goods and items  necessary to operate our ranch and raise our  children, we must pay the ""set"" price-be it  a windmill tower, a tractor, or a toothbrush.  We have found through conversations with  people of other professions that the average  consumer today seems most concerned about  high prices, inflation, the energy crisis, and  the deplorable conduct of some of our coun try's high government officials. The rancher  shares all of these very real concerns, but be cause of the nature of his business, he  ls  equally as anxious about droughts and bliz zards;  insects and predators;  livestock dis eases which destroy a  few head or kill an  entire herd; poison weeds which also kill  parasites; ever-rising grazing fees and inter~  est  rates;  the prohibitive  costs of hiring  laborers; cattle rustling;  astronomical feed  prices; scarcity of essential goods and mate rials. As for high prices, this is not a new  problem for us. Each year the rancher has  been  faced with paying higher prices  for  most of the products essential to his opera tion. Yet, by comparison,  (and except for  last year)  the prices  received by  ranchers  for their livestock for the past twenty years  have remained the same, or have been only  slightly higher, and in some yea.rs have been  even less than twenty years a.go.  The  financial  squeeze on  livestock pro ducers right now is driving some near bank ruptcy. Cost increases in our business hit 19  per cent last year and are predicted to climb  at lea.st 14 per cent more this year. As of now,  livestock prices have collapsed. Many cattle  feeders are losing up to $200 a head. Some of  us wm suffer financial losses from which we  wilI not be able to recover, thus making it  necessary for even more families to leave the  land which  they have worked and been a  part of for generations. Small independent  farmers and ranchers cannot survive years of  huge financial  losses, and so we  find  tax subsidized conglomerates and non-agricul ture corporations buying up the lands which  we can no longer afford. And so right now,  as we  livestock producers find ourselves  in  one of the worst loss periods in history, we  also find  that we are confronted with yet  another very real problem, the consequences  of which could prove disastrous. Disastrous  not just to the producers, but to the nation  and even to the world. I am referring to the  law suit brought by the Natural Resources  Defense Council and others against the BLM  and the Secretary of the Interior. The Uti ga.tion involves livestock grazing permits on  about 140 million acres of Public Lands in  the Western United States, of which 13.6  million acres are in New Mexico.  This  law suit and  the possible harmful  effects it might have on the rancher is in fact  the reason for this letter. It is to this matter  that Canyon Cowbelles most  respectfuily  wish to direct your attention. Our members  have a great common concern for those who  use the land for raising livestock. Most of us  who a.re Cowbelles live on the land with our  families. We love the land and the homes we  have made on it; we love our work with the  land; and above all, we love our special kind  of life in which the family unit is the most  important element.  In the Introduction of  their Complaint,  Plaintiffs state, ""Livestock grazing and the  attendant management practices have had  significant adverse environmental effects on  the Public Lands,  including reductions  in  types and populations of fish and wildllfe,  accelerated  erosion,  deterioration  in  sou  ",1974

258,,93,0.183,588,18,Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois.," Mr.  Speaker,  tomorrow I plan  to offer an  amendment to H.R. 11500 to establish a  more reasonable time period for imple mentation of the interim environmental  standards. The committee bill provides  a 120-day period in which State regula tory authorities are to incorporate the  new  interim  standards  into  existing  strip mining permits. Although this time  period  is sufficient,  the concurrent re quirement that existing surface mine op erations comply with such standards is  clearly inadequate. Indeed, we may ex pect an adverse impact on coal produc tion to result from the committee's im plementation schedule.  While continuing to allow 120 days for  State permit revision, my amendment  restructures this schedule by allowing a  more  reasonable  180-day  period  for  existing operations to comply wUh  the  new standards. This schedule will mini mize  any  adverse production  impacts  and grant hard pressed State regulatory  officials adequate time to amend exist ing permits. The text of the amendment  follows:  Page 152,  line 12. Strike out subsection  (c) and insert a subsection  (c)  to read as  follows: ""(c) On and after 180 days from the  date of enactment of this Act, all surface  coal mining operations existing at the date  EXTENSIONS OF R£MARKS  of enactment of this Act shall comply with  the standards in subsection (b) above with  respect to lands from which the overburden  has not been removed. Within 120 days fol lowing enactment of this Act, the regulatory  authority shall review and amend perinits in  order to incorporate in them the standards  of subsection (b) above.""

I would like to take belated note of that  fact by  including for  insertion  in  the  RECORD at this point a summary detail ing highlights of Mr. Burger's long ca reer in behalf of small businessmen in  this country:  George J. Burger, Vice President in charge  of Legislative Activities and Board Member  of the National Federation of Independent  Business since 1947, represented small busi nessmen at Washington, D.C.  for  the past  quarter-century.  His  interest has been  generally  in  all  things directly or indirectly affecting inde pendent  business  fair  opportunities. His  chief concern has been in adequate enforce ment of all antitrust laws, at the national,  state and local levels, among businessmen,  farmers,  labor  and government  itself,  to  keep  trade channels  free of arbitrary  re straints. He believes  that adequate  anti trust enforcement  strengthens  free enter prise, and thereby helps stave off otherwise  inevitable  trends toward state socialism or  greater government interference with busi ness.  Since 1947 Mr. Burger has directed Feder ation  legislative efforts which have helped  gain small businessmen the strongest, most  effective representation ever in our nation's  history in governmental affairs ... through  creation of  the permanent Senate Small  Business committee (1950), creation of the  Executive Branch Small Business Adminis tration  (established  in 1953, made perm.a nent in 1958), and creation of the continuing  President's Special Cabinet Committee on  Small Business. He has also directed efforts  which  resulted,  in 1958,  in Congressional  enactment of $260 million in special tax re visions for smaller firms, in the Small Busi ness Tax Adjustment Act.  In 1962, he was credited by the officials  of the United States Treasury with playing  a prominent part in the drive !or enactment  of  the original 7%  Investment Credit. In  that year also, in concert with organizations  representing doctors, lawyers, and other self employed professionals, he worked success fully for enactment of H.R. 10, a measure  which allowed, for the first  time, self-em ployed business and professional people  to  take tax credits against payments made into  their retirement programs. In 1964 he  led  the lobbying effort which resulted in reversal  in  the  corporate  tax  structure  favoring  smaller corporations.  In 1966 Mr. Burger won a 25-year fight for  independent tire dealers, securing for them  equality with tire manufacturer-owned re tail stores in payment of the federal excise  tax on tb.eir tire stocks.  July 17, 1974  More than this, he has coordinated Federa tion legislative activities which have helped  lead  to, among other  things,  ( 1)  Federal  Trade  Commission  pioneering  efforts  to  establish tire maximum discount ceilings as  protections for independent dealers  (1947),  (2)  the successful small business counter drive against ""basing point"" proposals which  could have wrecked  antitrust protections  against pricing unfairnesses (1949),  (3) en actment of the Celler-O'Mahoney strength ener  to Clayton Act prohibitions  against  monopoly procuring mergers (1950), (4) en actment of the McGuire Fair Trade Enabling  Act, and creation of the Smaller War Plants  Corporation to integrate small business pro ductive potential into the Korean War pro grams  ( 1951),  (5)  successful  cooperation  with  the Independent Bankers Association  in securing enactment of the Bank Holding  Company bill  (1955), and  (6)  in 1958 and  1959  a  rash of Congressional  enactments  helpful to independent enterprisers, includ ing measures  for  speedier enforcement of  antitrust orders,  the closure of legal  loop holes which  helped  giant  chains  escape  effective antitrust supervision over unfair  pricing activities, bills to protect small in terstate sellers against multi-state taxation  of their incomes, etc.  Additionally, he has directed Federation  legislative activities in cooperation with the  Hoover Commission which have helped pro mote a claimed $7.5 billion in savings on  government operations, and he has helped  set the wheels in motion for elimination of  burdensome Federal excise  taxes on  inde pendents' telephone and telegraph bills, and  has provided Capitol follow-up on Federation  member wishes to reduce the size and num ber of Government establishments compet ing with  independent businessmen. Pres ently he is working closely with a number of  Congressmen on new  legislative proposals  aimed  to  require manufacturers who  sell  through both their own factory store chains  and  independent  dealers,  to  treat  both  equally price-wise.  In his years  at Washington, D.C., Mr.  Burger has been a member of the Small Busi ness Task Force of  the National Security  Resources Board, a member of the Business  Advisory Committee to the President's Coun cil of Economic Advisers, and a member of  the Small Business Advisory Committee to  the House Small Business Committee. Fur ther tha~ this, he has acted as consultant  to both major political parties in drawing up  the Small Business planks of their Presiden tial Year Platforms,  testifying before  their  conventions in 1948, 1952 and 1956. Many of  his recommendations were incorporated into  these platforms, and subsequently >oted into  law.  Prior to 1947, Mr. Burger represented the  n.{1.tion's independent tire dealers at Washing ton, D.C. In that capacity he shared in lead ership of the drives that le::l to enactment of  the Robinson-Patman Law, which put teeth  into Clayton Act prohibitions against unfair  price discrimination, and that led to enact ment of the Miller-Tydings Fair Trade En abling Act. He worked closely with Congress men in establishing the temporary House and  Senate Small Business Committees in 1940  and 1941, and cooperated closely with these  Committees in their studies of  tire dealer  problems. These  studies have become  the  ""bible"" for Government officials working on  small business problems to this day. By sur veys of national conditions, he helped put  the wheels in motion with Justice Depart ment  and Federal Trade Commission on  projects that have freed independent service  station operators to buy their tire-battery accessory goods when and from whom they  want. By espousal of the Tire Bill, a meas ure to bar tire manufacturers from selling at  retail in competition with their independent  outlets, he helped head off disastrous price  wars in the rubber industry. In cooperation  with  the Small Business Committees he  ",1974
260,,93,0.068,601,18,Mr. WALSH.," Mr. Speaker, I have re ceived the following information dealing  with the more technical problems of the  proposed  effluent  limitation guidelines  for steam-electric powerplants recently  issued by the Environmental Protection  Agency and I would like to share this  information with my colleagues.  As a former member of the New York  State Public Service Commission, I have  worked very closely with the representa tives of the New York power pool and  I have always been impressed with their  professional performance and their mon umental concern for environmental con siderations.  With the sharply rising cost in utility  rates now throughout the country, I feel  that it is extremely important that all  of my colleagues be made aware of the  impact the proposed guidelines may have  on electric rates in future years.  I,  too, am deeply concerned that we  not despoil our environment further but  I am also acutely aware of the energy  shortage which we face in this country  and which we will continue to face for  many years.  I am hopeful that working  together  with the experts in both the field of en vironment and the field of energy, we  may be able to achieve the best of both  worlds. This should be our goal.  The information follows:  NEW YORK STATE  ELECTRIC & GAS CORPORATION,  Binghamton, N.Y., July 10, 1974.  Hon. WILLIAM F. WALSH,  U.S. House of Representatives,  House Office Building, Washington, D.C.  DEAR MR. WALSH: As you know, the U.S.  Environmental  Protection Agency  (EPA)  has  issued  proposed  efll.uent  limitation  guidelines  for  the  steam  electric  power  plants of the United States. With the great  interest in environmental matters and the  current chaotic conditions  facing utilities  in financing needed expansion,  these pro posals have more than ordinary meaning to  each of our customers who also are a part  of  the electorate which you represent. We  know that the matter of rising costs ls of  importance to everyone these days and feel  that you would be interested in the comments  of New York State  investor-owned electric  companies on the proposed guidelines.  There is a great debate in regard to most  environmental matters  these days  regard ing their desirability. All too often the mat ter of  economic  impact  is overlooked or  deemphasized. Chairman Wright,  of  the  Subcommittee on Investigation and Review  of  the House  of Representatives  Public  Works Committee,  reflected  our  concern  when he emphasized that such guidelines  should be for the benefit of man and that it  would be ridiculous to establish regulations  in which the benefits were exceeded by the  total cost.  The EPA has proposed an essentially uni form nationwide guideline that there should  be no discharge of heat from power plants  to receiving waters in spite of the fact that  Congress had written into the Water Pollu tion Control Act many obvious reservations  about heating being a ""pollutant"" since there  was little evidence to support such a con clusion and many  studies  showing bene ficial effects. Notwithstanding, the EPA has  concluded that no heat should be added to  receiving waters. The EPA also failed to con sider or  inadequately considered the many  adverse  environmental  impacts  resulting  from  a  requirement  for universal  closed cycle  cooling. These  include  concentrated  heat  release  to  the atmosphere,  increased  fogging and icing, salt drift, additional water  consumption, additional noise pollution, and  aesthetic intrusion. Closed-cycle cooling also  increases the consumption of precious fuel  and  reduces  the generating capacity of a  plant making it less able to meet the demand  for electrical power.  The burden that these regulations would  impose on our ratepayers is enormous. It is  estimated that the average residential elec tric customer nationally would have to pay  almost $250 a year  in added costs-about  equal to his present annual blll. Estimates  made by the member companies of the New  York Power Pool show that the people of  New York State alone wlll be asked to pay  almost $10 billion over a twenty-year period  to implement these regulations. This would  be in addition to increases they are already  paying for fuel and capital costs for con struction of new capacity to meet an ever growing demand for powe:r. In fact, such an  added burden might well make it impossible  for utillties  to finance  the construction of  necessary additional generating capacity.  There is enclosed herewith a copy of the  response to the proposed regulations by the  New York Power Pool. These answers deal  with some of the more technical problems.  There ls, throughout, emphasis of the need  for the EPA to carry out the complex bal ancing of all costs and benefits to the tax payers, as we believe was intended by Con gress, and to promulgate regulations which  would require the use of technology to the  ex.tent that the net benefits to man exceed  the total cost.  I hope that you will encourage the EPA  to carry out this very difficult task with the  reasonableness  that  I  feel Congress must  23907  have intended. Only through this approach  can utility bllls be kept at an economic min imum and the use of the State's total energy  be optimal.  Sincere1ly,  LLOYD L. KELLY.  N .Y. POWER POOL,  Binghamton, N.Y., June 21, 1974.  Mr. PHILLIP B. WISEMAN,  EPA Information Center, Environmental Pro tection Agency, Washington, D.C.  DEAR MR. WISEMAN:  The member  com panies of the New York Power Pool (""NYPP"")  have reviewed the Environmental Protection  Agency's proposed efll.uent limitation guide lines,  standards  of  performance,  316(a)  guidelines  and  all  supporting documents.  Comments on these documents, are attached  and include an evaluation of the economic  impact on  the NYPP member companies.  These comments have been prepared by the  NYPP assisted by our consultants, the NUS  Corporation and Quirk, Lawler and Matus ky Engineers.  The NYPP member companies support and  endorse the Utillty Water Act Group-Edison  Electric Institute submission to you regard ing these documents.  We are of the opinion that the proposed  regulations are  for  the most part, unsup ported by fact. The objective appears to be  ""zero discharge"" without regard to whether  or not net benefits to man's total environ ment will result, and without regard to the  cost to the public. We find that the EPA has  failed  to adequately  identify and consider  the environmental, social and economic im pacts of its proposals--to perform the com plex balancing of all benefits and costs en visioned by Congress. The NYPP member  companies find that, on balance, most of the  estimated $9.7 blllion cost to our customers  for the period 1978-1997 is simply not justi fied by any ""benefits""  that may result,  if  indeed there are net benefits.  The NYPP member companies suggest that  the EPA has exceeded its statutory authority  by proposing efll.uent limitations for internal  plant streams  rather  than discharges  into  the waterway, and by proposing that ""gross""  quantities of constltutents are  to be regu lated rather than ""net"" quantities added by  the user. We  also  find  that  the proposed  schedule of compliance with  the  thermal  limitations  ineffectuates  the  intention of  Congress and compounds many of the prob lems, for example, our ability  to maintain  system reliab111ty.  We recommend that the EPA carry out the  complex balancing of all benefits and costs  associated with these regulations, and pub lish efHuent  limitation guidelines  that re quire application of  treatment  technology  only in those cases where the net benefits to  be derived by man exceed the total costs to  him.  The NYPP member companies offer their  full  coopera tlon  in  assisting  the EPA  in  these endeavors.  Sincerely,  Chairman, Environmental Committee.  0. L. HOUSTON,  COMMENTS OF THE NEW YORK POWER POOL  ON THE U.S. ENVmONMENTAL PROTECTION  AGENCY'S PROPOSED EFFLUENT LIMITATION  GUIDELINES AND  STANDARDS OF  PERFORM ANCE  FOR STEAM-ELECTRIC  POWER  PLANTS  CONCLUSIONS  1. EPA has not properly categorized  the  steam-electric power plant industry, propos ing  instead uniform  industry-wide guide lines that do not take into account the di verse characteristics of that industry.  2. EPA has failed to carry out the Congres sional mandate for the ""complex balancing""  of all benefits and costs associated with its  proposed regulations.  3. EPA has proposed ""effluent limitations""  instead of the ""efHuent limitation guidelines""  mandated by the statute.  ",1974
261,,93,0.003,614,18,Mr. CRONIN.," Mr. Speaker, July marks  the 50th year of  the existence of  the  Foreign Service of the United States of  America and gives us all an OPPortunity  to pause and  reflect upon  the great  achievements of  this dedicated service  which represents our Government in 129  embassies around the world. This anni versary month  is a  time for all of us  not only to rededicate the Foreign Service  but to remember its founder, Representa tive  John Jacob Rogers  from Massa chusetts, who ably represented our own  Fifth Congressional District for many  years.  Although he faced popular opposition  to the idea of U.S. presence on foreign  soil by Americans who supported isola tionism, Congressman Rogers persevered  with his idea to join together the con sular and diplomatic  functions of  the  executive branch and to formalize our  Diplomatic Corps  into an active and  forceful body. Certainly his foresighted ness has been borne out during the last  half century of diplomatic achievements  in the part of the United States.  The Honorable  John Jacob Rogers,  with the assistance of his wife, Edith,  made great  inroads  into  the realm of  foreign affairs conduct. Together  they  worked on behalf of  their homeland  abroad, marking a distinguished career.  When Representative Rogers died, his  wife carried on his work for the Fifth  Congressional District of Massachusetts  serving in Congress with the enthusiasm  and dignity that her husband brought to  the seat. The Foreign Service today is a  living memorial to John Jacob and Edith  Nourse Rogers, and a tribute to their un selfish hard work. At this time we should  all pause and remember their work as  portrayed in the following editorial pub lished in today's New York Times:  [From the New York Times, July 17, 1974]  THEY ONLY WArr WHo ALso SERVE  (By C. L. Sulzberger)  JIDDA, SAUDI ARABIA.-lt is startling to re call tha.t fifty years ago the United States,  which is now the world's most diplomatically  involved nation, had no ad.equate Foreign  Service. Only  in July, 1924, when  the a.ct  sponsored  by Representative  John  Jacob  Rogers of Massachusetts became law, did to day's efficient system of representation de velop.  The idea of having regular foreign envoys  was  always  somewhat  repugnant  to most  Americans who were imbued with a romantic  concept of isolation from the nasty outside  world from which they and their ancestors  fled. A Department of Foreign Affairs was  created in 1781 by the revolutionary govern ment which had  to enlist aid abroad and  finally to negotiate peace. In 1789 this was  reorganized into the State Department.  For years its representatives were appoint ed on the basis of a political spoils system.  In 1856, the thought of merit as a qualifica tion was first legally acknowledged. Subse quent acts in 1906 and 1909 ~ave civn-servto  ice status to those serving in foreign mis sions.  However, it was only with the Rogers Act  that the existing diplomatic and consular  services were  joined into a  single Foreign  Service  that admitted qualified applicants  after examina.tion and  then assigned and  promoted them according to need and merit.  By establishing a uniform scale of salaries  and  representation allowances  (always  far  too stingy) it became possible for individuals  without priva.te means to serve the State De partment.  One useful result of the welding of diplo matic and consular officials  into the same  career service was that it opened doors  the highest office to competent consuls who  would otherwise have been prevented from  playing active policy-making roles. An out standing e~ample has been Robert Murphy,  a  young vice-consul  in Munich when  the  Roger Act became effective. He subsequently  rose to the rank of ambassador and Under  Secretary of State.  Had there been no Rogers Act or its equiva lent, the United States would be in no posi tion to play its extraordinarily active role in  international affairs today. In 1924 the United  States had only 122 persons in its diploma.tic  service-plus 511 consular officials (including  Mr. Murphy). Now the Foreign Service num bers 3,290. In 1924 Washington was repre sented by 54 small diplomatic and consular  posts abroad. Today we have 129 embassies  a.lone.  The trend begun by the Rogers Act has not,  however, been completed. At the time of its  enactment only 35 per cent of our missions  a.broad were under career diplomats. Now 68  per cen:t of the far larger number of missions  are headed by career officers; yet that figure  means 32 per cent of our embassies are under  noncareer envoys. In other words, the spoils  system is still far from dead.  The American public was recently shocked  to  learn as part of  the fall-out  from  the  Watergate scandal how flagrantly some dip lomatic posts overseas have been peddled  about by political influence merchants and  fund-raisers. Some of the resulting appoint ments  have  ranged  from  embarrassingly  comic to well-nigh catastrophic.  However, it cannot be forgotten that cer tain of our noncareer ambassadors have been  among the most distinguished public servants  the United States ever produced and rank  with such early amateur envoys as Benjamin  Franklin and John Jay.  Nevertheless, while always  leaving space  for specially qualified noncareer ambassadors,  it seems only just that the implied intentions  of the Rogers Act should be fully carried out.  Each and every post abroad should be open  to members of the career Foreign Service with  adequate pay and allowances  to maintain  even  the costliest embassy out of public  hands.  As things stand, the most luxurious posi tions a.re most coveted by beneficiaries of the  spoils system. Likewise, the most difficult and  dangerous post.tions are always awarded  career diplomats. Thus it was a. hard-working  pair of U.S. public servants, Ambassador Cleo  Noel and George Moore, who were kidna.pped  in Khartoum, Sudan, across the Red Sea from  here, by Palestine Ara.b guerr1llas and bru tally murdered. Similar  tragedies have  in volved career diplomats in Brazil and Guate mala.  In  the United States where equality of  opportunity has  always been  stressed-as  well as equaUty of hardship or danger  in  times of crisis-it would be useful to recall  this philosophy in assigning overseas posts.  There is no sense continuing even vestigial  favoritism or amateurism-when not fully  qua.lifted by talent-at the expense of that  industrious, courageous body of men, largely  unknown, who  serve us  in  a. world  from  which we cannot isolaite ourselves.  to  ELDERLY WANT  INDEPENDENCE,  AND THAT MEANS MONEY  HON.

LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY FOR SUCH REPORTS  The Alaska Pipeline Act-Public Law  93-153-signed into law on November 16,  1973, contains authority for the FTC to  gather the information called for by the  reports in question.  This newly  acquired  authority has  long been sought by FTC, but on grounds  detailed later in my remarks was denied  the same till passage of the act men tioned.  'I'he need and purposes for the report  data as described by the FTC include the  following:  First. To enable the Commission to in vestigate the extent of competition in  the U.S. economy in general and in specific industries;  ,  Second. To  ascertain  industry per formance as to profitability;  Third. To determine the extent of sales  promotion activity in industry;  Four,tll. To determine  industry: per formance and expenditures in research  and development; and  Fifth. That such data would be useful  in supporting rational policy planning  procedure's witnin  the Federal Trade  Gommissioh.  Additional purpqses to which the data  will lend itself would include the filing  of civil antitrust suits by Government  and by private parties; and access to data  giving vital Information and unfair com petitive advan.~e to foreign corpora tions which  are not  required  file  reports.  There is much to be said for the de sirability of gathering such information.  In general, this will be of some value  overall.  But, Mr. President, to possess any use fUlness and eff ectivenesa of proposed re ports requires, first, that they be reliable~  uniform, accurate, and adequate; and,  second, that they not contain data which  wm present distorted  results.  In  the  words of the economist-that they not  be ('contaminated"" or be ""polluted"" with  misleading figures.  In past years, authority for such re ports has been denied by Congress prin cipally because there has not been any  reasonable assurance that such require ments as to qualitu would be forthcom ing. This for a variety of reasons which  I will state later.  Ur. President, it is submitted that the  present procedures and forms proposed  by FTC for  these reports fail to meet  these reqUirements, They cannot possi bl,. comply with the necessities of a qual ity and of attributes which will do the  job; which will make them useful and  meaningful for  their declared and in tended purnoses.

268,House,93,0.134,848,18,Mr. ESCH.," Mr. Speaker, a wire service  report  this week highlighted  the diffi culty being encountered by the Federal  Government in implementing the sup plemental security income program. The  news account tells how a Portland, Oreg.  man has been receiving an SSI check  for about $145 each month despite his  best efforts to explain to the local Social  Security Administration office that he is  no  longer qualified  for  the payments.  The individual even returned one check  only to have the Government send him  a duplicate 2 weeks later.  This incident might be blamed on a  computer abberation and even consid ered somewhat amusing were it not for  the fact that literally thousands of per sons throughout the country are being  frustrated  in  their  efforts  to  receive  checks  to which  they are  legitimately  entitled. Fortunately,  the Social Secu rity Administration has  reacted  in a  positive fashion and I am convinced that  efforts are now underway  to clear up  both computer and procedural problems  plaguing the program. However, I intend  to  continue  to monitor  the  situation  closely through the General Accounting  Office and SSA and Health, Education,  and Welfare officials.  As a result of the interest expressed by  many Members and staffs following my  Dear Colleague regarding SSI, I  intend  at this point in the RECORD  to summar ize the problems we have uncovered plus  the steps being taken as outlined in the  very  responsive  letter  I have  received  from Secretary Weinberger.  As I am certain has been the experi ence of other Congressmen, constituent  complaints began this spring following  implementation on January 1 of the SSI  program which was signed into law in  October of 1972. In early May I learned  from various individuals including rep resentatives of the Washtenaw, Mich.,  Association for Retarded Children that  failure  insure a  smooth  transition  from the programs replaced by SSI was  creating widespread  confusion  among  to  to  SSI  recipients. This was  particularly  true of the handicapped and the transi tion from the aid-to-disabled program to  SSI.  After a preliminary  investigation,  I  found their charges to be true. In fact, it  appears that what has occured is a gen eral breakdown of the entire SSI pro gram,  leaving  thousands of  recipients  either without benefits or  totally con fused  as  eligibility. A  tremendous  backlog of cases piled up. For example,  I understand  that by mid-May  there  were  some  630,000  new  claims  cases  pending and  that during  the next 4  weeks there were an additional 150,000  new SSI applications. However, emer gency measures to improve SSI program  performance were ordered by Commis sioner James B. Cardwell and a claims  payment strike force was created to be  directed by Elliot A. Kirschbaum.  On May 30, I sent a long and detailed  letter to Secretary Weinberger outlining  my concerns and I met with HEW and  SSA officials. The problems were quite  specific and because of  the  likelihood  that similar situations may apply in the  districts of other members, I am includ ing a copy of the text of my letter to  Secretary Weinberger at this point  in  the RECORD:  MAY 30, 1974.  Hon. CASPAR w. WEINBERGER,  Secretary of the Department of Health, Edu ciation, and Welfare, Washington, D.C.  DEAR SECRETARY WEINBERGER: The purpose  of  this  letter  is  to express my shock  and  dismay over the incredible situation which  has developed over the failure of the Social  Security  Administration  to  implement  regulations under the Supplemental Security  Income program,  implemented under Title  XVI of the Social Security Amendments of  1974.  The failure to develop final guidelines to  insure a smooth transition from the Aid to  Disabled program  to SSI, after more  than  17 months, is creating widespread confusion  and near hysteria at the local levels over the  eligibility of thousands of handicapped for  SS! benefits. While SS! apparently has de veloped ""interim"" regulations, they have ap parently have not bothered to put them all  together in one package.  For example, SS! in Balitmore has failed to  develop a final definition of ""student status,""  or at least has failed to let the District Of fices know what this definition is. If a per son of age 18, applied December or earlier,  he would be eligible for SS! benefits by virtue  of grandfathering from A.D., no matter what  the parents' circumstances. However, an 18  year old who applied after January 1,  the  effective date of SSI, must choose between  financial benefits or education programs un less  that disabled persons' parents' income  and resources are nil. If a person selects ""stu dent status,'' the present guidelines extend  the dependency of  the handicapped adult  until age 22, unless they keep that person out  of school programs. All this is understood.  However, the confusion comes in defining  ""student status."" Michigan has passed  a  Mandatory Special Education Act providing  the right to education for all handicapped  until age 25, and has encouraged non-institu tionalization of education benefits for  the  disabled. In many-in fact, most--instances,  this means the handicapped are involved in  part-time  ""community-school""  training,  which in only rare instances equals the bene fits that would be provided under SS! if a  disabled person elected not to participate.  The effect has been that in this confusion,  many parents are simply pulling their dis",1974

His nickname ""Dizzy""  came from his outlandish,  fun-loving,  boastful manner. But as  the late New  York  sportswriter, Tom Meany,  said:  ""He's dizzy like a fox."" As the free spirit  leader of the St. Louis Cardinals' ""Gas house Gang,"" he had a penchant for loud  bragging about his pitching, but he also  had a strong arm to prove he was the  best.  The stories about him are legend.  He once called an opposing team be fore a game and boasted: ""No curve balls  today-I'm pitching all fast balls."" Even  with  that  tip,  the  opponents  could  scratch only two hits off Dean that day.  When he was assigned  to play  for  Houston in 1931, he went  to a phone,  called the Dallas team and announced:  ""Yep, I'm back in town. And I'm gonna  give you just two hits tonight."" That is  exactly what happened.  In the final game of the 1934 World  Series, with his St. Louis Cardinals win ning 11-0 in the ninth inning, Dean was  pitching when Detroit ace slugger Hank  Greenberg came to the plate. Having al ready struck out Greenberg twice that  day, Dean went  to the Detroit dugout  and hollered: ""Hey, ain't you guys got  any  pinchhitters?""  Card  teammate  Frankie Frisch stormed at Dean, but  Dean  retorted,  ""You're a  great  guy  Frisch, but you take things too serious ly."" Dean  then struck out Greenberg  again on four pitches.  Dean loved to tell outlandish stories,  and he was  the darling of the sports writers. To every writer who asked where  and when he was born, he gave-a differ ent answer. When his hand was acciden tally gashed by his wife's nail file, he told  one sportswriter that he fell through a  glass cigar case. Then he told another  writer that he was bitten by a lion in a  New York taxicab.  After his baseball career ended, Dean  took  up  golf  and  quickly  became  a  scratch handicap player. Golf pro Ben  Hogan, who frequently played Dean for  high stakes, would give Dean a handicap  ",1974
270,,93,0.247,900,18,Mr. YOUNG of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like to call the attention of my  colleagues to the 75th anniversary of the  village of Glenview, Ill. It has been said  that the family is the cornerstonE of the  community, and the community is the  cornerstone of the Nation. With corner tones like Glenview,  the United Stat.es  has an unparalleled foundation  in the  history of the world.  I would like to insert in the RECORD  the following remarks about Glenview:  GLENVIEW,  ILL.:  ""75  IN  '74, WITH THE  'SPIRIT OF  '76' ""  This year, 1974,  the Village of Glenview  celebrates its 75th anniversary. It was 1899  when Glenview incorporated under the laws  of Illinois. To mark the event, a Diamond  Jubilee celebration was held  from July 4  through July 6. The three days of activities  were held in various parts of the village, but  centered around Jackman Park and the ad jacent village hall parking lot. Festivities in cluded the Fourth of July parade, with the  theme ""75 in '74 with the 'Spirit of '76' "", a  merchant's street sale in the center of the  village, and performances by the Glenbrook  South High School German Band, the Glen brook South Master Singers,  the Melodons  (Notre Dame high school's jazz band), and  the big band of Carl Sands. In addition, there  were  several game booths and  concession  stands to accommodate the throngs of people  who attended the celebration. The plans and  efforts put forth by the Diamond Anniver sary Committee, including the crystal. clear  sky  overhead,  were  well-received  and  appreciated.  The growth and development of Glenview  began in the early 1800's, and has continued  up to the present day. In 1837, following his  military service at Fort Dearborn, Sgt. Joseph  Adams established a general store in the cen ter of what is now Glenview. A growth pat tern, typical of the times, developed. Origi nally  occupied  by  peaceful  Indians  and  ~rontier farmers, the fertile land, forests and  waterways brought others to the area. Many  came  from across  the Atlantic Ocean and  established  themselves  in Glenview. The  names of numerous settlers are still well  known today.    EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The Dewes family arrived from England in  1833  to farm  the fertile  lands. The Rugen  family came  to Glenview via Germany  in  1852,  and  established  the Rugen  Stores,  among other business and civic activities in  which this family has been  involved up to  the present time. By 1899, the name of the  village had changed several  times, having  been called South Northfield, North Branch,  and Oak Glen. In 1895 the name ""Glenview""  was chosen by the local citizenry, at the sug gestion of Hugh L. Burnham, who was to be come the first president of the vtllage.  The population growth of Glenview has  been gradual, except for occasional ""boom""  periods. Originally, the village consisted of  approximately 350 inhabitants, which num ber surged higher whenever the Chicago river  overflowed its banks. Fears of cholera, diph theria and other epidemics caused people to  move out into less crowded surroundings. By  1950  the population had climbed to 6,142.  During the past quarter century, that num ber has skyrocketed,  jumping nearly  five fold. Today it stands at nearly 30,000.  Following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,  the Milwaukee Road put in a set of railroad  tracks to haul timber and supplies for recon struction of the city. Twenty years later, an other track was added, in anticipation of the  greater  traffic for  the 1893 Columbian Ex position. In 1903 a  telephone exchange was  installed  in Glenview. Gas and electricity  came in 1910, and a volunteer fire depart ment was organized in 1911. One year later  concrete sidewalks were poured to replace the  wooden ones, and during 1916, water service  was added. All of these occurrences in addi tion to the opening of Edens Expressway (a  4-lane, limited access highway to Chicago) in  1952, added to Glenview's appeal as a con venient, accessible, yet pleasant community.  Congratulations are  in order  to Village  President Ed Patten, Paul Thomas, chairman  of  the Diamond  Jubilee Committee,  the  Glenview Area Historical Society, the Glen view Chamber of Commerce, and the many  citizens of Glenview for all of their efforts  put forth in making the Diamond Jubilee a  memorable event. A great deal of commu nity spirit and involvement went into making  the celebration a success. Glenview has seen  seventy-five years of growth and success.  ""75 in '74, with the 'Spirit of '76' ""  is an  especially appropriate slogan for a great com munity Glenview.  SURFACE MINING CONTROL AND  RECLAMATION ACT OF 1974  HON. JOHN P. MURTHA  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, Ju~y 18, 1974  ",1974
271,,93,-0.644,913,18,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to express again my grave concern  for the basic human right of each woman  to decide when to acquire a legal abor tion. I believe that it is not the moral  duty of this body to legislate laws forc ing any woman  to have an unwanted  child.  The medically administered abortion,  which has long been used by more affluent  Americans, alters a natural process of  the female body  just as the vasectomy  does  the male. To  illegalize  abortion  would only serve to impose further hard ships on America's poor, in addition to  thwarting medical advancement.  Abortion as a  right, not a privilege,  should be a V'ailable to every woman in  this country without restriction by law or  constitution amendment. For if this Con gress opts to enact such legislation, a past  era of quackery, self-induced abortions,  and abortions at exorbitant fees will be  reawakened.  A wide array of  individuals and or ganizations  have  taken  a  principled  stand to support each woman's option to  legally abort. However, at times oppo nents  to  legal abortion  raise cries of  ""genocide"" to support their position. Dur ing the turbulent sixties, some black or ganizations used the genocide argument  to denounce a woman's right  to  legal  abortion. Despite the rhetoric of such an  argument, the fact remains that to legal ly deprive women of that right is  im moral, insane, and unjust.  Since  then black organizations have  taken a  turn  in  thought. Given  their  plight in this country, blacks forsee po tential dangers if abortion is illegalized.  At this time, I would like to enter into  the RECORD a letter from the Black Wom en Organized for Political Action which  profoundly expresses opposition to pro posed legislation to restrict abortions:  BLACK WOMEN ORGANIZED FOR ACTION,  Congressman RONALD v. DELLUMS,  San Francisco, Calif., July 11, 1974.  Longworth House Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN DELLUMS: Black Wo men Organized for Action  (BWOA) would  like to express our co'ncern on the proposed  amendment  to  the Constitution  of  the  United States whlch reads:  ""Neither the U.S. nor any state shall de prive any human being  (from the moment  of)  conception of life without due process  of law; nor deny any human being from the  moment of conception, within its jurisdiction  the equal protection of the law. Neither the  U.S. nor any state shall deprive any human  being of  life on account of  illness, age or  incapacity.""  BWOA  recognized several problems with  this amendment sponsored by Senator Mark  Hatfield (Oregon) and Senator James Buck ley {New York) :  1. Rape victims who conceive a child will  be forced to bear the child.  2. Danger to a mother's life will no longer  be sufficient grounds for abortion.  3. Abortion will be defined as murder.  4. Women will not have free choice to make  personal decisions on the abortion question.  Black Women Organized for Action does  not support this proposed amendment to the  Constitution for Black women who are poor  or who must depend upon public health  facilities may resort to illegal abortion and  jeopardize their life and heal th.  We urge you to oppose the ""so-called right to-life"" amendment.  Sincerely,  ANITA WILLIAMS,  For the Health Committee Black Women  Organized for Action.  CONGRESSMAN AL QUIE'S LEADER SHIP REFLECTS DECENCY AND  COMMONSENSE  HON. ANCHER NELSEN  OF MINNESOTA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 18, 1974  ",1974
272,,93,0.268,913,18,Mr. NELSEN.," Mr. Speaker, back home  in Minnesota, most of our citizens have  long  recognized  that Congressman AL  QuIE is one of the Nation's leading ex perts  in  the field of education. When  this fact is recognized by no less an au thority than the New York Times, how ever,  it creates a  feeling of particular  pride among Minnesotans, particularly  when AL'S position in the instance cited  did not reflect the special interests of the  State in which this newspaper is housed.  I am pleased,  therefore,  to insert in  the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD  an article  from the New York Times that appeared  earlier this year describing AL's deter mined effort to make the allocation for mula more equitable for the assistance  of disadvantaged students in elementary  and secondary schools across the Nation.  AL QuIE's commonsense approach and  his leadership, to quote the Times' new$  account, as ""one of  the foremost con gressional authorities on education mat ters,"" is warmly appreciated.  Over many months, Mr. Speaker,  I  have also been saving for inspirational  purposes a heartwarming commentary  written by Washington Post syndicated  columnist David Broder. In this depress ing Watergate period,  it continues  to  serve as a clear reminder that decent  political motivations and individual con science have not been written off  in  American politics. AL QuIE's eloquent  statement quoted by Mr. Broder cer tainly proves the point.  The articles to which I have alluded  follow at this point in my remarks:  [From the New York Times, Mar. 13, 1974)  STATE FACES Loss IN EDUCATION Am-HOUSE  DELEGATION  DEFEATED  IN TEST VOTE ON  FORMULA FOR FEDERAL FUNDS  (By David E. Rosenbaum)  WASHINGTON, March 12.-The New York  State delegation, so often divided and con quered on the floor of the House of Repre sentatives, stood united today on an aid-to education measure and still went down  to  defeat.  The vote was on a procedural question  setting the stage for the House debate next  week  on  a multibillion-dollar,  three-year  bill  that would provide continued Federal  assistance for grade schools and high schools.  New Yorkers object to the part of the bill  that would create a new  formula  for de termining how much each state and school  district is to receive in assistance for under privileged pupils over the next three years.  Under  the  formula,  established by  the  Education and Labor Committee, New York  City would be allocated about $30-million  less each school year than it is now receiv ing, and the rest of the state would lose $5million more.  The vote today came on whether to adopt  ground  rules  for debate  that would  limit  amendments to the formula. The New York  delegation wanted  to  reject  the proposed  rules, but they were accepted by a vote of  234 to 163.  James F. Hastings, a Republican from a  rural district  around Elmira, was  the only  New Yorker  to vote  in favor of  the rules.  New  Jerzey  and Connecticut would  lose  marginal amounts under  the formula, and  their representatives also voted against the  rules.  ISSUE HAS BEEN CAST  Representative Peter A.  Peyser,  a West chester County Republican who  is one of  the leaders in the fight against the bill, de clared after the vote, ""We still have a shot  at it.""  But the issue has been cast as one of New  York against  the rest of the country, and  the House is stacked against New York.  As the Representatives filed into the House  chamber for the vote this afternoon, Repre sentative Albert H. Quie, a Minnesota Re publican who  is one of the foremost Con gressional authorities on education matters,  stood  at  the  door  to  the  chamber  and  warned his colleagues. ""This is just for New  York.""  The main hope for  the New Yorkers now  lies  in the Senate, where Senator Jacob K.  Javits  is  the  ranking Republican on  the  committee that is considering education leg islation.  At present, Federal aid for compensatory  education  programs  for  underprivileged  children is principally based on the number  of  children  in each  school district whose  families  receive welfare payments and  the  state's per-pupil expenditures for education.  The formula devised by the Education and  Labor Committee would base allotments on  three factors: the number of poverty families  ( $4,200 a year or les3 for a nonfarm family  of four this year), two-thirds of the children  in  families whose welfare payments push  th~ir income above the poverty line and the  state per-pupil expenditure.  STATE WOULD BE ALERT  A limit would be set so that states that  spend more than 20 per cent above the na tional average  for education, as New York  does, could not count the expenditures above  120 per cent of the national average.  New York would be hurt because of  its  large number of families on welfare and large  state expenditures for education.  The State Department of Education has  estimated that the cutback in the city's Fed eral funds would mean that 88,000 children  would have  to be dropped  from programs  providing remedial reading and ari th me tic,  social counseling and other services for dis advantaged children. The staff of these pro grams would have to be cut by one-third,  according to department figures.  Mr. Quie, arguing in favor of the new for mula, declared that New York State had 8  percent of the children in the country and  6.3 percent of those in poverty but received  15 percent of the Federal compensatory edu cation money last year. The new bill, he said,  would give the state 11 percent of the money.  Moreover, Mr. Quie noted, the old allot ments were based on 1960 census  figures,  which were now out of date and, he declared,  an unfair measure of need.  ",1974
273,,93,-0.33,926,18,Mr. TRAXLER.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  House  is considering a bill  this week  which will have  important and  long reaching effects on  the welfare of our  Nation. I ref er to H.R. 11500, the Sur face Mining Control and Reclamation  Act of 1974.  The gas crisis  this country endured  last winter taught us that we cannot af ford  to  remain dependent on  foreign  sources of  energy. We must  turn  to  sources within our borders if we want  to remain free from energy blackmail.  By far the cheapest, most abundant,  and most practical  source of energy  found in the United States is coal. In deed, the proven reserves of the United  States are estimated  to be 43 percent  of all the coal in the world-more than  the combined reserves of the next two  ranking countries, Russia and China. As  this country moves to lessen its depend ence on foreign  sources of energy by  expanding development of native nat ural resources, coal will assume an ever  greater share of the energy market.  However,  in developing our own en ergy resources, we cannot abandon our  land  to  unchecked  exploitation. The  challenge we face is to unlock the vast  stores of coal beneath our land while  minimizing damage to the environment.  As this country turns to coal for more  and more of its energy needs, the need  for control of mining practices will as sume great  importance. While  in  the  long run the deep mine method of min ing coal must dominate, since the vast  majority of coal  reserves can only be  mined this way, the strip mine method  will be most attractive to coal companies  in the immediate future, because of the  cheaper mining costs involved.  While strip mining may cost less than  deep mining,  though,  the cost  to our  land could be great if strip mining prac tices  remain  largely unchecked. Even  now, 1,000 acres are strip mined every  week in the United States, and it has  been estimated that strip mining is cost ing Americans $35 million a year in lost  recreational  resources  and  an unde termined amount in lost land left scarred  and  desolate.  Some States  have  at tempted  to check  this  envirorunental  damage by regulating strip mining prac tices, but their efforts have suffered from  lack of uniformity and enforcement.  ",1974

275,House,93,-0.416,1134,18,Mr. MOORHEAD of Pennsylvania.,"  In 1970, under the able leadership of  the  gentleman  from California  <Mr.  SISK)  the Rules Committee made pro visions  to  permit  the  televising  and  broadcasting  of  committee  hearings.  However,  as committee members now  realize, they inadvertently failed to ex tend the same provisions to committee  meetings.  It was clearly  the  intention of Mr.  SisK's subcommittee to include meetings  as well as hearings in that category. Our  colleague from Louisiana (Mr. LONG) has  pointed out that the minutes of the sub committee hearings  referred  to,  reveal  that the term ""meetings"" and ""hearings""  were used interchangeably. However, in  drafting  the final  rules provision,  the  term ""meeting"" was dropped apparently  inadvertently. As a result, the chairman  of the various committees, including the  Judiciary Committee, have  interpreted  the  rules  to preclude  telecasting and  broadcasting  of  committee meetings,  This rule change is now relevant because  of the pendency of the impeachment de bate and voting in committee and the  desire of the Judiciary Committee to au thorize electronic media coverage,  The impeachment of a President is a  relatively  rare occurrence, a point for  which, I am confident, we are all grate ful. The impeachment of Andrew John son a century ago has provided us with  only a hazy set of standards to follow.  Therefore,  the Judiciary Committee  is  plowing a great deal of new constitu tional ground. The actions we  take in  these historic proceedings will  create  many precedents and the significance of  what we do will endure for many years  to come. Committee members are aware  that, in part, we are setting standards of  conduct for future Presidents. Television  coverage will assure the most complete  record for history.  Mr. Speaker, we undertook  this  im peachment inquiry on the premise that  public  involvement was essential. Such  activities  could  not  be  completed  in  secret.  I regret that the Judiciary Committee  hearings were not opened previously to  television. Though  the committee con sidered it several times, a majority voted  to keep most of these proceedings closed,  specifically those for the presentation of  evidence. The taking of testimony wit nesses,  pursuant  to  the provisions of  rule 11, were required to be conducted in  executive session because of the possi bility that the evidence or testimony may  have tended to defame, degrade, or in criminate individuals.  The committee has since ordered all of  the evidence made public. Same 9,000  pages of materials have been printed and  released. The last of the testimony given  in hearings by the nine witnesses called  by the committee is scheduled to be released today. All of the background in formation which the committee members  will debate and upon which each will base  his or her vote has been made public.  It is now timely that we should open up  debate and the committee vote to com plete public examination which electronic  coverage will permit.  This is not a partisan issue. There is  broad support from both sides of  the  aisle  to permit the public  televising of  these important hearings. Counsel to the  White House has long been in favor of  such action. Chairman RODINO has ex pressed a desire to open the committee  meetings. And last Thursday, the second  ranking minority member of the Judi ciary Committee, Mr. MCCLORY,  joined  with me in the Rules Committee in ask ing for favorable consideration of  this  resolution.  I would argue to the Members of the  House that this debate has great rele vance;  indeed, that it is of overriding  public importance. Committee members,  who for 12 weeks have studied these ma terials, will be debating the entirety of  the  issues, defining and refining  those  which they consider of greatest impor tance and significance. The public should  be allowed to watch and listen to the  arguments  as  they  are made;  they  should be allowed to weigh the evidence  while  the Judiciary Committee mem bers do.  Televising is the best medium for pre senting  this  diverse  compendium  of  materials and information to the pub lic. Television establishes a direct cir cuit between the viewer and the partici pant, avoiding the interposing views of  any third party, including newsmen. The  Senate Select Committee hearings on  Watergate  last summer were an un precedented  educational  success. The  American public studied  the witnesses  and their testimony and evaluated the  importance and truth of each witness  and his testimony. Now the public should  be  allowed  to  examine  the  Judiciary  Committee and  the  results of  its 9month inquiry the same way.  Rather than creating a political cir cus, as some have alleged, I believe that  the television cameras will keep the par ticipants serious and alert. The televi sion eye is a critical, perceptive device  which has  the ability  to  reveal pom posity, ill preparation, and a weak case.  Indeed, had  there been  television 100  years ago, I  think the impeachment of  Andrew Johnson would have died in the  House.  The public's right to know is not just  empty rhetoric. The country is divided  emotionally and intellectually on this is sue like on no other. Never before has it  been so important for the people of this  country  to be aware of complex facts  and to be able to evaluate the truth for  themselves. It is hard to imagine an is sue which demands public participation  more than does this one. It is imperative  that the public now have the opportu nity to listen and to evaluate the evi dence which  the Judiciary Committee  has received so  that,  in the end,  the  country will have confidence in its find ings, and so that hopefully, when this  ",1974

We have made changes to section 201,  and unlike the comments that have been  made in support of the point of order,  further amendments would be possible  on this substitute, as I understand it; so  it is not the intention of the author or  of this substitute to foreclose debate, but  in an orderly way to consider all those  that pertain to section 201 at this point  in the debate, so that, for instance, title  II is open for debate at any point.

279,,93,-0.48,1199,18,Mr. BLATNIK.," Mr. Speaker,  in the  4 years that he has been the chairman  of  the Virginia State Water Control  Board, Noman Cole, Jr., has shown what  one man can do when his concern  is  backed by knowledge, courage, and de termination. Mr. Cole is largely respon sible for the fact that although the ft.ow  to the sewage treatment plants in north ern Virginia  increased from 30 million  gallons a day to 37 million gallons a day  between 1970 and 1974,  the amount of  pollutants discharged actually dropped  from 40,000  to 12,000 pounds over  the  same period. While this is not the most  ""glamorous""  of  accomplishments,  the  people of northern Virginia should real ize that if the Potomac runs more clearly  and cleanly in the near future, it will be  due, to a large extent, to the dedication  and courage of Noman Cole, Jr.  As  the author of the Federal Water  Pollution Control Act, I applaud the ac complishments of Mr. Cole as the chair man of the State water control board,  and extend my congratulations to this  untiring :fighter for water quality in Vir ginia. His example should be an inspira tion to all citizens that their concerns and  their efforts can make a difference.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to submit for in clusion in the RECORD, an editorial and  a recent article reviewing the fine work  of Noman Cole, Jr., as the date for his  retirement from the State water control  board draws near. As the editorial states,  ""We are sorry to see him go.""  The material follows:  [From the Washington Post, Jan. 2, 1974)  CITIZEN COLE  Some years ago, Noman M. Cole Jr., like  many other citizens of this area, was dis turbed about the threat a proposed Fairfax  County sewage treatment plant posed to the  wildlife sanctuary at Gunston Cove. He wrote  the county supervisor about it. He got an  unsatisfactory reply. It sent him up like a  rocket, as he put it. One of his sons said  it was no use, the system would not respond.  Well, Cole  took up  the challenge. A 40year-old nuclear engineer with a deep con cern  for  the environment and unlimited  faith in the inventiveness of American tech nology, Cole taught himself more than even  some experts knew about the complexities  of sewage engineering and the problems of  cleaning up our water. A former assistant  to Admiral Hyman Rickover, the blunt and  testy promoter of  the nuclear  submarine,  Cole adopted Rickover's manner in applying  his knowledge to get action, first as a pri vate citizen-activist and, in the past three and-a-half years, as  the chairman of  the  Virginia State Water Control Board.  His knowledge and bluntness, fired by tire24505  less energy, has managed to get some orga nization into the indifferent and chaotic sys tem by which this metropolitan region man aged-and fouled-its water supply. Under  his leadership, the Georgetown Gap, which  poured millions of gallons of raw sewage into  the Potomac, has been closed. The amount o1  solid waste dumped  into Virginia's water ways has been substantially reduced. Smith  Mountain Lake near Roanoke  is being de polluted. State standards for clean water are  being enforced. There  is greater hope than  before that the Blue Plains treatment plant  will eventually clean up the Potomac.  That is no mean job in the face of hesitant  if not recalcitrant and  forever  squabbling  county and state officials,  some of whom  Noman Cole once called ""a bunch of phonies.""  He has now announced that he will resign  his job when his four-year term on the Watei  Control Board is up in July. ""Four years of  this kind of thing is enough,"" he said. ""My  kids will leap for joy.""  We won't. We are sorry to see him go. But  then Cole has largely accomplished what he  set out  to accomplish. He  taught his son  that energetic leadership can make the sys tem respond.  [From  the Washington Post, July 1, 1974]  NOMAN COLE:  IMPATIENCE LED  TO RESULTS  (By Kenneth Bredemeier)  When Noman M. Cole Jr. the always vocal,  usually controversial chairman of  the Vir ginia State Water Control Board, disclosed  he would not seek reappointment, two Prince  W1lliam County  supervisors unsuccessfully  tried to get their colleagues to pass a resolu tion.  It said pointedly: ""Honorable Governor of  Virginia, please accept Noman Cole's resig nation.""  The resolution is one measure of the tur moil  that has surrounded Cole during his  four-year tenure as the powerful chairman  of the once-moribund water quality agency.  Cole, a 41-year-old nuclear engineer with  MPR Associates,  a Washington consulting  firm, has prodded, threatened, chided and or ..  dered countless  local officials  to halt  the  overloading  of  their  sewage  treatment  plants, to upgrade their qua11ty  and, in some  cases, to stop the outright dumping of raw  filth  into  the state's waterways.  In doing  so, his frequent caustic and sarcastic com ments, often contained in letters he leaked  to the press, have angered just about every  local official in the state he's dealt with at  one time or another.  Now, as he leaves his part-time state post  to devote more time to his family and job  even some of the local officials he has clashed  with repeatedly, and still is waging war with  in some cases, generally give him high marks  for both his single-minded diligence in seek ing to cleanse Virginia's streams and rivers  and most importantly, the success the Cole directed water control board has had in re ducing pollution.  ""I  think Noman's the best  thing  that's  happened to Virginia,"" says Jean R. Packard,  chairman of  the Fairfax County J3oard of  Supervisors, who  nonetheless  vocally  op poses his position in a current dispute over  construction of sewage facilities in northern  Fairfax.  ""His  impatience with excuses may have  overlooked the legitimacy of some explana tions""  for  sewage  problems,  says Fairfax  engineer Louis Guy, ""but  this  impatience  has brought results.""  Says  former Gov. Linwood Holton, who  appointed Cole:  ""Nobody  in  the history of Virginia has  done more for cleaning up our rivers than  Noman Cole.""  Specifically, during Cole's tenure as board  chairman:  The Georgetown Gap sewage flows, which  dumped untold millions of gallons of raw  sewage,in the PotomacRiver, were plugged.  ",1974
280,,93,-0.085,1225,18,Mr. ROGERS.," Mr. Speaker, recently  I  read an article in the National Insti tutes of Health record which described  a  technological advance in the field of  biomedical communications. The Appli cations  Technology  Satellite, ATS-6,  will provide a  television  link between  physicians in hospitals and patients in  remote villages  in  the Northwest. The  great advantage of the ATS-6 is its abilEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ity to establish visual contact between  physician and patient, thereby facilitat ing diagnosis and treatment. The physi cian or medical aide in the village will  be able  to establish contact with  the  hospital  to  assure  adequate medical  advice.  I wish to congratulate the people at  NASA and at the National Library of  Medicine's Lister Hill National Center  for Biomedical Communications for de vising this important system. The pros pects  for  expanded health care  seem  brigher with the advent of the ATS-6.  I would  like  to share with my col leagues the article in the NIH record.  The article follows:  The National Library of Medicine will use  NASA's newest communications satellite, the  ATS-6,  in experiments  to extend physican  services and medcal education in Alaska and  the State of Washington. The NLM's Lister  Hill National Center  for Biomedical Com munications, working with the Health Serv ices Administration and  the Health Re sources Administration, will coordinate the  experiments.  The Applications  Technology  Satellite,  launched from the Kennedy Space Center on  May 30,  is the most versatile and powerful  communications satellite ever developed.  The communications network being de veloped by NLM will bring physicians into  regular  visual  contact with  the  remote  Alaskan villages of Galena  (pop. 425)  and  Fort Yukon (pop. 630)  for the first time.  Using the satellite's capability for  trans mitting high-quality  television, physicians  at  the  Indian Health Service hospital  in  Tanana and medical specialists in Anchorage  will be able to ""see"" patients at the two vil lages and will be able to prescribe treatment  and follow the patients' progress.  NLM  is also utilizing the satellite to im ...  prove medical education in the Washington Alaska-Montana-Idoha (W AMI)  region. The  University of Washington School of Medicine,  Seattle, will share its teaching resources with  first-year medical  students  in Fairbanks,  Alaska,  and with  thirdand  fourth-year  students at Omak, in central Washington.  Representing NLM at the launch site were  Melvin S. Day, deputy director, and Earl  Henderson, chief of  the LHNCBC Network  Engineering Communication and Operations  Branch.  Although  it is not exactly a  household  term, NLM's Lister Hill National Center for  Biomedical Communications  is  having  a  direct impact on the lives of many Ameri cans, including New Englanders, Alaskan na tives, and the elderly residents of a public  housing project in New York's East Harlem.  In ea.en case, the key to the Center's in volvement is to apply modern technology to  improve biomedical communication. The staff  of the Center turned to satellites as a means  of helping health professionals bridge great  distances.  Working with and coordinating the efforts  of the HSA and HRA, the Center set up in  the summer of 1971 a reliable voice commu nications link, via ATS-1 satellite, to con nect physicians at the hospital in Tanana  with the health aides in 26 outlying native  villages.  .SYSTEM SAVES LIVES  The experience gained with this network  has provided a solid basis for the expanded  experiments to be tried via ATS-6.  The  existing  audio  network  has  been  credited with saving lives in several medical  emergencies, such as severe burns from a  stove explosion and, in a separate case, seri ous complications during childbirth.  The  satellite  communications  network  made possible immediate step-by-step first24531  aid data for the village health aide followed  by prompt air evacuation for the patient.  ""More  important  in  the  long run,  than  these  spectacular  successes,""  according  to  NLM Director Dr. Martin M. Cummings, ""is  the dramatic  increase  in  the number of  patients treated with the advice of a physi cian  in  those villages where  the satellite  radio has been installed.  ""This consultation will be even more effec tive when the physician can actually see the  patient via high-quality  television  trans mitted by the AT8-6 satellite,"" Dr. eum mings said .

Mr. Cleveland, who  has ably served the university and the  people of Hawaii for 5 years, has been se lected to head an important new pro gram in international affairs at the As pen Institute of Humanistic Studies.  The institute, one of the world's larg est ""think tanks,'' attracts scholars and  artists from all over the world to partici pate in its varied programs. Originally  established to promote studies in the hu manities and arts, the institute has re cently applied  its unique  ""Aspen ap proach""  to a  broader  range of social  problems,  including  ""Communications  and Society,"" ""Environment and Quality  of Life,'' and ""Education for a Changing  Society."" Two new programs, ""Interna tional Affairs"" and ""Law, Justice anp the  Individual"" are to be added to this im pressive list.  Harlan Cleveland's selection to direct  the new program in international affairs  is a fitting tribute to his lifetime of serv ice to his fellow man. He will bring to  the institute a wide variety of experience  in education, politics, publishing and in ternational relations.  Mr. Cleveland, a graduate of Prince ton University and a Rhodes scholar, be gan his illustrious career in Washington,  D.C., as an intern in the office of progres sive Senator Robert M. LaFollette, Jr.,  of Wisconsin. In 1944, at the age of 26,  he was assigned to manage the economic  programs of the Allied Control Commis sion in Italy and later joined the United  Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Ad ministration,  serving  as  director  of  UNRRA's China program. After the war,  Mr. Cleveland was assigned to develop  economic aid programs  in other East  Asian countries and, during this period,  authored the phrase ""Revolution of Ris ing Expectations,"" which has been widely  quoted  by  development  economists  throughout the world.

One example of such an improvement  is my bill, H.R. 13158, which r can the  ""Fugitive Fathers Act.'' This. legislation  has received widespread support from lo cal welfare administrators and county  boards  in Wisconsin.

283,,93,0.181,128,22,Mr. RONCALLO of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, I recently submitted testimony  before the National Parks and Recrea tion Subcommittee urging the expansion  and other reforms of the Land and Water  Conservation Act. I would like to share  these remarks with my colleagues be cause, regardless of our individual views  on the recent land use bill, the fund pro vides a viable mechanism for the pro tection of our environment.  My statement follows:  LET Us ""SAVE OUTDOOR AMERICA""  Mr. Chairman, I  a.ppreciate the opportu nity to offer  testimony in support of H.R.  15740, the Save Outdoor America Act, which  I have co-sponsored, and other leglsle.t1on to  expand the Land and Water Conservation  Fund.  The bill ls aptly na.med, because unless the  fund ls greatly increased, the encroachment  of urban sprawl upon our remaining green  space and our beaches will soon lose what  chance remains for our children and grand children to enjoy the natural beauty of this  great Nation.  The need is now, the time for this legis lation is now and the mechanism for fund ing is available now. It ma.y not be next year.  The Save Outdoor America Act would finance  an expansion of the fund to $1 billion by  earmarking additional  revenues  from  off shore oil leases, but committees throughout  this Congress are already carving up the pie.  I am not a proponent of offshore oil drill ing, despite my commitment to Project In dependence. Until technology catches up to  desire, drilling on  the Outer Continental  Shelf poses a great risk to the very wetlands  which share in the Land and Water Con servation Fund.  My own personal views in favor of our ecol ogy notwithstanding, offshore  leasing  is a  fact in several of our coastal areas and does  generate substantial revenue to the Federal  Government. It seems only  fitting,  there fore, that monies from those who risk the  destruction of our environment be first used  to help preserve it. An expanded Land and  Water Conservation Fund should have first  call on  these revenues. Other worthy pro grams and the general treasury can partic ipate in the remainder.  Mr. Chairinan, the need for a vast expan sion of the Fund is manifest in the example  of just one small corner of our country. Nas sau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island,  which I am proud to represent in Congress,  together with loc~l municipal governments  and New York State have made a strong com mitment to the acquisition and development  of green spaces and wetlands for conserva tion and  recreational purposes consistent  with the environment. The bi-county area  presently has pending with the State appli cations for grants totaling $163 million. As suming an average 50 per cent federal share  that is $81.5 million, or 45 per cent of the  Fund allocated to the States in the Interior  appropriation which  recently  passed  the  House, and  this  is only  two counties, not  the whole state. The non-federal funds for  these projects are already available. We've  done our part in New York, but we cannot  do it alone.  Obviously, we are not going to get 45 per  cent of the allocation for assistance to States  in FY75, but the predicament of the Long  Island environment gives rise to two impor tant points. First of all, the Fund must be  vastly increased. In the la.st fiscal year only  $76.223 million were  appropriated. These  projects have been standing by and State  funds have been gathering dust while we  watch the cost of land, labor and materials  rise dramatically and while those areas to  be acquired remain open to private devel opment.  Secondly, the arbitrary seven per cent limit  on allocations to any one state must be re moved from the la.w. On a. per ca.pita. basts,  New York and other largely urbanized states  receive  le.ss  than one-tenth of the appor tionment granted  to  the  least populous  states. Let's face it: land costs more, every thing connected with  these projects costs  more, in our urban states, and they are the  ones with the least open space left and there fore in greatest need of assistance.  What also seems to have been forgotten  1s that 40 per cent of the Fund 1s used for  Federal projects, nearly all of them far from  our centers of population. If the majority  of our population is to be able to enjoy the  benefits of what ls left of our natural re sources  reasonably  close  to  their homes,  equity dictates that the p~ntage limitation  be removed. I would suggest to the subcom mittee that the well-intentioned amendment  to raise that limit to ten per cent is not the  answer. I find no fault wtth the 60-40 split  between State and Federal projects, but  the state allocations should be determined  by a  formula  to  include population, unit  costs of acquisition and development, ex tent of State and local commitment and an  inverse ratio to the Federal projects support ed by the fund in each state.  Parenthetically, I warmly endorse the pro posal made during these hearings by the dis tinguished Commissioner of the New York  State Office of Parks and Recreation,  the  Honorable Alexander  Aldrich,  suggesting  that states with extreme seasonal variances  in climate be permitted  to use a minor  portion of their allocation to enclose selected  recreational facilities so that they may be  utilized on a year-round basis.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to append to  these remarks for inclusion in the hearing  record, a  list of the backlogged projects in  Nassau and Suffolk Counties, plus a minor  share of one project which goes over  into  Queens County. The logjam can be broken if  interested  funding  is  authorized  for  the  Land and Water Conservation Fund.  I would  like  to conclude  these  remarks  with a  thought which may not have been  considered previously in these hearings. As  most of the members of the subcommittee  are aware, I was a leader in the fight against  the Land Use bill, and indeed was the first  to call the attention of the House to what I  consider the dangers of that piece of legis lation. Among the many reasons for my op position to the Land Use bill as written was  that the impact of restrictions for the pub lic good on the use of private land was not  borne by society as a whole, but by the few  whose property happened to fall in the re stricted areas. This is not only of doubtful  constitutionality, but  is of very doubtful  morality as well.  I  remain, however, deeply committed  to  preserving our environment for future gen erations to enjoy, and I stress the word en joy. An expension o! the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, coupled with better en vironmental management of Federal lands,  is the perfect substitution for the Land Use  bill. If a state or local government wants to  preserve green spaces and beaches for  the  public good, but to the detriment of prop erty owners, the right and proper thing to do  is to condemn the land under the right of  eminent domain and pay a fair price for it.  This can be done through the Fund. Fur thermore, the land does not remain in pri vate hands-useless to its owner and closed  to the public. Instead, it can be developed  for recreational uses consistent with the en vironment and available to all the people.  Mr. Chairman, I urge swift enactment of  the Save Outdoor America Act and related  provisions to expand a.nd improve the Land  and Water Conservation Fund.

285,House,93,-0.073,284,22,Mr. BRINKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, in his  address to the joint session of Congress  last week, President Ford accurately ad judged inflation as ""public enemy No. l,''  and pledged to us his total effort at uni fying the Nation in a concerted campaign  against this problem. I have faith in his  ability to do this.  As one of his first recommendations,  the President urged the Congress to re establish a cost of living monitoring sys tem within  the Federal Government,  while at the same time he vowed that  there would not be a reestablishment of  wage and price controls. Upon hearing  the President make  this recommenda tion, my immediate reaction was one of  surpise; I told a reporter who asked my  reactions, in fact, that it came as a ""jolt.""  After  all,  the  former Cost of Living  Council had been so closely related to  wage and price controls, which many  think now were a disaster and very well  might have caused more harm than good  to the economy.  It is clear now, Mr. Speaker, that what  the President was asking for was a task  force  that would monitor wages  and  prices along with other aspects of the  economy, and would recommend to the  President actions  that could be  taken  with regard to private business, Federal  agencies and other sectors, with an eye  toward  generally  increasing  supplies  while holding back prices. The Cost of  Living Task Force, in essence, will be  giving public exposure to conditions in  the economy, while not possessing  the  powerful controls which the former Cost  of Living Council had.  I think that we all must face the real ities  of  the  economic  situation, Mr.  Speaker, and acknowledge the necessity  of an oversight panel such as that mged  by the President. But we all must de mand, in return for supporting the re quest, that the panel-the task force stay within its legal bounds and not be come  another  agency  for  controlling  wages and prices.  In this regard, I am bothered some what by the rather high budget, $1 mil lion, requested for the task force, and by  the fact that the bill provides for a direc tor and deputy director at salaries of  $38,000 and $36,000 a year respectively;  and provides for the hiring of ""a neces sary number"" of additional personnel at  supergrade salary  levels  ranging from  $32,806 to $36,000 yearly. I for one want  to go on record as urging and hoping that  the  task force will hold  its personnel  needs to a minimum, that the personnel  hired will justify their presence on the  payroll, and that the Cost of Living Task  Force itself will set an example for the  rest of the Nation.  What we need now, Mr. Speaker, is not  another bureaucracy. Indeed, we learned  through the Cost of Living Council that  this is no answer for inflation. What we  mgently need is a  trustworthy weapon  against ""public enemy No.  l,"" and the  seriousness of the problem requires that  the Cost of Living Task Force contribute  meaningfully to that goal.  ",1974
286,House,93,-0.339,310,22,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise 1n  support of the bill H.R. 14897,  legisla tion which will expand and make per manent, the Youth Conservation Corps.  This program is a proven success. I was  pleased  to cosponsor  the  legislation 4  years ago which created the YCC, and I  am pleased today to cosponsor this leg islation which will make  the YCC  a  permanent Federal program.  In 1970 the Youth Conservation Corps  was created. It was to be modeled after  the famous Civilian Conservation Corps  of  the 1930's which provided  tens of  thousands of persons with employment,  while making great advances  in con servation efforts. The new YCC program  was hailed by many in this Nation, and  now 4 years  later,  it appears to have  exceeded everyone's expectations both in  terms of providing employment for young  Americans and tending to some key con servation projects.  For the first 3 years,  the YCC pro vided over 10,000 Americans between the  ages of 16 and 19 with gainful employ ment. In addition, it has been estimated  that the YCC accomplished some $4.5  million worth of high-priority conserva tion work on Federal lands.  Yet despite  these glowing statistics,  the YCC  since  the outset ha-s  been  hampered by inadequate funding. While  Congress raised the authorization levels  for fiscal years 1973 and 1974, the admin istration requested only enough appro priations to employ 10,000 persons for  the current summer, far below the num ber who were seeking these jobs.  This legislation today seeks to provide  the YCC with a more viable and realistic  budget so as to continue their work. The  program will now become permanent  with an annual authorization  level of  $60 million. If this full amount is appro priated, it is expected that some 60,000  persons a year can be employed by this  program.  This program takes on added signif icance when measured against the fact  that traditionally young people between  the ages of 16 and 19 suffer one of the  highest levels of unemployment of any  group in this Nation. This is particularly  true in the nonschool months of summer  when the demand for jobs is especially  high. In June of 1974 the unemployment  rate fo1 this group of Americans reached  15.6 percent, some 10 percent higher than  the national average.  We as a nation are more concerned  about  the consequences of unemploy ment among our youth, because in the  long  idle hours of the summer, many  well-intentioned young men or women  have found themselves engaging in nonconstructive activities instead of enjoying  the virtues of hard work which many of  them would prefer.  Not only does the YCC provide  jobs  for young people, it also provides them  with an education. Their education con sists of having an opportunity to work  directly with nature, and gaining a last ing  respect  for our Nation's environ ment. It educates them to work closely  with young people their own age. And  above  all,  it provides  them with an  education on the value of a dollar.  Throughout the hearings which were  conducted on this bill glowing testimony  was received by beneficiaries of the YCC  program, who recounted their own per sonal observations on the unic_ue experi ence of working for the protect.ion of our  Nation's environment.  In a  time when this Nation is con cerned about inflation and wasteful Gov ernment spending, it should be pointed  out that for each dollar spent on YCC,  an estimated 79 cents was returned to  the Government in the form of conser vation work and improvements on public  lands. Further, by providing jobs, it re duces unemployment, which is an inte gral cause for the unprecedented levels  of inflation we have today.  Mr. Speaker,  all of my  colleagues  should relish the opportunity to pass leg islation as worthwhile as this. We have  a stake in the future of the youth of this  Nation as well as a stake in preserving  and protecting our environment, both  for owselves and our children. The YCC  is a program designed to assist both these  concerns. It deserves your support and I  am confident that it will receive it.  ",1974
287,House,93,-0.278,310,22,Mr. GAYDOS.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in  support of this legislation.  The pmpose of  this legislation  is  to  expand and make permanent the Youth  Conservation Corps whict was estab lished in 1970.  After  several unsuccessful attempts,  Congress finally passed the Youth Con servation Corps Act in 1970. This wa.s a  pilot program which provided summer  employment for 2,600 youths, age 14 to  18, in 1971, and 3,500 youths of that age  in 1972. The act was amended in 1972  to expand the scope of the program both  in the number of youths employed as  well as to provide for a Federal-State  cost-sharing program.  In 1973,  3,500  youths were employed  for  the 8-week  program, out of 100,000 applicants. In  1974,  there were 10,000 participants in  the program, with States participating  for the first time in this program, with  3,500 of the 10,000 engaged in the State  program.  This program has been highly success ful. It ha.s a twofold effect in that it pro vides  summer employment  for youths  representing  all  segments  of  society,  while at the same time, many conserva tion projects have been undertaken. In  the first 2 years of the program, $4,464,000 worth of high priority conservation  work was performed on Federal lands.  It is estimated that out of every dollar  spent in the program, 79 cents has been  returned to the Government in the form  of improvements on Federal lands. This,  of course, is the most obvious financial  retw'Il on the investment. But the other  ",1974

290,House,93,-0.396,323,22,Mr. MORGAN.," Mr. Speaker, it is my  great pleasure  to support H.R. 14217,  which provides for  increases in appro priation ceilings and boundary changes  in certain units of  the National Park  System  and  authorizes  appropriations  for additional costs of land acquisition.  The House Committee on Interior and  Insular Affairs, chaired by Congressman  HALEY, and its Subcommittee on National  Parks and Recreation, chaired by Con gressman TAYLOR, have spent a great  deal of time conducting hearings and de veloping this important legislation. Like  many of you, I had the pleasure of testi fying before the Subcommittee on Na tional Parks and Recreation, and I would  like to commend the distinguished Mem bers who have worked to produce this  omnibus bill, which is a composite of the  various individual measures which had  been introduced.  Mr. Speaker, one of the historical sites  which this bill is concerned with is the  Fort Necessity National Battlefield, which  is located in my congressional district. At  the present time, the battlefield consists  of 350 acres. An additional 150 acres have  been authorized, but have not yet been  acquired.  This  legislation authorizes the addi tion of approximately 411 acres, so that  the total battlefield acreage, as a result  of  this  legislation, will amount to 911  acres. H.R. 14217 authorizes the appro priation of $607,000 for a new ceiling of  $722,000 for land acquisition. When ap propriated,  this money should be suf ficient to accomplish the acquisition of  the former 150 acres remaining to be  acquired, along with the additional 411  acres authorized by this legislation. One  235-acre tract is a portion of a  larger  parcel once owned by George Washing ton and constitutes his original  land  patent at Fort Necessity.  If you are not familiar with the his torical significance of Fort Necessity, I  would like to briefly note the highlights.  The Battle of Great Meadows was fought  here on July 3, 1754, and the skirmish  was a turning point in American history.  It marked the beginning of the French  and Indian War between England and  France for control of the North Amer ican Continent, a war so expensive that  the  excessive  taxes  levied  upon  the  Colonies by Great Britain precipitated  the War of Independence. In addition,  the Battle of Great Meadows marked the  first major episode in the military career  of George Washington.  Mr. Speaker, I have always believed  that the preservation and restoration of  our historic sites are key functions of the  Federal Government. If we ue to pass  along to our children and grandchildren  an appreciation for American history, it  is imperative that we support legislation  such  as H.R.  14217,  and  I  urge  its  passage today.  ",1974
291,House,93,-0.233,323,22,Mr. ROUSH.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in  support of H.R. 14217 which provides for  increases in appropriations ceilings and  boundary changes in certain units of the  national park system and for other pur poses.  I support the bill in its entirety, but  there is one part that is of special in terest to me and that is the section deal ing with  the Indiana Dunes National  Lakeshore, which raises the authoriza tion ceiling to $35,526,000.  When that lakeshore was authorized  in 1966  the land acquisition ceiling of  $27,900,000 was established. To complete  land purchase we now need to raise that  authorization celling to $35,526,000 or an  additional $7,626,000.  Since 1966 when 8,330 acres were au thorized for acquisition, 3,490 acres have  been acquired. The Department of the  Interior informs me that some 2,600 acres  have to be acquired, if at all, by dona tion-these are either State park lands or  other lands in public ownership. So, 1,872.55 acres in private ownership remain  to be acquired by purchase.  The entire amount authorized for land  acquisition by the 1966 act has now been  appropriated, and all but approximately  $1 million, according to the Department  of the Interior, which is being held as a  departmental  contingency  reserve  to  meet deficiency judgments, has been ex pended as of last fall.  The Department has reported that the  increase in acquisition costs over the 1966  estimates is in part attributable to infla tion in land values and in part to a de cision by the U.S. Court of Appeals con cerning  the proper method of valuing  certain tracts. Deficiency judgments will  take up part of the additional funds and  administrative costs, of course, are fig ured in as well.  The Department of the Interior has  concurred  in  this  request  for  the  in creased authorization ceiling as well.  The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore  is a  unique combination of  lakefront,  dunes, hinterland that is not only eco logically valuable as a study site, but is  ideally suited to the fulfillment of the  recreational and open-space needs of the  people of the region.  Mr. Speaker, I have visited the dunes  frequently over the years. I have walked  the area and camped out with people who  love  that beautiful, peaceful .setting.  I  wish I could bring to you a full realization  of the beauty and wonder of the area. I  want to see it preserved and used for the  enjoyment and enrichment .of millions of  people' not only from the .Midwest, but  from the whole United States. We have  something special there. The legislation  before us today will allow us to compl~te  purchase of the land authorized and is  therefore particularly important.

In light of the Turkish aggression on  Cyprus, I have joined with the gentle man from Indiana (Mr. BRADEMAs), the  gentleman from Maine (Mr. KYRos, the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. YAT  RON,  and  the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. BAFALIS, along with 72 other Mem bers of the House, in introducing House  Resolution 1319 which calls for a cutoff  of all military and economic assistance  and all military sales to Turkey until all  of Turkey's Armed Forces have been  withdrawn from Cyprus. Mr. Speaker, I  invite other Members of the House who  may not already have done so to join in  cosponsoring House Resolution 1319, the  text on which follows this statement.  Mr. Speaker, last night I was privileged  to address  in Boston  the 52d Annual  Convention of the Order of Ahepa, the  Nation's largest Greek-American frater nal order, on the tragic consequences of  U.S. policy with regard to Cyprus. The  text of this address is set out below:  HOUSE RESOLUTION 1319  Resolved, That it is the sense of the House  of Representatives that(1) all military, economic, or other assist ance, all sales of defense articles and srevices  (whether for cash or by credit, guarantee, or  any other means), all sales of agricultural  commodities (whether for cash, credit, or by  other means) , and all licenses with respect to  the  transportation of arms, ammunitions,  and implements of war (including technical  data relating thereto) to the Government of  Turkey should be suspended on the date of  adoption of this resolution; and  (2) the provisions of this resolution should  cease to apply when the President reports to  the Congress that the Government of Turkey  has withdrawn all of its armed forces from  Cyprus.  STATEMENT OF CONGRESSMAN PAUL S. SAR BANES  (D.-MD.)  ORDER  OF AHEPA,  52D  ANNUAL CONVENTION, BOSTON, MASS., SUN DAY, AUGUST 18, 1974  Reverend clergy,  fellow members of  the  AHEPA family and all true friends of liberty  and justice. Tonight I  join with fierce de termination in your efforts to achieve peace  and justice for the suffering people of Cyprus  and  fair and honorable  treatment for  the  people of Greece.  The recent events on the historic Greek  islands of Cyprus have once again tested the  bravery of the Cypriot people and the con science of us all. As one Greek Cypriot sol dier,  fighting on a  front  line with only a  bolt-action rifle and supported by obsolete  armored cars and a few tanks almost thirty  years old told a journalist, ""write that Greeks  are never afraid."" When he said that he was  fighting against some of the most modern,  sophisticated weapons in the world; weapons  provided by the American taxpayer to Tur key, but provided for defensive purposes and  not for despicable actions of aggression.  We meet here to join in an effort to restore  the  independence and  integrity of Cyprus  and  to aid  its people to meet the critical  problems of survival now facing them. Re member that at this very moment thousands  of  refugees  in Cyprus, victims of Turkish  aggression, are Without  food,  shelter, and  medical care and in need of immediate as sistance. We must do all we can to respond  to that need at once.  We meet here to press forward with the  cause of  justice for  the people of Cyprus.  We must pursue this goal not only because  of our close ties with those of Greek heritage  but, perhaps more importantly, because the  Turkish invasion of this small, independent  and peaceful country violated every princi ple of international law and every precept  of human decency. Turkey's military action  was carried out in direct violation of United  Nation's resolutions and in the face of con demnation by world opinion. Let there be no  doubt about it, Cyprus is the victim of ag gression,  raw and brutal aggression which  has brought death and destruction to that  lovely country. It is a grievous wrong and  we must work to make the situation right.  As Americans we should be deeply con cerned and troubled by the position our State  Department has taken with respect to this  crisis. Despite repeated warnings from many  sources, including members of the Congress  and representatives of your organization and  many other concerned groups, the State De partment at every critical juncture has failed  to take action to avert the tragedy now con fronting us.  1. It refused to support Archbishop Maka rios, the democratically elected President of  Cyprus, when such support could have pre served stability and peace on Cyprus.  2. It failed to prevent Turkish military in tervention by denouncing  the  attempted  coup in Cyprus and stressing the need  to  preserve constitutional government in Cy prus.  3. It refused to bring pressure to bear on  Turkey  to prevent the  invasion of Cyprus  and to limit and restrict Turkish military  action once such an invasion occurred. Con trast,  if you will,  the actions of the  late  President Johnson, who warned a Turkey  preparing to go to war in no uncertain terms  of the American Government's position and  thereby preserved peace in the area.  4. It failed to consider the need to be un derstanding and supportive of a democratic  regime in Greece, thereby placing in danger  our traditional friendship.  Let us look for a moment, because it is  important to our understanding of this mat ter, at the statements our State Department  has issued on this tragic matter during the  past week and  the  interpretations placed  upon them.  Item: On Wednesday, August 14th, State  Department spokesman, Robert J. Mccloskey  stated, in response to charges that U.S. policy  was  favoring Turkey, ""I  think it is plain  baloney that the United States is tilting to ward any one party or other in this dispute.""  Item: Just  the day before, on Tuesday,  August 13th, the State Department issued a  statement on Cyprus in which it stated the  U.S. position to be as follows: ""We recognize  the position of the Turkish community on  Cyprus  requires considerable  improvement  and protection. We have supported a greater  degree of autonomy for them.""  ""The parties are negotiating on one or  more  Turkish  autonomous  areas.  The  avenues  of  diplomacy  have  not  been  exhausted. And, therefore, the United States  would consider a  resort to military action  unjustified. We have made this clear to all  parties.""  Notice my friends that this statement was  directed to all parties at a time when it was  obvious to everyone that only Turkey was  engaged  in  aggressive  military  aotion.  Furthermore, the comments favoring greater  autonomy for the Turks on Cyprus was made  at the very time that a desperate effort was  underway to prevent the Geneva talks from  collapsing. As  one diplomat  subsequently  observed: ""In the day's context those were  the magic words Turkey had been waiting  for.""  Item: On Wednesday morning, August  14th at 5 a.m. Turkish forces began major  aggressive military actions With air strikes  and tank and troop movements directed at  Nicosia and Famagusta.  Item: British F01reign Secretary  James  Callaghan,  returning  home  from Geneva  following  the  renewed Turkish mllitary  action, said: ""A great opportunity has been  thrown away. All we needed in Geneva was  another 36 hours to work out a solution. All  that has been thrown away."" He went on to  express the belief that the Turkish orders  to attack were issued before Turkey walked  out of the Geneva peace conference.  Item:  In London, Archbishop Makarios  stated: ""I am in particular disappointed at  the attitude of  the United States which  could, I believe, have prevented Turkey from  invading Cyprus or at least put an end to  the ag,gression.""  Item: On Wednesday, August 14th, in the  face of Turkey's flagrant action, the State  Department  finally  issued  its  first public  criticism stating ""We deplore  the Turkish  resort to the use of force"". However it then  went on to issue warnings to both Turkey  and Greece by stating ""If Greece and Turkey,  two NATO allies, were  to resort to war it  should be clear that they could not count on  a continuing line of military supply from the  United  States.""  Imagine,  with  Turkey  actively moving as an aggressor, the State  Department  felt  compelled  to warn both  sides.  Item: On Thursday, August 15th, Turkish  Prime Minister Ecevit after a meeting with  Ambassador William Macomber  in  Ankara told reporters Turkey is very happy  with the ""frank and open"" U.S. policy on  Cyprus.

It dealt with the ""Special Skills  and Requirements"" that Congressmen's  offices list for applicants for employment  on the forms of that agency-such as  ""No southern accents, white only.""  At first blush this might be thought to  be racially discriminatory. But on more  careful  examination  any  fair-minded  person will conclude that this is not nec essarily so. Any person, black or white,  from climes closer to the sun than Bos ton, might commit errors in pronuncia tion which would grate on Massachusetts  ears. For instance, what $8,000 clerk stenographer from Mississippi would not  fall into the old southern way of drop ping the ""r"" in the word ""idear""?  And then, too, although a southerner  from Georgia of whatever color would  apply the meticulous accuracy of Mas sachusetts speech to the name of the island in the Indian Ocean, ""Diego Gah ciah,"" a southerner from, say, Browns ville,  Tex., might  erroneously  insert  an ""r.""  Such use of  the language could not  help but be a source of daily embarrass ment to both New England staff and  Massachusetts constitutent alike and to  all who speak the immaculate and unal loyed King's English  of  the Boston  waterfront.

",1974
299,House,93,-0.367,518,22,Mr. ULLMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  in con nection with the pension reform bill let  me alert the Members as to how the mat ter of integration between the pension  programs and the social security system  will be handled.  Many of us have received  telegrams  expressing  concern about one of  the  provisions  in the conference report on  the Employee Retirement Security Act  of 1974.  am referring to section 1021  (g), which appears on pages 131 and 132  of the conference report of the House  Committee on Ways and Means.  This provision would provide that until  July 1, 1976, pension plans cannot in crease their level of integration of social  security with private pension plans by  taking into account changes in the so cial security wage base or in social se curity benefit levels since 1971. We have  been told that this will greatly increase  the costs of private pension plans, some thing that I am sure none of the Mem bers of the House would like to see occur.  This  is particularly  true  if these  creased pension costs result in the ter mination of private pension plans. Cer tainly that is not the intent of this leg islation which  is designed  to  improve  and encourage the expansion of private  pension plans.  Personally, I  am not sure that those  who tell us that their funding costs will  be substantially increased because of the  2-year freeze provided in this provision  are correct in their analysis. If there are  substantial increases in costs,  believe  that this arises from the belief on the  part of the private pension plan actu aries involved that once this freeze oc curs there will be no further integration  of social security and private pension  plans hereafter. This certainly was not  the intent of the 2-year freeze included  in the bill.  recognize, however,  that  this has  caused a great deal of concern, and I  personally do not want to detract from  this fine piece of legislation by the cre ation of any confusion on  this  issue.  For that reason I have consulted with  the conferees, and they have indicated a  willingness to delete this provision from  the conference report. The technique for  doing this is by action on a concurrent  resolution  immediately  following  the  adoption of the conference report,  in structing  the  enrolling  clerk  of  the  in I  I  ",1974
300,House,93,-0.383,700,22,Mr. WRIGHT.," Mr. Chairman,  this  amendment would simply limit to not  more than 10 percent of the total funds  available under category C the amount  that the Secretary might grant under  that category to any one wbanized area.  few days ago the gentleman from  Texas <Mr. MILFORD)  offered a similar  amendment which would have applied to  categories A and B. The House apparent ly felt that it was inappropriate with re spect to category A inasmuch as there  are only nine enumerated communities  presently  included  in category A,  al though I believe it was the intention of  the gentleman from Texas <Mr. MIL FORD)  that we should anticipate the pos sible futwe admission of additional com munities.  The House probably felt that such a  limitation was unnecessary with respect  to category B, since category B's funds  are distributed in any event to the States  upon a population formula.  However, category C lends itself ideal ly to the application of such a restric tion since category C contains 27 per cent of all the moneys authorized in this  bill and since the disbwsement of this  money is entirely discretionary with the  Secretary of Transportation. Under cate gory C as the bill presently is drafted,  the Secretary presumably and at least  conceivably could grant all of that money  to one urbanized area of the 269 which  are intended to be covered by this section.  Therefore, it seems logical to me that  as a protection for all of those ubanized  areas we at least ought to have this mini mum restriction that in any given calen dar year no more than 10 percent of  those  discretionary  funds  should  be  granted to any one urbanized area. This  would afford some measure of protection  for the other 268.  I do not believe that this is unrealistic.  Certainly it would not be inconsistent  with our previous actions. The UMT A  legislation imposed a  restriction of not  more than 12 percent for any one State.  This would not be unduly restrictive  to any community in my opinion, since  10 percent of the amounts authorized in  the present bill  for  fiscal  year 1975  would be $20 million, to which the Sec retary would be held for any one com munity. For fiscal year 1976,  it would  simply prevent his giving any one com munity more  than $67 million under  category C, for fiscal year 1977 not more  than $110 million, or for the entire fiscal  period of 6 years he could not give more  than $539 million from category C  to  any one of the 269 communities. Surely  that is a substantial amount of money  for any one community to receive, par ticularly since it would come in addition  to the amounts guaranteed under cate gory B.  So I think it is a reasonable restriction  and one with which the Members surely  should agree.  ",1974

Mr. Chairman, with regard to any spe cial limitations in certain States on the  size of trucks, and what one State al lows, let me say as one who lives in the  State of New York I am concerned about  truck  traffic  in New York.  I am con cerned about the safety of those on the  highways which have been built in New  York. To cite one State as an example,  and say because that State has gone to a  high limit we should advocate that is  questionable. The leadership at this level  in this body should say we want to look at  the limits of all this country in terms of  what they should be consistent with traf fic safety. To abdicate our responsibility  and say whatever a State wants to legis late, if they want to go as high as New  York, is all right with us is irresponsible.  Maybe New Yorlc is too high at this mo ment. I believe it is. I do not think we  should be saying leave it to the States  because whatever they do is all right and  they are responsible. I believe that we  as a deliberate body c,ught to be respon sible in controlling the Interstate System.  I believe the time has come to say how  big the trucks should be. The alternative  is to look at the rail system. When New  York went to higher limits our rail sys tem went into bankruptcy.  We need an integrated transit system  in this country. Let us look down the  road before we go  to the super, super  trucks. There is a responsibility in this  body. Let us not abdicate it to the State  legislatures.  ",1974

Davis, a  leading and beloved  citizen of our community, while he was  on an official visit to Sweden.  AI Davis was director of Milwaukee's  International Institute, an organization  devoted to the welfare of many ethnic  minorities-of all nations,  races,  and  creeds. Our city has been a better place  in which to live because of his great skill  at bringing together in common goals  people of varying and sometimes hostile  points of view.  We in Milwaukee believe that Amer ica  is strengthened by the infusion of  nationalities from abroad. AI Davis was  a symbol of that belief and of the effort  to help ethnic Americans shape lives of  fulfillment and prosperity within the so cietal framework shaped by our Consti tution.  Perhaps Mr. Davis' best known accom plishment--and one which gave him na tional recognition as an ethnic leader was the annual Holiday Folk Fair.  Begun as a means of making the art  and  culture  of  various  nationalities  known to one another, the Folk Fair has  become an annual event which draws  thousands of persons from throughout  the Middle West to view handicrafts, eat  national  delicacies  and  enjoy  ethnic  dances.  My wife, Blanche, joins me in express ing our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Davis  and the Davis family upon their loss.  Mr. Speaker, at this point I should like  to  include in the RECORD an editorial  from the Milwaukee Journal of August  14 on Mr. Davis, and his obituary from  the Milwaukee Sentinel of August 13. The  latter provides a description of the many  activities which Mr. Davis engaged in to  the benefit of our community and his  fellow men.  The articles follow:  ALBERT M. DA VIS  Milwaukee's ethnic community, and all  who appreciate  the color and diversity  it  brings to the city, have lost a friend in the  death of Albert M. Davis. De.vis who died un expectedly while traveling in Sweden, was ex ecutive director of the International Insti tute. A native Milwaukeean who, in a sense,  became a citizen of the world, Davis was the  backbone of the annual Holiday Folk Fair.  His skill at bringing  together diverse and  sometimes hostile ethnic groups will be sorely  missed. His concern for people, shown in 11  years of service on the Wisconsin Health and  Socia.I Services Board, made him a va.I ued and  respected citizen of the entire state. His un timely death creates a void.  August 20', 1974  INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE CHIEF, DAVIS  DIES  Funeral  services are being arranged  for  Albert M. Davis, 52, executive director of the  International Institute of Milwaukee Coun ty, Inc.  Davis died Friday in Stockholm, Sweden,  of an unknown ca.use. Swedish officials said  an autopsy was to be performed but it was  believed he died of natural causes.  Davis, of 12315 Christine Dr., Wauwatosa,  was  in Sweden to attend an  international  folk festival.  A nationally known ethnic leader, Davis  became head of the International Institute  in 1958. The institute co-ordinates the an nual Holiday Folk Fair of which Davis was  also executive director.  Before ta.king the institute position, Davis  was a welfare worker in the Milwaukee Coun ty Welfare Department and an aide to former  Mayor Frank P. Zeidler.  He also had been the Democratic Party  vice chairman for the 5th Congressional Dis trict.  Davis had been a member of  Health and Socia.I Services Board.  He also was a member of the National As sociation of Social Workers, The Interna tional Festival Association and the Ethnic  Advisory Council.  Davis was a member of local posts of the  Ainerican Legion and the Veterans of For eign Wars. He also was a member of  the  Tripoli Temple.  He was graduated in 1948 from Marquette  University and received a master's degree in  social work from the University of Wiscon sin-Madison in 1955.  He was a veteran of World War II.

Paradoxically, the purposes of parame ters of such a program are not ade quately or clearly discernible  from  a  reading of the legislation or the accom panying committee report. In fact, H.R.  13565 is a somewhat amateurish, unpro fessional approach  to a  segment of a  complex national energy situation.  H.R. 13565, as reported by the Com mittee on Interior and Insular Affairs,  falls short of what is a minimally ade quate measure either to stand alone or  to compliment the Energy Reorganiza tion Act of 1974, which establishes the  Energy Research and Development Ad ministration-ERDA. The ERDA struc ture which is about to be erected should  be suitably complimented. It should not  be encumbered by popular catchwords,  flourishes, fetishes, or wishful thinking  that are not clearly harmless and empty  of potentially adverse consequences. The  patent provisions are inartfully drafted  and create a thicket that would ensnare  ERDA and impede its programmatic ad vancement. In addition, there are several  prescriptions in H.R. 13565 regarding the  manner of pursuing energy research and  development that would constitute seri ous impediments to the conduct of such  programs, whether carried forward with  or without the management of the new  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  agency. H.R. 13565 incorporates several  impediments of  this nature  that will  doubtlessly lead to litigation, costly de lays, and other problems.  It is a difficult task to try and improve  an  unprofessional  product  through  amendments. Nevertheless,  conscience  dictates that such an effort be made and  therefore  I  shall off er amendments  to  H.R. 13565 or any substitute with sub stantially similar content, as follows:  AMENDMENT NO. 1  Page 38, line 2.

309,,93,-0.479,778,22,Mr. CARNEY of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  recently I received a very thoughtful let ter from one of my constituents who is  currently with  the Armed Forces sta tioned in Korea. In his letter, my constit uent expresses concern over U.S. policy  toward South Korea, particularly  the  absence of any  serious effort by  the  United States to encourage respect for  basic human, civil, and political rights  in South Korea. He asks the question:  ""Aren't we supposed to promote and en courage democracy?""  Mr. Speaker, I, too, have become in creasingly concerned about the billions  of dollars we are providing in foreign aid  to other countries with little or no regard  for  the way  the governments of  those  countries treat their own people. Accord ingly, I have joined a number of my col leagues in the Congress who have sent a  statement of concern  to Secretary of  State Kissinger. America cannot sur vive as an island of democracy in a sea  of totalitarianism. For this reason, I be lieve that a  thorough reexamination of  our Nation's foreign aid objectives  is  urgently needed. Mr. Speaker, I  insert  my constituent's letter and  the  letter  which I and my colleagues are sending  to the Secretary of State in the RECORD  at this time:  AUGUST 13, 1974.  CHARLES J. CARNEY,  Representative in Congress,  Youngstown, Ohio.  MR.  CONGRESSMAN: We  didn't  support  Hitler, we didn't support Mussolini. Why do  we support Park Chung Hee??? I am a service  man stationed in the 2'd Inf. Div. at Camp  Casey Korea and  formerly  resided on  the  West side of Youngstown. I attended Chaney  High School where  I've heard you  speak  several times. I've been in Korea for about  4 months now and am enjoying my tour  here. This is a good place to serve your time  and I have no desire to return to Stateside  duty until my current tour terminates next  spring. But one thing constantly plagues me,  and that is  the U.S. policy  toward aid  to  Korea. I  realize it would be foolish to cut  off all economic aid to South Korea but I  to use a  believe  it's time  little ""political  leverage"" on the current dictator of South  Korea. The people here have no freedom at  all. To voice discontent  is  to  risk being  thrown into prison as a communist instiga tor. The people here have no freedom of  speech, press, the right to peaceful demon stration, and many of the basic freedoms we  as Americans have  fought  for and value  so much. Aren't we supposed to promote and  encourage democracy? Last week a Catholic  bishop was thrown in prison for criticising  the Park regime. A spy from North Korea I  suppose. It's common practice to imprison  political  opposition. Although  they're no  threat to Park as far as elections are conEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  cerned, since he abolished presidential elec tions several years ago.  Who can blame the students in Seoul to  protest Parks government? Perhaps they are  the bravest people here realizing the penalty  they pay for disagreeing with dictatorship  is excessively harsh. Maybe we should give  them military and economic aid in the good  American tradition of fighting for liberty and  justice.  DRAFT-To THE SECRETARY OF STATE  . Th~ undersigned have supported  legisla tion in recent years providing economic and  military assistance to other nations. We are  troubled, however, about continued Ameri can assistance to a number of foreign gov ernments which are increasingly indifferent  to internationally recognized human rights  and deal with their own people in an in creasingly oppres.sive manner.  We recognize that a large number of coun tries are ruled by governments which  re strict the full observance of political rights  as we know them, including one-party and  authoritarian states. It may not be realistic  to expect strict observance of political, civil  and other human rights by  these govern ments while their political systems are still  evolving. Nevertheless,  even within  such  countries, the observance of certain funda ~ental human rights is practicable, includ ing freedom  from  torture, arbitrary arrest  and detention, and arbitrary curtailment of  exiSting political rights.  In the absence of extraordinary circum stances, we do not believe that long-term  U.S.  foreign policy  interests are served by  maintaining  supportive  relationships with  oppressive  governments,  especially  in  the  military field, since military power is directly  associated with the exercise of governmental  control over the civilian population.  Unless U.S. foreign aid policies--especially  military assistance policies-more accurately  reflect the  traditional commitment of  the  American people to promote human rights,  we will find it increasingly difficult to justify  support  for  foreign aid  legislation  to our  constituents. We cannot, in good conscience  associate ourselves with policies which lack  active concern about the fate of people living  under oppressive governments. While it may  be beyond our power to alleviate the plight  of those people, we can refuse to be identified  with their oppressors.  ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS OF  HOUSE RESOLUTION 1319  HON.

311,,93,-0.384,856,22,Mr. CHURCH.," Mr. President, as we all  know, Congress is still considering legis lation  to reform our campaign proce dures. Both the Senate and the House of  Representatives have passed campaign  reform bills, and we will be considering  a conference report soon.  Earlier this year, our colleague from  Delaware  (Mr. BmEN) wrote a major  article on the question of public financ ing of elections  for  the Northwestern  University Law Review.  In this article, Senator BmEN makes  an argument 1n favor of public :financing  of political campaigns which bears di rectly on the legislation now pending in  Congress. It is a provocative article, and  one which should be read by both propo nents and opponents of public :financing.  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Presi dent, that the article be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  {From Northwestern University Law Review,  Ma.rch-Aprll 1974)  PuBLIC PINANCXNG OF El'..ECTrONS: LEGISLATIVE  P&OPOSALS AND 0oNSTITUT:tONAL QuESTIONS  {By Joseph R. Blden, Jr.)  During my ca.mpa.lgn for the United States  Senate in 1972, I pa.id a visit to certain leadvited me  thing, and it  ers of a labor union whose members worked  in the aircraft industry, ancl who intended. to  contribute $5,000 to the campaigns of vari ous Senate candidates. It was an honest and  open procedure, and payment was by check.  They asked what my chances of winning  were, and I explained for perhaps the hun dredth time of the campaign why I thought  I would win. I want to emphasize that no  one asked me to promise my vote on any  particular issue, but they did ask, ""Well, Joe,  had you been in the ninety-second Congress,  how would you have :voted on the SST? 1 And  while you are at it, how would you have  voted on balling out Lockheed?"" s A candidate  does not have  to be very sophisticated  to  know the correct answers to such questions  posed by labor leaders.  Later in the campaign, when I  began to  show strength in the polls and it looked as  though  I  might  win,  thirteen multi millionaire Republicans from my state  in to cocktails. The spokesman ~or  the group said, ""Well, .Joe, let us get right  to it. You are a young man and it looks as  if you may win  this da.mii.  appears that we underestimated you. Now,  Joe, we would like to ask you a few ques tions. We know that everybody running for  public office feels compelled to talk about tax  reform, and we know that you have been  talking tax reform, particularly capital gains  and gains for  Inlllionaires by consequence  of unearned income."" Then one man leaned  over, patted me on the knee in a. fatherly  fashion, and said-as if to say it was just  among us-""Joe, you really don't mean what  you say about capital gains, do you?"" Again,  I knew what the right answer to that ques tion was worth $20,000 in contributions.  I did not give  the ""correct"" answers  in  either instance, and accordingly, I  received  no money. But it is no secret that, in similar  situations, other candidates have not hesi tated to answer ""correctly,"" feeling that it  is better to win their elections even while  compromising certain principles, than to lose  With all  their principles remaining intact.a  Certainly few politicians would choose to be  included in a second edition of Profiles  Courage at the expense of a  long and pro ductive political life. To say the least. a polit ical system which  requires such a  choiee  deserves serious re-examination. On the basis  of such an inquiry, I have concluded that  the present system of ca.mpaign  financing  should be reformed, and a system of public  financing of elections consistent with con stitutional mandates adopted.'  in.  POLITICAL DARWI?nSM: THE POOR GET POORER  AND THE RICH GET ELECTED  There  are  three principal  reasons why  existing campaign financing practices should  be reformed. First, an electoral system sup ported solely by private contributions affords  certain wealthy  individuals or special  in terest groups  the potential for exerting a  disproportionate  influence over both  the  electoral mechanism and the policy-ma.king  processes of  the government. Second,  the  concept of Ainerlcan democracy presumes  that  all  citizens,  regardless  of  personal  wealth, have equal access  to  the political  process.5 Under the present system of financ ing, however,  the  individual of moderate  means lacks the financial resources necessary  to mount an effective campaign and, there fore,  is precluded  from attaining elective  public office. Third, our current method of  financing campaigns tends to ""lock-in"" in cumbents by making it extremely difficult for  a  challenger  to mount a  successful cam paign.   The source of most of our present problems  is the high cost of running for election. In  1972, for example, the a,vera.ge reported ,ex.  penses for candidates win.ntng closely con tested election-s 'l to the House of Representa tives was more than $100,000.1  In. elections  Footnotes at end of article.

312,Senate,93,0.172,882,22,Mr. YOUNG.," Mr. President, as one  who was opposed to getting into the Viet nam war  the  first place-it never  made sense to me-it is unusual for me  to be def ending military assistance  to  South Vietnam. I know that many of  the sponsors of big cuts now thought this  war was a great adventure about 10 years  ago; but after we lost more than 50,000  lives,  the  thousands who are missing,  over 300,000 casualties, and over $150  billion in expenditures, I  think it wise  that we give  some money  to salvage  something out of this great loss to this  Nation.  The President's budget estimate  for  this purpose submitted by the Bureau  of the Budget was $1.4 billion. The Armed  Services Committee-and their author ization bill passed both Houses of Con gress-called for $1 billion. We have now  cut it down to $700 million. I agree with  the Senator from Arizona that if we are  going to cut it further, we might just as  well cut it all out.  We have a new dimension in our for eign policy now, in Secretary Kissinger.  in  I  I  think he has done more for peace in  the world than any other man in the his tory of the United States. He believes  that our foreign assistance is a part of  his bipartisan foreign policy, and to that  extent I am willing to change some of  my thoughts of the past and give some  foreign assistance, if he believes it nec essary, as he does.  Mr. President, I would like to read a  letter addressed to Chairman McCLEL LAN of the Senate Appropriations Com mittee, received this morning, signed, in  behalf of Secretary Kissinger, by Rob ert S. Ingersoll, Assistant Secretary. It  reads as follows:  AUGUST 20, 1974.   DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Secretary Kissinger,  who  is out of town, has authorized me  to  send you the following statement concern the Defense Assistance for Viet-Nam (DAV)  funding  appropriation  that may  be dis cussed in the Senate August 21:  ""I understand there may be moves to re duce further the amount to be appropriated  for Defense Assistance for Viet-Nam.  ""As I stated in my letter to you of August  12, cuts already ma.de in our military assist ance,  combined with  the  rapid  inflation  which has eroded the value of that assist ance, have brought the South Vietnamese  armed forces to a level of austerity which, if  reduced further, might affect  their ability  to defend their country against continuing  Communist mllitary pressure. Even the full  $1.0 billion which the Congress has author ized  for Viet-Nam military a.id would be  dangerously austere, particularly in view of  the  increased North Vietnamese military  pressure in recent months. At the $700 mil lion level currently under discussion, I  fear  that the North Vietnamese will be strongly  tempted to increase their pressure still more,  and the South Vietnamese will be in danger  of running out of military necessities for  defending themselves well before the end of  the  fiscal  year. Still  further cuts would  clearly vitiate our policy of supporting the  conditions which made the Paris Agreement  possible and would call into question the re assurances President Ford and I have been  giving of the continuity and constancy of  American foreign policy.  ""As I also stated in my August 12 letter,  the best hope for a genuine negotiated settle ment and eventual reconciliation  in Viet Nam  is  to maintain the balance of forces  which has permitted the progress made thus  far.  I  continue  to believe  that  it  is ex tremely  important  in furthering progress  toward the goals of American foreign policy  of the past five years that no further cuts  be made  in our assistance to South Viet Nam.  Best Regards,  RoBERT S. INGERSOLL.  Mr. President, I have great confidence  in Secretary Kissinger. I think he is one  of  the most popular men in America  today. I believe he is using good judg ment; and, as I  stated before, he has  done more for peace in the world than  any other man in the history of this Na tion. If he so strongly advocates  this  $700 million, I am willing to go along.  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  HATHAWAY). Who yields time?  Mr. McCLELLAN.

315,House,93,-0.355,999,22,Mr. ZABLOCKI.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  to speak in favor of the Export-Import  Bank and the bill which has been intro duced to extend its life and increase its  lending authority. Throughout  its 40year existence, Eximbank has made a  significant contribution to the U.S'. econ omy by supporting over $76 billion in  U.S. export sales  to foreign countries.  These exports have resulted in jobs for  U.S. workers, have produced revenues ~or  all levels of Government, and have en abled us to earn the foreign exchange  required to pay for needed imports. Ex imbank has thereby contributed to the  high standard of living we enjoy in this  country and has assisted in maintaining  the strength of our industrial sector in  the world economy.  Eximbank  has  accomplished  these  achievements without  expending  tax payers' funds and with an excellent re payment record on its loans. The Bank  was funded originally with a $1 billion  capital investment from  the Treasury.  Over $900 million in dividends has now  been paid to the Treasury out of  the  Bank's profits. Over the years, Eximl;>ank  has lost only 2 cents on every $100 ,of  loans. This record is far better than the  bad debt ratios of large U.S. commercial  banks and is a reflection of the sound  banking practices followed by the Bank's  Directors.  An issue relating to congressional con trol will be raised by the amendment in troduced by the gentleman from Mis souri (Mr. IcHORD). I particularly want  to express my views on this provision to  impose prior congressional approval or  disapproval of individual Eximbank loan  transactions. Congress already exercises  control  over  Eximbank's  activities  through the annual review of all opera tions conducted by the Appropriations  Committees of both Houses and through  periodic reviews of the Bank's charter  such as we are currently undertaking.  Neither we as  individual Congressmen  nor our staffs have the necessary time  or the  technical banking expertise  to  determine whether a particular project  is  financially, economically, and  tech-  nically sound. Congress should set the  policy  limitations on  loans, and  leave  individual loan. decisions to the Bank's  Board of Directors who are charged with  the responsibility for ma'king this type  of examination and decision.  ...  .  I am parti-cular-ly concerned about the  foreign relations aspects of granting the.  Congress  the authority  to approve or  disapprove individual transactions. The  congressional debate of an  important  loan to a foreign country and the possi bility of rejection could strain our rela tions with that country. The uncertainty  of an individual Eximbank loan could  cause the project to be snatched by a  foreign competitor ready and anxious to  supply and finance satisfactory equip ment. No other industrial country re quires  legislative  review of  individual  export transactions.  By  imposing such a  requirement on  Eximbank, we would be placing our ex porters at a serious disadvantage vis-a vis their competitors. We would be jeop ardizing  important  export  sales  into  which  American  firms may have put  months, even years of effort as well as  substantial sums of money to prepare a  successful bid. We could be unknowingly  damaging  intergovernmental  relationships.    Further, Mr. Chairman, we would be  severely constraining the ability of the  Eximbank to participate with its coun ter parts in other countries in large scale  projects, such as thermal power stations  and petrochemical complexes; projects,  which frequently  require  the financial  participation of  financial  institutions,  private and government, of a number of  countries. If the Bank were not able to  commit firmly and promptly, U.S. partici pation in these multi-country projects  would become far less possible.  What purpose, then, would a congres Bional veto serve? I believe that bank ing decisions should be  left  to Exim bank's Board of Directors and we should  restrict . our  oversight  of  Eximbank's  activities to the traditional and existing  channels.  Eximbank  has  served  the  American people we~l in the past and we  should continue to give it the flexibility  to perform effectively in the future.  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote  against the amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will read.

323,House,93,-0.098,1038,22,Mr. CASEY of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  am today introducing a bill to amend the  National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.  This legislation, passed by  the 90th  Congress, was amended last year follow ing the most severe losses in the history  of the Nation due to flooding. Yet, I think  that events of those days made us draft  legislation which was  too broad. With  . the passage of time, we often see that  what appeared to have been a practical  proposal is unsuited to actual circum stances.  In general, the amendments enacted  into law in 1973 were an effort to make  the flood insurance program as broad as  possible, and also to discourage move ment into flood-prone areas by restric tion of credit in these areas.  Federal mortgage money, for example,  may not be lent on real estate in flood  prone areas unless such property is cov ered by Federal flood insurance. In turn,  such insurance  is not available where  Federal officials believe land is likely to  be flooded.  Such a  law forbidding settlement in  flood prone areas appears sound at :first  glance:  it discourages movement  into  areas where life may be endangered by  flooding, limits property losses in these  areas and safeguards Federal mortgage  funds.  In practice,  the  result varies  region to region, however.  The arrangement is very satisfactory  in hilly or mountainous States, because  the rule is simple: build on high ground.  But what do you do, Mr. Speaker, when  you have no high ground?  This is precisely the situation in many  parts of coastal Texas, and in other  parts of the Nation as well. When the  land is flat, Mr. Speaker, what is a flood  prone area and what is not? The simple  fact is that in Brazoria County, Tex., and  in other parts of my district, the land is  flat and most of the area which could be  flooded  is limited only by the amount  of floodwater. Some areas are, of course,  much more flood prone than others, and  the people who live and work there know  the difference. As an increasing number  of people have seen the advantages of  living and working on the gulf coast of  from  I  The Federal flood program now threat Texas. my district has grown rapidly.  ens to virtually halt that growth, how ever, because  it  limits  the mortgage  money available  in almost  this entire  area.  Some of the Members of the House  may ask how this could be. Did not the  act apply to Federal secondary mortgage  funds only? No, under sections 102 (b),  every ""Federal instrumentality responsi ble for the supervision, approval, regu lation or  insuring of banks--shall by  regulation-direct such institutions-not  to make-any loan-secured by real es tate, not covered, by flood insurance.""  The result of this legislation is that  no bank may make loans on property  without flood insurance even with non Government funds. In the event that an  official of the U.S. Government decides  property should not be covered by flood  insurance, believing the realty is overly  flood prone, then over 90 percent of the  banks  in the State of Texas are for b id den by  law  from  lending on such  property.  Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that the  intention of the House at the time this  act was debated was  to discriminate  against some parts of the Nation on the  basis of topography. As ridiculous as this  sounds, this is precisely what is happen ing.  do not ask that the U.S. Govern ment risk  its own mortgage funds by  passage of this bill.  I only ask that mortgage lenders be  given  the opportunity of deciding  for  themselves what the risks are on each  and every parcel of land they mortgage,  and that they be allowed to determine  where the risks justify an investment.  I urge my colleagues to give this meas ure a sympathetic hearing. A careful in vestigation will reveal the harm which  this legislation is doing, and also that  this bill is the vehicle to rectify it.  Under my bill, the Federal Insurance  Administration would still issue flood in surance only within the areas it desig nates as eligible. Communities would still  participate in the program in order to  qualify for flood insurance.  Homes and businesses constructed un der Federal mortgage programs, the FHA,  the VA, the SBA and so on, would re main under mandatory controls of the  Federal Insurance Administration.  The only change in the law would be  that our banks and lending institutions  would be free to make their own deter mination of the local flood hazards, and  so long as public money or public insur ance was not involved, would be free to  make loans in areas they choose without  intervention from Federal authorities.  am confident that the changes in  the law I propose are in keeping with the  intent of the Congress in enacting the  National Flood Insurance Act of 1968  and that the public would best be served  by the passage of the bill I  introduce  today.  I  THE BLACK LUNG BENEFITS ACT  OF 1974  ",1974
324,House,93,-0.265,1038,22,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, we are  presently in the middle of a 5-day work  shutdown of the Nation's bituminous coal  mines as a memorial to victims of mine  disasters, black lung disease, and coal  company violence.  Although I began working on the legis lation I  am about  to  introduce many  months ago, I can imagine no more ap propriate time to discuss the Black Lung  Benefits Act of 1974  than during this  memorial period.  Mr. Speaker, any legislator from a coal  mining area who has seen first hand the  various stages of black lung disease as  it perceptively moves to rob a man of  his breath and eventually of his  life,  knows how  important  the black  lung  benefit legislation enacted by Congress  has been. But as a Congressman who  must deal daily with the benefit claims  of miners from my area, I  realize that  this important law must be strengthened  and improved.  Before I  discuss the specifics of this  legislation, I would remind the Members  that Congress enacted the original black  lung benefits legislation as recognition  of the national debt we owe the men who  for years have gone, and continue going,  into the mines of our Nation to produce  this most precious and valuable resource.  I hope the time has passed when any  question remains about the rightness of  this benefit program.  Coal miners deserve financial security  and health benefits for their contribu tion to the energy needs of this Nation.  Despite advanced technology we again  recognize our need for coal, and just as  the miner must still go underground to  mine it, the coal dust is still there to  greet him. Mining  remains  the most  dangerous profession in our Nation.  The debate must continue over how  best to help past, present, and future  miners. My amendments are designed to  fill gaps in the present law, and I would  briefly  like  to outline  them  for  the  Members.  Most  important, and deserving  the  most attention, is an amendment known  as  the 15-year rule. This amendment  states that any miner or his widow would  automatically qualify for benefits if the  miner had worked 15 years in the under ground mines.  I would like to mention some reasons  why  this amendment  is essential, Mr.  Speaker. First, the present law is unfair.  It allows some miners with 15 years and  the  illness  to  receive  benefits, while  others with 15 years' service and the ill ness do not  receive aid. Presently no  automatic, definite way exists to prove  the presence of black lung, or to prove  its severity. We are left with a system of  medical and lay judgment that inevitably  discriminates against many valid claims.  The decision becomes a subjective one,  with different doctors forming different  conclusions from the same evidence.  Black lung disease may not show itself  until a man has left the mines for some  time; it is unlikely he will accumulate  medical evidence while working and feel ing no effects of the disease in its early  stages. Thus the miner reaches a state of  ",1974
325,,93,-0.504,1064,22,Mr. BOLLING.," Mr. Speaker. the Kan sas City Star on August 12 had an inAugust 21, 197 4  teresting  lead editorial on commodity  trading. Regardless of one's views on  this complicated subject, it expresses a  significant and interesting point of view.  IN  ROLE  CONFUSION  OVER  SPECULATOR'S  COMMODITIES TRADING  A group of farmers attending the Ozark  Empire Fair  in Springfield, Mo.,  recently  vented  their ire over several developments  threatening their financial security. Accord ing to Frank Farmer, farm editor of the News  and Leader newspapers,  the  farmers were  frightened by dry weather, militant over low  cattle prices and still angry at Washington  over price controls, which started a process  still distorting those prices.  But their biggest complaint, especially by  dairymen plagued by low milk prices at the  fa.rm and high grain prices, was over specula tion in the marketplace. One man shouted  that permitting speculation  in grain at a  time of a  threatened shortfall in U.S. pro duction  ""borders  on  insanity."" Unfortu nately, that charge also prevails in more lofty  councils,  including Congress, where  some thing more concrete than sound and fury  could emerge in the form of legislation.  On  the same day a U.S. senator visited  the Kansas City Board of Trade as a member  of a committee studying the entire commod ities  trading  structure;  however, his  em phasis was on transportation. A committee  staff member with  the  senator predicted  legislation to tighten up supervision of the  futures market.  What the Ozark farmers failed to realize  is precisely what  the senators must: The  present system of commodity  transactions,  including futures trading, must be preserved.  Its role is vital in preventing erratic swings  in commodity prices and any major  tam pering certainly would cause both consum ers and  farmers  even more pricing grief.  That is not to say the system, which has  grown enormously in the last several years,  cannot be  improved by  the  judicious co operation of the Congress and the commod ities exchanges.  The fact  is that futures  trading, which  has evolved in the last 100 years from a sim ple forward pricing contract to a  complex  and often misunderstood giant, would not  work without speculators. They are the ones  willing to take the financial risks in return  for the possibility of making a profit that  others,  among  them packers,  bakers  and  millers,  cannot  assume. Speculators bring  to  the market  some  degree  of  stability,  whether that particular commodity be wheat,  corn, soybeans, precious metals or whatever.  Farmers, of course, also a.re speculating in a  different way when, as this year, they hold  their grain in hope of higher prices later on  in the marketing year.  To visualize futures speculation and trad ing in an ultra-simple approach, picture a  teeter-totter with  the speculators on each  end. They ride up and down freely, but move ment is scarcely discernible at the fulcrum.  That's where the commercial hedgers gather  to buy and sell  the commodities they and  their companies need for future market and  food production requirements. The hedging  process becomes a form of price insurance.  At the steady fulcrum bakers, for exam ple, can assure themselves through hedging  of a  ready and dependable supply of flour  at relatively stable prices for months ahead.  The costs of other raw materials, labor and  transportation are more unpredictable, but  to some extent through the present system  of t.ading every consumer is protected from  violent price fluctuations because that risk  is  taken by speculators. That function  is  what the nation's lawmakers and consumer  groups should take great care to perpetuate  against well-intentioned  but  ill-informed  critics.  ",1974

327,,93,-0.439,1142,22,Mr. MONDALE.," Mr. President, today  am introducing along with Senators  PROXMIRE, HART, HUGH SCOTT, GRIFFIN,  HUMPHREY, NELSON,  STEVENSON, BAYH,  HARTKE and TAFT an amendment to the  ""En~rgy Transportation security Act of  1974"".  I propose to amend section 809 of the  Merchant Marine Act of 1936 (46 U.S.C.  1213) as amended by inserting after the  words, ""the foreign trade requirements  of the Atlantic~ gulf, Great Lakes, and  Pacific ports of the United States"" the  following sentence:  eaeh n.uge of ports nferrecl to 1n the pre In order to assure equitable treatment tar  ceding sentence, not leSI th&ll 10 percent ot  the .funds approprit.ted or othennae made  a.ffila.ble for the foreign-trade requlrements  of the l1nite<l States pursuant to th11 Act  or any law authorizing funds for the purposes  of :such Act aball be allocatec:l for the forelgn trad.e requirements of each such port range.  In the 1970 amendments to the Mer chant Marine Act, the Congress desig nated the St. Lawrence Seaway-Great  Lakes as the ~Fourth Seacoast'' of the  United States. Shortly  thereafter  the  Department of Commerce established it  as one of the .. essential routes of foreign  trade""--a. route that should be promoted  and maint.ained in the interest of U.S.  foreign commerce.  Those of us quite distant from  the  Tidewater ports viewed this act of Con gress as truly histortc and believed that  this designation and use of the Great  Lakes would stimulate our economies and  contribute to the overall balance of trade  for our Nation. The 1972 sale and ship ment of wheat to the Soviet Union ha.s  most recently 1Ilustrated  the commer cial and foreign trade value of this area  and this Seaway.  However, while  this potential exists  and while its needs in foreign commerce  remains evident,  the Great Lakes are  not, in faet or in practice, ''the Fourth  Seacoast"" of the United Sta.tes.  No  oceangoing cargo American-flag  ships serve the Great Lakes. In fact, there  has been no regularly scheduled Ameri can registry vessels there for 5 yea.rs. In  addition to this, since the amendment  of 1970, advertised liners ha.ve actually  decreased from 22 to 10 now serving tbe  lakes.  My amendment is not designed to cause  any unnatural diversion of cargo. In fact,  it is intended to encourage the use of all  the designated essential wutes of trade  to prevent the unnatural and inefficient  diversion of products.  Furthermore, it is not and I  under stand will not cause any expensive con versions in the shipbuilding industry. The  Congress authorized $294 million for con struction diff erentia.l subsidies 1n fiscal  year 1975. Mr. Lowry, director of the of fice of shipbuilding at MARAD, the Ma.ri tlme Admlnistratfon.  informs me that  every one of the 20 American shipbuild ing companies can construct ships that  can traverse the Great Lakes. However ..  the United States has not subsidized the  construction of an oceangoing vessel that  can sail the seaway fully loaded since  1961. During the same period, over 10,000  foreign ""salties"" were constructed. Forty eight percent of them can travel, fully  loaded, through the Great Lakes.  Mr. President,  have discussed my  amendment with representatives of the  International Longshoremen Association,  the AFL-CIO, and the National Farmers  Union. They have assured me of their  full and enthusiastic support.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have my amendment to H.R. 8193  and an article from the January issue ot  the Maritime magazine printed ln the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at this time.

328,Senate,93,-0.18,1272,22,Mr. LONG.," Mr. President, the pension  legislation now before us represents one  of the most substantial achievements of  the Congress in the current session or for  that matter in any session. This bill will  aid many millions of employees to receive  more secure and meaningful pensions. In  fact, the beneficial effects of this bill will  be enjoyed not only by the present gen eration but by many generations to come.  think that there have been few bllls  that have involved as much cooperative  effort in the Congress as this bill. As you  recall, the legislation was adopted :first in  the Senate after being considered by  both  the Finance Committee and the  Committee on Labor and Public Welfare.  This cooperative effort is one of the ma jor reasons why we-have a bill on the  Senate floor today and I want to ack nowledge the very imPortant role that  Chairman Wi:LLIAKS, Senator JAVJ:TS, and  all the members of the Labor and Public  I  Welfare Committee played in getting this  bill out.  Similarly, both the Ways and Means  Committee and the Education and Labor  Committee of the House considered the  House-passed version of the bill.  So what we have here today-the con ference agreement on this legislation represents the combined wisdom and ex pertise  on  pension matters  in  both  Houses of the Congress. In the case of  some of the provisions, we have deferred  to the House; in other cases, the differ ence was resolved by accepting the Sen ate provision. However, I want to stress  that the conference agreement should  not be viewed as one side giving in to the  other on particular provisions. In most  cases, the particular way in which the  issues were resolved reflects the fact that  we were able to give more study to them.  In a very real sense, many of the House  provisions differ from ours, because they  were able to build on our work. In con ference, we have made still further im provements while retaining the basic ob jectives in our bill.  In saying this, I recognize that there  are some provisions in the bill which some  Members think can be improved. In fact,  I know of a few provisions which I might  pref er to change. But I think that it is not  possible in legislation so complex as this  to secure completely unanimous agree ment on each and every detail. What  really matters is that we have developed  here a successful pension bill-a bill that  will achieve its overall objectives.  One of the most important aspects of  this blll is that it achieves reform within  the basic framework of the present tax  treatment of pension plans which is de signed to encourage the growth and de velopment of voluntary plans by employ ers. The legislation continues the favor able tax treatment that has been so es sential in encouraging the growth of non discriminatory plans over more  than  three decades. Indeed, we have actually  expanded this favorable tax treatment in  some respects by increasing the amounts  that self-employed people can set aside  in their own retirement plans and by al lowing individuals not covered by pen sion plans to set up a new type of indi vidual retirement plan for themselves.  In order to qualify for the favorable  tax treatment, pension plans will have  to satisfy the present type of rules in the  Internal Revenue Code which are de signed to confine the special tax treat ..  ment to plans which do not discriminate  in favor of highly paid employees as com pared to the rank and file employees.  Under this legislation, to secure the fa vorable  tax treatment, plans will also  have to satisfy additional requirements  which are designed to protect employees  and to make pension plans a more ef fective vehicle for providing retirement  income. These new requirements pertain  to coverage, vesting, funding, fiduciary  requirements, and plan termination in surance.  The new requirements have the virtue  of providing adequate protection for em ployees at only moderate additional fi nancing costs for most plans. We who  have worked intimately on this legisla",1974
329,Senate,93,0.134,1311,22,Mr. PEARSON.," Mr. President,  am  proud to join with my colleagues on the  Special Committee on the Termination  of the National Emergency in sponsor ing the National Emergencies Act. This  bill  is  the product of a careful review  of a President's emergency powers by a  unique bipartisan committee.  In a very  real sense, Mr. President,  this bill complements other efforts which  this Congress has  taken  to  reinstitute  constitutional government as it was in tended to function. We moved in Public  Law 93-148, the war powers bill, toward  a reassertion of the right of Congress to  declare war. In the budget reform mea sure, we reasserted the right of Congress  to control Government expenditures.  The National Emergencies Act,  the  these other  laws, does not attempt  to  eliminate necessary and essential execu tive powers which our country grants its  President. Certainly there is a need for  a President to operate, on his own initia tive, with speed and efficiency  in  the  face of a national crisis. However, I be lieve that excessive power in the hands  of any one man is both undesirable and  alien to our system of Government.  During the past year and a half, all of  us on the committee have learned a great  deal about  the extent of  the powers  which a President may exercise during a  ""national emergency."" With the aid of a  highly professional and competent staff,  we have compiled a list of statutes and  Executive orders detailing  the precise  nature of this authority. After review ing this list,  I was amazed at the ex tent  to which Congress has delegated  special powers to a President who deems  that  the United States  is  facing an  emergency.  My concern was increased when I real ized that Congress bears a large share of  responsibility  for  the steady accretion  of emergency power. While Presidents  can and have unilaterally declared that  states of emergency exist, Congress has  given them means to exercise extraor dinary  powers  during  these  times.  Thus, Harry Truman's declaration of a  national emergency in 1950 had a major  psychological  impact. However,  laws  passed by Congress, such as the Defense  Production Act, provided the legal basis  for most of his subsequent actions.  There are nearly 500 such laws still on  the books. Each law gives any President  special powers during a ""national emer gency,"" during times of war, or when he  deems that ""war is imminent."" The 1950  Emergency  Proclamation,  and  three  others are still on the books. As a re sult, each and every one of the congres sional delegations of power  is  today  available for use by a Chief Executive.  Even more amazing than the number  of laws granting special power to the  President is the fact  that there is ho  mechanism  for  reviewing or  revoking  these  laws  once  they  are no  longer  needed. Unlike  inherent  Presidential  powers which can be reviewed by  the  Supreme Court, emergency powers are  specific legal delegations of authority to  a President. The Supreme Court has gen erally given deference to such delega tions of authority. The laws are viewed  as persuasive evidence of congressional  intent that the President should be per mitted  special  latitude  during  crises.  Thus, unless Congress itself imposes con trols,  emergency powers may  remain  largely unchecked.  For this reason, the bill sponsored by  the special committee is a carefully meas ured step toward reimposition of congres sion control. First, the bill suspends the  existing authority of a President to utilize  the laws granting him powers during a  national emergency. After placing these  laws on a ""shelf,"" we also require future  Presidents to specify the powers which  they wish to use once an emergency has  been declared. I believe that this is pref erable  to permitting  the President  to  choose his actions from a large residuum  of unorganized, undefined, and of ten out dated legislative grants of authority.  Second, the bill imposes time limits on  any future declaration of emergency. No  emergency is effective beyond 6 months,  unless specifically extended by Congress.  This  requires Congress  to  review any  declaration of emergency and  thereby  imposes a degree of  responsibility on  Congress.  Also,  the bill proposes  the repeal of  existing emergency statutes which  the  committee and the administration have  agreed are no longer needed.  This bill is an important piece of legis lation. Although it does not and cannot  foresee every eventuality, it will interject  a degree of  thoughtful oversight over  Executive decisionmaking.  Mr. President, I  recently outlined in  greater detail my thoughts on this matter  in article published in the Wichita Eagle  on August 18. I ask unanimous consent  that the article be printed at this point  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  THE PRESIDENT'S POWER  (By James B.

Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to commend our distin guished colleague, the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. BURKE) for his lead ership, not only in his effort to bring  about a meaningful and comprehensive  national health bill, but also in his con tinuing effort to see that the elderly and  crippled who live on social security get  enough in the way of benefits to be able  to keep body and soul together.  The gentleman  from Massachusetts  (Mr. BURKE) over the years has always  pioneered and led the fight to be sure  that our senior citizens particularly are  not forgotten by his colleagues in the U.S.  House of Representatives.  Mr. Speaker, I would only hope that  not only all of us here on the floor today  but  the new  leadership  in  the White  House as well will carefully note the re marks of our distinguished colleague this  afternoon.

334,House,93,-0.414,1428,22,Mr. MEZVINSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  controversy  over  the  use  of  airport  X-ray systems to inspect carryon bag gage is being aired now by the Federal  Aviation Administration preliminary to  setting rules  for  their use. There are  important issues being raised about the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  these  machines of which the public needs to be  awa:re.  Data submitted  to  the FAA by  the  Aviation Consumer Action Project, a  national consumer organization working  for safety in the airline industry, raises  several serious questions about the use  of these machines. The first is whether  the proposed safety standards are ade quate to prevent radiation emissions that  are potentially harmful  the public  boarding an airplane and, particularly,  to the operators of the machines. The  other basic question  is whether X-ray  inspection  is  indeed more effective  deterring hijacking than hand  inspec tion. If not,  is  it worth exposing  the  public to the burden of increased X-ray  contact when there is evidence that any  exposure to X-ray poses a health hazard?  I would like to submit for the RECORD  my comments to the FAA on this subject:  to  in  AUGUST  15, 1974.  H. LOUISE COOMES,  Chief, Rules Docket,  Federal Aviation Administration,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR Ms. COOMES:  I would like to respond  to the proposed rulemaking for the airport  x-ray units. I am pleased that in the year  since I became concerned about the lack of  Federal safety standards, the units now in  operation meet the FDA standards.  In light of the voluminous scientific data.  on the seriousness of any unnece-ssary x-ray  exposure to the individual, the FDA stand ards seem the very minimum precaution that  needs  to be made. I would urge that FDA  manufacturing and operational standards be  established and  that all care be given  to  monitoring emissions.  In addition to a  radiological survey when  the x-ray equipment is installed or removed,  it seems only prudent that there be regularly  ",1974
335,,93,0.247,1467,22,Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.," Mr. Speaker, in  an article entitled ""This  is  the Week  That Was for Gerry Ford,"" written by  Bud Vestal, the Jackson Citizen Patriot,  August 14, chronicled the somber events  of  the change in Presidents, and edi torially commented on ""A Golden Op portunity"" for greater openness in Gov ernment. While no one expects that all  our problems can be solved only by a  change in leadership,  the general  tone  of  editorial  comment  in daily news papers, as well as from other media, ap pears optimistic, and, with the Water gate era now behind us, such views can  be constructive in urging the American  people's support for President Ford at  this critical point in history.  The articles follow:  A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY-OPENNESS, CANDOR,  AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS  Congress now has an unparalleled oppor tunity to straighten out some questionable  practices that have crept  into government  during the past several decades.  The  reference  is  to  the gradual erosion  of congressional powers, willed by both Con gresses and the past several presidents.  Most of the powers surrendered by Con gress to the White House have been handed  over as a matter of expediency, and a succes sion of presidents dating back  to Franklin  Roosevelt  have  been  only  too  happy  to  accept.  This abdication of power has  inevitably  led  to  confrontations  between  the  two  branches of government, and to even more  recriminations,  all of  them avoidable and  unnecessary.  The most publicized of  these confronta tions occurred over the too-broad permission  given presidents to impound funds approved  by Congress, and over the war powers given  Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon.  Ultimately the war powers matter was set tled in an acrimonious battle capped by a  congressional override of Nixon's veto. The  fund-impounding problem  is still with us.  It even drew President Ford's comments dur ing his first address to Congress Monday.  One of the basic problems is that all too  often Congress passes laws dealing with spe cific matters but neglects to include termi nation dates beyond which the desired action  should cease.  ",1974
336,,93,-0.25,1480,22,Mr. DULSKI.," Mr.  Speaker, when  citizens stand up  to defend  their own  nations from enemies, they are acclaimed  as heroes and honored by history. When  individuals  defend  their  countries  against authoritarian or totalitarian rule  with personal integrity and humanity as  guides, they are revered. Such is the case  of  one  Ukrainian  historian-writer,  Valentyn Moroz.  Mr. Speaker, some 500 feet from the  Soviet Embassy in Washington, there is  a hunger strike by a number of Ameri cans of Ukrainian heritage demonstrat ing solidarity with Valentyn Moroz, who  has been on a hunger strike since July  1 of this year protesting his treatment  in Vladimir prison. The last information  is that he is being force-fed. The Ukrain ian historian was arrested for allegedly  spreading  ""anti-Soviet  propaganda,""  which consists of his three major works:  ""A Report on the Berian Reservation,""  ""Amid the Snows,"" and ""A Chronicle of  Resistance."" Valenytn Moroz and  the  hunger strikers are protesting  in soli darity a number of specific points of the  Soviets' form of ""justice"":  A closed trial-contrary to the Soviets'  own criminal code of procedure;  A lack of substantive evidence for con viction-all witnesses refused to testify  against Moroz;  Unconstitutional conviction-the ar ticles of conviction were, according to  the International Commission of Jurists,  ultra vires to the Soviet Constitution;  Physical assault and poisoned food certified by recently freed  inmates in cluding Anatoly Radygin, a Russian Jew ish captain  imprisoned  for attempted  flight from the Soviet Union.  Valentyn Moroz  is not the only one  persecuted  for his beliefs-which,  in cidentally,  are guaranteed under  the  Freedom of Speech clause in the Soviet  ",1974

338,House,93,0.268,28,30,Mr. NELSEN.," Mr. Chairman, I know  of no bill that has had a more thorough  examination than has this one. I dis cussed it with officials down at HEW,  and they like the bill. They feel we need  a bill like this. There may be some dif ferences of opinion as to dollar .figures  for some phases of amendments  that  may be offered, but by and large the  feeling is that we must have a bill like  this.  As far as  the comprehensive health  programs and the regional medical pro grams, I  think it is obvious nationwide  that there has been competition as to  which one is going to be predominant in  the health delivery system. The feeling  of  the committee was  that  these  two  groups should really become a part of  the planning group within States so  none of them would be denied a voice,  that they should be working  together  rather than separately. That certainly  would be to the advantage and it would  be much more efficient.  I might add  that  I will have an  amendment dealing with  the formula  of H111-Burton,  having  in mind  that  under the provisions as presently in law  we have an allocation for every State  and in many cases some of those States  are not drawing the funds because the  States have met their needs. Therefore it  takes a huge amount of money on a  formula basis, and that could be cut in  half and we would stm have more money  for  the places where help 1s needed. I  have not done an extensive campaign  for  the amendment but  I  do  feel  it  should be  offered and discussed  and  some of the material I have will be in serted in the RECORD.  I only want to mention that in the  program I once administered, the REA  program, we had a  formula and every  State had a dollar figure in the bank.  Finally when  the  electrification had  reached its peak and every State had  been accommodated to meet the needs,  we  found a  formula was a hindrance  rather than a help, because sometimes  extensively larger amounts were needed  in a certain area which we could not give  because of the formula. So we took the  formula out of  the operation and in serted a grant program, and it took less  money and was much better for  the  program.  I think the same thing will be true in  the Hill-Burton formula, because at this  time we have more hospital beds than  we need. We need improvement in the  facilities we have. In some of the paorer  communities they do not find it possible  to operate as they should because they  cannot make the front end money, as  we say' available to meet the matching  funds.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentle man from North Dakota <Mr. ANDREWS).  ",1974

342,House,93,0.183,93,30,Mr. LENT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup port of this much needed legislation. The  financial problems  faced by Pan Am,  TWA and other U.S. flag carriers are due  in no small part to circumstances out side the control of the Federal Govern ment, such as spiraling fuel costs and a  reduction  in  international air  travel.  However, most of the circumstances are  not only within the control of the Federal  Government but are actually the direct  subsidy  is  in in  result of U.S. Government action. Or to  put it more correctly-inaction.  H.R. 14266 simply corrects a situation  which should have been corrected long  ago. As it was reported, H.R.14266 directs  all departments and agencies to eliminate  discriminatory and unfair competitive  practices against U.S.  flag carriers  the international air transport industry;  it requires  the Department of Trans portation to survey user charges made  to our carriers by foreign governments  and to take steps to correct the inequi ties which do exist;  it encourages the  promotion of ""Fly U.S."" programs,  in  other words,  travel  to and  from  the  United States on U.S. air carriers.  Given the current state of our econ omy, we all should be concerned about  the plight of our international air trans portation industry. Pan Am, for example,  currently has 33,000 employees. Failure  to enact this legislation will most cer tainly mean the end of Pan Am as we  know it, and the effect on most of its  employees will be either unemployment  or severe dislocation. It will also mean  the almost certain end of U.S. participa tion in the international air transporta tion industry.  Mr. Speaker, this bill does not repre sent a subsidy for anyone. It is simply  equity. At the appropriate time I will be  supporting an amendment to be offered  by my colleague from New York  (Mr.  MURPHY) which will further strengthen  the bill. I urge my colleagues to support  this bill, which will provide long overdue  equity for our U.S. flag carriers, in recog nition  of  their  contributions  to  the  American economy.  ",1974
343,House,93,0.103,119,30,Mr. RAILSBACK.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to take this opportunity  to  urge immediate passage of a bill I have  sponsored, H.R.  17382,  the American  Folklif e  Preservation Act.  Over  200  House Members have  introduced  this  legislation, and I have been encouraged.  The bill also has the support of more than  50 Senators, and  the endorsement of  numerous private citizens, professional  folklorists,  and organizations  such  as  the American Library Association and  the American Folklife Society. It was  also unanimously reported by the Com mittee on House Administration.  Briefly stated, the purpose of our bill  is to establish an American Folklife Cen ter in the Library of Congress. Since the  Library is the basis for library services  throughout the country, authorizing the  Library to develop, promote, and imple ment a program of support for Ameri can folklife will insure the advancement  of folklife in library services generally.  At a  time when we are preparing for  our Bicentennial, I can think of no more  appropriate contribution by  the Con gress  than  to  preserv~ our country's  folklife. We have always respected and  fostered cultural differences among the  American people,  recognizing  the  im portance of their values and beliefs upon  the strength of our country. I am con vinced it is in our best interests to pre serve American folklife arts and tradi tions,  and  hope H.R.  17382 will  be  enacted without delay.  THE DISMISSAL OF MICHAEL  FRO ME  ",1974

Amendment 2058, by Mr. COTTON, ex clusion of  import-sensitive  textile and  footwear products from preferences un der title V, would be germane.  Amendment 2060, by Mr. DoLE, making  sector negotiation objective consistent  with overall negotiating objective, would  be germane.  Mr. President,  if cloture  is voted on  this bill, we believe it offers us the oppor tunity and a good chance, on behalf of  all these sponsors, to enact the amend ments we consider germane.  We think that if cloture is not voted  on the bill, none of these amendments  have any chance at all, the bill will not  become  law, and none of  the amend ments will become law. I believe that the  overwhelming majority of Senators feel  that we should pass a trade bill; I know  the Finance Committee by unanimous  vote thought so. But we will not be able  to do it unless we can limit ourselves to  germaneness, because otherwise, in de bate over matters  like  the Consumer  Protection Agency, no-fault  insurance,  oil and gas pricing, percentage depletion,  deregulation of natural gas-so far the  Genocide Treaty has not been brought  in here, but I am sure it will if this bill  is thrown open to practically all amend ments; and I have no doubt, Mr. Presi dent, that there will be an antiabortion  amendment offered on this measure, too,  before we are through, if we are not able  to limit ourselves to a rule of germane ness.  The Senate has  the opportunity  to  pass this bill. It can vote for a measure  on which this body has labored this year,  and  the  House  of  Representatives  worked on last year. The Senate Finance  Committee put in 9 months of hard work  on  this bill. The Senate, by  trying  to  make this measure into a Christmas tree  bill, will not only be performing an ex ercise in futility, but I believe will bring  upon itself much criticism and a con siderable degree of scorn.  The President has made many recom mendations that have not passed either  House, or been cleared by both Houses.  We have had  long struggles on  tax  reform proposals which have been offered  to debt limit bills, and various and sundry  proposals offered to other measures dur ing this Congress, which have failed to  achieve their purpose, because there is  very substantial opposition to them. To  try to add all of that on, in these closing  days of Congress, means the whole thing  will go down the drain.  So, Mr. President, I hope very much  that the Senate will be allowed to legis late on this item, and to bring it to a vote.  While it is true that there has not been  a great deal of debate on this matter, the  trade bill has been the pending business  of the Senate since December 5. So this  has been the pending business, and any one who wanted to could come in and  make himself a speech on the trade bill  for the last week or so. I admit that with  the pressure of other business he might  have had to make his speech early in the  morning or late in the afternoon, but at  any rate the bill and committee report  have been available  to be read by all  Senators and the public and the press  of this Nation, to weigh and to consider,  along with the other information avail able to us. So Senators have not been  denied an opportunity to be heard. They  could have made all the speeches they  wanted to up to now, and they will have  additional opportunities,  if we are  to  pass the bill at all.  Otherwise, if we are not able to get  cloture on this bill, it will not make any  difference what Senators say  in  their  speeches, so that even the 1 hour they  will have available to them would be a  waste of time, because the bill will not  pass.

345,,93,-0.218,314,30,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker, one of the  chief functions  that President Lyndon  Johnson envisaged for the LBJ Library  was for it to be a forum to focus on the  critical issues of the day. Symposia have  been held to coincide with the opening  of Presidential papers on a specific sub ject, such as civil rights, education, and  urban problems.  Recently the library held a very timely  conclave on the most crucial issue facing  the world today-the energy and its re lation to the environment. Some of the  leading scholars, scientists, and thinkers  gathered  to discuss  these very difficult  questions  that we must come  to grips  with quickly. Some of the illustrious par ticipants included the English economist  and author, narbara Ward-Lady Jack son; Mr. W. Donham Crawford, presi dent of Edison Electric Institute; Prof.  Roger Revelle, Center  for Population  Studies; Mr. Gerald Piel,  :publisher of  the  Scientific American; Mr. Rufus  Miles, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of  HEW; Dr. Barry Commoner, Washing ton University-St. Louis; Mr.  Jules  Bergman, science editor, ABC; Dr. Dixy  Lee Ray, chief of  the Atomic Energy  Commission; Mr. Kerryn King,  senior  vice  president,  Texaco; Mr.  Russell  Train, head of the Environmental Pro tection Agency; Prof. William Drum mond, University of Texas, Austin; di rector of the Center for Energy Studies;  U.S. Representative MIKE McCORMACK,  a research scientist and chairman of the  House Science Committee's Subcommit tee on Energy; Dr. James W. McKie,  Dean, College of Social and Behavioral  Sciences, University of Texas, Austin;  Mr. Maurice Strong, executive director,  United Nations environment program;  Mr. Charles Schultze, Brookings Insti tute; Prof. William E. Cooper, Michigan  State University; and Dr. Allen Kneese,  a native of Fredericksburg, Tex., a dis tinguished  resources economist at  the  University of New Mexico.  uttered at  this union of  intellectuals  Naturally some of  the wisest words  were from the former First Lady, Lady  Bird Johnson.  Mrs. Johnson focused on these prob lems as they affect us in our daily lives.  There was an excellent article which  appeared in the Williamson County S-uu  which detailed some of  the conference  higr.lights. The article was written by a  veteran Texas  journalist, Stuart Long,  who  operates Long News  Service  in  Austin, Tex.  I insert Mr. Long's article in the REC ORD as follows:  AUSTIN NOTEBOOK  (By Stuart Long)  AusTIN.-Those of us who write almost  daily on the news outcroppings of the energy  crisis have been only dimly aware of the real  depth of the problem, compared to a dazzling  array of thinkers brought to the Lyndon B.  Johnson Library  for  a  symposium on  the  future of the environment as it is bent and  twisted by the massive use of energy to power  the world's machines.  Many of the experts were frank to admit  that prospects are indeed very gloomy and  that this generation's grandchildren can ex pect a darker, slower world because the 20th  Century will have used up all the fossil fuels.  Such renowned scholars as Barbara Ward,  the British economist, put the situation in  blunt and plain language. ""We are in grave  trouble,"" she said. The  last 25 have been  years of great productivity, good weather,  economic growth and cheap oil and gas to  fuel a burgeoning economy and a way of life,  she recalled. But now the world is faced with  shortages of natural resources, wild infia tion,  starvation  in many  countries, population  growth and an  inability of  technology  to  maintain that high rate of economic speed.  Rufus E. Miles, Jr., who was an assistant  secretary of health, education and welfare  under six different secretaries, posed it in  even more troublesome terms. He suggested  that it is possible that the world has become  so  interdependent, and so intertwined and  politically confused,  that it may be com pletely impossible to get things back together  again.  The problem, as Miles sees it, is that the  economists and other social scientists have  ignored politics. They must be put back  together and puzzled out as a unit, because  politics  is  the only way  to  solve  the big  problems of economics.  Dean James W. McKie of the University  of Texas at Austin College of Social and Be havioral Sciences hit a  low note when he  used  the  declining water  supply  of  the  High Plains of West Texas as an illustration.  People in that area can continue to mine  water, and when it runs out and the High  Plains  returns  to  dry-land  farming  and  ranching,  they can leave, he said. But the  people of the world are using up resources  that cannot be replaced  in  the same way  West Texans are using water, but there is no  place to go when they run out. McKie said  that  technology has always pulled people  out of  their economic problems, but now  ""we are betting the fate of future genera tions on technology, and technology does not  know what to do in this situation.""  The people of the United. States are the  biggest resource-users of all, speaker after  speaker pointed out. We scorn mass trans portation in Texas becavse we are wedded to  the twoand three-car garage and the 300  horsepower engine, 70 mile-per-hour driving  and the 72-degree air-conditioning, the full  garbage can and  the  thick steaks, half of  which are left on the plate.  A display in the lobby demonstrated how  wasteful we have become. Browning-Ferris  had built a complete, carpeted suite of offices  from  trash which  cost  city  government  money to haul away and bury. Glass, paper,  metal, old beer bottles and mattresses, dis carded auto pistons and nylon  fibers were  ",1974

348,,93,-0.484,392,30,Mr. HELSTOSKI.," Mr. Speaker, today  I would like to share with my colleagues  a position paper prepared by Nasrollah S.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  December 14, 197 4  Fatemi, director of the Graduate Insti tute of International Studies, at Fair leigh Dickinson University, which is lo cated in Teaneck, N.J. The paper is en titled ""The Economic Summit and the  Future,"" and was prepared by Mr. Fatemi  after he attended the recent Economic  Summit Conference in Washington.  In his paper, Mr. Fatemi offers many  perceptive observations and insights con cerning the problems which plague our  economy. Copies of his comments already  have been sent to President Ford and  White House Economic Adviser William  Seidman, and today I would like to take  this opportunity  to share his remarks  with my colleagues. The paper follows:  THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT AND THE FUTURE  (By Nasrolla.h S. Fa.temi)  To find a solution to the present economic  crisis-soaring  inflation,  serious  recession,  high interest rates, and productivity slump,  we need major changes in the way in which  economic, monetary, and fiscal policies are  made in Washington. For three decades the  policy makers in Washington have paid at tention only to the symptoms of economic  problems while continuing policies and prac tices that have failed to alleviate the critical  situation. We have been bandaging wounds  which need ""radical surgery.""  Real  improvement-a stable, productive,  prosperous economy-will elude us unless the  Administration and the Congress, manage ment,  labor and consumers are willing  to  recognize the causes of the present crisis and  meet the challenge with courage, boldness,  creativity, and pragmatism.  Basically the present situation was caused  by the belief both here and abroad that the  economic  and  financial  resources  of  the  United States were  inexhaustible. This no tion, shared and encouraged by successive  post-war administrations, encouraged us to  spend more than $250 billion on foreign and  military expenditures, plus $150 billion on  the longest and the second mo!St expensive  war in the history of the United States.  Lack of attention to our fiscal and mone tary policy, and the belief that the country  can spend $400 billion on foreign wars and  giveway projects without some control over  wages, prices, interest, and credits, has pro duced in five years close  to a $100 billion  budget deficit; an $80 billion deficit in bal ance of payments and, or the first time in  eighty years, a balance-of-trade deficit.  As inflation, recession, and unemployment  developed,  immense effort was being spent  on a deceptive public relations campaign to  convince  the country  that ""the economic  bliss of a generation of peace"" was around  the corner. Successive economic promises of  the past five years have done nothing but  apply  ""time-frames""  ever-worsening  domestic  conditions. Scapegoats,  domestic  and  foreign, have been sought,  identified,  and blamed, but inflationary and recession ary drives have accelerated. Why?  1. Strong, steady, honest and courageous  leadership was lacking in both the Johnson  and Nixon Administrations.  This country needed effective wage, price,  profit, interest, and credit controls in 1967.  If, at that time, we had understood that it  was  impossible  to spend $30 billion a year  on the war and continue business as usual,  most of  the present problems could have  been a.voided. It is  tempting  for  some  to  point out that Nixon's Wage and Price Con trol policy failed, forgetting that when it was  initiated in 1971, it was a case of too little  and too late. Controls cannot be effective if  profits, interest, credits, and commodities are  exempt from restraints. Furthermore, what  was the use of locking the barn door after  the horse had been stolen? By 1971,  inti.ato  tion was already in full swing, the cost of liv ing having risen 21 percent in four years.  And  then the wheat deal with  the Soviet  Union not only deprived the United States of  a vital food reserve but caused the price of  wheat to quadruple throughout the world.  2. The wrong monetary remedy was ap plied  to fiscal policy. The purpose of  the  Federal Reserve Bank is to sustain a stable  monetary system, beneficial to the economic  development of the country and to the wel fare of the people. During the past five years  those who make our monetary policy have  failed either to evaluate the situation cor rectly or to help the economy.  A part of the present ""inflation, recession,  and associated financial crises ls rooted in  perverse monetary and fiscal policies. Mone tary policy  is good or bad depending on  whether or not  the Federal Reserve Sys tem uses its power with moderation; soundly,  sensibly, and in the public interest.""  Since 1970 most of the monetary policies  of the Federal Reserve System have been con fused, fluctuating, and political rather than  economic in nature. They have resulted in  financial disruption and an unprecedented  rise in interest rates. In eight years we have  had alternating cycles of too rapid and too  slow monetary growth, resulting in financial  disintegration,  sharp  increases  in  interest  rates, drying up of  long-term credit, and  the collapse of the stock market.  From January 1967 to December 1968, and  from January to December 1972, the Federal  Reserve System increased money supply faster  than the Joint Economic Committee's 6 per cent per year upper-limit guideline. In 1967,  1969, 1970, and 1973-4, money supply growth  was kept under 2 percent. Each money cycle  was accompanied by over-heating, high in terest rates, financial crisis, and finally re cession.  Events of the last eight years suggest that  is a. great need  there  for  financial reform  and possibly for  the accountability of the  Federal Reserve System to the House Bank ing Committee. While the Federal Reserve  can directly control  the reserve base with  some accuracy, it cannot evaluate or exert  direct guidance on the long-term economic  planning of the country. ""In some ways, the  nation's economy can be viewed as a giant  ocean  liner and  its policy  instruments as  controls. The  controls are set broadly  to  bring the ship to it.s destination and, though  there may be adjustments for currents or'  storms, the course is not changed from hour  to hour-nor is any captain foolish enough  to think that he can turn the ship around  sharply, as if it were a speedboat."" Future  economic planning should not depend on a  volatile interest rate policy. How can indus try, agriculture, and consumers fight infla tion,  if the Federal Reserve  in three years  allows  a  300 percent  increase  in  interest  rates?  Dr. Andrew Brimmer, a former member of  the Federal Reserve Board, has admitted that  the agency miscalculated economic trends in  the country. Many participants at the Sum  mit Economic conference conceded that there  have been serious errors of judgment by the  Federal Reserve-errors  that have created  high  interest  rates,  restricted  economic  growth, and as a result have contributed to  the present inflation. What the Federal Re serve directors have not contemplated is that  usually the high rates of interest are a sure  guarantee for continuing .'..nflation.  3. Neither the Administration nor the Fed eral Reserve had a plan to cope with the sud den demand for American agricultural and  industrial goods all over the world.  Before 1967, there was a demand for Amer ican food and industrial goods, but very few  countries could afford  them. The Vietnam  War,  the  increase ln purchasing power of  the Western European countries, the Soviet  Union and Japan created both inflation and  demand for raw materials. Many developing  ",1974

350,,93,-0.598,457,30,Mr. PROXMIRE.," May I say to my good  friend, the Senator from Alabama, I am  sure his amendment has merit. The dif ficulty is the House considered this and  deferred it. The Army did not even re claim when it came to the Senate, they  did not ask that it be restored. The Sen ate did consider it, and they felt that for.  economy reasons and because they are  constraining the budget very tightly they  reduced the overall military construction  budget by 15 percent, one of the biggest  reduction anywhere,  that  they simply  could not put it in.  I would  like  to  tell my  friend,  the  Senatqr from Alabama, that I will do my  best to work with the majority leader,  who is the chairman of the subcommit tee,  to see if we can win consideration  for it next year.  ",1974
351,Senate,93,-0.333,483,30,Mr. STEVENSON.," Mr. President, I be:.  lieve that is understood by the Senate  conferees.    I should like to suggest a modification  to that of the Senator from Idaho, if the  Senator from Idaho will give me his at tention for a moment. The modification  is simply that the motion to instruct the  Senate conferees be amended to include  the instruction that they insist upon all  the provisions of the second conference  report, with  the exceptions which  the  Senator has mentioned;  namely,  the  Church amendment and the Proxmire  amendment. Otherwise, we are, I thirik,  in greater danger of giving away  the  very sound reforms which were first ap proved by the Senate and then adopted  in conference.  With the understanding, if the Sen ator accepts  the modification,  I  think  we shall all seek to obtain the most we  can.  ",1974
352,Senate,93,0.029,483,30,Mr. SCHWEIKER.," Yes, I have agreecl  to both modifications to my motion. My  original motion was to recommit the bill  with instructions that we accept as a  threshold the initial agreement of the  first conference report; also, beyond that,  the Church amendment banning a Soviet  energy deal, and the Proxmire amend ment saying the Bank shall come under  congressional budgetary reporting pro cedures. If that is the issue-",1974
353,Senate,93,0.135,483,30,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President,  I  shall support sending this back, although,  as  I  told some of my fellow Senators  earlier, I have talked with Congressman  ASHLEY and Congressman FRENZEL, who  were two of the principal conferees. The  House is obdurate on the Church amend ment, I am not going to argue whether  rightly or wrongly.  I shall support the motion to recom mit, and I shall support the Senate's in structions. The House is under similar  instructions to do exactly the opposite. If  each House stands firm,  there will be  no Export-Import Bank, short of some  kind of concurrent resolution to extend  it for 6 months or a year, which both  Senator STEVENSON and I find a very un satisfactory situation from  the stand point of the Bank. Nevertheless, it is ob vious  that  the cloture votes have not  varied more than two or three votes. We  may as well try to go back to conference,  realizing that, as we start in, we are at  least deadlocked on an issue on which  each House has instructed its conferees  to stand firm on positions.

357,House,93,0.133,561,30,Mr. SARASIN.," Mr. Speaker, I am a co sponsor of H.R. 17504, legislation which  will grant status as a private, nonprofit  corporation  to  the American Film In stitute.  AFI is now part of the National En dowments for the Arts and Humanities  and $225,000 from NEH, for a rough total  of $2 million. Some $1.2 million arc antic ipated  from private  sources, bringing  their total anticipated revenues to $3.2  million. They anticipate  requesting  a  modest increase in the fiscal 1976 budget.  In 1966, the Stanford Report from the  Stanford Research  Institute estimated  that costs to operate AFI should be in  the neighborhood of $8 million, and the  report concluded that--in the words of  George Stevens, Jr., director of AFI in  hearings before our subcommittee-that  the American Film  Institute  ""should  have divisions which will implement pro grams for an advanced study center for  film  education,  archives,  information  services, planning and research.""  Stevens reported that todayAs a  result of AFI's collaborative archive  program with the Library of Congress,  the  Museum of Modern Art, George Eastman  House, and other institutions, there are 12,500 films preserved in the AFI collection in  the Library of Congress ....  Today,  the American Film Institute has  an oral history program ... When complete  this will be an unmatched and essential rec ord for scholars, historians, and journalists  of the cultural legacy of the visual media ....  ""Today, the conservatory (Center for Ad vanced Film Studies at Graystone) exists and  ls recognized as one of the leading film and  television academies in the entire world.  The Center for Advanced Film Studies,  according to Stevens, attracts the most  promising and talented aspirants from  every part of the country, ""Through sem inars and workshops with  the Screen  Actors Guild,  the American Society of  Cinematographers and Writers Guild of  America we have created a unique rela tionship with the professional commu nity. The names of the people who have  been to our conservatory in California to  lecture and tutor is an anthology of the  great people of the cinema arts.""  Stevens listed the names of graduates  of  the Graystone center, among  them  John Hancock, ""Beat the Drum Slowly,""  Terrance Malick, a Rhodes Scholar, and  Harvard University, who wrote and pro duced ""Badlands"" which, according  to  CXX--2530-Part 30  critics, is one of the most outstanding  films of  the year, awarded the grand  prize as best pictilre at the International  Film Festival in Spain.  Two programs conducted at the con servatory are  related  to  training new  artists. AFI has given 130 grants to in dependent film artists across the coun try, which enable experimental film art ists to advance their careers.  Another, is a program of internships,  whereby talented young people from the  conservatory are assigned to a  leading  :filmmaker to observe first hand. the mak ing of a film. According to Stevens, this  is ""a unique opportunity, and it is made  possible by AFI's constructive relation ship with the professional community.""  Stevens also listed for the record the  list of 21 prizes and awards won by AFI  students and grantees.  They lllustrate the recognition and respect  the AFI's filmmakers are earning.  Mr. Speaker, AFI is seeking independ ent status because it has ceased to grow  in funding as the National Endowment  for the Arts has grown.  Stevens calls his budget ""static"" over  the past few years, and believes that his  best chances for growth will be through  the route of independence.  He acknowledged that this will be dif ficult, inasmuch as Congress faces strin gent measures to keep our Federal spend ing in balance, and unnecessary expendi tures cut to the maximum.  Many will say that this funding for  AFI is unnecessary, that we do not need  moneys for the arts at a time of national  crisis.  I believe otherwise, and would remind  my colleagues that the art of film speaks  to  the world of  the American culture  and accomplishments of our democratic  society.  We are presently housing in the Na tional Gallery of Art an art exhibit un paralleled in our history, which repre sents some thousands of years of Chinese  culture, shown through its arts.  What is it a civilization leaves behind  to demonstrate to the societies that fol low something of the worth of its national  life? Is it not in truth shown in great pro portion by  the literature, by the arts?  And in AFI's case, the art of film, which  is truly the medium of the culture of our  people, will be a legacy of our culture to  those who follow in our footsteps.  In my opinion, AFI is, in fact, an at tempt to upgrade the art of film. And  anyone looking at the amusement pages  of any major newspaper can say, in truth,  that America's films need to be upgraded.  AFI seeks through grants to filmmakers  and the training of young people, to in fuse new blood into the movie industry and the choice of trainees is made from  among well-educated young people, both  men and women, which I believe the in dustry badly needs.  AF! has made errors, but the issue of  whether there should be a fi!ti1 institute  transcends personalities and who hap pens to be at the helm of AF! at present.  The concept of providing assistance to  those engaged  in  the art of  training  young  filmmakers, making  grants  to  independent filmmakers, attempting  to  provide services to over 600 colleges and  universities who have departments of  to  thank  film,  providing  conservation work  for  master works of film, et cetera, to my  mind is worth supporting with Federal  money. The British and other European  countries  recognize  the uniqueness of  film by setting up independent agencies  to work in this area, why not the United  States?  Everyone recognizes the worth of the  British Broadcasting Corp. and the ex cellence of its product, seen on our edu cational television networks-the Eliza beth series, the Henry VIII series, War  and Peace, Upstairs, Downstairs, et cet era. Why are we not producing this qual ity and remaining competitive? Why do  networks, such as ABC-TV go to Great  Britain and BBC to produce Gore Vidal's  biography of Aaron Burr? American ac tors and other creative artists are out of  work, we need  the stimulation of  thi'S  vital industry-the movie industry pro duces the bulk of films for television which AFI provides, in order that we may  produce the talented, educated, excellent  filmmakers which we need  remain  competitive with the foreign market.  It is my opinion that AFI should be  granted its wish to become independent,  and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of this measure.  ",1974

I  think there  are various reasons why one should be  opposed to this bill. It is somewhat prec edent setting.  This bill would in effect give independ ent status  to a Federal grantee based  upon the premise that its benefactor in  the past, in this case the National En dowment of  the Arts, has not been as  generous with Federal  funds  as  the  American Film Institute would have it  be. I can see if established this sort of  precedent many subgrantees coming to  the Congress and asking for independent  status  to get out from under  the re straints of having to prove their value  among competing claims for the funds  that have been furnished to some larger  more encompassing organization.

362,House,93,0.157,613,30,Mr. BROTZMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to join my colleagues in paying tribute  to LES ARENDS. During  the 10 years I  have been privileged  to  represent  the  Second District of Colorado in the House  of Representatives, I have found LES to  be a source of strength. His leadership  abilities are well known and his accom plishments are legion.  The people of  the 15th District of  Illinois have certainly  recognized LES'  abilities. That is why  they asked him  to represent them in the House for 40  years. Their  judgment has  been  re warded with outstanding service. The  94th Congress will miss LEs ARENDS,  but he has surely earned the retirement  he has chosen. Mrs. Brotzman and I wish  him well in all of his future endeavors.  ",1974
363,House,93,0.739,613,30,Mr. CRANE.," Mr.  Speaker,  LESl.IE  ARENDS has had one of the longest and  most distinguished careers of any Mem ber of this House.  First elected to the 74th Congress on  November 6, 1934, he has been reelected  to every Congress since that time and  since 1943 has held the position of Re publican whip.  While other party leaders have come  and gone, have  incurred the wrath of  their colleagues, inspired hostility on the  part of their opponents, and ended their  careers not by their own choice but by  the choice of others, LESLIE ARENDS' leg acy is far different.  His decision to retire at this time sad dens all those who have had the oppor tunity to know him and work with him  through the years. This is particularly  true for those of us from his own State  of Illinois. A native of  Illinois, LESLIE  ARENDS served that State with a devotion  and dedication borne only of real love  and affection.  Yet, his has never been a narrow or  parochial approach to the Nation's af fairs. He has been aware of the fact that  ours is a nation of men and women of di verse backgrounds, of many racial, re ligious, and ethnic origins, from sections  of a vast nation whose interests often  conflicted, and had to be reconciled. LEsLIE ARENDS viewed his leadership role, at  least in part, as that of such a reconciler.  For this reason, for his ability to under stand the problems and interests of so  many different people, his leadership po sition has never been seriously chal lenged.  It is unfortunate that today,  in the  wake of an unprecedented period of po litical turmoil, that the American people  have lost much of their confidence in po litical leaders. It is true, as the Found ing Fathers so often warned us, that that  government is best which governs least.  It is equally true, as Lord Acton noted,  that power tends to corrupt, and abso lute power tends to corrupt absolutely.  The Constitution carefully  limits  the  power of each branch of Government,  and states clearly what powers govern ment is to have and which are to be re served  to  the people  themselves. Yet,  within the limited range of government,  men of honor and vision are required.  The low esteem in which politics and  politicians are now held would be re versed were  the American people  to  understand  the careers of  individuals  such as LESLIE ARENDS. He has brought  honor  to his State, to his family, and  most particularly to this House of Repre sentatives in which he has served for 40  years.  It is with sadness that we bid farewell  to LESLIE ARENDS, but not only sadness.  We are also  thankful that the Nation  brings forth men of his stature to serve  in the political life of the Nation. As long  as  it does, our freedom will be more  secure.  Such accomplishment has been the re sult of hard and diligent work, something  which  sets  apart  leaders  from  those  whose interests and concerns are else where. LESLIE ARENDS brings to mind the  verse by Henry W. Longfellow  in his  poem, ""The Ladder of St. Augustine"":  The heights by great men reached and kept  Were not attained by sudden flight,  But they, while their companions slept,  Were toiling upward in the night.

364,House,93,0.177,613,30,Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama.," Mr.  Speaker, it is an honor to join with my  colleagues  today  to pay  tribute  to my  good friend LES ARENDS.  LEs, who came  to Congress in 1935,  through diligence and hard work soon  became a highly respected and influen tial Member of this body. Through the  years he has shown both wisdom and  vision and has been a truly great legislator. His unfailing enthusiasm and per suasiveness have been a compelling force  in creating and effecting outstanding  legislation.  My colleagues on this side of the aisle  will certainly miss his energetic work  with  the party  leadership and as our  whip, a position in which he has served  since 1943.  With his retirement, we are losing a  truly outstanding Congressman, one who  has been dynamic, capable, persuasive,  a .. 1cl productive While it is sad to think  of  this  body without  him,  after  40  continuous years of service to his con stituents and to his country, his volun tary retirement is certainly well earned.  He will long be remembered by all who  have had the privilege of serving with  him, and for whom he has been and will  continue to be an inspiration.  I am sure the rest of my colleagues  join with me in extending to him our  deep appreciation for his great service,  and wishing him the best for the years  to come.  ",1974

You wish them the best,  but you hate to see them leave. That is  how I feel about our distinguished col league from New Jersey, PETER H. B.  FRELINGHUYSEN, who  is  leaving at the  end of this Congress.  I am proud to count PETER as a close  personal friend, and I will miss his pres ence greatly in the 94th Congress. But  the loss to the House and the country  will overshadow my personal  loss,  for  PETER  is  truly an outstanding legisla tor.  PETER'S record during his 22 years of  service speaks for  its'elf. It is a record  that reflects his concern for both his  constituents and his country.  For the past 14 years it has been my  pleasure and honor to serve with Con gressman FRELINGHUYSEN on the House  Foreign Affairs Committee. During that  time I have developed a great admiration  for his tremendous ability and dedica tion.  Although he has served as  ranking  minority member on  the Foreign Af fairs Committee a relatively short time,  he has served with distinction. He was  particularly effective as  the  leader of  the House delegation  that visited  the  People's Republic of China this fall.  I  was fortunate enough  to be a part of  that delegation, and PETER'S leadership  in representing the U.S. position on some  very important issues was invaluable.  It is my sincere hope that the vast  experience and ability that PETER FRE LINGUYSEN possesses will be used for fur ther public service in the future. A man  of his talents is a rare thing, indeed. For  the Government  to  fail  to utilize his  ability would be a  tragic and shameful  waste.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to wish  Congressman PETER FRELINGHUYSEN  all  the best in the years ahead. I shall miss  him here  in  this Chamber where he  served so ably for over two decades, and  I thank him for his friendship, and his  outstanding service to Congress and his  country.  ",1974

CHAMBERLAIN.  When CHUCK  CHAMBERLAIN  entered  Congress in 1957, his district included the  cities of Lansing and Flint, Mich.,  the  homes of three large automobile compa nies. His  constituency  included more  automobile workers  than  that of any  other Member. This circumstance set the  direction of his main legislative interest  through the years, an interest he pur sued so vigorously  that he earned the  designation, ""the auto horn of Congress.""  Mr. Speaker, events of recent months  certainly tend to support CHUCK CHAM BERLAIN'S contention  that the vigor of  our automobile industry, or its lack, di rectly affects  the health of  the entire  American economy. He has taught us a  lesson we should not forget.  I might, Mr. Speaker, mention also  Congressman  CHAMBERLAIN'S  extended  labor on the Armed Services Committee,  during one of the most difficult military  eras in the Nation's history; or I could  summarize his work on  the Ways and  Means Committee when it produced some  of  the most  important  tax  legislation  in a generation.  But this  is not really necessary, be cause this  is by no means  the end of  CHUCK CHAMBERLAIN'S career. He leaves  this body with our friendship, our re spect, and our very best wishes for the  future.  ",1974
368,,93,0.217,678,30,Mr. GUYER.," Mr. Speaker, only once in  a half century does  a man  like LES  ARENDS come upon the political horizon.  Unassuming, quiet of nature, profound  in wisdom,  sparkling  in humor, com manding  in  sincerity,  dependable  in  crises, loyal in allegiance, and sterling in  character-here is a man who would be  at home with Will Rogers or Pope Paul.  We new Members of Congress, who  came to know LES, first by reputation,  and next by personal privilege-soon  knew we were in the company of a man  who stands on that very narrow rim of  Alpine leadership.  Standing on that lonely ledge of mi nority circumstance, LEs always towered  above the battle. His quiet but persuasive  voice rallied his team with excitement  and vitality. If we lost, he always found  time to say thinks. If we won, he was  the first to pat us on the back. He was  often our only avenue of communica tions between the White House and the  Congress.  LES ARENDS made life exciting and in teresting. He was never bored, and could  find as much enthusiasm over the price  of soybeans as successfully sustaining a  Presidential veto.  But more importantly, LES ARENDS  is  one of a dying breed-a real gentleman.  He always did the common things un commonly well. Farmer, golfer, legislator,  leader, community worker, family man,  and much more-LES ARENDS has  the  esteem of his colleagues, the love of his  countrymen, and the respect for people  in high and low places. His niche will  never be filled and his remembrance will  always be a treasure to those who knew  him and admired him. We wish him  well.  LABELING OF OLEOMARGARINE  HON. JOHN C. KLUCZYNSKI  OF  ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 16, 1974  is  ",1974
369,,93,-0.382,678,30,Mr. KLUCZYNSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I am  introducing this bill for the purpose of  bringing the food margarine into more  uniformity with  the Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act as respects  two  labeling  requirements. When  the  old Federal  taxes were repealed, special requirements  were inserted into the act requiring col ored margarine  to be  labeled  ""Mar garine""  or  ""Oleomargarine""  in  let ters as large as any others on the label  or, on an inner wrapper, in 20-point let ters. These  requirements  are  section  407(b)  (3-A) and (4), respectively.  They are necessary, as a quarter cen tury of experience has shown. Marga rine labeling should be covered as all  other foods are covered under the act,  by  the misbranding section 403. Since  these unique requirements were set up,  margarine has become a food in almost  universal use;  it  the major  table  spread. No special problems attend its  sale. It should be brought under  the  same provisions of  law  that apply  to  other  foods  in  the  interests of uni formity, lower packaging costs, and sim pler enforcement, and with no loss of  consumer protection.  New packaging and labeling laws we  have enacted cover margarine the same  as other foods. New labeling regulations  issued by the Food and Drug Adminis tration and issued or proposed by the  Department of Agriculture make no spe cial. clauses for margarine.  Section 407  itself merely reflects the  obsolete idea that margarine had to be  specially restricted or limited in its sale.  Whatever relevance that concept had 25  years ago, it has none now.  My bill would bring margarine  into  uniformity with the act in two respects:  First, applying the regular provisions of  section 403 to the word ""Margarine"" or  ""Oleomargarine"" on the label, instead of  the rigid present requirement. Section  403 requires such a name to be truthful,  conspicuous, and understandable-sub sections a, b, c, f, and g. Within these  requirements allows some flexibility  in  size of type.  There  is no  reason why margarine  should not have  the limited flexibility  permitted under section 403. Conspicu ousness  is  the real objective, and this  requirement is in the act. A considera tion is the fact that so mqch information  is required to be on margarine package which at its largest is only 5 by 5 inches  and for smaller units is much less:  list  of  ingredients,  nutrition  data,  net  weight-ounces and pounds-and name  and address of manufacturer or distrib utor. Many margarines also include poly unsaturates and cholesterol information.  Smaller units have to cram all this lan guage into one small panel.  Second, removing the 20-point mini mum type size  requirements for  inner  wrappers, in cases where the margarine  so wrapped is not intended to be sold as  ",1974

376,House,93,-0.123,925,30,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. Chairman, my  grandfather at one  time when  I was  arguing with him about something and  he felt he knew a great deal more about  it than I, looked at me and said: ""Son,  don't confuse me with the facts. My mind  is made up."" When we talk about the  rice bill I sometimes think we are in the  same situation today because I think by  and large the people sitting here listen ing to the general debate have basically  made up their minds. However, I think  there are some very  important points  which should be made as  to why  this  bill at this time is not necessary.  Not only is it not necessary as timely  legislation but also it is not necessary  because it is basically a very bad bill.  I think it is very important for all of  us to realize under the present program  we are operating in this country with  regard to rice, the farmers of this coun try have produced 23 percent more rice  this year than last year. That is basically  because the present program-when we  need more rice-demands the Secretary  of Agriculture to remove allotments and  open up production so that anyone, as  the gentleman from Texas,  the chair man of  the Committee on Agriculture,  said, whether he be from New Hamp shire or california, can produce  rice.  That is what has allowed us to produce  some 23 percent more  than last year.  That  is 2.5 million acres of rice  that  were produced in this country this year.  That  is approximately a half million  more acres than we normally produce.  I  think the program' is working well  when we consider we produced 10 per cent more than the all-time record pro duction year in 1968.  All that has been accomplished under  the present existing rice program.  I would also like to point out that the  proponents of  this bill have stood up  and argued that we need more rice so we  can  feed  the starving nations of  the  world. Let me point out that under the  1974 rice crop 1 million tons of rice was  supposed  to move overseas under  the  Public Law 480 program. Barely one fourth of that amount has been moved  and up until 2 weeks ago  the Depart ment of Agriculture was saying that as  much as 1.3 millon tons of rice would be  left over from this year's crop, surplus  rice, and that is rice that was not in cluded in the Public Law 480 program.  Now they say they have managed enough  of  the program  to work  that surplus  down; but  three-quarters of a million  tons of rice is still possible in carryover  stocks, of stocks that simply will not be  marketed this year.  I  think it is  important for our col leagues to understand that in rice we are  not talking about the same type of pro gram as we are with wheat, corn, cotton,  and other seed grains, because under rice  we export two-thirds of every bit of rice  that is grown in this country. Of that  two-thirds, one-third is marketed under  Public Law 480  programs. Only one third is left to be consumed in this coun try. A great deal of that is consumed by  the beer  industry. They are  the main  consumers benefited by  this bill;  the  beer industry, not the farmers, not the  farm organizations and not the enlight ened consumers who really understand  what we are talking about.  Let us talk for a  few minutes about  the price of rice. The distinguished gen tleman from the State of New York was  very concerned that his people in New  York are having to pay more for rice  than they have in 20 years. Let me point  out that in 1973 the price of rice did go  up after it had been very stable for ap proximately 20 years. The price went up  because the crops in the United States  were very poor because of weather con ditions and the crops in Asia were very  poor also. A  tremendous demand was  created. That is why the price went up  in 1973; but let me just tell what is hap pening under  this present program as  far as rice. We have talked about the  Sugar Act, but let us talk about the price  under the rice industry. Under this pres ent program right now that provides for  open production, they produced 23 per cent more rice-that is the Agriculture  Department's :figures. And please listen  to this, the average price of rice that the  American farmer received last year was  $17.10 a hundredweight. That was in the  1973 crop.  Now, in 1974 the Department of Agri culture's own :figures show that in No vember of 1974 the average price, to an  American farmer who was farming rice,  received was down to $11.10, down from  $17.10 a hundredweight in 1973. That is  approximately a 35-percent drop.  I would  join with my colleague,  the  gentleman from New York, in arguing  why  is not the price dropping on  the  shelf?  The CHAIRMAN. The  time of  the  gentleman from Louisiana has expired.  ",1974
377,House,93,0.109,964,30,Mr. PRITCHARD.," Mr. Speaker, I am  going to vote to support this legislation  because  deep  sea  oil  terminals  are  essential for our national energy policy.  They are the only reasonable alterna tive  to  the  construction of  large oil  facilities  close  inshore, and with  the  approaching end of the session we must  accept  this  conference action or not  have a deep port bill.  But I would like to express my dis satisfaction with the final product and  the methods that produced it. By a sub stantial margin, and with full debate on  the merits  of both bills,  this House  adopted  the Merchant Marine  and  Fisheries Committee version over  that  of the Public Works Committee. Then,  with the appointment of a majority of  the House conferees from supporters of  the public works bill, it was assured that  the version adopted by the House would  never receive adequate consideration in  the conference.  This bill before us now lacks clear-cut  administrative authority, has numerous  veto opportunities, provides a series of  special preferential arrangements, and  generally is going to be very difficult to  work with.  It culminates a tortured, wasteful, and  time-consuming legislative process that  has delayed implementation of this vital  portion of our energy plans for nearly  2 years.  If Congress  is  to  effectively  address the many problems confronting  our Nation in the next term, we must do  better than this.  GENERAL LEAVE  ",1974

379,House,93,-0.423,990,30,Mr. BRASCO.," Mr. Speaker, I  regret  that I will not be a Member of the 94th  Congress. I  take this time to extend to  all who will comprise that body my best  wishes in the difficult days that lie ahead  and to explain to my friends and col leagues some of the events of the past  year that caused me  to withdraw my  candidacy for reelection to a fifth term  in the House of Representatives.  On July 19, 1974, I was convicted of a  one-count conspiracy  indictment. This  was the second trial; the first one ended  in a hung jury and the cast is presently  being prepared for appeal.  I want to emphasize at the outset that  I do not intend to use this great forum  to castigate anybody, or for any other  purpose except  to attempt  to demon strate to the Members of this body who  are  responsible  for  enacting  and/o,r  changing the law under which such. tria!s  are conducted the inherent evils of the  law of conspiracy.  These evils translate themselves into  the frustra,tion and unrest that we have  seen emerge whenever this law is used  freely by the Government.  The suspension of the American con cepts of  justice and  fairness  charac terized by  the  law of conspiracy has  caused many people, both publicly and  privately,  to speak out against it, and  Judge Learned Hand to label it as the  ""dung heap of the prosecutorial effort.""  I now wish to present for your con sideration an analysis of some of  the  stark realities concerning Federal crim inal practices as compiled by my at torney, Herbert A. Lyon,  a most  re spected member of the New York State  Criminal Bar Association:  DEAD MEN CAN TESTIFY  The law of conspiracy has so evolved from  the principle of agency that it has become  permissible  to  introduce  into  evidence  against a defendant  testimony not subject  to cross-examination.  The theory constructed is that each mem ber of the alleged conspiracy acts as an agent  of all of the others. Therefore, he is respon sible for and damned by any statement made  by any coconspirator in the furtherance of  the conspiracy even though there is no alle gation  that the defendant was ever aware  that the statement was made.  Thus,  in Congressman BRAsco's  trial,  a  witness, Doherty, admittedly a  thief and a  liar, was permitted  to  testify  that a man  named Sullivan gave $2,000 to Doherty and  that Sullivan  said  to Doherty  the $2,000  came from Uncle Joe Brasco. The jury was  instructed that it might consider this testi mony  binding  on  Congressman  FRANK  BRASCO. The  rationale was  that a witness  named Masiello, an admitted perjurer, ex tortionist, and underworld  figure,  testified  in absentia  that Joe Brasco was a  cocon spirator and  Joe Brasco  sent Masiello  to  FRANK BRASCO.  The evil in this combination of horrors is  further dramatized by  the  fact  that  the  above mentioned testimony concerning Sul livan's alleged  transference of  a  bribe  to  Doherty was made known to the defendant  only after Sullivan died.  To make matters worse, Doherty's testi mony concerning Sullivan was made known  to the Government-special agents, U.S. At torneys-in 1970, years before Sullivan died.  However,  the Government's answer  to de fense  inquiry as  to Sullivan's response  to  Doherty's charge was  the  incredible state ment that no Government agent ever ques tioned Sullivan in this regard although Sul livan's whereabouts were well known and he  was readily available.  Now to get to the ruling that should be  the final horror-except there is more-the  representation by  the Government  that  it  had never questioned Sullivan was never to  reach the ears of the jury. This tidbit was  ruled inadmissible.  Similarly, the defense had available to it  testimony that while Sullivan was alive he  .had  responded  to  other  statements  by  Doherty. Doherty had already become a Gov ernment witness and  this  fact was made  known  to  the public  through  the media.  However, Doherty's claim of a  $2,000 pay ment from ""Uncle"" Joe Brasco through Sul livan never surfaced while Sullivan was alive.  Sullivan  responded  to what he did hear  about Doherty by telling the defendant and  the defendant's attorney that Doherty was a  liar,  that Sullivan never  trusted him and  would never have any dealings with Doherty.  This  testimony was  ruled  inadmissible.  ",1974
380,,93,0.015,1016,30,Mr. WAGGONNER.," Mr. Speaker,  it  gives me a great deal of personal satis faction to be able to pay tribute today  to one of the House's most respected and  dedicated members,  the distinguished  Republican whip, LES ARENDS.  I can remember, just as if it were yes terday, when I came to Congress as a  freshman back in 1961 LES ARENDS say ing to me:  JoE, remember you must look after the in terests of your constituents as best you can  because  they are  the ones that elect you.  But, you must also look after the interests  of your country, and it should be your first  consideration above all else.  Well, I have tried to live up to those  words of a wise statesman, and there is  no one here that has lived up to them  any better than LES ARENDS himself. I  guess it was from that time on that LEs  and I began what I consider to be a close  association and friendship. During my  13  years  in Congress,  I  have worked  about as close with LES ARENDS as I have  with any man here. He has been as good  a friend as I have had. We have fought  legislative battles on  just about every  major issue coming before this body, and  LEs' word has always been his bond. LEs  ARENDS' overriding consideration has al ways been what was in the best interests  of the country.  Needless  to say, Les has been a  re spected arid effective leader and has been  an excellent example to his friends and  colleagues. He has been devoted to the  people of his district and his State and,  of course, his country. His untiring and  unselfish efforts always seemed more ef fective during crisis times. His strength  and courage will be remembered by those  of us who have benefited by his leader ship and wisdom.  You know, it is difficult for me to imag ine that LES ARENDS will not be serving  in the 94th Congress. After 40 years of  service in the House, he has become an  institution. His 31 years as Republican  whip have surely gained for him the last ing title of ""Mr. Republican Whip.""  Well, as LES  leaves the House at the  close of a brilliant and illustrious career,  I want him to know that this  is one  Member from the other side of the aisle  that will long remember and cherish the  warm friendship and close association  we've had over the years. My heartfelt  best wishes and personal regards go out  to him.  NO IRANIAN MILITARY TRANSFERS  IN OCTOBER 1973  HON. LEE H.

At our Rules Committee hearings last  week, the senator from North Carolina  <Mr. ERVIN)  testified in behalf of this  legislation. I would  just like to read a  paragraph. The bill passed the Senate by  a vote of almost 3 to 1.  This quote comes from Senator ERVIN:  S. 2439 represents a reasonable request that  a 2-year study of the New River be conducted  by  the  secretary  of  the  Interior  (who  strongly endorses the legislation)  to deter mine  the  feasibility of  re<iommending  to  Congress whether it should be placed in the  Naitional Wild and Scenic Rivers System.  Surely, you could have no objection to the  study. Final disposition of the matter must  ultimately be made by  the Congress, and  armed with an objective study most certainly  will give proper guidance in making such a  decision.  Those are the words of Senator SAM  ERVIN.  All  environmental, wildlife, outdoor,  Isaac Walton, United Mine Workers, and  Auto Workers are supporting New River.  The SPEAKER.

386,House,93,0.39,1341,30,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. Speaker, the Coastal  Zone Management Act of 1972 estab lished a national objective  to  restore,  protect,  and  enhance  our  country's  coastal zone  resources,  to bring about  implementation  of management  pro grams by the various States for the pru dent use of the land and water resources  of the coastal zone, and to encourage the  participation  of  the  public,  Federal,  State, and local governments in the de velopment of such programs.  Although the act became effective in  October of 1972, funding was not appro priated until December 1973. Because of  this, implementation of the program be gan less than a year ago. Since that time  31 of the 34 States and territories eligi ble for grants have already applied for  and received such funds and are making  the much needed headway  toward  the  development of their coastal zone man agement programs. My home State of  Mississippi was eligible for and received  slightly over $100,000 in Federal money  for a 3-year development period begin ning in May 1974.  Unfortunately,  sufficient  funds were  not available to meet the needs of all of  the applying coastal States during the  first year of  the act's operation, and  grants for some States were postponed.  Even though the appropriation for fiscal  year 1975 was increased to the authoriza tion level of the original act, it is evident  at this point that there will be additional  unmet grant requests.  Since I am aware  through my own  State  and  from  working with  the  Merchant Marine and Fisheries Commit tee that the States have expressed their  enthusiastic support of the coastal zone  management program and have tangibly  demonstrated their good faith intentions,  often by providing funding in excess of  ",1974
387,House,93,-0.306,1354,30,Mr. HANLEY.," Mr. Speaker, with the  demise of the 93d Congress an excep tionally large number of sitting Mem bers will be leaving. If time allowed, I  would enjoy expounding on the virtues  of so many of them as I have enjoyed  a delightful association with virtually  every one of them. At this moment my  thoughts are of my long time friend and  corridor neighbor, HUGH CAREY.  In all  candor, I  too have mixed emotions, as  I  am disheartened at  the  thought of  HuGH's departure from the 93d Congress  in recognition of his truly outstanding  capabilities. On the other hand, I am  greatly heartened at the thought of his  assuming  the  reins as chief executive  of my native State, New York.  I  am  confident that as time proceeds, the peo ple of my State are going to take great  pride  in Governor CAREY. His virtues,  incidentally, must  have  greatly  im pressed New Yorkers as he was elected  Governor with  the  largest  plurality  since the election of the late and great  Al Smith.  HUGH enlisted in our military estab lishment and served through World War  II with great distinction.  In essence,  from the date of his enlistment to the  present time, he has dedicated himself  to the cause of Government and as such  a better society.  His  service  in  the Congress  com menced as of the 87th Congress. Thus,  our Nation has enjoyed his services in  this body for 14 years. His constituency  has indeed been well served and I  feel  certain  that  like myself, most of his  constituents have mixed emotions. That  is, losing him in the Congress but gaining  him as our Governor.  His very special attention during his  tenure in the Congress to the plight of  handicapped  children  provided  some  evidence of  the nature of  this great  man. His determination to assure that  one day every American child would en joy equal educational opportunities  is  another quality most worthy of note.  Truly his achievements here in the Con gress would fill many, many pages. Time  does not allow me  the opportunity  to  elaborate. It is especially interesting to  note that throughout this arduous pe riod of public service, Governor CAREY  was a family man in every sense of the  word. The mutual devotion between he  and his late wife, Helen, was always so  obvious.  Their  14  beautiful  children  cemented a magnificent relationship. I  am confident that Helen is so proud of  HUGH'S success in the New York elec tion and certainly from the Heavens will  be a guiding force to him as he assumes  his new challenge.  I have said many times that I have  never heard an  ill word about HuGH  CAREY from any Member on either side  of the aisle. This .again is a great testi mony  to an  individual  in  recognition  of a philosophical and position difference  which we in the Congress are confronted  with on a day-to-day basis.  One of  the great rewards of public  service  is  the privilege of associating  with fine people. In the case of Governor  CAREY,  I have indeed been blessed and  I will always  treasure  this association  and cherish the friendship which I am  ",1974
388,House,93,-0.484,1367,30,Mr. HELSTOSKI.," Mr. Speaker, a sig nificant proportion of Members will re tire at the end of this session and among  those most sorely missed will be Con gressman THADDEUS DULSKI, Representa tive of New York's 37th Congressional  District.  I would like to take this opportunity to  extend my best wishes to Congressman  DuLSKI on the occasion of his retirement,  and to thank him not only for the many  contributions he made to Congress, but  for the contributions he made to America.  Congressman DuLsKI brought an in spiring sense of decency and diligence to  his work in the Congress, and provided  his constituents with excellent  repre sentation for 16 years. As chairman of  the House Post Office and Civil Service  Committee,  he  consistently  displayed  compassion, perseverance. and a great  deal of legislative skill in dealing with  matters that came before his committee.  In addition, as a member of the House  Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I had the  privilege of working on this committee  with Congressman DuLsKI. Again his per formance on the committee was charac terized by dedication and the determina tion to do everything possible to make  life better for our veterans.  Mr. Speaker, though THADDEUS DuL SKI will no longer represent the people of  New York's 37th Congressional District, I  am confident that his community will  continue to benefit from his leadership,  integrity, and experience. It has been a  privilege for me  to have Congressman  DULsKI as a colleague and a friend.  ",1974
389,House,93,-0.536,1367,30,Mr. NIX.," Mr. Speaker, it is with deep  regret that I rise to note the retirement  of one of our most distinguished commit tee chairmen, THADDEUS J. DULSKI of New  York. As a member of the Post Office and  Civil Service Committee, I have had the  honor and the opportunity to work closely  with THAD DuLsKI, who has served as the  able chairman of that committee in the  past four Congresses.  We all know the qualities that a com mittee chairman should have-patience,  the willingness to listen to all points of  view, commonsense, dedication, and so  forth. And we all know how difficult it is  for a chairman to live up to the demands  and expectations of his committee. I am  happy to say that THAD DULSKI haJ more  than met the stern test of leadership in  our committee. He has been unfailing in  his understanding of the problems and  points of view of members of the com mittee and of other Members of  the  }louse. He has never waivered  in his  devotion to his duties. His knowledge and  command of the subject matter of the  committee's jurisdiction has set a high  standard for the other Members. He has  always carried more than his share of  the burden in committee work, and he  has expected the rest of us  to do  the  same ..  In short, Mr. Speaker, THAD DULSKI  has more than lived up to the demands  made on him. I would be hard pressed  to think of another chairman who would  better exemplify the qualities we expect  of our chairmen in this House. He has  served as a model and an inspiration, I  am sure, to many Members learning the  legislative ropes of Congress.  THAD DuLSKI has served as chairman  of the Post Office and Civil Service Com mittee in a time of reform and change.  He has labored long and hard to replace  the antiquated organization of the Post  Office with a reformed and streamlined  Postal Service. He has completely  re formed the salary and pay raise mecha nism of the Civil Service. He has fought  to maintain and r~ise the high standards  of excellence that we expect of employees  of the Federal Government. And he has  fought just as hard to see to it that Fed eral employees are not  treated as  the  stepchildren of the Government, but re ceive the compensation, the benefits, and  the working conditions that they deserve.  Despite his heavy workload, THAD DuL SKI has never  forgotten his  responsi bilities to his constituents. He has de voted himself wholeheartedly to serving  the people of his district with all of their  problems, large and small.  Throughout his distinguished career in  Congress, THAD has always been mindful  that the problems we deal with here are  not abstract problems, but the problems  of people.  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that our Com mittee on Post Office and Civil Service  will lose the services of its able chair man in the next Congress and that this  House will lose one of its most outstand ing and most constructive Members.  I  am sorry, also,  that I will be deprived  of the great privilege of working closely  with a man for whom I have such great  admiration and respect. I am proud to  call myself a friend of THAD DuLSKI. And  though he will not be with us in the next  Congress, my memories of working and  serving with him will always be a cher ished memory and a source of personal  pride.  I wish him  the best of  luck in  whatever he chooses  to pursue  in his  retirement.  ",1974

It has been a privilege  to serve with  him, and his leadership in the House will  be sorely missed during the coming ses sion of Congress.  I wish, however, to extend my warm est good wishes  to him  for whatever  future endeavors he undertakes.  ",1974
391,House,93,-0.562,1367,30,Mr. ROSENTHAL.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  want to join with my colleagues in ex pressing my highest regard for a fell ow  New Yorker who has served with distinc tion in the U.S. House of Representatives  for 16 years.  THAD DuLSKI's years in the House were  devoted  to bettering  the  civil  service  system and the quality of government.  As chairman of the Committee on the  Post Office and Civil Service-a position  he held for 8 years-THAD worked to bring  about the Postal Reorganization Act and  many other governmental reforms. His  concern for  improvement in the postal  system  stemmed  from his  recognition  that postal delivery  touches every in dividual in the Nation.  While serving on the Veterans' Affairs  Committee he was instrumental in up grading the medical care facilities for the  Nation's veterans  and  expanding  the  benefits  available  in general  to older  American veterans.  In  recent years, THAD  has  taken a  leading role in rail reorganization in the  Northeast and improving port facilities  on  the Great Lakes. Recognizing  that  mass  transportation  facilities  are  of  growing significance  to Americans, he  has been particularly active in attempt ing to bring about an expandable net work of railroad branchlines and termi nals. He has also been involved in bring ing about a more effective use of  the  Great Lakes as industrial ports.  For many years, THAD  and  I  have  worked  together within  the New York  State Delegation. While serving as up state dean of  the delegation, he has  shown great leadership in demonstrat ing the similarity of interests between  urban and rural areas in the State. We  will  all miss his  friendship and wise  counsel.  ",1974

As chairman of  the Post Office and  Civil Service Committee since 1967, THAD  DuLSKI has  steered  to passage many  pieces of important legislation.  Aside  from his duties as chairman,  THAD has proven himself to be an eff ec tive  legislator determined  to  represent  the people of his Buffalo, N.Y., district--~  ",1974
393,,93,-0.213,1419,30,Mr. BEVILL.," Mr. Speaker, without ob jection I  am placing in the CONGRES SIONAL RECORD information relating to a  proposal by the Social Security Admin istration to speed-up deposits of social  security tax on the wages paid to State  and local governmental employees.  The State of Alabama is strongly op posed to this proposed change in proce dure. The reasons for this opposition b.re  set forth in two enclosures which I sub mit at this time. I urge my colleagues to  give close study and attention to these  arguments.  The information follows:  STATE OF ALABAMA,  STATE AGENCY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY,  Montgomery, Ala., October 31, 1974.  Hon. TOM BEVILL,  Representative in Congress,  House Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  6642  DEAR CONGRESSMAN BEVILL: I am enclosing  a report from our Federal State Procedures  Committee in which they are really protest ing  any  change  in  our  Social  Security  reporting.  You recall  that State and  local govern ments were removed from the Senate Amend ment  to HR  dealing with  annual  reporting.  What has prompted this protest ls the So cial Security Representatives  in Baltimore  have indicated to the Committee that this  topic will be the second item on the agenda.  at the meeting to be held in Baltimore No vember 17 and 18.  There a.re many local governments in states  who would be forced to terminate due to lack  of funds to employ the required personnel to  handle this additional work. This, of course,  would hurt their employees, but due to the  many hardships this will create, the group  will have no other alternative.  In  just a  few words,  the National Con ference does not wish to have our twenty-five  year reporting program upset.  I have found from personal experience with  Internal Revenue Service  that State and  local government coverage is a foreign lan guage. In fact, Mr. Coppinger, our Internal  Revenue Service Director,  told me once he  knew nothing about Section 218 of the Social  Security law.  The Conference President requested that I  serve another year as Legislative Chairman.  I hope to see you when l.~p that way around  November 19 or 20.  I have just talked with Mr. Edward Baub lits, our, Conference President, and he plans  to be in Washington with me.  Thanks again for all your assistance and  will look forward to seeing you.  Best wishes always!  Sincerely yours,  EDNA M. REEVES,  Chairman, Legislative Committee.  ARTHUR E. HESS,  Deputy Commissione1, Social Security Ad ministration, Baltimore, Md.  DEAR MR. HESS: At the Santa Fe meetings  of  the NCSSSA  this organization was  re quested to submit to the Administration a  position paper setting forth the conclusions  of the states with respect to what would re sult if the long established quarterly report in{; procedure under Section 218 were to be  abandoned and the states were required to  make deposits in the trust funds on a month ly or semi.monthly basis.  Since Congess as evidenced by the language  in the conference committee report on H.R.  6642 (Report No. 93-1400) has forcefully in dicated disapproval of changes in the present  system of  reporting under Section 218  it  would appear that the intimations hitherto  manifested with respect to annual wage re porting and more frequent contributions de posits now may be moot.  However,  for  the  record we are setting  forth in this paper some of the reasons why so  many Senators and Representatives have  gone on  record as vigorously opposed  to   changing  the  remittance procedure upon  which  the  state-federal  agreements were  based, and which has been in effect for such  a  long period.  The  state-federal procedures  committee  at the mandate of the NCSSSA acting as a  committee of the whole has also canvassed  every state on this subject and has been very  much impressed with the general unanimity  of the responses of the states.  We now submit for your review a summary  of the responses from the states as reflected  also in the vigorous language of our repre sentatives in the Federal Congress:  1. Repeatedly state administrators stress  that the proposed abandonment of quarterly  reports and deposits and the substitution of  more frequent reporting requirements would  most certainly stimulate and accelerate the  movement to terminate coverage for public  personnel. Some of the underlying reasons  are set forth later in this paper.  Federal  personnel  have  heretofore  ex pressed  some  concern  over  this  growing  movement  toward  termination. Hence  it  seems  strange  that steps  should now be  taken to increase terminations.  Many political  subdivisions  are  looking  for an excuse to terminate coverage because  the costs are increasing so markedly. This  proposal will definitely provide such an ex cuse. Even now it requires great effort on the  part of the states  to convince  responsible  officials and covered personnel that Social  Security cover.age should not be abandoned  because of the steadily accelerating cost.  The proposed change would provide am munition for private insurance carriers seek ing to induce termination of coverage.  Some state administrators might even be  tempted to cease their efforts to discourage  termination of coverage.  In many of the states where terminations  would be stimulated by the proposed change  the :JOlitical subdivisions most likely to ter minate are the poor areas of these states that  find it difficult to finance their present budg ets. Unfortunately it is these same political  subdivisions where the individuals are the  most in need of the protection pre vided by  Social Security.  2. There apparently has been overlooked  the fa.ct that a  large proportion of covered  agencies under Section 218 are small entities  ordinarily having part-time officials.  After strenuous efforts by education, prod ding,  enforcement  by  field  audits,  cor",1974
394,,93,-0.121,1432,30,Mr. GUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, public  broadcasting has  some very  talented,  dedicated people in its ranks who deserve  public recognition. I am delighted that  the Main Public Broadcasting Network  has awarded a medal to Frederick H.  Sontag, one of  the  really  solid  indi viduals in this field. His commentary and  news programs during recent years have  made fine listening and have shown that  brilliance, courage and foresight do not  all reside in Washington but are equally  evident in individual states, from Florida  to Maine.  Frederick Sontag first became inter ested  in  public  broadcasting  in  the  1950's. For the past 25 years he has shown  remarkable courage and foresight, par ticularly during the difficult periods pub lic broadcasting has gone through. I am  happy for our country that his skills will  again be available in the next session of  Congress and that his persistence in and  devotion to the advancement of this pub lic service area still exist.  Public broadcasting needs the honest,  farsighted people who have been working  in its best interests since its inception  rather than those who are strangers to  the genuine concept of education through  public broadcasting and other services  it is developing.  To those in government and broad casting who will have the opportunity of  benefiting during the next Congress from  Frederick Sontag's many  constructive  ideas, I want to say that I intend to keep  in close touch with him, as he has been  a  loyal and able consultant to me and  to my  legislative staff.  I  feel strongly  that those who will be active in public  broadcasting  during  the  1970's  and  1980's might well  follow Mr. Sontag's  example of persistence, hard work, and  imaginative ideas, which characterize his  work as a public affairs consultant.  I would like at the conclusion of this  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  item to include  articles from the Ellsworth, Maine Amer ican, Oct. 31, 1974, edited by J. Russell  Wiggins, former editor of the Washing ton Post; the Bangor Daily News, Octo ber 16, 1974; excerpts from the official  State  of Maine  Program Guide  of  November 1974, with Frederick Sontag's  biography for his listeners; antl excerpts  from one of several letters from those in  public broadcasting who know him best  for what he has done and will continue  to do.  I am sure his future with my  colleagues  and  associates will  be  as  productive as it has been with me.
