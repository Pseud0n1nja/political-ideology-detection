5,4,1,The VICE PRESIDENT., The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nebraska. ,1974
6,4,1,Mr. CURTIS.," Mr. President, following the anouncement that the Governor of Ohio had designated Mr. METZENBAUM to become one of the U.S. Senators from Ohio, certain matters were called to our attention. One of them appeared in the newspapers. It raises some questions that I believe should be determined at this point. I am not in a position to nor do I pronounce guilt upon any man prior to a hearing. I can best give to the Senate an account of this situation by reading a letter that I wrote to the Honorable MIKE MANSFIELD, majority leader, U.S. Senate, on January 14, 1974. The letter is as follows: DEAR SENATOR MANSFIELD: This letter relates to the seating of Howard Metzenbaum as a Senator from the State of Ohio. On December 27, the Washington 1973, Star-News carried an Associated Press article stating: ""Cleveland industrialist Howard Metzenbaum paid $118,102 in taxes the government claims he owed, Dec. 17, two days before he was appointed U.S. Senator from Ohio, U.S. Tax Court records here showed."" I have examined the documents on file in the U.S. Tax Court in reference to this matter. The government alleges that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) found the following: ""It is determined that the transactions • • • Mr. President, the gravamen of my complaint is not that somebody owed taxes, that this gentleman owed taxes, that he paid them, or that he exercised his right to litigate. That is all conceded. The point involved is the determination by the Internal Revenue Service that transactions set up in his tax return were not bona fide. Were they? The only way we can find out through an investigation and hearing. Reading on from the letter: is I do not know Mr. Metzenbaum. Certainly, there is nothing personal in my presentation, neither are there any partisan considerations because everyone understands that the appointment will go to a member of the majority party. I make the presentation because the integrity of the Senate is at stake. Section V, Article I, of the Constitution provides that each house shall be the judge of the qualifications of its own members. During the time of your leadership, relevant precedents applicable to this situation have been clearly established. I refer specifically to three precedents. The Senator from Connecticut was censured. The so-called Watergate Com.mlttee has applied far reachlng standards of conduct for the Chief Executive. The third precedent to which :r refer were the hearings on the confirmation of our present Vice President. The Vice President was subjected to one of the most intense investigations ever conducted. Judicial notice was not taken of the fact that the voters of his Congressional District had for a quarter of a century approved his conduct. The Vice President was required to prove his innocence in the most minute detail including his finances and tax matters. In determining the qualifications of the Vice President, the Senate went far beyond therequirements enumerated in the Constitution for someone to be eligible for the Office of the President. A similar procedure should be followed when the Senate is asked to pass on the qualifications of someone seeking to be seated as a member of the Senate. To do otherwise would reflect upon the U.S. Senate. Mr. Howard Metzenbaum should not be seated as a member of the Senate when the Senate reconvenes on January 21, 1974. He should be asked to stand aside until an appropriate com.mlttee makes a thorough and complete investigation of his income tax situation. If it had developed that our Vice President, two days before his appointment, had settled a tax claim of $118,102, relating to a transaction which the IRS determined was ""not bona fide"", believe it is safe to say that the Senate would not have confirmed him. The purpose of this letter is to specifically request that you, as the Majority Leader, assume the responsibility of seeing to it that Mr. Metzenbaum is not seated a-s a member of the U.S. Senate and that an appropriate investigation be conducted. Respectfully yours, CARL T. CURTIS, U.S. Senator. I Mr. President, I repeat: The issue here is not whether someone should ever be seated in this body owing taxes or having recently paid taxes or having asserted his right to contest a tax claim. The issue here is a determination by the Internal Revenue Service that the individual had entered into transactions that were not bona fide. And it goes on to name them-Wer-e not bona fide. • • • Accordingly, the claimed rental losses are determined to be unallowable • • • ."" Webster's New International Dictionary, Second Edition, defines bona fide as ""in or with good faith; without fraud or deceit; genuine; as a bona. fide transaction."" The determination of the IRS was that the transactions in question were ""not bona fide."" Were they? I do not know. I cannot pass on that. All I can say is that the facts warrant an investigation. First, Mr. President, let me state that my letter was addressed to Mr. MANsFIELD, majority leader. I think I am quoting him accurately when I state that I have received information from him this morning that he expects to take no action. ",1974
7,4,1,Mr. MANSFIELD.," Mr. President, will the Senator yield? ",1974
8,4,1,Mr. CURTIS., I yield. ,1974
9,4,1,Mr. MANSFIELD.," The Senator is absolutely correct, because it is not the responsibility of the majority leader or minority leader; it is the responsibility of any Senator who desires to take such action. ",1974
10,4,1,Mr. CURTIS.," Very well. I am happy to have the record clarified so we know exactly what the position of our very beloved leader is. Therefore, Mr. President, I make the following unanimous-consent request: I ask unanimous consent that the oath ",1974

17,204,1,Mr. GRIFFIN.," Mr. President, I wish associate myself with the remarks made by the distinguished Senator from Virginia concerning the death of a very fine American, Lewis Strauss. It is most appropriate, I suggest, that note be taken in this body of his passing because it was in this body where, perhaps, the greatest disappointment of his life came to Lewis Strauss. I refer to the rejection by the Senate of his nomination as Secretary of Commerce in the Eisenhower administration. Although I did not serve in the Senate then, I studied the circumstances surrounding that incident at the time when Mr. Fortas was nominated to be Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The action of the Senate with respect to Lewis Strauss was most unfortunate, in my view, because, as nearly as I could determine, Mr. Strauss was rejected not because of a lack of qualifications, not because of any problems concerning impropriety or anything of that kind, but primarily because there were many in this body who did not agree with his philosophy. That was a sad episode in the life of Mr. Strauss, and I suggest that it was an unfortunate episode in the history of the Senate. Along with the distinguished Senator from Virginia, I regarded Mr. Strauss as a most able, most capable and dedicated public servant, who contributed a great deal to this Nation. I join the Senator from Virginia in extending condolences to those he leaves behind. ",1974

25,204,1,Mr. ROBERT C.," BYRD. Mr. President, the agreement between Egypt and Israel to realine their military forces along the Suez Canal and the Sin~,i is a significant development in the quest for a permanent peace in the Middle East. Though this agreement is only the first step down what may be long road of negotiation, it marks the first time that Egypt and Israel have been able to reach an agreement on anything other than a cease-fire. Though Egypt is only one of the Arab nations involved in the troubled Middle East situation, Premier Sadat's willingness to negotiate with the Israel Government is a hopeful sign that the other Arab countries will follow suit. Already, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria has made proposals for beginning troop separation talks with Israel. Secretary of State Kissinger has described the Syrian President's overtures to Israel as ""very constructive,"" on both the troop disengagement talks and on a final peace settlement. For the first time since the 6-day war, it appears that there are reasons for genuine optimism that the Middle East impasse will be broken, and that the governments of the countries concerned may be replacing emotional intransigence by constructive pragmatism. If subsequent negotiations proceed as smoothly as have the initial stages, an appreciable share of the credit must go to the efforts that have been made by the Government of the United States bringing the opposing interests together. The President, Secretary of State Kissinger and his staff, are to be commended for their untiring dedication toward helPing bring about a solution of a problem that has international as well as local implications. If and when a permanent peace settlement is arrived at in the Middle Eastand with that settlement there is removed one of the most dangerous threats to peace in the world-President Nixon, Secretary Kissinger, and American diplomacy in general will have reason to be proud of the parts they have played. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. ",1974

29,404,1,Mr. CULVER.," Mr. Speaker, whlle we were scattered in our districts during the recess a political earthquake occurred in Iowa, the tremors of which had perceptible effects across the Nation. I am sure that the instigator of these shocks deliberately chose to set them off at a time of congressional dispersion, since otherwise we would all have been too stunned. For all of u8 know that the House of Representatives operates through a delicate system of checks and balances, about one of which the House rules are silent. I refer, of course, to that majestic and rock-like institution, H. R. GROSS. In announcing his intention to retire from the House at the end of his current term, H. R. GRoss is removing one of the pillars on which our legislative procedures are built. In taking away this bulwark he imposes a heavy responsibility on all those who remain in this body to compensate for a large vacancy. H. R. embodies not only a unique and memorable personality; he also brought distinction to the legislative craft. There is probably not a member here who has not at some time left the floor with the conviction that H. R. saved them from foolish or inadvertent legislative error. There is no one in this body who has not marvelled at his command of legislative intricacies or at his professional skill in the reading of fine print. Moreover H. R. has always exhibited the values of a firm grounding in arithmetic and vocabulary. He always recognizes the difference between $1 million and $1 billion-and even the difference between 1 and 10. His mastery of the active verb and the telling adjective are also legendary. As one of his colleagues from Iowa, I have profited from his example and earthy wisdom however much I have disagreed with a good many of the policy conclusions he has reached. But even in disagreement H. R. is the kind of man who at least makes colleagues less smug in their beliefs and readier to see the possibilities of error. H. R. GRoss has made this a livelier and better place in which to do the Nation's.business. He will leave with universal affection and with our delight that we have been both the objects of his vigilance and the beneficiaries of his good will. HEARING SET ON VOTING RIGHTS OF EX-OFFENDERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Wisconsin <Mr. KAsTENMEIER) is recognized for 5 minutes. ",1974
30,404,1,Mr. KASTENMEIER.," Mr. Speaker, the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice has scheduled a hearing on H.R. 9020, and a number of identical measures to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1970 to prohibit the States from denying the right to vote in Federal elections former criminal offenders who have not been convicted of any offense relating to voting or elections and who are not confined in a correctional institution. The legislation was introduced by me and has been cosponsored by 27 other Members of the House. Its purpose to prohibit the States from denying the right to vote in Federal elections to former criminal offenders who have not been convicted of an offense relating to voting and who are not incarcerated. The denial of the right to vote to citizens who have been convicted of a criminal offense is a significant obstance to to is that right by the full enjoyment of American citizens. The blll sets forth findings supporting the constitutional foundation of this legislation. A question is raised by the very recent Supreme Court decision in O'Brien against Skinner whether the bill can constitutionally provide, as it purports to do, that incarceration in a correctional institution deprives the inmate of his right to vote. Also, it has been proposed that the protection of the blll should be extended to State and local elections. The subcommittee will study the legislation with great care. The hearing will be held at 10 a.m., on Wednesday, January 30, 1974, in room 2226, Rayburn House Office Building. Witnesses will be heard from the Department of Justice, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and the American Bar Association. UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New York (Mr. STRATTON) is recognized for 5 minutes. ",1974
31,404,1,Mr. STRATTON.," Mr. Speaker, at a time when Alexander Solzhenitsyn's brilliant new work on Soviet concentration camps has focused world attention on the repressive practices of the Soviet Union over the years, it is especially appropriate to remember the valiant and hardworking people of the Ukraine who have been struggling against these policies for over half a century. For most of the· past 300 years the Ukraine has been submerged in the massive Russian state and for most of those years, the Ukrainian people battled valiantly against czars and later Communists in an effort to win the inalienable rights of people everywhere, namely personal and political freedom. For just one bright, shining moment, when czarist authority was first smashed in 1917 the Ukrainian people were able to gain their freedom and create their own state. That interlude began on January 22, 1918, and ended 5 short years later, when Bolshevik occupation finally took over. Today, 56 years later, Ukrainians are still in political and intellectual bondage. Their brief taste of independence evaporated all too quickly. But even though the independent State of the Ukraine is only a memory today, the spirit of freedom stlll burns brightly in the minds and hearts of all Ukrainian people everywhere. In this era of detente with the Soviet Union, we must never forget that the leaders in the Kremlin are still suppressing the legitimate hopes and aspirations of the Ukrainian people for freedom and self-determination. Yet this suppression has merely served to strengthen the spirit and the resolve of the people of the Ukraine. And it is this brave spirit which we commemorate today, on the anniversary of Ukrainian independence, and which we deeply believe will eventually bring the Ukraine back into the world community again as a free and independent state. I know that in my own upstate New ",1974
32,454,1,Mr. HUNGATE.," Mr. Speaker, the December 1973 issue of the American Bar Association Journal strongly supports the principle of independence of prosecution. Citing the chain of events surrounding the Watergate Special Prosecutor, the article reaflirmed the ABA's position that the Special Prosecutor must be wholly independent of the executive branch of Government: THE RULE OF LAW The deep attachment of the American people to the principle of the rule of law and not of men could not have been exemplified better than by the outpouring of public disapproval that greeted President Nixon's action in late October when he declined to follow the adverse Watergate tapes decision of the court of appeals and then dismissed the special prosecutor for refusing to temper his investigation and to accept the president's alternative to turning over the tapes. The publlc outrage, which political reporters have said was not expected by the president, demonstrated that the people have an ingrained trust in and respect for our system of justice as administered by fearless and independent judges and lawyers, and that they feel that the established judicial means for the settlement of disputes are to be preferred over methods grounded on political power and position. These events serve to point out again the awesome yet integral role the legal profession plays in our nation's life, and they should be the occasion for a reaffirmation of our determination to fulfill that role. It is elementary that the investigation and prosecution of wrongdoing must be independent, free of conflicts of interest, and not subject to the influence of those who might fall under suspicion and investigation. This problem was present from the beginning in the investigation and prosecution of the events that comprise what ha.s been called ""Watergate,"" but it became more acute as higher officials were implicated last April. Robert W. Meserve, then president of the American Bar Association, told a National Press Club luncheon on Aprll 30 that an ""independent special prosecutor, having no connection with the government or any of the parties in the case, should be appointed to direct the grand jury inquiry and any criminal prosecution that might result."" After referring to the Code of Professional Responsibllity and the Standards Relating to the Prosecution and the Defense Functions, Mr. Meserve added that the ""appointment EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS of a special prosecutor of recognized professional stature and integrity would do much to clear the air and reassure the country that the facts will be brought out and those involved dealt with fully and fairly."" The special prosecutor's office as established was a part of the Justice Department, a circumstance that did not remove the inherent anomaly of investigatee having ultimate dismissal power over investigator. But the Senate was satisfied with the assurance of the new attorney general, Elllot L. Richardson, that the prosecutor would have an unusual degree of independence and could not be removed except for ""extraordinary 1mproprieties,"" which would be determined by the attorney general. These assurances were expressed in ""guidelines"" that became the foundation of the special prosecution force. This compact between the executive branch and the people was abrogated by the president in late October when he directed Archibald Cox, who had been appointed special prosecutor, ""to make no further attempts by judicial process to obtain tapes, notes, or memoranda of presidential conversations,"" discharged Mr. Cox when he refused to accept this interference in his prosecutorial function, and abolished the independent status of the prosecution force. Mr. Richardson did not find Mr. Cox guilty of ""extraordinary improprieties."" Indeed, he declined to discharge the special prosecutor and himself resigned. Neither President Nixon nor anyone for him has charged Mr. Cox with ""extraordinary improprieties."" In a statement issued October 22, Chesterfield Smith, president of the Association, declared that President Nixon's actions were an ""intolerable assault upon the courts, our first line of defense against tyranny and arbitrary power .... I express my hope and confidence that the judicia.! and legislative forces of this nation will act swiftly and decisively to challenge, repeal, and correct this damaging incursion . . . upon the system of justice and therefore upon the basic liberties of the citizens of this country."" A few days later the Association's Board of Governors endorsed Mr. Smith's statement and went on record favoring the re-establishment of the office of the special prosecutor by appointment of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. (For the text of the resolution and the statement, see the article on page 1389 of this issue.) The principle of independence of prosecution is one that needs to be remembered and preserved. No better successor for Mr. Cox could have been selected than Leon Jaworski, the former president of the American Bar Association, whose appointment was announced on November 1. But the question is not one of men but of independence of the prosecutoria.l function. In the unusual circumstances of this situation, that principle requires a prosecutor not beholden in any way to the executive branch of government. HON.

The Governor of Texas, the Honorable Dolph Briscoe, delivered the main address, and January 22, 1974 I am pleased to include the text of Governor Briscoe's remarks: REMARKS BY Gov. DOLPH BRISCOE Thank you for a kind and generous introduction. I know of no other place where I feel more at home than I do with you. For a great number of years I have worked closely with you and I know personally the great contribution the men and women of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station have made to the progress of Texas. Working with your partners-the Texas Agricultural Extension Service-the many lasting benefits of research have been carried to the people of this State, and as a result of these efforts, all Texans have enjoyed a more abundant life. President Williams, I would like to thank you, Dean H. 0. Kunkel, Directors Mlller and Hutchinson and the many dedicated members of this university staff both here and in the field for our favorable position in agriculture. Of course, many of you hold joint teaching appointments and I express appre • elation also to those dedicated teachers who are training the young men and women who will lead agriculture and home economics in the future. Dr. Wllliams, in my opinion the land grant university concept of teaching, research and extension is one of America's great achievements. I hope that the high priorities given to agriculture and rural life in the past will be accelerated in the future. You are assured of my continued support for your efforts. You are aware that one of the goals of my ad.ministration is to make Texas Number One in Agriculture, not only in volume of sales but in profits to the farmers and ranchers of this State. If we achieve this goal then we all must accelerate our efforts. I believe no one could be engaged in a more exciting career than in today's dynamic agriculture. Agriculture is really the great hope of our country. Not only does it feed and clothe our people but agriculture has become the one tool with which we can compete most efficiently in foreign markets. Dean Kunkel, in his annual report message, said ""an agronomist can no longer be concerned only with producing the seed, but he has to be part of the team concerned with the disposal of the straw."" Yes, the agronomist has to be a team member. You are developing a team approach and I congratulate you on the strides you are making. The fourteen designated research and extension centers, one of which is located in my home town of Uvalde, provide truly effective multidisciplinary task forces, dedicating their efforts toward solution to the problems of the areas in which they are located. The conduct of research by the station is organized into projects which outline objectives. This provides for necessary coordination to insure that the most important priority problems are being investigated and prevents costly and unnecessary duplication. The Research and Extension Centers and dynamic area development programs such as B.E.T., B.I.G., P.E.P., South Plains, E1 Paso, Rolllng Plains and the new one just recently organized at Uvalde can continue to make Texas agriculture a leading economic and social base for a more prosperous Texas. After all, the principle measure of research success is the impact that research has had on the economy and well being of the people of the State. No one would deny that Texas agriculture and its associated supplying, processing a.nd distributing industries have been transformed. dramatically in recent years. And agricultural research has been the basis for every change--the new varieties of cotton, rice, vegetables and grain sorghums, the modern fertilization practices, the new equipment and processes, the new management and cultural practices, the new livestock rations and feeding systems. As only one measure of value of agricultural research ",1974
34,604,1,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, today I am calling on the White House to match its energy rhetoric with solid energy proposals. The White House is calling for project independence to make this country self-suftlctent by 1980 yet the Federal Energy Oftlce under William Simon will be set up as a temporary. stop-gap measure with an authorization for only 18 months. What we need is a National Energy Policy Council capable of long-range planning and collation of energy statistics. We are in the present crisis because no one was minding the store and the supplies ran out. We cannot solve our present problems without all the facts and we certainly cannot become selfsufficient without long-range planning. •",1974
35,704,1,Mr. JOHNSON of California.," Mr. Speaker, it was with much sadness that learned of the recent passing of my friend and former colleague, Dr. Antonio Fern6s-Isern, a former Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico. Together we &erved as members of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee during the consideration of many significant bills in the early 1960's. I could always count on the counsel of Dr. have missed his presence in these halls, and are sorry to learn that he is no longer with us. Dr. Fern6s was a legend in his own time. It was he who tirelessly worked for the legislation which granted his homeland the status it enjoys today. Fern6s to be valuable and informed. We With many hours of hard work and determined effort, Dr. Fern6s gained the approval of his colleagues for the legislation creating the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. It was always a pleasure for me to work witl:1 him, for he was a man who enjoyed his work and shared this enthusiasm with others. He was always very much concerned with the legislation before the committee and contributed greatly to its consideration. In nearly 20 years of service in the Congress, Dr. Fern6s made many friends for his native land as well as for himself. We will miss his advice and counsel. Mrs. Johnson joins me in expressing our deep sympathy to his family and friends. ",1974
36,704,1,Mr. WON PAT.," Mr. Speaker, it was with great sadness that I recently Iea.med of the death of a former Member of this body and a personal friend, Dr. Antonio Fem6s-Isern, who passed away in Puerto Rico on Saturday, January 19. Dr. Fem6s left behind him a remarkable legacy of pub1ic service and compassion for his fellow Puerto Ricans. A physician who left his profession to work in politics, Dr. Fern6s served as Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner in Washington from 1946 to 1964 with outstanding distinction. As the San Juan Star noted ip its editorial marking the passing of this great man: His tenure 1n Washington was marked by many accomplishments and few failures. Among his many accomplishments was, of course, the passage of Public Law 81-600, which authorized the creation of the Commonwealth status between Puerto Rico and the United St.ates. During those days, Guam, too, was working hard to improve its status within the American system. As a member of the team of Guam officials who came to Washington to work for the passage of an organic act establishing a civll government and granting U.S. citizenship to the people of Guam, I had the privilege of working closely with Dr. Fern6s. His counsel and astute understanding of the congressional system and his sympathy for our cause contributed in no small way to our ultimate success. Upon his completion of two terms as Resident Commissioner, Dr. Fem6s returned to the island he so deeply loved and was elected to the Puerto Rico Senate in which he served until 1968. All Americans, and especially those of us from the territories, owe a great deal to the efforts of Dr. Fern6s to create a better tmderstanding between his j)eople and their fellow citizens in the States. Understanding mutual problems is the key to successful relations between all peoples, and Dr. Fem6s' significant contribution to this end paved the way for increased involvement in the American way of life for all territorial Americans.

37,704,1,Mr. DENT.," Mr. Speaker. it was with deep personal regret that I received the news of the death 'of our former colleague and friend, the delegate from Puerto Rico, Dr. Antonio Fern6s-Isem. Through the years that we were colleagues in the House, I came to know and respect this very ""gentle"" man who, though a physician by profession, excelled in many other areas as well. All of us who worked with him were impressed with his efforts on behalf of the people of Puerto Rico, whom he served for over 50 years. It was he who authored the law creating the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the law ratifying the constitution of that Commonwealth after presiding over the Puerto Rican Constitutional Convention. All of the important legislation affecting Puerto Rico bore his handprint. . I share the sadness the people of Puerto Rico must feel and extend my sympathy to the members of his famlly.

39,704,1,Mr. MILFORD.," Mr. Speaker, during our yearend break I had meetings with several owner-operator truckers in my district. These people have some very serious problems that deserve the immediate attention of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. Very typical of the problems of our owner-operator truckers are outlined by this letter from Mrs. Margaret Brown of Fort Worth, Tex.

41,804,1,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of speculation lately as to why the on companies behave in such a monopolistic manner. I believe that a large part of the answer lies in the fact that a number of interlocking directorships exist among the oil and gas firms. These interlocking directorates have the effect of eliminating competition since common directors tend to monopolize a market and provide the opportunity for exchange of information. I have asked Attorney General Saxbe to investigate the apparent violation of the Clayton Act, which bans interlocking directorates in competing companies, by individuals. The various Attorney Generals who have served in the current administration have avoided offering a precise definition of what constitutes an interlocking directorate. We have all become very concerned about the energy shortage and how it has come about. I would like to suggest that this problem, like so many others, is a result of the activities 9f individuals. For far too long the oilmen in this country have been allowed a free hand. They have created an international cartel beyond the reach of most governments. If there is to be any good to come out of our present uncomfortable circumstances, it is that we should never again allow the control of our resources to be vested in the hands of a few men.

A BilL AUTHORIZING PARTITION OF JOINTLY HELD HOPI AND NAVAJO TRIBAL LANDS HON. WAYNE OWENS OF UTAH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 24, 1974 ",1974
42,804,1,Mr. OWENS.," Mr. Speaker, in September of last year I introduced a bill intended as a compromise solution to the tragic and costly land dispute between the Hopi and Navajo Indian Tribes in northeastern Arizona. At the same time, an identical bill was introduced in the Senate jointly by the two Senators from Arizona, Mr. FANNIN and Mr. GoLDWATER. The purpose of this proposed legislation is to resolve a dispute which began more than a century ago, and in recent times has resulted in bitter and sometimes violent intertribal con:fiict and has allowed tribal lands to become desolate and unproductive. Prior efforts by the Federal Government and courts to resolve this dispute have been unsuccessful because Congress has never granted authority to the courts to define the territorial boundaries of the two tribes in a partition proceeding. Enabling legislation must be passed by Congress in order to bring about a lasting settlement. It is a matter of history that President Chester A. Arthur in 1882 directed that 2.500,000 acres of public domain land be set aside for the use and occupancy o! the Hopi, and for such other Indians as the Secretary of the Interior may see fit to settle thereon. Over the years many Navajos have moved from their adjoining reservation onto the original Hopi lands, • Not listed in SEC report--information obtained from SEC and ms omcials. ",1974
43,904,1,Mr. JAVITS.," Mr. President, I would like to call to the attention of my colleagues an editorial appearing in the Washington Post last Thursday, January 24, highlighting the need for more and better rail transportation service. Since the energy crisis began, Amtrak has been deluged with an overabundance of passengers and requests. Not only has Amtrak been unable to provide seats for all the potential passengers on established routes, but Amtrak has also been unable to provide any service at all to areas in great need of rail service. Foremost among these areas are recreation communities that are not within easy automobile commuting distance of a large metropolitan area. Large portions of our country are heavily dependent on recreation and tourism for their economic survival. Rail passenger service is essential for many of these areas if they are to withstand the effects of the immediate fuel shortages. But I would not be speaking out for long-term commitments to rail service if I believed the effects of the fuel shortage are short term only. Even if we can develop self-sufficiency in energy within a decade it will be necessary for us to make some major changes in our lifestyle and habits. One of the easiest methods for change is to employ mass transportation for travel recreation areas, areas to to, where in the past we would drive leave our car in the parking lot for the duration of our stay, and then drive home. Our Nation presently has one of the least developed systems of rail passenger service in the Western World. It is high time we began to correct this deficiency with a major Federal commitment to such service. I ask unanimous consent that the editorial referred to be printed in its entirety in the RECORD. There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Washington Post, Jan. 24, 1974) RAILROADS AND PASSENGERS Last fall, Amtrak, which is supposed to entice people back to the pleasures of railroad travel, began to set up a computerized, national telephone reservation system of the kind the airlines have used for years. The system's capacity seemed sufficient for five years. Then, on November 19, the President proclaimed the energy crisis, gasoline and jet fuel supplies seemed threatened, people took to the ralls, and, what with the Christmas holidays, the new reservation system was jammed by the sudden, overwhelming demand for seats. As a result, it still can be somewhat annoying to reserve an Amtrak railroad ticket. And that pretty wellillustra.tes our passenger train dilemma. Amtrak, with the help of airline and travel agency experts, seems to have done a good, slow, difllcult but conscientious job of keeping ran travel from going the way of the stage coach. From 1945 until Amtrak was Ia.unched in May 1971, the railroads ha.d steadily lost 15 per cent of their passengers every year. Now they are regaining 11 per cent every year. This is due to a number of visible improvements. Amtrak, first of all, consolidated the passenger runs across the country to a bare minimum. Some cities, such as Cleveland, are not served by passenger trains at all. Next Amtrak began to improve the cars. Oniy half of the existing 3,000 cars were considered salvageable. The other half are being refurbished at the ra.te of first 48 and lately 70 cars a month. New diesel locomotives have been put in service or ordered. The ChicagoSt. Louis run has a whole new train, made in France. Personnel has been retrained. There is now a nationwide timetable. Many cities have downtown ticket offices and some have had their railroad stations cleaned and repainted. Three new stations--at Jacksonville, Fla., Springfield, Mass., and Cincinnati, Ohio-have been built. There has even been some modest innovation. Some of the long distance trains have passenger representatives to help make people comfortable and some, like the Montrealer, include recreation cars that offer games and movies and have a piano player along for entertainment. The Interstate Commerce Commission, furthermore, is about to issue new customer service standards for passenger railroads that will insist on proper luggage handling, a !air reservation system and punctual performance. Under the new rulings, railroads can be fined tor being late. But like the new reservation system, all these gains are likely to be overwhelmed by the new demand on railroad travel created by the energy crisis. There is not enough eqUlpm.ent to handle a. sudden increase in passengers. It will take years to build additional cars and locomotives, particularly since Amtrak rightly insists on new, up-todate des1~ and engineering rather t-han reordering obsolete models. The refurbishing program can, of course, be accelerated. But there is ~ yet little incentive and less money to get the railroads ready for the new pas-",1974

46,1054,1,Mr. HATHAWAY.," Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution to extend the so-called Cordon rule of the Senate, rule XXIX(4), to cover the entire process of bill consideration in the Senate committees. The Cordon rule, adopted by the Senate in 1949, requires that in reporting a bill to the Senate, a committee must provide an accompanying document showing the text of the statute or part thereof Which is proposed to be repealed, and a comparative print of that part of the bill or joint resolution making the amendment, and of the statute or part thereof proposed to be amended, showing by appropriate typographical devices the omissions and insertions which would be made by the bill or joint resolution if enacted in the form recommended by the comm:.ttee. The purpose of the Cordon rule is to make clear the effect of proposed legislation on existing law. Both in terins of clarification and efficiency, the rule has proven helpful to Members of the Senate, and has undoubtedly expedited the floor work of the Senate. With the Senate workload increasing all the time, I feel we can utilize this helpful tool even more extensively in the legislative process. In the belief that the expanded application of the Cordon rule would benefit the Senate, I am introducing a resolution requiring that the rule apply during the most preliminary consideration in subcommittee hearings, through final · committee consideration of a bill or resolution. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution be printed in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: S.

47,1104,1,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, in c<>nducting relations between the United States and oth,er countries, our ambassadors ~broad play a critical role -'l'b1s is true with regard to-the major countries of the world, especially during times of"" delicate negotiations with adversaries, and strained relations with allies. It is also true with regard to countries that are not in the mainstream of current policy, where their relations with the United States only rarely command the attention of th-e President, the Secretary of State, and other senior officials. There, the American ambassador becomes even more important than he would be otherwise, and often plays the central role in shaping day-to-day policies of the United States, and relations between u.s and the country in which he serves. Ambassadors also play an important symbolic role. Appointing a man or woman who is highly capable is a mar~ of respect, and can pay direct benefits in the process of conducting relations. By contrast,-appointing second-rate people as American ambassadors can make matters worse. And not appointing an American ambassador at all can be regarded as an insult and a direct impediment to good relations, or-at best-as a handicap to working out diplomatic problems and difficulties. It is important for us in the Senate, therefore, to note vacancies of long standing in U.S. ambassadorial posts abroad. It is with particular regret that I note the continued absence of a U.S. ambassador to Sweden, since August 30, 1973. We all know the reasons for this: Swedish criticism of U.S. bombing policies at the end of our involvement in the Vietnam war, and the granting of asylum by Sweden to some Americans who refused to fight in that war. Whatever we think about these Swedish policies, the failure to appoint an Ambassador to Stockholm, at tbis critical time in the energy crisis and in the reordering of international economic relations, is clearly not in the best terests of the United States. In addition, we also have not had an Ambassador in Libya since November 7, 1972, a period which has seen the most serious tunnoil in international oil marto kets. do n,ot wish imply that the presence of a U.S. Ambassador in Tripoli would have had a decisive impact: But at least we would have had better opportunities for direct communication at the appropriate level. Far more important, the United States has not .had an Ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development-OECD-since September 1972-nearly a year and a half. And yet this has been a critical t>eriod in trying to reach common pOsitions in the stlppl:1 of energy, through the OEcn·s on committee.

48,1154,1,Mr. JACKSON.," The Senator is correct. However, when we break it down, it is in the middistillatc area. Gasoline is going down, because they are still refining heating oil. We have benefited from the weather. Because of the weather we may be faced with having a glut of heating oil. Mr. McGOVERN. I know that the Senator from Washington has been very vigorous interrogation of these companies. I do not need to remind the Senator that these are the same companies that told us 3 or 4 years ago that there was not any shortage and that we did not need to lift the import quotas. I wanted to remind the Senator that their judgment and facts are not always right. ",1974
49,1154,1,Mr. JACKSON.," The Senator is correct. I wrote a letter to Secretary Shultz in 1969 denouncing the archaic quotas set on oil. The problem is a d.imcult one which we are following up in the committee. The staff met with the representatives on yesterday.

54,1154,1,Mr. LONG.," Mr. President, I have yet to hear anyone refer to the fact that this measure is unconstitutional. We have the testimony of tax lawyer after tax lawyer, many of whom have served as Commissioners of Internal Revenue the Service under the Truman administration, the Johnson administration, the Kennedy administration, and the Nixon administration, who they say that they ·think the proposal is unconstitutional. If that proposal is unconstitutional, it may well bring down the whole bill with it. So the whole bill may be declared unconstitutional. It is very simple. This constitutes a taking without due process. It says that if someone takes what we believe to be an unfair profit, we might look at all of his profits and tell the man to give back anything that he has received that is more than a fair profit. Now the Renegotiation Act is able to bypass that issue because there is a contract between the Government and the Government contractor to give the money back. I know a very able lawyer in New York who said that he thinks that provision is bad. I think that we can repeal it later and substitute something else. Here is what the witnesses say. If a company produces more oil than it had in that base period, he has to give back 100 percent of everything that he has made or he is guilty of price gouging. ",1974
55,1154,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The time of the Senator has expired. ,1974
56,1154,1,Mr. NELSON.," Mr. President, I yield 1 additional minute to the Senator from Louisiana. ",1974
57,1154,1,Mr. LONG.," Mr. President, the people will say, ""You will not accuse me of price gouging. I will not produce that much oil."" Look at the list of all the companies up there on the board. They made more profits than they made in a depressed period. We should not be giving them an incentive to produce less oil than they did before so that they will not be accused of price gouging. That is ridiculous. We ought to be encouraging people to produce more energy. When we put that provision on the statute books, lawyer after lawyer who has had responsibility in this matter has said that people will be confronted with uncertainty and that, if they invest their money, they cannot get it back. Bankers will not make loans to companies that want to produce more oil. Mr. President. bankers wUl not make loans to companies who want to drill wells and produce more oil and process more oil. They will say that it is doubtful whether the company will be permitted to earn enough money to pay off the loan. so. we would get less oil and less gas in due course if we were to follow method. Why would we want to do that if we could take our time and pass a law that would be constitutional? We would then be doing what we swore to do when we took our oath of office. to uphold the Constitution. ",1974
58,1154,1,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, is it not true that there are approximately 220,-000 service stations in this country, that 70 to 80 percent of those stations are independent operators, that there wCi'iiiObe individual decisions with respect to each of them with respect to the sale of gasoline, that any citizen might object to any one of those stations and a hearing would have to be held, and that would result in this a legislative nightmare. There is no way in which that could feasibly be accomplished. ",1974
59,1154,1,Mr. LONG.," And every one of those 220,000 service stations can be hauled into court under the Renegotiation Board for every sale they make to every customer. So that board could meet from now to eternity, and would not have settled all its cases. ",1974
60,1154,1,Mr. BENTSEN., Does the Senator from Louisiana remember the service station operators who were here last year because they were having problems in this regard? ,1974
61,1154,1,Mr. LONG., I certainly do. ,1974
62,1154,1,Mr. BENTSEN., Does he not think they would be back again with the same kind of problems? ,1974
63,1154,1,Mr. LONG.," I certainly do. Mr. President, I expect to vote for the kind of excess profits tax that would work, and would not keep us from getting energy for the American people at a time when they need it desperately. ",1974
64,1154,1,Mr. NELSON.," Mr. President, what we are really doing if we approve this bill is playing a gigantic con game on the American public, because it is not constitutional, it will not work, and it is not a tax, and I do not think the President. on his worst day, could conceivably sign this bill. Nevertheless, I think we ought to recognize who we are putting a burden on with this bill. That is, the local gasoline station owners and it will bankrupt them. They cannot live under it. Think of a situation where the President sets the price at the retail level, and then the fllling station operator follows the price the President sets. Then along come a bunch of customers and complain that the price he charged, based upon what the President set, gives him an excess profit, so they go up to the Renegotiation Board, which has the authority under the law to decide that in fact, after using all these guidelines I read into the RECORD, he is charging an excess amount. So then they haul him before the Renegotiation Board, with maybe 10 complaints or 50 complaints, and now he has got to pay back money. There is no way in the world, under the free enterprise system, for any retailer to survive under this provision. The Senator from Washington and the Senator from Maine both know it is a bad provision. They will both say so. They both voted against it. Yet they want to stick by the provision because they say that is all they can get out of the conference. Now let us look at the argument that there are a bunch of urgent things in here. I just called WILBUR MILLS and talked with him at home, and I asked him about whether, if something happened at this conference and they did not come back with any agreement, he considered it important that we have some unemployment compensation act provision such as is in this blll, or better. He said, ""Yes, we have got to do something about those who are unemployed."" So we have the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee who has a position on it, we have the chairman of t>he ",1974
65,1204,1,Mr. BOLAND.," Mr. Chairman, I wish to go on record as supporting H.R. 11793, a bill to reorganize and consolidate certain functions of the Federal Govern· ment in a new Federal Energy Administration in order to promote more emcient management of such functions. This legislation will establish by law the agency which has hitherto been operating under executive order. I wholeheartedly support the concept of unifying under one omcial the various related energy functions which rational formulation of a coordinated national energy policy demands. The forward strides that have already been made by the present Federal Energy Office under William E. Simon offer a refreshing and long-awaited change from the chaos and false steps of previous so-called ""energy czars"" and ""advisers."" I feel that H.R. 11793, by setting a 2-year authorization period for the FEA, puts a sensible limit on the lifespan of our emergency energy regulatory apparatus. Provision is made in the bill for Presidential recommendations for either continuance or other disposition of the functions assembled under the aegis of the Federal Energy Administrator. I feel that one lesson that we ought to have ~earned by the experience of the last year Is that regular and frequent reviews of our energy policymaking procedures and goals are a necessity if we are not again to be caught as fiat-footed as we were by the Arab boycott. Mr. Chairman, I am aware that some Members are alarmed by what they characterize as the sweeping breadth of power which has been deputized to the FEA by this legislation. I think it important to point out--as is already evident from the workings of the present Federal Energy Office-that the President already possesses the powers that it is feared will so strengthen the Executive Office. Last spring Congress renewed the Economic Stabilization Act, under which the President has since authorized the creation of the Federal Energy Office and assembled various energy functions. I favor passage of H.R. 11793 because it will enhance congressional control over the new FEA. If this bill becomes law, all the principal officers of the FEA will necessarily have to be confirmed by the Senate. Further, congressional approval will be mandated at the end of 2 years for any further energy regulation and policymaking vehicle. The interim period will have afforded all of us in this body and in the other House the opportunity to appraise the benefits and drawbacks of this agency. At that point, we will be able to act on information our own senses have gathered. Despite my endorsement of this legislation, I am troubled in particular by one aspect of this bill and its near relation, the conference report on the Energy Emergency Act <S. 2589). Neither piece of legislation takes, to my mind, a firm enough stand upon perhaps the most crucial issue raised by the national energy crisis. Quite simply, where are our national priorities? Do they lie with some ill-conceived, vague entity-the marketplace-or do they have their foundation in the wellbeing of our people? It seems to me that the most dangerous and insidious issue amidst this whole energy debate is the view, quite openly stated and restated by top administration figures, including Mr. Simon, that 1f prices go high enough demand will eventually mesh with supply and presto, no more shortages. This philosophy seems to me to ignore the fact that energy-whether it be used to heat homes, carry people to work or school or run factories--is not some imaginary commodity in an economics textbook. It is a rockbottom necessity. If ",1974

I think that the pendlegislation certainly lays a good foundation. There are aspects of the pending legislation, however. that it occurs to me will not bring about the desired results of fiscal discipline and fiscal responsibility unless they are changed. I wonder tf I might ask several questions of the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee. ",1974

Mr. President, on page 121 of the blll. the statement Is made that the resolution .shall set forth: (4) RECOMMENDED SURPLUS ORDEFICIT.-The amount. 1f any, by which revenues should exceed budget outlays, or by whlch bu~get outlays should exceed revenues, eonstdertng economic conditions and all other relevant factors; Am I correct in my understanding that the resolution is not required to bring in .a balanced budget? ~.PERCY. The Senator is correct. ",1974
86,104,6,Mr. HARRY F.," BYRD, JR. Therefore, a. resolution can provide for a deficit of % number of dollars, $18 billion as projected for the eurrent fiscal year. and say that under present conditions that is thought to be the appropriate deficit. ",1974
87,104,6,Mr. PERCY.," The distinguished Senator from Virginia is correct. Not only that, but lt was also the very strong feeling of members of the Government Operations Committee, and possibly of the Committee on Rules and Administration, in looking over the· budget that it would be unwise to put the Congress in a straitjacket and require a balanced budget each and every single fiscal year. It for instance, the country were to go into a period of recession where the economic activity was low .and where the demands for assistance and help in providing employment, or whatever, might be quite high, the economy would require or almost demand stimulus in the Federal budget, and this would give the discretion to Congress to do so. Those who feel that the country should have a balanced budget regardless of the circumstances could not prevail and v.ote in a balanced budget. The objective that we have a balanced budget, may be very desirable-but it is also to be hoped that we would have a period in which we could start paying o1f the national debt. However, there is no .requirement in the pending measure that we have a balanced budget. At the outset we should recognize that this would give us the ftexibntty to either further the national debt or enable us to pay down the previous deficit. ",1974
88,104,6,Mr. HARRY F.," BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-dent, the Senator from Tilinois is quite optimistic about being able to pay down the previous debt. I note that 25 percent .of the national debt will have been incurred in the fiscal year ending 1975; .25 percent of that debt will have been added in a 6-year period, from fisca11970 to fiscal l975. We are going in the opposite direction from paying o1f the debt. We are adding to it at .a rate that we have never added to it before in the history of the Natien. ",1974
89,104,6,Mr. PERCY.," The Senator from lllinois would not argue at an with that starement. The Senator from Illlinois abhors the fact that in a period .of a hlgh level of prosperity and activity and ttlm<>st rampant inftation, we have .aggravated and added $1'00 billion of .additional debt which only adds to the penn anent nnancing charges for the national debt, puts mol'e of the budget in an uncontrollable account and adds undoubtedly to the indebtedness of future generations.

100,154,6,Mr. CARTER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member of the committee for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill H.R. 12503, the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act, to provide for the registration of practitioners conducting narcotic treatment programs. Although the artificial narcotic methadone does not afford a permanent solution to the problem of heroine addiction, many treatment programs involving the use of methadone have had some success. The number of patients now participating in these programs is estimated to be 73,000, and the FDA is receiving a large number of applications for the use of this drug. With the increasingly widespread use of methadone there is the inevitable problem of its illegal sale and use. This legislation is designed to strengthen control over such programs and to prevent the increasing numbers of deaths from methadone overdoses. Through improved enforcement methods and improved treatment techniques, we are making forward strides in overcoming the drug abuse problem in America. This legislation, by the increased regulation of methadone and other narcotic drugs used in the treatment of narcotic addicts, is necessary if we are to effectively continue our efforts in this important area of national concern.

102,154,6,Mr. HASTINGS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yield ing me this time. Mr. Speaker, I join in very strong support for this legislation. I first introduced this bill in 1973, and we did not consider it then, so I am delighted that the chairman of the subcommittee and the full committee saw fit this year to allow this measure to receive the careful attention that it did in the committee. Mr. Speaker, I am very much concerned over the related deaths through methadone overdoses. We have been accustomed in this country to deaths through heroin overdoses, and so I believe the principal impact of this bill is that we are now trying to pay the attention that is needed to the advances that have occurred through the utilization of methadone in the legally au·thorized clinias in this country. The measure recognizes that methadone treatment is no longer a research project, but that we are now treating over 70,-000 addicts with methadone today. This measure goes a long way toward provid-ing the protection that is necessary to continue this very fine program. Mr. Speaker, I again tbank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding me this time. ",1974
103,154,6,Mr. PEYSER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I believe that it serves a valuable purpose and urge its swift passage. However, I would like to clarify one point. It is essential that the definition of ""maintenance treatment"" in no way be construed to condone or permit the usage of heroin or morphine as treatment drugs. It is my understanding that the bill is clear on this point, but I think that the intent of the House should be known. When we refer to narcotic drugs in the definition of ""maintenance treatment"" we are not including heroin or morphine. In fact, if the rules permitted, I would offer an amendment to specifically exclude these two drugs from ever being dispensed in any drug maintenance program in the country. I have a bill in right now to do that, and I hope that we can have hearings on it in the near future. As I said, though, I do support the provisions of this bill. It is important that strict regulations be placed over the dispensing of any maintenance or treatment narcotic drug, and I urge swift passage of this bill. ",1974

107,304,6,Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 11929. For the last year we have been engaged in an important and historic effort to reform and rationalize the congressional budget process. Yet this bill would institute still another back-door spending gimmick which would only further reduce the controllability of the annual budget. For the past 3 years we have struggled mightily to keep the Federal budget from careening out of control and have helplessly watched the so-called fiscal dividend from economic growth being completely eaten up by the built-in momentum of Federal spending. This bill would only compound that problem by adding what amounts to another $100 ·million per year to the deficit. In the early 1970's we embarked on a massive new effort to clean up the environment, and, more particularly, to insure that the pollution costs of our high standard of living and sometimes extravagant consumption habits are fully refiected in the prices we pay for goods and services. Yet, this bill is based on the illusion that there is such a thing as a . ""free lunch"" and that by hiding poilu-tion control costs in the tax btll we can have a clean environment and cheap power too. During the last 6 months this Nation has had to come face to face with the unsustainability of our voracious appetites for energy, and with the consequent need to make major collective and individual efforts to conserve limited supplies of fuel. Nevertheless, this bill would reward overconsumption of energy rather than provide incentives for curtailing unnecessary use. During the last 2 years, our national political discourse, spurred by the Watergate tragedy and other events, has dwelt heavily on the need to clean up the governmental decisionmaking process; to establish new national priorities; and to assert the broad public interest against the special interests, advantages, and protections that clutter the Federal budget, hover around the executive departments, and dominate the Federal regulatory agencies. Yet this bill calls upon the general taxpayers of the Nation to subsidize the electricity consumption of a small segment of the population in one region of the country. Mr. Chairman, I am well aware of the principal argument made in behalf of this bill and must admit that it has a strong surface appeal. Since the TVA is a public nonprofit corporation, it may not avail itself to the various tax advantages afforded priva·te investor-owned utilities. The pages of material included in the committee report on the dollar value of these tax benefits to various private utilities would seem to make a good case for this bill. But before we become too mesmerized by all of these statistics and their implied unfairness to TV A, let us recall a few cardinal facts: TV A does not pay Federal income taxes; TVA has no equity capital; TVA has no private investors or shareholders who must be paid a return on their investment. These obvious facts mean that TVA rates, prices, and revenues need not reflect a margin for profits to be paid to shareholders and for income taxes to be paid to the Federal Government. While I have some reservations about the wisdom of providing tax breaks even to private utilities, the important point is that these tax breaks do not lower actual capital costs by a single penny. The only thing they affect are tax liabilities, and to the extent that they lower tax liabilities they marginally reduce the price and revenue levels needed to secure an adequate after-tax rate of return. Let me put this in concrete dollars and cents. In 1972 private utilities in the United States earned roughly $5.5 billion .in net profits. That amounts to roughly 39 cents per kilowatt-hour that TV A users do not have to pay be-cause by law TV A revenues are limited to the costs ·of producing power. Were not the various accelerated depreciation and other tax breaks available to these private utilities they would have paid nearly $2.7 billion in Federal income taxes on these profits as opposed to the $900 million they actually paid. These tax breaks, then, result in a tax savings of roughly 13 cents per kilowatt hour. In sum, private utility consumers buy 39 cents rather than 52 cents more per kilowatt hour than do TV A consumers due to the Federal pollution and other tax breaks available to private utilities. But the point is they still pay 39 cents more, all other things being equal. How it can be concluded from this that we need a compensating subsidy for the TVA system is difficult for me to fathom. Indeed, because of the proximity of fuel sources and lower costs generally in the TVA region, its consumers are already far better off than their counterparts in other areas of the country. According to the committee report, the average per kilowatt hour residential cost of electricity in the TV A system is 1.32 cents. Compare this to New York where the median cost is 3.18 cents, California where it is 2.08 cents, or the Northeast as a whole where it is 2.93 cents. In short, the combination of natural advantages in production costs, the lack of need to cover profit and dividend costs, and the exemption from Federal taxes mean that consumers in the TV A region get electric power nearly twice as cheaply as many other areas of the country. In light of this, should taxpayers in New York, Illinois, or California be called upon to lower these bargain basement power rates even more? I think not, and urge that the House defeat this bill and repudiate the unsound reasoning that lies behind it. ",1974

109,354,6,Mr. HARTKE.," Mr. President, yesterday I introduced a bill which would increase the personal exemption on Federal income tax returns from $750 to $1,000. This is a proposal which I first made in January 1961; I believe that it is all the more necessary today. The likely course of the economy will be a downturn in 1974. My legislation would help cushion recession and speed recovery with only minor effects on the course of inflation this year. Economic activity already sags. Industrial production has declined during the past 3 consecutive months; unemployment has risen by 650,000 persons since October 1973; and real GNP is declining sharply this quarter. What has happened is that a normal economic cooloft' which began last summer and autumn collided with the energy crisis and the slowdown turned into a tailspin. ",1974
110,404,6,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, some of the most obvious symptoms of our sick economy are the soaring· postal rates now being in:flicted on the American public. The 10-cent stamp is bad enough for the average citizens, but few are aware of the even more serious burden that astronomical rate increases are now imposing on what is perhaps the most valuable source of ideas in our free society, the Nation's newspapers and magazines. Today's Wall Street Journal contains an excellent discussion of this issue by Mr. Stephen Grover. As Mr. Grover notes, publications are taking a number of imaginative steps to try to alleviate the burden, but many believe that the real remedy lies with Congress. To provide the sort of relief that is urgently needed, Senator BARRY GoLDWATER and I have joined in introducing legislation that is now before the Senate and that will soon be considered by the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. My hope is that the Senate will be able to act on this measure as soon as possible. Only through prompt action to relieve the burden of rising postal rates can we commute what is, in effect, a death sentence for many of the Nation's most valuable publications. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Wall Street Journal may be printed in the RECORD, as well as an article I prepared on the subject for the current issue of Signature magazine. There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 20, 1974] EMBATl'LED FOURTH ESTATE: IN THROES OF POSTAGE HIKES, PUBLISHERS SHRINK PROD • UCT, HIKE PRICES, CRY DOOM (By Stephen Grover) To hear many of the nation's magazine and newspaper publishers talk, the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 is this generation's equivalent of the pre-Revolutionary War's sugar and stamp acts. ""A heavy blow"" is how the usually optimistic Reader's Digest magazine referred to the postal act in its January issue, adding that the congressional move ""makes our future-and that of many other magazines-uncertain."" ""There is no doubt whatever,"" the Digest's editors continued, ""that the rate rise will force a large number of magazines to stop publishing,"" Rates, of course, are at the heart of the postal act. Besides setting up the present U.S. Postal Service as a semi-independent body with more autonomy than the old Post Office had ever enjoyed, Congress directed its new creation to see that all classes of mail were made to pay their own way. And as far as second-class mail was concerned, this congressional direction was a radical departure from times past. American tradition, said historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in a recent article in this newspaper, has been ""in transit second-class mail at cheap rates because the circulation of newspapers and magazines has been deemed essential to the enlightenment of the Republic and to the strengthening of American democracy."" The result of the Postal Reorganization Act will be that postal rates for most publications will be at least 242% higher by 1976 than they were in 1971. The effects of the increases, which are taking place in steps over a five-year period, are already obvious. Such magazines as Esquire, Ladies' Home Journal and Fortune and such newspapers as The Wall Street Journal have trimmed their size as one means of shaving their postal bills. Some periodicals have also started to print on lighter-weight grades of paper, and many publications have raised prices. Some, like the Journal have taken all three steps. GRIM VIEW Now, many publications say they can do no more. Prices are about as high as they can go without a drastic loss of readership. Still lighter grades of paper, even 1f they were avilable, would cost far more than the postal savings that they would effect. And further dimensional shrinkage would in most cases be unfeasible. The upshot: Many publications are taking the same grim view as Reader's Digest and assert that unless postal rates are trimmed, or unless they're spaced out over a 10-year period instead of the current fiveyear schedule, they will have to fold. The malaise at the Digest, whose U.S. circulation of 18.4 million makes it the most popular American magazine in existence, is caused by the fact that 90% of its circulation is sent to subscribers via second-class mall; consequently, the publication faces a rise in its second-class postage bill from $7 million this year to $16 Inillion two years hence. Significant as this magnitude is, the Digest is far from alone. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and The National Observer, expects its second-class postage bill to rise this year alone to $13.7 million, up from $8.7 million last year (the Dow Jones increase is largely accounted for by the Journal, 80% of whose 1.4-million circulation is subscription). Time Inc., whose Time, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated magazines all depend heavily on mail dellvery, expects its second-class postage blll wm rise by $4.5 million this year to $14.4 million. Newsweek magazine expects its second-class postage expenditures to amount to $5.7 million in 1974, a 54% jump over last year""and that's assuming that the volume of second-class postage remains about the same as it was last year,"" says Gibson McCabe, president of Newsweek, a Washington Post Co. publication. NOWHERE TO TURN Dire as the predicament of these publications may be, certain of their sisters in the field may fare even worse. For example, a number of the nation's smaller technical journals and magazines of opinion, unlike such mass-circulation publications as Time and Newsweek, are almost entirely dependent on revenues from circulation, rather than advertising, and therefore can't turn to increased advertising rates to meet higher postage bills. One such magazine is The Nation, nearly all of whose 30,000 circulation is subscription. The Nation has few advertisers. ""Consequently,"" says its publisher, James J. Storrow Jr., ""any increase in costs must be borne almost entirely by our readers."" The publication has already raised its rates to $15 a year (for 48 issues) from $12.50 in 1971, the year the first step of the new postal increases went into effect, and the magazine is fearful that any further increases will lead to a loss of readers. ""We already pay 25% to 30% more for postage than for paper, and postal rates are going up faster than any other item,"" Mr. Storrow says. The periodicals with sparse advertising argue tha-t ad-heavy publications brought about the current postal situation. Traditionally, major consumer publications have taken advantage of low subscription rates and even cheaper second-class postal rates to flood the nation with their production and then raise their ad rates on the basis of huge subscription lists. In fact, this factor was a significant motivation for Congress to pass the Postal Reorganization Act; and · today U.S. Postmaster General Elmer T. Klassen stands by that decision. ""I find it difficult to think these publications deserve any form of subsidy,"" he says. ""CATCH 22"" LOGIC is ""If Mr. Klassen quickly adds, ""We're not trying to destroy anyone. These magazines are our customers."" Nevertheless, Arthur Keylor, Time Inc.'s group vice president in charge of magazines, skeptical about Washington's benevolence. the Postal Service were to find the volume of mall declining as a result of the increases, it would find a way to jack up the rates still more. And then where would we be? The whole business has a 'Catch 22' logic to it."" While some of the smaller and middlesized publications are more or less resigned to the postal-rate increases-""There isn't much that we can do about them,"" says Russell Bernard, publisher of Harper's magazine-the larger publications are moving to confront the problem on a number of fronts. Coleman W. Hoyt, distribution manager of Reader's Digest, says his magazine has developed a delivery system based on the services of a private carrier that it will try out in several communities this summer in conjunction with McCall's and several other major magazines. According to Mr. Hoyt, the Digest system sorts the magazines not only by particular areas within a community but by exact carrier routes as well. ""We're even planning to sequence the walk of that carrier,"" he says, ""so he doesn't have to do any sorting himself while on the route.''

114,554,6,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. Speaker, when the President replied to questions on beef prices by the broadcasters Tuesday evening, I had hoped he would take the questions concerning beef prices asked by the broadcasters. I had hoped that he would establish a policy of this administration within the Department of Agriculture and other Federal agencies to find out why consumers have been paying high prices for beef in the stores while producers are taking drastically lower prices for their cattle. Last summer cat.tle prices touched $60 per hundred, broke sharply recently, and are near the $40 mark which is about a 30-percent drop. Consumers should be benefiting from the lower prices while cattle feeders are sustaining huge losses of $100 per head, mostly because of higher feed and other operating costs. The President's reply to one of the questions was that farmers are having it pretty good, but anybody in the cattle feeding business would vigorously dispute that statement. They know better and so should President Nixon. He should examine the information that is available in the Department of Agriculture's ""Livestock and Meat Situation"" for February of this year which indicates that the cost and expense of feeding a 1,050-pound steer comes to $556.88. To cover this cost it requires a sale price of $53.04 per hundredweight just to break even. Since the market is about $10 lower than that, that amounts to a loss of over $100 per head. Feedlot operators are not having it good. No way. On the contrary, the losses are so substantial as to create a concern among many of us that many feedlot operators will either be forced out of business or put so low in the hole that they cannot restock their feedlots. That would mean less beef available in the last half of this year and the first quarter of 1975, and if consumers think prices are tough now, look out for a period of scarcity when there would be a real excuse to raise the price at the supermarket meat counters. Consumers simply have not received the lower beef prices that they are entitled to considering the drop in cattle prices. In August when cattle were reaching close to the $60 figure, the retail price as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics read like this: Round steak, $1.88; hamburger, $1.03, and rump roast, $1.60. The latest comparable figures available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics are for February when we find round steak, $1.93; hamburger, $1.10, and rump roast, $1.87. Cattle are much ches.per than they were in August, yet the statistics show in February consumers not only did not get the break they should have in price reductions, but were actually paying more for the same items than they did last August. So the cattle feeders are having it bad, not good, and the consumers are having it bad, too, despite the fact that there has been a 30-percent drop from the high point in cattle prices last summer. The Subcommittee on Domestic Marketing and Consumer Relations will hold public hearings on April 2, 3, and 4 to investigate this paradox of low cattle prices with high retail prices and why. Even the calling of these hearings may result in retail price drops. It is high time they do come down to reflect the lower cattle prices.

118,604,6,Mr. SCHWEIKER.," Mr. President, some people seem to think Federal spending is about like death and taxes; nobody likes it, but not much can be done about it. I reject that. Not only can we do something about Federal spending, but if we are going to preserve the economic vitality of the United States, we must do something about it. Federal spending sets the pace for the rest of our economy-and as long as Federal spending is out of control, our galloping inflation is going to continue out of control. We simply cannot afford this any longer. During the first session of the 93d Congress, I introduced S. 1213, the Federal Spending Control Act of 1973. I am pleased that the legislation before us today, S. 1541, has adopted the basic features of my bill: A strict Federal spending ceiling, tight controls on backdoor spending, and creation of a congressional budget committee to impose businesslike discipline over the entire Federal spending process. Back in 1972, I joined a majority of my colleagues in both houses in fighting for a $250 billion budget ceiling-and such a ceiling finally passed both Houses of Congress after a bitter fight. But it was never enacted into law, because the President and the Congress could not agree on where the cuts would be made. Last year, when I introduced S. 1213, I favored a spending ceiling substantially less than the President's proposed budget request for that year. So the issue is not between the spenders in Congress and the savers in the executive branch. Mr. President, the issue is a battle of priorities, a debate over how the same amount of our tax dollars should be spent. I believe our constitutional form of Government requires that the representatives of the people, in the House and the Senate, make these crucial decisions. S. 1541 will finally give us the machinery to do that, and I strongly support this measure. In closing, let me stress that S. 1541 is only a first step. Reform of the Federal spending process must be coupled with reform of the Federal taxing process. It is high time we end the special interest tax breaks, the ""golden gimmick"" which has encouraged the major oil companies to raise world oil prices by giving them a dollar for dollar tax credit against U.S. income tax for foreign royalties paid, and the regressive taxes imposed on our poor and elderly. S. 1541 is a strong first step, but I intend to continue fighting for comprehensive tax reform, this session. ",1974

",1974
123,604,6,Mr. RIBICOFF.," Mr. President, this amendment is a modified version of my printed amendment No. 1044. My amendment in no way affects the discipline imposed by the bill. It relates only to the jurisdictional question affecting certain specific types of legislation. Mr. President, S. 1541 is designed to promote fiscal responsibility by reforming the budget process so as to make it reflect congressional priorities. It will establish a framework, reflecting Congressional priorities, which will provide a discipline under which all congressional action affecting the budget can be seen in an overall context. I strongly support S. 1541 for the discipline it creates and for the central role it gives congressional decisionmaking. · As I have said, my amendment in no way affects the discipline imposed by the bill. It relates only to a jurisdictional question affecting certain specific types of legislation. The amendment would delete the requirement that legislation affecting certain programs be referred to the Appropriations Committee but instead offers that committee a~ opportunity to report on this legislation before the Senate acts on it. Under S. 1541, legislation creating a new entitlement to payments or increasing existing entitlements must be referred to the Appropriations Committee for· a period of 10 days after it is reported by a substantive committee. This requirement of referral to the Appropriations Committee would not affect existing trust fund programs but it would apply to such programs as veterans' compensation, veterans' pensions, veterans' educational benefits, payments to needy, aged, blind, and disabled persons, medical assistance to the needy, and food stamps. This additional referral to the Appropriations Committee was not requested by that committee and it will occur at a time when the Appropriations Committee will be fully occupied in attempting to process all appropriations legislation.

125,654,6,Mr. GURNEY.," Mr. President, today I am introducing an amendment to section 4(c) (4) of the Emergency Petro- leum Act of 1973. Basica1ly, my amendment would require that when the Federal Energy Office is making adjustments in the allocation of gasoline established under the regulations, such adjustments will be made for a period of not less than· 180 days. · Mr. President, on March 8, Deputy Administrator John Sawhill attended a meeting· in my office with members of the Florida petroleum marketers and deal-· ers. During the course of this meeting, several aspects-of the mandatory allocation program were discussed, among which was the problem encountered by gasoline owners and operators as it related to their uncertainty of present allotments past a few months period. In speaking of the posture of concern, I find that in the application of the act in its present state, it has a two-fold effect for which I am certain it was not intended. The current ability of the Federal Energy Office to only grant increased adjustments in the allocation of gasoline for a period of 60 days simply does not provide the individual dealer, coping with all of tlie other problems attendant to the energy crisis, with a sufficient adjustment upon which to base any reasonable business or operational projection. I have been advised that Federal Energy Office is not attempting to make adjustments for a 12-month period. However, I"" have been informed, this is only an experiment which may be scrapped not because the program is unworkable or infeasible, but due to a lack of manpower to operate this program. Another factor I would like to point out as to the urgency of such an amendment is that in filing of an FEO 17 form, the attendant processing of these applications simply requires so many days of transit and action time that it clearly makes the current 60-day period of the authorized increased allocation adjustment impractical and unrealistic. Therefore, I submit this amendment as a more practical, urgently needed method of assisting and modifying the basic regulating authority to better serve the needs of the American people Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks the bill I am introducing today be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: · s. 3211 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That section 4(c) (4) of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 is amended by inserting immediately before the period at the end thereof the following: ""Increased adjustments in the allocation of gasoline established under such regulation shall be effective for a period of not less than one hundred and eighty days."".

127,754,6,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, the Defense Department supplemental budget request for fiscal year 1974 (H.R. 12565) contains a provision to build up facilities on the remote United StatesUnited Kingdom island base at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. The Honorable LEE HAMILTON'S Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Near East and South Asia was sufficiently concerned to hold 5 days of about this proposal hearings on it. My own Armed Services Committee voted approval of this project and the entire supplemental budget after barely more than 5 hours of hearings. I believe that the testimony of Earl C. Ravenal before Mr. HAMILTON's subcommittee clearly sets forth the important questions and, as this statement will probably not be published before H.R. 12565 is ramrodded through the House, I would like to take this opportunity to bring it to the attention of my colleagues. Mr. Ravenal puts it well: The ultimate question, of which Diego Garcia is only an early test, is whether we ",1974

129,854,6,Mr. ERVIN.," Mr. President, I just want to say that the Senator from Tilinois has made such a fine argument against this amendment that I do not feel I can add anything to it. I would also like to say, as he did, that the distinguished Senator from Delaware has been one of the most dili· gent members of the Government Opera· tions Committee, and it would be im· possible for me to overmagnify the many contributions which he has made to the work of the committee, both in respect to this particular bill and in respect to the other legislation which has come be· fore the committee during this session of Congress. I feel that I ought to express those thoughts because it would be impossible for any committee to have a more faith· ful and more diligent member than the Government Operations Committee has had in the person of the distinguished Senator from Delaware. ",1974
130,854,6,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President, I shall yield time in a moment to the Senator from Georgia, but I would just like to thank the distinguished chairman of the Com· mittee on Government Operations. It has been a great pleasure to work on this legislation. As in many other areas, he has certainly provided great leadership to the committee, and I thank him for his generous remarks. I yield the Senator from Georgia such time as he may require. ",1974

He and I have spent many hours in this work on the Senate Budget, Management, and Expenditures Subcommittee measure. In working on this legislation, although it is not as tough or as disciplined as he would like or I would like, without his presence, without his great effort, we would have a much looser bill than we have now. I commend him and I also commend him on his amendment. I agree with some of the criticisms which have been made but I, for one, will vote for the amendment, because its vir· tues certainly overwhelm its disadvan· tages. The Senator from Delaware has made c magnificent contribution toward making this legislation meaningful and capable of providing real discipline for the first time in the budgetary process. ",1974

140,854,6,Mr. ROBERT C.," BYRD. Mr. President, I regret to have to oppose the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Minnesota (Mr. MoNDALE) and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. NELSON), but I am opposed to it. It would limit a member from serving for more than 6 years on the new budget committee. It would prevent members from gaining the same kind of experience over a longer period of time in the areas of the committee's jurisdiction. Members would not be able to become as expert as, say, the members of the Finance and Appropriations Committees would. For instance, they would only serve for 6 years. Additionally, if they can only serve on the committee for a brief period of time and would then retain ad infinitum their membership on two other major standing committees, obviously the time of the Budget Committee members would be badly fragmented and split and they would not be able to give the budget committee the kind of time and attention, the energy and the talent, the dedication and the service that they would otherwise give if they served only on that major committee and one other major committee, as is presently the rule in the Senate. Second, by so doing, by having a rotating committee, the stature of that com· mittee would be greatly reduced. This legislation, once it becomes law, will be difficult to implement. So while I believe it can possibly be a workable act, it remains to be seen whether it will work. A great deal will depend on the human element in both Houses. If this committee is looked on as just a temporary committee on which one may serve and get a little exposure and a little experience, and then shift back to another committee, it will reduce the stature of that committee. This commit· tee needs stature. The Appropriations and the Finance Committees already have stature. We have a new committee here and it will be a vitally important committee which will need equal stature with that of the Appropriations and Fi· nance Committees and other committees. It will detract from the stature of that committee if it becomes a sort of rolling stone committee on which members will rotate. It would be just another commit· tee assignment for a member-just another chore, another burden-and not one of his most important committee assignments. Third, the amendment would preclude the development of long-term personal relations with members of the new committee and the other standing commit· tees whose legislative work would have to be coordinated with the new budget committee. The Finance Committee has a long his· tory, and the Appropriations Committee has a history which goes back deep into the roots of this institution. They both have great stature. The members of these committees, because of their seniority on such committees, generally, not only have great stature within the committee structure but also within the Senate. If we are going to set up a committee now that rotates its membership, its mem· bers will be deprived of the opportunity to gain valuable experience and would not be as dedicated in their service to that committee, because of that fact, nor be able to accumulate the expertise in their field, which all members of other committees are able to gain with long and continuous service. I am afraid that they will not then have the prestige that will enable them to act with the kind of comity that will be needed between the budget committee and the Appropriations and Finance Committees, if we are going to make this legislation work. The members of the Appropriations and Finance and other committees may otherwise view those who will be work· ing on the Budget Committee as ju.st messing into the business of the Appro· priations and Finance and other com· mittees. It will damage chances of favorable implementation of this act, once it becomes law. Finally, I do not believe we should veer away from the normal procedure governing the service on standing com· mi ttees in this body. If this is really going to be a major standing committee, then it should stand on an equal basis with all other such standing committees, and its members should understand that. Mr. President, I trust, for these various reasons, that the Senate will not agree to the amendment of the distinguished Senators from Wisconsin and Minnesota, Mr. NELSON and ",1974

Ewing will be honoring this fine American upon his retirement as president of Retail Clerks Union, Local 1442 of Santa Monica, Calif. I am honored that I might be able to share in this tribute befitting a man who has given so much of himself for the benefit of his fellow man. Settling 40 years ago in the San Joaquin Valley, Arlie Ewing worked for DiGorgio Winery as a refriger81tion engineer. Here he became very concerned for the welfare of his fellow workers and became very much involved in the organized labor movement. Through his tireless efforts as an avid organizer, he helped membership grow through contract development. fact, as was brought out in a meeting of the State Federation of Labor in 1957, Arlie was responsible for getting the first contract with DiGorgio Winery in 1937. Later, Arlie 0. Ewing and his family moved to Redondo Beach where he applied his time and talent in numerous civic activities. He has been an active member of the retail clerks since 1950. In addition to serving for the past 10 years as president of local 1442, Arlie Ewing has also served for many years on the State council of the retail clerks. He has also been a very active member of the Democratic Party serving as president of the North Redondo Democratic Club for many years, chairman of the 67th Assembly District for four terms, and chairman of the 17th Congressional Democratic Council for four terms. In addition, he has served as a member of the Los Angeles County Democratic Central Committee for 15 years, and has for four terms been a member of the State committee. A true civic leader, Arlie Ewing has been involved in numerous community affairs. He has served for several years March 22, 1974 as chairman of the budget and finance committee of the city of Redondo Beach; has held the office of vice president of the Food and Drug Council; and has served on State committees. Currently, Arlie is serving as a member of the harbor commission in Redondo Beach. Mr. Speaker, we are fortunate in southern California that we have individuals like Arlie 0. Ewing who are willing to give of themselves for the benefit of their community and fellow man. I know that his wife Jessie and his children-Glen, Wayne, and Margaret-share in the pride we have for this great humanitarian. ARCHER TEXAS EASIER FULLINGIM POLITICIANS RETffiES; BREATHE HON. CHARLES WILSON OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, March 21, 1974 ",1974
146,904,6,Mr. CHARLES WILSON of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I do not guess it is very often that a Member will rise in these chambers to pay homage to someone who has slandered him. We are all accustomed to having our egos trampled, of course, but that does not mean we should do honor to the tramplers. Archer Fullingim, though, is a far cry from your standard, run-of-the-mill ego-trampler. For 22 years now, Archer has been putting out a little weekly paper in a little town named Kountze, and there probably has not been a year when he could not count almost as many libel suits as paid advertisers. That does not mean he is irresponsible or unfriendly or anything; he just believes in getting things off his chest and letting you know whose newspaper it is you are reading. That the Kountze News belongs to Archer is a fact nobody has ever seen fit to challenge. He turns it out every Tuesday on a cranky, wheezY old flatbed press that looks like something Gutenberg improved on, talking to it and tinkering with it till it agrees to meet him halfway. In the process, that old press gets two things from Archer that no Texas politician in the last 22 years has been able to get: flattery and compromise. In between his various cantankerous campaigns and crusades, Archer has found time for his other interests as well. He is a yarn-spinner and shirt-cuff raconteur without par, and he makes something called Mayhaw Jelly that you would swear was a collaborative effort between Mother Nature and Sardi's. Archer has also fallen in love with the pine bogs and backwoods of the Big Thicket Wilderness, and he will tell you with a straight face that he can talk to the trees. And you cannot help but believe him. He looks like he probably can, tall and angular and all, about as gnarled and ageless as some king cypress hidden off in a timeless corner of the thicket wilds. At any rate, Archer has decided to quit the newspaper business. That is probably going to make the world safer for a lot ",1974
147,1004,6,Mr. TREEN.," Mr. Speaker, the monumental problems resulting from Federal involvement in elementary and sooondary education are demonstrated by the rash of amendments to H.R. 69, and by the continuous controversy over funding which has embroiled almost every Member of the House for years. I feel strongly that the time has come to do what many members are convinced must be done: Be.gin extricating the Federal Government from the malaise by returning responsibility for elementary and secondary education to the States and local school authorities. I propose to diminish-and later eliminate-Federal funding of ESHA title I programs and at the same time pro-to EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS vide the States a source of revenue to make up for the reduction in Federal spending. My proposal involves two steps: First. An amendment to be offered to H.R. 69 this week which will impose a $500,000,000 ceiling on ESHA title I programs for fiscal year 1976. The funding anticipated for fiscal year 1975 will not be affected. The amendment will also terminate ESHA title I programs on June 30, 1976. However, an automatic extension for 1 additional year would still be possible under section 404 of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. 1221. Second. Passage of legislation which will terminate the Federal excise tax on tobacco, thus providing a tax revenue source for the States to increase its funding of educational programs. The tobacco tax would terminate on June 30, 1975. Thus, for the year beginning July 1, 1975, the States would have a revenue source which amounted in fiscal year 1973 to $2,276,951,000, and which will amount to an estimated $2.3 billion for (In millions of dollars) March 25, 1974 fiscal year 1974, plus the sum of $500 million under H.R. 69 as amended. Every State-except my own State of Louisiana and the States of Mississippi and Kentucky-would have a greater funding level under this proposal. The following chart-attachment No. 1-shows how each State would fare under my proposal. It is anticipated that the $500 millon Federal funding would either terminate with fiscal year 19·76 or be continued at a reduced level depending on the extent of tobacco tax revenues. I call this plan revenue source returning. It has obvious advantages over revenue sharing. A summary of the advantages of this proposal is found in attachtachment No. 2. ~The first step of this proposal, a bill to repeal the Federal excise tax on cigars, cigarettes, cigarette papers, and tubes will be introduced tomorrow.

This will result in the revenue coming directly to each state without any increase in the tax to the consumer. ( 1) Provides greater funds to District of Columbia and 47 states (all except Louisiana and Mississippi and Kentucky). (2) Gives the states and local school authorities fiexibllity in educational programs. (3) Automatically solves the ""forward funding"" problem. (4) Saves the states and local school districts an estimated $300,000,000 in administrative costs. in (5) Eliminates more than $10,000,000 federal administrative costs. (6) Relieves Congress of one of its more perplexing burdens and the source of much acrimony. (7) Local school authorities will be relieved of having to come on bended knees to Congress. (8) Individual congressmen will be relieved of demands on their time resulting from meetings, correspondence, telephone calls, etc., about ESEA title I programs (all of us could use more time for concentrating on other legislative and administrative duties). (9) Avoids increased federal spending for elementary and secondary education which will certainly grow to monstrous proportions if the federal government continues its role in the financing of education. (10) Expresses our faith in the Jeffersonian principle that that government closest to home is the best government. ATTACHMENT No. 3 AMENDMENT TO H.R. 69, AS REPORTED OFFERED BY MR.

150,1204,6,Mr. TREEN.," Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, the substance of my proposal is printed in the RECORD today on page 8060, and there is a chart on that page which indicates what my proposal would do with regard to funding. My proposal is in two parts, only one of which could be effected here. First of all, let me explain why I am making this proposal. It has been said by one of the Members here that this is not the time to debate whether or not the Federal Government should be involved in education. I disagree with that. I think now is the time that we should debate the basic question of whether the Federal Government should continue to be involved in education. I think that the monumental problems that have been demonstrated by the rash of amendments that we have to H.R. 69; by the continuing controversy we have had over the years on the level of appropriations, on the formula for spending, and many other controversies that we are going to have on H.R. 69 before we get to a final vote, demonstrate that we ought to look at the question of whether or not this Congress should be involved in elementary and secondary education. Mr. Chairman, I think the time has come to extricate ourselves from this mailaise by returning responsibility for elementary and seconda.ry education to the States and to the lor.al authorities. ",1974
151,1254,6,Mr. MILFORD.," Mr. Speaker, today I have introduced a resolution urging that the United States, as a national policy, make every effort to encourage and require the export of finished materials, rather than our basic natural resources. This Nation, so rich in natural resources, currently faces shortages of such basic materials as copper, wheat, cotton, logs, fertilizer, petrochemical feedstocks, and others. Part of the reason is exports. These shortages have a twofold negative impact on our economy. They are cutting into our work force, which normally would be turning these basic resources into finished products; and they are driving up consumer prices. This resolution would put the House on record as strongly favoring a policy to protect these vital natural resources until our own needs are filled. At the same time, it puts the House on record as strongly favoring an export policy which would encourage the export of finished products-manufactured by American workers. How many American millers would it have taken, how many hours of pay into American pockets, to convert last year's massive shipment of wheat to Russia into flour? How many American workers would have jobs if we were exporting finished lumber, plywood, or even completely finished products like furniture to Japan, instead of selling Japan logs off our taxpayer-owned lands? How many American textile workers would be on payrolls instead of unemployment or welfare, if we were shipping cloth-or even thread-overseas, instead of raw cotton? And a lot of that cotton comes back to the United States as finished products, anyway. The primary purpose of this resolution is to put firmly on the record our national desire to protect our resources and make jobs for American workers. The secondary purpose of this resolution is to send a strong message to our colleagues in the Senate that the House meant what it said last September when it passed H.R. 8547, amending the Export Administration Act of 1969. That bill would write this concept into law. Unfortunately, consideration of that bill has been indefinitely postponed in the Senate. Mr. Speaker, I am not an isolationistfar from it. I believe a healthy international trade situation reinforces a healthy American economy. At the same time, though, I cannot see where the export of American raw materials and natural resources, coupled with the subsequent import of finished products from foreign manufacturers employing foreign workers, is of any benefit to the American economy. I urge the House to act on the resolution at the earliest possible time to underscore strongly the fact that this body is serious about this concept. A GREAT MAN (Mr. PEPPER asked and was given permission to extend his remarks at this point in the REcoRD and to include extraneous matter.) ",1974
152,1254,6,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker, a great man and a great American is a dear friend of my wife and myself and lives on Miami Beach. He is Baron Vladimir Kuhn von Poushental who was born in Russia of a distinguished family and fought in the White Russian Army during the Revolution. After the White Russian Army was defeated he fled to Ameria in 1918. His accomplishments in this country have been numerous and outstanding. The first I shall mention is his association with an old pilot friend and fellow Russian refugee, Dr. George de Bothezat, who developed the first prototype helicopter. Dr. de Bothezat died in 1940. Recently, Baron von Poushental, who had been in business with de Bothezat, collected and cataloged the latter's record and data concerning the first prototype helicopter and presented all that invaluable material to the Superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colo. The account of that presentation appears in a publication, Realtor, volume 40, No. 2, published January 8, 1973. This is such interesting aviation history that I know my colleagues and my fellow countrymen who read this record will be pleased to learn that long before the Sikorsky helicopter was developed this prototype helicopter of Dr. de Bothezat was developed with high efficiency. The second outstanding accomplishment of Baron von Poushental was in the establishment of a Russian colony of White Russians in the vicinity of Richmond, Maine. Baron von Poushental acquired the land and provided for its acquisition by the White Russians and helped to develop a complete and successful Russian colony with schools, churches, and other institutions reflecting their ancient Russia of which these people of Russian background so vividly remembered and so much loved. This program of Baron von Poushental which led to the successful development of this great colony was also a momentous contribution to our own country. In the Lewiston Evening Journal there is a very interesting article about Baron von Poushental's work in the establishment and development of this colony and re:fiecting the great success of the colony. Mr. Speaker, I include the article to which I referred from the Realtor and the article to which I averted from the Lewiston Evening Journal about the Russian colony and also about Baron von Poushental presenting the papers of Dr. George de Bothezat to the Superintendent of the U.S. Air Force ,Academy in the RECORD following my remarks. I also include, following these insertions, two letters to Baron von Poushental dated January 28, 1972, and February 7, 1972, from the U.S. Air Force Academy, the first about the de Bothezat materials and the second about the Russian colony to which I referred: [From Realtor, Jan. 8, 1973] Baron V. Kuhn von Poushental, after the White Russian Army was defeated in the Crimea, fled to America in 1918 and quickly sought out his former pilot friend and fellow refugee, Dr. George de Bothezat. The latter was a mechanical genius who shortly thereafter was commissioned by the U.S. government to build a radical new aircraft, based on an aeronautical theory de Bothezat had evolved. The result--the prototype helicopter, built in 1922-llfted 4,400 pounds using a 170 horsepower engine. This was a ratio of more than 20 pounds per unit of horsepower, a.n efficiency of performance the Realtor® says he has not since been achieved. Following de Bothezat's death in 1940, Baron von Poushental, who had been briefly in business with the inventor, commenced collecting and cataloging the latter's records, consisting of four original manuscripts, eight typed scripts, 62 photos of the first helicopter flight and historical records of de Bothezat's private helicopter companies. The culmination of von Poushenthal's devotion to his friend and mentor came last August, when he was invited by the superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy to present the de Bothezat materials for permanent storage at the academy's library, where they are available for study by cadets, faculty and scholarly researchers. In a letter to the donor, Lt. Gen. A. P. Clark, superintendent of the academy, said in part, ""You may be sure these papers will be reviewed by cadets for years to come, for their historical significance as well as the unique record of one of our pioneers in aviation. The academy library and cadets are enriched by your generous contribution."" [From the Lewiston (Maine) Oct. 21, 1972] Journal, RICHMOND'S TALENTED RUSSIAN COLONY (By Priscilla E. Braun) Richmond on the Kennebec is the hub of activity for the Russian people in the area. Four churches, a Russian restaurant, cobbler shop and a rest home are located in the village. How did a small Maine community happen to draw people from a completely different tradition? Baron Kuhn Von Poushental was on a duck hunting trek in this area about 1940. Bearing in mind the large number of Russian refugees nearing retirement he brought up land at bargain prices, advertised through the Russian language newspapers, and resold to those who yearned to spend their last years on their own land. The Richmond area bears a striking similarity the Russian countryside. People have settled throughout Whitefield, Dresden, Pittston, Bowdoinham, Litchfield, and Richmond. To group these people under the title ""Russians"" is inaccurate. They are usually victims of changing politics in Russia, Ukrania, Poland, Lithuania, and other iron curtain countries. The one thing they usually to ",1974
153,1304,6,Mr. OWENS.," Mr. Speaker, discussion often arises in Congress regarding the care and needs of our senior citizens. Among the foremost considerations in searching for a solution to the problems of the aged is returning these people to a life of dignity and quality, as well as a strong sense of usefulness. This is a problem of great importanc.e which we must face. It is no secret that for many of this Nation's elderly, retirement holds nothing more than dependence, anxiety, and loneliness. However, the picture is not all that bleak thanks to organizations such as Green Thumb, Inc., sponsored by the National Farmers Union and funded by grants from the Labor Department. The Green Thumb program operates in 24 States, including my home State of Utah, and Puerto RicoL It is an employment project for senior citizens at the povertyincome level. All Green Thumb workers must be at least 55 years old, have a lowlevel income, have rural or farm background, and be in good health. There is no age limit. The oldest Utah Green Thumb worker is 97 years old. The average age of workers in Utah is 71.9. The workers have done a tremendous amount of work for the State of Utah on a volunteer basis. Green Thumb pays them from grant money, so that workers can earn additional income for food, medical care, and other necessities. Recently, Utah Green Thumb sent me a copy of their 1973 report. In the report was a copy of a letter from the family of the late Alden Miller, who had been a Green Thumb worker since 1968. The story related is typical of the immense benefits which Green Thumb employment has meant to many of our senior citizens. I insert this letter for the information of interested Members: NoVEMBER 30, 1973. Mr. JoHN ZuPKO, Green Thumb Project, Salt Lake City, Utah. DEAR Ma. ZuP~o: We, the family of Alden Mmer, would 11k'e to take this opportunity to March 26, 1971, (33 express our appreciation and gratitude to you and the Green Thumb Project {or the opportunities it opened up for Otlt b tlsband and father. .. Green Thumb meant a new life to him. It gave him independence in himself that he had never been able to express before. He was so proud of his work, his men, and the job that they were Cl.oing together. He enjoyed the respons llity of his paper work and this gave hini self confidence when he realized that he could do it and was doing a good job. It was the first time in his life that his job was something special and people looked up to him for supervision. He was most proud that he was chosen to be foreman and he enjoyed working with his crew of men and they were so special to him. He was an intelligent and alert man and Green, Thumb gave him a chance to prove this to himself and others. After working with the Green Thumb Project it was the first time he had been completely out of debt: He was able to save toward fixing up their home {which they had lived in for over 40 years). He and some of his sons were able to lay cement sidewalks all around their home and this was something that they had wanted for some time. They were able to buy some nice new modern chairs for their living room and at the time of his passing plans were being made by· he and his wife to carpet and wallpaper some of the rooms in their home. Christmas of 1972 was the first time that he and his wife were able to save enough tnoney so that they could give ChriStmas presents to ALL of their family. What a thrill it was for them to give five dollar bills to each of their children and their spou-ses (J.6 total), silver dollars to each grandchild total), and silver dollars to each great grandchild ( 6 total) . December 20, 1972, our parents celebrated their 50th Wedding Anniversary. Daddy had saved the money and for Mother's ann!ver· sary gift gave her 'fifty dollars. How proud he was that he had been able to save this amount out of his Green Thumb earnings for his companion of 50 years. . He was able to save some from each of his checks and had a sizeable savings account for the first time in his lii'e. He felt this was. a very good insurance to have this saved for a rainy day .. It was a big load lifted from his and his Wife's shoulders when they knew that there was a regular income check coming in each month. Our father was a kind and gentle man who had been poor and hard working all of his life. It was only after he started with the Green Thumb Project and had the financial load lifted that he had time to sit and visit with his friends and loved ones and enjoy life. . It made him so proud when he could go wlth friends or family and show them some of the accomplishments that he and his crew of Green Thumbers had accomplished. On a Sunday afternoon ride he was so proud to ~how you such accomplishments as the Palisade Lake improvements, Fairview Museum, Manti Cemetery fence, Fountain Green Cemetery improvements, and many other various projects. The Miller Family feels Green Thumb was one of the most rewarding opportunities in our Father's life. What a wonderful program for older men to work in who would otherwise think they had no meaning, place, or purpose in life. Green Thumb gives them the opportunity to prove they are important people and that they still have a useful place in life. With grateful hearts we want to take this opportunity to thank the Green Thumb Project and especially you-Mr. Zupko, for the confidence and responsibility you placed in our husband and father-Alden Miller. Because of yon and Green Thumb, in the last ",1974
154,4,11,Mr. BINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, according to media reports, when President Nixon inaugurated the system of having tapes made of conversations in his office, he had in mind that at some subsequent time a gift of such tapes would be deductible for tax purposes. If it is true that the law Congress passed eliminating tax deductions for papers and files, et cetera, does not include tapes, then the law should quickly be amended to correct that obvious loophole, and I am introducing legislation to that effect today. RESIGNATION OF MR. JENNER CALLED FOR (Mr. LANDGREBE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",1974
155,4,11,Mr. LANDGREBE.," Mr. Speaker, it may not seem to be in good taste to bring to the floor intraparty squabbles. However, the magnitude of the present situation requires that I speak out. For more than a year now the President has been under vicious attack. That this biased and partisan attack comes in large measure from members of the Democratic Party is to be expected. That this attack in large part comes from all the various factions of the liberal-left, to overturn who are attempting the overwhelming election mandate of 1972, is also to be expected. That many members of the Republican Party are acquiescing, following along, and not standing up in defense of the President is reprehensible. I think it is inexcusable for Republicans not to be def ending the leader of their party when he is being subjected to hostile and unjust attacks which are weakening and threaten to destroy our republican form of government with its system of checks and balances and separation of power between the executive and legislative branch. Even though millions of dollars have been squandered in what has been to date a futile attempt to find an offense of an impeachable nature with which to hang our President, nothing of that na.ture has been brought to light. Consider, in this context, the actions of the minority members of the House Judiciary Committee. The very least that the President could expect is that the members of his own party leave no stone unturned to insure that he has a fair hearing. Thus the role of the Republicans on this committee should be similar to that of a, defense attorney-continually subjecting the charges of the prosecution to close cross-examination. Therefore, it is important that the minority counsel on the Judiciary Committee be capable of standing up to the charges and attacks of the committee majority to insure that the impeachment investigation is honest and just. The actions of Mr. Bert Jenner, as outlined in the following letter, make it clear that he is totally incapable of meeting this challenge. I join my colleague, Representative LAWRENCE J. HOGAN, in urging Representative EDWARD HUTCHINSON to request the resignation of Mr. Jenner as minority counsel on the Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry. The letter follows: WASHINGTON, D.C., May 6, 1974. Hon. EDWARD HUTCHINSON, Rayburn Building, Washington, D.O. DEAR Eo: I strongly urge that you request the resignation of Bert Jenner as our Minority Counsel on the Judiciary Committee's Impeachment Inquiry. As we begin the most important part of our work, it is vitally important that we have reliable staff support. In effect, we do not have a Minority Counsel; we have an assistant Majority Counsel. You will recall that a number of us on the Committee were upset over his lack of candor in not telling you before he was hired tnat he had contributed $1,000 to Senator Adlai E. Stevenson Ill's campaign and had participated in a fund-raising breakfast. That could have been overlooked, but his subsequent activities I find inexcusable. We were also disturbed that, immediately after his appointment, he had gone on television publicly stating his views on impeachable offenses. We later questioned his statement that the President can be impeached for acts of his subordinates as well as the appropriateness of his making such a statement publicly. You will recall that we chastised him in our caucus and told him that he had been hired to advise us, not to make public statements on impeachment. He assured us he would not do it again. In this context, I also quote from the ""Rules for the Impeachment Inquiry Staff"": ""1) The staff of the impeachment inquiry shall not discuss with anyone outside the staff either the substance or procedure of their work or that of the Committee."" In spite of this rule and our specific instructions, he has traveled to various parts of the country making speeches on impeachment. I previously called to your attention the article from the April 12, 1974 Austin reported on a speech Mr. Jenner made at the University of Texas Law School. The story was headlined: ""Watergate Grand Jury's Report 'Loaded'; Committee Lawyer Joyful at Issuance of Subpoena"". I quote from this news story: ""One of the handful of people who know what is inside a confidential report from the Watergate grand jury to the House Judiciary Committee said in Austin Thursday 'it is Joaded.' ""As he spoke to law students at the University of Texas, Albert Jenner, minority counsel to the House committee, heard the news that the group had voted to subpoena all of the tapes and documents it has requested from President Nixon. ""As he read a note slipped to him during his speech, Jenner raised his arm into the air, clenching his fist and said, 'it was issued.' ""His announcement met with immediate cheering and applause. With a big smile on American-Statesman which his face, the attorney took off his coat, turned back toward the crowd and said, 'I've been working on that for months.' ""Before the interruption, Jenner had been telling the students of the many questions and problems that confront a lawyer placed in the position of heading up an impeachment investigation. ""Sticking to the confidentiality rules adopted by the Committee, he made no comments on a number of the more controversial issues involved in the case. ""He said if the President refuses to comply with the subpoena, the House Will probably vote him in contempt. 'They will then bring to bear the judgment and anger of the people of the country and include the contempt charge in the articles of impe.achment,' Jenner said. ""'In our opinion', Jenner said, speaking of the staff of 44 lawyers and 58 other workers, 'we feel the President must be guilty of gross misuse of power' to be impeached. 'It must be extremely serious.' ""But, he said he doesn't feel the constitutional statement that the President can only be impeached and convicted for 'treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdeme.anors' means that impeachable offenses are limited to 'crimes.' ""'We feel it extends to serious abuses and offenses against the system of government in the United States of America,' Jenner said. ""Impeachment is an inquiry, not a trial, he told the students. 'It is a political function given solely to the House and . . . (by implication) gives the right to exercise any power to obtain information the House feels necessary to carry out the inquiry.' "" 'This is a Grand Inquiry, with a capital G and I,' Jenner said. And because of this, he said, he doubts the committee will compromise on the materials it seeks from the President .. .'' I not only object to his improper remarks in violation of our instructions and the Committee's rules, but also the fact that he has missed important committee meetings and Republican caucuses, apparently because he was out of the city making speeches. I suggest that you ascertain if he is the anonymous ""source in Congress"" who was quoted in the Los Angeles Times March 23 as saying: ""'When you hear the tape,' one source said, 'you have a lot more respect for Dean's integrity and what he told the Senate Watergate committee. It is that explosive. It is not runbiguous.' "" I further question whether or not he should have met with editors of the Washington Star-News in an off-the-record session or whether he should talk to any media representatives ""off the record"" or on. In a number of instances Mr. Jenner has impeded the work of Republicans on the Committee. You will recall that he supported the Majority's brief on impeachable offenses and when we learned in advance of the thrust of this brief, we asked him for a broader brief stressing criminality. He said he would have it prepared for us. I specifically requested that we have this brief before, or at least at the same time, the Majority's brief was presented. I did not get it until several days after the Majority brief was made public and only after I specifically demanded it from Mr.Jenner. Obviously there are different legal views on virtually every legal principle, but we have been getting only one view because Mr. Jenner goes along with the Majority on all matters to the detriment of Republican members of the Oommittee. As you know we have requested Mr. Jenner to do research on a number of important matters and, as far as I can determine, this work has never been done. We have the right to expect that our Minority staff will give us the kind of assistance ",1974

195,404,11,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, education assistance programs for veterans have been among the most successful and productive ever enacted by our Government. After World War II and the Korean conflict educational benefits received by returning Gis were a major force behind the economic recovery o! the fifties and dividends from this postwar investment continue to be reflected in today's society Today, Vietnam era veterans face an extremely difficult problem of readjustment and education benefits often determine the difference between success and failure for them. The Veteran's Affairs Committee is currently working on a comprehensive bill to update veterans education benefits to put them on par with benefits which were available to World War II vets. As a cosp0nsor of s. 2784, I know that time is needed to allow proper consideration of such a comprehensive bill. But thousands of veterans who might benefit from this bill do not have time-because on May 31, 1974, their eligibility for benefits will expire. To prevent this from occurring, I urge the Senate to vote for S. 3398 and extend eligibility for education benefits from 8 to 10 years. PRAISE FOR DR. RIDDICK ",1974
196,404,11,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, I want to add my appreciation to the many expressions of deserved praise to Dr. Riddick, the Senate Parliamentarian, for the new edition of ""Senate Procedure"" that he developed. His is an honorable tradition stemming from the efforts of Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson, as Vice President, developed a set of rules of procedure, still known as ""Jefferson's Manual."" In pref ace to his seminal work, Mr. Jefferson wrote: I have begun a sketch which those who come after me wlll success! vely correct and fill-up till a. code of rules shall be formed for the use of the Senate, the effects of which may be accuracy in business, economy of time, order, uniformity and impartiality. Mr. Dr. Riddick's work is consistent with Jefferson's guidelines. As a newcomer to the Senate, I feel an extra dimension of appreciation for the new edition. Thank you, Dr. Riddick.

198,504,11,Mr. MOORHEAD of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker, two Pittsburgh area women, Lisa Voss and Susan Frasure, both students at North Allegheny High School, have prepared thoughtful cogent statements in support of the eastern wilderness legislation that was considered by the Interior Committee's Subcommittee on Public Lands, chaired by our very able colleague from Montana, JOHN MELCHER. Although they were not able to present their testimony in person to the subcommittee, the remarks of Misses Voss and Frasure will be made part of the subcommittee's official record. As the subcommittee chairman said in a note to me, the statements are ""a fine example of rational intelligent youth involvement in public affairs."" I could not agree with him more. I would like to include these statements in the RECORD at this time: ",1974
199,504,11,STATEMENT BY LISA ,"Voss My name ls Lisa Voss. I am eighteen years old and a senior at North Allegheny High School in Pittsburgh. I am speaking for the student committee of the North Area Environmental Council. The N.A.E.C. is a group of adults in our community whose main concern 1s the preservation of the environment. The student committee of the N.A.E.C. work along with the adults in various community projects-. We are involved in a recycling operation in the community and various other environmental projects. Presently, we are planning future backpacking weekends for the months of May, June, and July. My group has sent me here for the purpose of testifying on their behalf concerning the Eastern Wildnerness Act. We are totally in favor of the passing of this act and especially concerned with Dolly Sods and Otter Creek of West Virginia being defined as an instant wilderness. Along these lines, we would also like to see Hickory Creek, Tracey Ridge, and Allegheny Front classlfted as wilderness study areas. Speaking for myself and the other members of my committee, I urge you to vote in favor of this bill. I have backpacked in the Dolly Sods area twice, and in Otter Creek and Hickory Creek, once. I have never felt more freedom or tranquillty as I have when hiking and camping in these areas. It pains me to think of the consequences that these areas could suffer without the help of these bllls. The simple Joy of drinking clean, clear water from a mountain stream excels all others for me. To be able to breathe that wonderful, fresh EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS country air is an experience that I hope others will be able to enjoy as a result of the passing of the Eastern Wilderness Act. The quiet sounds and the beauty of nature itself stay with me as I reflect back on my past experiences with the wilderness. I intend to expand my love and knowledge of the wilderness in future years, and hope that this will be made possible through the passing of this and other similar acts. My greatest hope is that when I'm older and have a family of my own, the love I hold for the beautiful creations of God can be passed on to my children. Man can try to create beauty, but to me, the only real beauty stems from that which is natural and pure. A virgin wilderness 1s the most natural and pure of anything I know on this earth. I sincerely hope there will still be virgin wilderness for future generations to enjoy. In our organization, one of the points we stress the most before embarking on a backpacking trip., is that we are merely guests to the wilderness. By this we mean that it should be left as we found it so that the next people that come through can enjoy it to the fullest extent, without a trace of any previous presence of many. For example, visualize the Joy and delight I felt upon a return visit to the Dolly Sods area when I observed a particular spot I remembered, and it looked as if it had never been touched by man. I believe that respect for the wilderness is the most important requirement for a person to be considered a good camper. In closing, I would like to thank you so very much for letting me have the opportunity to testify here today. I'm sure it will be an experience I shall never forget. I ask you once more to consider what I've said, and realize how much the preservation of the Wilderness means to me, and so many others like me who share my deep love for nature. ",1974
200,504,11,STATEMENT BY SUSAN FRASURE ,"My name 1s Susan Frasure. I am an 18 year old senior at North Allegheny High School in Pittsburgh, Pa., and am on the executive board of the school's Environmental Action Club. Our club has been very active towards our environment by participating in recycling activities, setting up a hiking trail for the community, and going on backpacking studies. I am representing my club today because of our acute interest in the wilderness. Every member of our group is very much for the passing of the Eastern Wilderness Act. We have a special interest in the Dolly Sods and Otter Creek Wildernesses in West Virginia as we have backpacked there before and plan to return again this summer. Particularly, we are quite anxious to see Hickory Creek, Tracy Ridge, and the Allegheny Front of Pennsylvania included as Wilderness Study Areas. This fall our club packed at Hickory Creek and immediately fell in love with it. We hold great hopes that it will become a study area and eventually be classified as a true wilderness. We hope to visit either Tracy Ridge or the Allegheny Front this spring. It will be a great let down to our club if any of these natural wildernesses are allowed to fall apart because they are not classified as study areas. North Allegheny urges you to vote for the passing of the Eastern Wilderness Act and including the Allegheny areas as Wilderness Study Areas. There are so many benefits that could come from the passing of these bills. As an experienced backpacker, I know the reasons for valuing the wilderness. First of all, there is no better way to obtain adventurous exploring and exciting travel as in a wilderness. The thrills of self discovery and challenge are precious feelings I have found only through hiking. For those of us who are of a religious nature, there can be no better way to enjoy communion with God's beauty May 13, 1974 I and feel his presence as in the solitude of the wllderness. The areas in the Eastern Wllderness Act are perfect places to find refuge in forgetting one's problems by returning to nature. Wilderness areas have potential use for scientific research, including ecological and geological features. Also, the wilderness is a wonderful place for outdo<;>r education. have experienced all the wonders of the wilderness. I'm asking you to make sure that future generations can share my discoveries by passing these bills. Hickory Creek, Tracy Ridge and the Allegheny Front have all the qualifications for a wilderness study area. All through these areas the affects of nature are apparent. There are no signs of human habitation nor man's impact on nature such as roads or buildings. These are places where nature's balance of life can continue as it was intended without the help of man. I wish there was a way that I could convey to you my love of the wllderness so that you could then see the necessity for preserving it. There ls no other place that could possibly hold as much natural beauty and tranquillty. Backpacking has brought to me wonderful opportunities to express myself and become closer to my friends. In the wilderness it becomes easy to understand one's purpose and to see how little man truly is. It would be sinful for man to destroy these areas and to therefore lose the essence of his natural habitat. Once again I must ask you for my peers and especially for myself that you support all wilderness bills. Thank you so much for this opportunity of talking to such a distinguished group. Hopefully, what I have said today has made some impact. I also wish that someday all of you can discover for yourself the solitude and tranqullity that exists in the wilderness. DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS FREEZES COMMITTEE PROPOSAL DEEPREFORM HON. JOHN B. ANDERSON OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, May 13, 1974 ",1974
201,504,11,Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I was distressed and disheartened to learn that the House Democratic Caucus last week voted to move the BollingMartin committee reform proposal from the back burner to the deep freeze. If the Democrats had any real interest in seeing this important reform through in this Congress they would have moved the resolution to the front burner of the House Rules Committee now so that it could be reported to the full House in time for action yet this year. Instead, they have specifically ordered the Democratic members of the Rules Committee to take no action on the resolution while it is reposing in the reform graveyard of a caucus task force, reportedly stacked with opponents to the reform. Mr. Speaker, the Democratic Caucus cannot deceive the American people with this fancy bit of footwork, because no matter how you look at it, they are doing the ""antireform shuffle""; that is, two foot-dragging sidesteps, followed by four steps backward. I think it is interesting to note that the July reporting deadline for the task force conveniently runs up against the August recess, followed by the fall election campaign, followed by a ",1974
202,604,11,Mr. MAGNUSON.," Mr. President, high prices have created tremendous windfall profits for oil companies. The size of the windfalls is so large the numbers are hard to grasp. The Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation estimates 1974 profits on domestic oil production alone will be $9 billion after taxes. These windfall profits are in large part attributable to taxpayer subsidies of the oil industry. It is time Congress insists that the oil industry pay their fair share of taxes on their increased profits. I am pleased to join with Senator RIBICOFF and Senator JACKSON in an amendment to H.R. 8217, the vessel repair tariff bill, to restore equity to the energy tax system. Senator RIBICOFF, Senator JACKSON and myself propose that the Senate act to repeal the oil and gas depletion allowance immediately. This huge tax loophole has outlived any usefulness it may have had. Simple justice requires taxpayers no longer subsidize the industry that is reaping windfall profits far in excess of anything our Nation has ever before experienced. Immediate repeal of the oil depletion allowance, effective January 1, 1974, as we propose, would yield $2.6 billion more revenues this year than a phased-in repeal such as proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee. By 1980, the total difference between immediate and phased repeal of depletion will total $80 billion. These extra windfall profits are not needed to finance future oil and gas exploration. The Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation estimates the industry is limited to investing a maximum of 50 percent of recent profit increases. Immediate repeal of depletion will still leave an average $1.50 per barrel increase in profits over 1973, as a price incentive for expanded exploration and development. Depletion allowances have not stimulated exploration and development. To the contrary, a Library of Congress study concludes they have stimulated overdrilling of existing fields. Further, depletion allowances significantly reward large domestic producers out of proportion to the rewards received by smaller producers. Worst, during today's energy shortages, depletion allowances actively discourage capital expenditures and cheaper, more abundant energy sources such as coal liquefaction, oil shale and solar energy. The Congress must choose the most efficient incentives to encourage the production of new domestic energy supplies. The existing tax subsidies are inefficient incentives and, in fact, often act as dis-incentives. Where tax subsidies do have an effect on oil producers, they create out-of-pocket transfers from taxpayers to producers. Depletion was originally designed to allow producers to recover the loss in value of oil as they took it out of the ground. ""Cost"" depletion can be considered analogous to ordinary business depreciation. Percentage depletion, on the other hand, results in producers recovering the value of oil wells 16 times over. Inefficient tax subsidies to oil producers cannot be justified during times of windfall profits. Domestic oil prices have more than doubled over the past year and the price of domestic crude oil continues to rise. The President's energy message calls for a tax on windfall profits. I, and other Members of the Senate, have called for a price rollback. It is unconscionable to argue that tax subsidies are needed to further increase oil profits today. The current windfall profits in domestic oil production can be entirely attributed to price increases in foreign crude oil. In 1972, domestic crude oil was more expensive than foreign crude oil. Today, foreign crude oil has a posted price in excess of $10 per barrel. Domestic crude oil production costs average less than $3.50 per barrel. New domestic crude oil is being sold at foreign crude oil prices. Domestic producers are reaping a $6.50 per barrel windfall because of foreign oil price fixing. Repeal of the oil depletion allowance would reduce this windfall by about $1.50 per barrel. So immediate repeal of depletion will still leave massive increased profits as a price incentive to attract capital for expanded oil and gas production. There is no better time for the Senate to consider repeal of this tax loophole than in the context of tax relief for the ordinary consumer. I am proud of my record in consumer protection. Consumers have grown increasingly more frustrated as oil industry profits skyrocket, energy supplies grow short, and the oil subsidy burden on the common taxpayer increases. Repeal of the depletion allowance, effective January 1, 1974, will yield $19.4 billion more revenues by 1980, than the Ways and Means ""oil tax reform"" bill. This money is readily available for redistribution to hard-pressed taxpayers. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join me in this effort. The time to act is now. The choice is simple. Does the Senate wish to maintain unconscionably high windfall profits for oil companies, or does the Senate wish to provide tax equity for the ordinary workingman? SOLAR HEATING AND COOLING DEMONSTRATION ACT OF 1974-AMENDMENT AMENDMENT NO. 1332 (Ordered to be printed, and to lie on the table.)

203,704,11,Mr. ALLEN.," No, I would respectfully disagree with the distinguished Senator, because it has the second factor of including two-thirds of those children in families receiving AFDC over the amount of the Orshansky formula. So that is being cranked in. What the Senator from Alabama is objecting to is what the Senate committee does in not only counting the children under Orshansky, but also counting them again if they fall under the AFDC, so that one child could be counted on two occasions. It is not just a composite mix of formulas in coming up with one formula; it is the counting of one child two times that the Senator from Alabama objects to. ",1974
204,704,11,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Well, as the McClellan amendment proceeds, as the cost of living increases, we will be moving inexorably in the direction of eliminating that other part of the formula, AFDC. That has to be the nature of things, unless we have a reduction in the cost of living, which I would hope we might see but it is not realistic. ",1974
205,704,11,Mr. ALLEN.," Why should the children be counted twice, is what the Senator from Alabama does not understand. ",1974
206,704,11,Mr. WILLIAMS.,". Because there are so many who were not counted at all in the census figures, for one reason. We do know the annual census of needy children under AFDC. And we do know the number left out in the basic census figures was large indeed. It has been estimated that as many as 5 million families were left out. ",1974
207,704,11,Mr. ALLEN.," Why did the Senator bring the bill back to -the floor based on the Orshansky formula, if, as he is now pointing out, it is not a proper formula? ",1974

210,704,11,Mr. WILLIAMS., Excuse me. Was that directed to me? Was there a question tome? ,1974
211,704,11,Mr. ALLEN., What was my question? ,1974
212,704,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The question will be repeated by the Reporter. The Official Reporter (Grant E. Perry) 1·ead as follows: answer, I Why did the Senator bring the bill back to the floor based on the Orshansky formula, if, as he is now pointing out, it is not a. proper formula? ",1974
213,704,11,Mr. WILLIAMS.," That is a very worthy question, and, believe me, we have been under great pressure to have this bill here long before this, and we have been on a search for what I would consider a better approach than Orshansky, particularly now that v.e are faced with Orshansky almost pure in this amendment. Quite !rankly, this administration did not come up with figures that would guarantee the most equitable distribution. We do not have it in the bill, but it is a lot more equitable, I would suggest, in the bill the committee brought out than in this single approach of the faulty Orshansky formula. ",1974
214,704,11,Mr. ALLEN., I thank the Senator. ,1974
215,704,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Who yields time? ,1974
216,704,11,Mr. JAVITS.," Mr. President, is any time left in opposition to the amendment? ",1974
217,704,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., There is 12 minutes remaining. ,1974
218,704,11,Mr. JAVITS.," I yield myself 10 minutes. Mr. President, it is very interesting to me how the text of the amendment itself defies a good many of the arguments made in its favor as against the amendment of the committee. For example, with all the decr.ying of the AFDC children as a proper element in the formula, it is a fact that Senator McClellan's amendment cranks in, not all the AFDC children above the poverty level, but only two-thirds of them, as if there were twothirds of a poor child. Nonetheless, they are cranked in, so there must be some self-consciousness in the author of the amendment that this is an essential element of the situation. I will come back to that in a minute. Also, Mr. President, with all the decrying of a base year, the fact is that though they very considerably reduced the effect of the base year, they cranked that aspect in, too, in an altered formto wit, 85 percent of the preceding year hold harmless, and then after that 85 percent in the preceding year. Now, Mr. President, one other thing: We are proceeding, in respect of this amendment, against a tradition, here, which has established a 100 percent hold harmless situation in respect of this very Federal aid to education. That was contained in the first continuing resolution for the current fiscal year, and was contained also in the fiscal year 1974 LaborHEW appropriation, the definitive appropriation which obtains for this fiscal year. Finally, Mr. President, to go further with it, we are told that in order to get precision, definiteness, we have to adopt the McClellan amendment; but the McClellan amendment puts us more than ever on an uncharted sea. Let us just take one example of that. It is argued that the Orshansky formula is definitive for those children, and that the AFDC formula is indeterminate. But the fact is that it is complained, for example, according to an Urban League estimate, that the Orshansky formula, which is based upon the 1970 census undercounts the poor children by 5.3 million. That is an infinitely bigger margin of error, Mr. President, than even 40 percent of the children under AFDC, which would amount, on that basis, to something in the area of 3 million, even if you took it on its face. The reason, Mr. President, for cranking in the AFDC formula, as we do and the McClellan amendment does-exactly the same thing in terms of acceptance of the principle-is that the Orshansky is a static index. We only change it every 10 years based on the census. That will not be for 9 years to come, whereas AFDC is a moving index. It changes all the time, depending on the group of children concerned and their poverty area. So I think this is critically important because taken at its face, it is still very good until we begin to break it down. 3,000 One other thing that is critically important to break down and that is the global figure. Let us remember that the global figures taken here, by eliminating the two gifted provisions-parts B and C-relating to incentives to the States to do better in education and the unusually high concentration of lowincome children, are eliminated so that the global sum used in the McClellan amendment becomes a greater sum. Certainly, no matter how we slice it, the individual amount distributable under that formula would appear to be greater. The figures are given by States, but the money is not distributed by States. This is the key fallacy which I hope the Senate will carefully scrutinize. The money is not distributed by States but by local educational districts. So the State may, in a global sense, look good, but the State is not the entity that gets the money. The entity that gets the money is the local educational district. When we break that down into local educational districts, according to the formula proposed by the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. McCLELLAN), we find that 600 counties out of some counties in the Nation will receive less in :fiscal year 1975 than in the current fiscal year. This, to me, is the real nail that should be driven into the internment of the McClellan amendment, the point about the populations. We are talking about people, the population of those 600 counties as compared with the population of the other 2,400. That will give us a real measm·e of what this means. The 600 counties are disadvantaged. They include the primary metropolitan areas of the country. This country is no longer rural. Seventy-five percent of our people live in urban areas. Practically every State has .an important metropolitan area. So those are the very key reasons why such diverse entities as the American Federation of Labor, the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the United Automobile Workers of America, all espouse the committee's formula, because taking everything together it did the best justice. In addition, it obeyed and conformed to the tradition which we have established, because of the shifting nature of the formula bases, the tradition of a hold-harmless formula based on the preceding year. Finally-and we shall have more time to debate this, I do not want to take more than the time allotted to me at this moment-there is one more critically important fact that I should like to point out. It is a very popular sport, Mr. President, on the floor of the Senate-and I have been here .a considerable time and I have heard it countless times and have seen the game played time and time and time again-to point the finger at New York. Look at ~ew York. Look at what has happened in New York. Look at what New York is getting. When we do that, let us remember that no matter what we do, New York is the State that will always be ahead. Take the McClellan formula or any other formula and New York will still get a lot of money. The McClellan formula gives New York the most of any State. It gives New York ",1974
219,754,11,Mr. GROSS.," Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, the more I listen to this bill the more convinced I am that it is designed, as it has worked in the past, almost exclusively for the benefit for the State of California. I see no evidence of any accomplishment in any other direction. Is there anybody here who can put his finger on any substantial accomplishment anywhere else in the country? I like California and Californians, but I do not believe Congress should be in the business of taking care of California exclusively. Perhaps the State of Georgia has been benefited; if so I should like to hear from Georgia. ",1974
220,754,11,Mr. ROUSSELOT.," Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? ",1974
221,754,11,Mr. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? ",1974
222,754,11,Mr. GROSS.," I was expecting California to rise to express appreciation for the money that has already been spent on this boondoggle, but I will yield and listen to the gentleman from Georgia. ",1974
223,754,11,Mr. BLACKBURN.," I appreciate the gentleman's yielding. . Let me assure the gentleman that while we have given specific references of the improvement of train facilities as far as the east and west coasts are concerned, both areas of the country have benefited by this. The improvement in the use of long-haul trucks in permitting them to be utilized for hauling goods back from the point of origin, where in the past they have not, is certainly of national benefit. It is not restricted to that particular area of the country. There are studies from the National Commission on Productivity working with the Grocery Manufacturers Association which is working with local legislators to improve productivity in the grocery distribution and handling business. It is certainly not provincial in its character whatsoever and I suspect they work in the State of Iowa as well as other States. ",1974
224,754,11,Mr. GROSS., I might as well advise the gentleman from Georgia that my wife has not reported to me that she can trace any benefits back to this Commission insofar as her shopping at the grocery store is concerned. ,1974
225,754,11,Mr. ASHLEY.," Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? ",1974
226,754,11,Mr. GROSS., I yield to the gentleman from Ohio. Has the State of Ohio benefited too from this organization? ,1974
227,754,11,Mr. ASHLEY.," Yes, I would say so. The Commission has been working with units of local government not just in the State of California or in the State of Ohio but also as a matter of fact on a rather broaa. scale, so I think the question with respect to the Commission's parochial interest is not well taken. ",1974
228,754,11,Mr. GROSS.," Of course when one starts dealing with the bureaucrats he will find that they will say they work for anybody anywhere, any plaice around the world. But let me get down to a case or two with the gentleman from Ohio. What has been accomplished by this Commission in the last few months? How has this outfit lived for the last few months? Have they had money to spend? What have they been doing? ",1974
229,754,11,Mr. ASHLEY., We know that the legisation is necessary. ,1974
230,754,11,Mr. GROSS.," No, no. I am talking about their operations late last year and up to this point this year. What have they been living on? ",1974
231,754,11,Mr. ASHLEY., My understanding is that they have been working in cooperation with the Cost of Living Council and have been funded in part on the basis of supplementary appropriations. ,1974
232,754,11,Mr. GROSS.," From December 23 to February of 1974 I hear they have been · using temporary 60-day appointments, 10 from the staff were detailed Treasury and 10 to the Cost of Living Council because the outfit did not have enough money to run on. What is the story? How has this boondoggle been operating up to this point? ",1974
233,754,11,Mr. WIDNALL.," Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? ",1974
234,754,11,Mr. GROSS., I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. ,1974
235,754,11,Mr. WIDNALL.," Mr. Chairman, I believe what the gentleman stated is correct. I am not admitting it is a boondoggle because I believe it is not. They did use temporary 60-day appointments and the work has been very effective. Ten of the staff were detailed to Treasury and 10 to the Cost of Living Council from December 23 through February 1974. ",1974
236,754,11,Mr. GROSS.," Where do they get money to operate if they have accomplished anything, and I do not believe they have, in the last few months? ",1974
237,754,11,Mr. WIDNALL.," In February 1974 to the present, the National Commission function as such was phased out. The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Iowa has expired. (By unanimous consent, Mr. GRoss was allowed to proceed for 3 additional minutes.) ",1974
238,754,11,Mr. WIDNALL.," Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield further, the Office of Productivity was created within the Cost of Living Council under authorities contained in the Economic Stabilization Act. Ten people were assigneq to this office. Temporary assignments were not renewed. Since April 30, the Cost of Living Council has been closing down under temporary authority. to ",1974
239,754,11,Mr. GROSS.," Yes, so they have been living hand to mouth and what in the world have they accomplished? And with respect to expenditures, no matter who paid the bill, what have they been accomplishing? ",1974
240,754,11,Mr. WIDNALL.," They have not been able to accomplish very much because of the opposition from the gentleman from Iowa and a few others, and because of that the Commission have been living hand to mouth. ",1974
241,754,11,Mr. GROSS.," The point is that they have not accomplished anything. I hear nothing except two or three Members arising from the State of California to claim they have accomplished anything of a tangible nature, and I am not convinced they have accomplished very much in that State. There is nothing in this report to show any record of accomplishment on the part of the Commission. There is no recommendation on the part of any other agency or department of the Government that this outfit ought to be continued. ",1974
242,754,11,Mr. ROUSSELOT.," Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? ",1974
243,754,11,Mr. GROSS., I yield to the gentleman from California. ,1974
244,754,11,Mr. ROUSSELOT.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am happy to report to the gentleman that there are other areas of the country that have benefited from this Commission. I want to show the gentleman a report I hold in my hand that has produced a good resume of their 1973 activity. On page 53 they discuss the work of this Commission with the Chicago Construction Coordinating Committee which was set up in the city of Chicago to deal with and wrestle with the problems of increased productivity in the construction field. They made recommendations to that committee. I can acknowledge the gentleman that the building industry in the city of Chicago has acknowledged that this has been helpful in trying to put a better handle on productivity in the construction industry in Chicago; so that the answer to the gentleman's guestion is that this was a specific activity. It did not just come into play spontaneously. ",1974
245,754,11,Mr. GROSS.," We have Commissions, Councils, and advisory boards running out of our ears in this Government. ",1974
246,754,11,Mr. ROUSSELOT., I understand that. ,1974
247,754,11,Mr. GROSS., Why must we spend $5 million or even $2.5 million more on still another Commission when we have them running out of our ears? We have a Labor Department that ought to be interested in productivity. What in the world are we doing with another outfit of this kind for the taxpayers to pay for and wet nurse? ,1974
248,754,11,Mr. ROUSSELOT., Will the gentleman yield further? ,1974
249,754,11,Mr. GROSS., Yes. I yield further the gentleman from California. ,1974
250,754,11,Mr. ROUSSELOT., I could not agree with the gentleman more. I think there are an awful lot of unnecessary commissions in this Government. I joined him in the past in opposing continuation of many of these. to to ,1974
251,804,11,Mr. HANRAHAN.," Mr. Speaker, Americans have been quite pleased with the discontinuance of the Economic Stabilization Act. This expired on April 30 to the pleasure of most citizens. I wish to insert the following article which appeared in the Chicago Tribune for the benefit of my colleagues. [From the Chicago Tribune, May 4, 1974] Goon RIDDANCE TO CONTROLS Few Americans are mourning the passing of the nation's first--and perhaps last--experience with peacetime controls on wages and prices. Not many are celebrating, either, because they are busy coping with the ""double-digit inflation,"" which means inflation at a rate of 10 per cent or more and which is, in part, a legacy of the controls. Barely had the Economic Stabilization Act expired before Harry Bridges called his west coast longshoremen out on a brief strike to emphasize their demand for a 30 per cent an hour cost-of-living raise in wages. Major copper producers didn't even wait. They increased the price for copper cathode by 12 cent to 30 cents a pound, American Express Co. increased its annual credit card fee by $5 and said the new $20 fee will apply to renewal cards expiring in early summer. No doubt other companies and labor unions will seek price increases and wage increases in the weeks ahead. They will rationalize their actions by arguing that the controls limited their ability to keep pace with rising costs and prices. As a result the nation will face an additional bulge in postcon trol prices and wages. John T. Dunlop, director of the Cost of Living Council, has warned that contrary to the expectation of many adminstration economists, inflation in the second half of 1974 will not show much improvement from the first half. If he is right, the inflationary spiral for all of 1974 is likely to exceed the 8 per cent rate set last year. Unless business and labor leaders act ""responsibly"" in a control-free economy, President Nixon told the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, ""the demand for controls will again come up and be reflected in the Congress."" . The gross national product in real terms dropped nearly 6 per cent in the first quarter, while inflation by the broadest measure climbed more than 10 per cent. Clearly a continuation of this pattern will lead to a recession that will throw thousands out of SALUTE TO GAYLE T. MARTIN HON. ALPHONZO BELL OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, May 14, 1974 ",1974
252,804,11,Mr. BELL.," Mr. Speaker, on Thursday evening, May 23, at Lococo's Restaurant in Manhattan Beach, a testimonial dinner will be held for my friend, Gayle Martin, the city manager of Manhattan Beach. Gayle Martin was born in Alva, Okla., and grew up in western Colorado where he attended grade school and high school. He attended the University of Colorado where he received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1940. He later attended the University of Michigan under a Navy postgraduate program studying naval architecture. He received his M.S. degree in public administration from the University of Denver in 1952. Mr. Martin started his professional career as an engineer with the Babcock & Wilcox Co., where he worked until entering the Navy in 1942. He received a direct commission as an ensign and reported for active duty in September 1942. He served on active duty in a number of assignments until September 1949, when he returned to inactive duty only to be recalled to active duty for the Korean war to serve until June 1952. While on active duty Mr. Martin rose to the rank of lieutenant commander. After his release to inactive duty he remained active in the Naval Reserve and progressed rapidly in rank with his military career being climaxed by his selection as a rear admiral in February 1968. Admiral Martin maintained a very active status in the Naval Reserve until his retirement on June 30, 1973, culminated 31 years of duty with the NavY. Mr. Martin's career in city management started in Phoenix, Ariz., where he took a 1-year internship in city management in the office of the city manager. His first appointment as a city manager came in November 1952, in Deerfield, Ill. In 1954 he became manager at Maywood, Ill., and in November 1956, he was appointed as city manager in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where he has served for the last 1 7 % years. ",1974
253,1004,11,Mr. GURNEY.," Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. PELL). ",1974
254,1004,11,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, I have studied the amendment of the Senator from Indiana. What disturbs me is the emphasis on the words ""de jure."" I remember the discussion on the Stennis amendment and all the wounds that were opened up then, which I had hoped had been laid to rest, and which would be opened up again by the words ""de jure."" If it were ""de jure"" and ""de facto,"" it would be different. For that reason I feel compelled vote against the amendment. ",1974
255,1004,11,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, I would be glad to change it to include all segregation, but the reason the words ""de jure"" were emphasized is that only de jure segregation has been dealt with by the courts, or by Congress, as far as that is concerned. ",1974
256,1004,11,Mr. PELL., I think reference to it does open up many wounds that we had hoped were almost healed over. ,1974
257,1004,11,Mr. GURNEY.," Mr. President, I would like to point out that in Indianapolis, one of the principal cities of the State of the author of this amendment, the Court plan would take 20,000 students out of Indianapolis and send them into the suburbs, many miles outside the city, at a cost of many millions of dollars. In addition, this Court plan proposes to close down a total of 29 elementary and high schools, all under the Supreme Court plan. This amendment, this substitute proposed by the Senator from Indiana, will not do anything to stop that business at all. My amendment will stop that business because what it is designed to do is to preserve neighborhood schools and stop massive busing all around Indianapolis. I say that this is a probusing amendment. It refuses to allow the Senate to face up to its duty and vote up or down on the question of whether we will have neighborhood schools or will have busing. to I get the message extremely clearly that the Senator from Indiana does not agree with my amendment. However, he has a simple way of expressing himself on that, because he can vote nay on that amendment when it comes up, and allow other Senators to vote as they desire on the amendment yes or no, instead of resorting to this ploy. I think the Senator from Tennessee used a little better expression when he used the term ""copout."" · However, this kind of amendment, which has no meaning at all, and is entirely meaningless, is designed to prevent the Senate from voting for a good, broad antibusing, neighborhood school amendment. ",1974
258,1004,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The time of the Senator has expired. The Senator from Indiana has 5 minutes remaining. ,1974
259,1004,11,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator from Florida. He has great wisdom. However, I suggest to him that he should confine himself to what has happened in the State of Florida, not to what has happened in the State of Indiana. As a matter of fact, I have spent a good deal of time and studied the problems of Indiana a little more closely than did my friend the Senator from Florida. I suppose that if I were going to ""cop out,"" as the distinguished Senator from Tennessee calls it, I would vote for the Gurney amendment. That would make many people in Indianapolis happy. That would make the school board happy. They were not opposed to busing when they were busing black children past white schools and white children past black schools. I think that situation is bad whether it is in Florida, Tennessee, or Indiana. My amendment would apply in the instance of Indianapolis, in the inner city of Indianapolis, the Indianapolis public school system. All my amendment would do would be to instruct the Indianapolis school board to come up with a plan to provide for integrated schools, a plan that uses as small an amount of busing as possible, and to explore and study the situation with respect to providing a plan that would result in adequate, integrated education. ",1974
260,1004,11,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Colby King, Terry Barnett, and Quincy Rogers, a member of the staff of the Judiciary Committee, be granted the privilege of the floor during the debate. ",1974
261,1004,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without objection, it is so ordered. ",1974
262,1004,11,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, I think it is rather obvious what the Senator from Tennessee is after, because I have studied that constitutional amendment that has been advertised around my State and all over the country as being an antibusing amendment. It does not even contain the word ""busing."" It does not contain the word ""transportation."" It goes back to the old segregation system that we fought a civil war to prohibit. Maybe the Senator from Tennessee can support that as an antibusing constitutional amendment. the However, I cannot accept it. Under his plan, nobody would get equal opportunity. The· amendment may gain votes for some Senators. Talk about a copout, I am not the one who is copping out. ",1974
263,1004,11,Mr. BROCK.," Mr. President, will Senator yield? ",1974
264,1004,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Indiana has 2 minutes remaining. There is no other time available. Does the Senator from Indiana yield back his time? ,1974
265,1004,11,Mr. BAYH.," No; if I have 2 minutes remaining, I will use it. I will use it to suggest that if my voice got a little loud when directed at the Senator from Tennessee or the Senator from Florida, I hope that they will not interpret that as an assault on their integrity or on their desire to do what they think they are accomplishing. I happen to think that their amendment is designed not to stop busing, but to give the school boards the tools to take us back 100 years. I do not want separate-but-equal anything. ",1974
266,1004,11,Mr. GURNEY.," Mr. President, will the Senator yield? ",1974
267,1004,11,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Florida. ",1974
268,1004,11,Mr. GURNEY.," Mr. President, I certainiy did not think that the Senator from Indiana was assaulting· my integrity. I did think that he was assaulting my amendment. ",1974
269,1004,11,Mr. BAYH., The Senator from Florida is exactly right. ,1974
270,1004,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The question now recurs on the amendm'ent. ,1974
271,1004,11,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. ",1974
272,1004,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Is there a sufficient second? (Putting the question.) There is not a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were not ordered. ,1974
273,1004,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The question now recurs on the amendment of the Senator from Indiana (Mr. BAYH). ,1974
274,1004,11,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry. ",1974
275,1004,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator will state it. ,1974
276,1004,11,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, in the unanimous consent request, was this amendment not located, as far as a vote is concerned, just prior to the vote on the Gurney amendment, to take place at 5 o'clock? ",1974
277,1004,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator is correct. ,1974
278,1004,11,Mr. GURNEY.," Mr. President, as I recall, we attempted to work out a unanimous-consent request. However, I do not think that we ever did. Is that correct? ",1974
279,1004,11,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Chair is advised that there is a unanimous-consent agre·ement. The question now recurs on the amendment of the Senator from Florida. Who yields time? ,1974

282,1104,11,Mr. WOLFF.," Mr. Speaker, another black mark of shame and outrage was written into the history books this morn-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS ing in the Middle East. Another ""guerrilla action,"" another challenge to all decent human instinct. What words can react strongly enough to the mass slaughter of the schoolchildren of Maalot, Israel? What steps can civilized humanity take to eliminate the terror that these beasts have again wrought? T~se events are beyond comprehension. Even to accept the label of ""guerrillas"" for the perpetrators is to dignify them. They are butchers-the basest form of humanity. In view of recent history and the condemnation of Israel acceded to by our country in the United Nations, what other course is now open to the United States but for once to take a firm position of moral leadership and outraged indignation? The children of Maalot were in no sense participants in any declared or undeclared war. They were victims of a depraved band who do a disservice to the Palestinian people. So now those nations who harbor such cutthroats must be put on notice that such acquiescence will no longer be tolerated by the community of nations-they will be brought to account. And to those who would seek to repeat such actiOn.s-they must know that retribution from the civilized world will swiftly follow. May 15, 197 4 they have visited such places as the Everglades, Fla.; the Appalachian Mountains; Isle Royale, Lake Superior; Padre Island, Tex., and parts of Wyoming. The final wilderness trip planned by Scoutmaster Moran is scheduled to get underway on July 5, 1974, in central Wyoming. When they return, Charles Moran will look at his Trailblazer Award, his Golden Arrow Award, and his other memorabilia-with few regrets. Mr. Speaker, although he is stepping aside as scoutmaster and will be succeeded by Dr. Joseph D. Schleicher of Lake Bluff, he will remain on the troop committee as executive director of the parents committee. Also, he will continue to operate his electrical business. Mr. Speaker, Charles Moran has gained the respect and genuine affection of campers and noncampers of all ages and generations, and is known by all to be a thoughtful, kind, generous, and compassionate human being, as well as devoted husband of the charming and totally supportive June Moran. I am proud to salute Charles Moran for his unselfish and invaluable contribution to the development of over 1,400 scouts, who are a source of strength and pride to our Nation, and I wish him much happiness and good health in the years ahead. LAKE BLUFF HONORS SCOUTMASTER CHARLES MORAN HON. ROBERT McCLORY OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, May 15, 1974 Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Speaker, having served some years ago as scoutmaster of Boy Scout Troop 42 in my home town of Lake Bluff, Ill., I have been particularly pleased to learn that Saturday, May 18, 1974, has been officially declared ""Charles Moran Day"" in honor of Scoutmaster Charles Moran. Mr. Speaker, for 20 years Charles Moran has been a central :figure of troop 42, of the North Shore Area Council, Boy Scouts of America. During these 20 years, the troop has flourished and membership has grown from 50 scouts to approximately 70 scouts today. Mr. Speaker, Scoutmaster Moran is a lifelong lover of the wilderness. After serving as an Oregon lumberjack, he became a dealer in-and repairman of major electrical appliances. Today Charles Moran is the proprietor of Moran Appliances in Lake Bluff. Mr. Speaker, in addition to training hundreds of other boys in scouting, Charlie Moran has reared his own two sons, Mike and Terry, in the scouting traditions. During this time, he has exhibited uncommon imagination, fortitude, unique skills and qualities of wholesomeness in his leadership of scouting. He has shared his experiences with the Boy Scouts, age 11 to 14 years, accompanying them on various wilderness trips across the country. With 30 or more boys and 4 or 5 adult assistants, RESOLUTION TO END DEPLETION ALLOWANCE HON. WILLIAM J. GREEN OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, May 15, 1974 ",1974
283,1104,11,Mr. GREEN of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker, the Democratic Caucus today passed a resolution requiring Democrats on the House Rules Committee ti) make in order my amendment to the Oil and Gas Energy Tax Act of 1974. I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this resolution and my amendment which will end the oil and gas depletion allowance as of January 1, 1974. The Congress is now one step closer to meaningful tax reform. In 1974 oil company profits are expected to be approximately $9 billion, more than double 1973's record levels. The Ways and Means Committee bill phases out the percent depletion allowance over 3 years, with no phaseout in 1974, and provides various exemptions and exclusions that would continue for many oil producers until 1979. The bill would impose only a $670 million windfall profits tax in 1974. My amendment will raise an additional $2.6 billion. Following is the text of the resolution adopted by the Democratic Caucus and my amendment to end the depletion allowance. RESOLUTION OFFERED BY MR. GREEN OF PENNSLYVANIA Be it resolved, That the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and the Democratic Members of the House Committee on Rules a.re hereby instructed by the Democratic Caucus to seek and vote !or, respectively, a. Modified Closed Rule !or consideration of R.R. 14462, the on and Gas Energy ",1974
284,1154,11,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, on April 16, 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in Arnett against Kennedy. It is but the latest in a line of cases dealing with the problem of termination or suspension of Federal employees in the competitive service. These cases are noted primarily for their failure to answer the important and ultimate question whether Federal employees have a protected right to their jobs after completing the probationary period, that is, whether they can be terminated or suspended without a prior hearing on the merits. The opinion in Arnett against Kennedy is similarly ambiguous on the question and offers little hope for a person looking for a clear statement of his rights. The courts are not entirely to blame. The law is unclear because Congress has not acted unequivocally regarding pretermination hearings. There is no statute which clearly mandates executive agencies to promulgate uniform regulations in the area. The law as it now stands leaves the whole matter of pretermination hearings for Federal employees up in the air and opens the door to agency abuse of employees who in good conscience criticize agency procedures or disclose agency wrongs and coverups. There are well known cases: for instance, those of Ernest Fitzgerald and Gordon Rule, employees of the Federal Government who have spoken out, been fired, and eventually won their rights to back pay and reinstatement. These cases, however, have involved employees in difficult fights and drawn out period without pay. Some agencies grant pretermination hearings; but many others do not. In those an employee must suffer without pay while he is waiting to be heard. For sure, our veterans now have a preference right to a hearing before termination, and some Federal employees, through contract, have a similar right. Many others, though, are without this fundamental protection. Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I am today introducing a bill called the Federal Employee Administrative Hearing Rights Guarantee Act. The purpose of this legislation is to guarantee all employees in the competitive service a prompt evidentiary hearing by an impartial individual prior to the time that removal or suspension without pay is effective. The bill declares that certain minimum protections are due such an employee before termination or suspension, among them, the right to see the evidence supporting the action and to have a transcript of the proceedings_ I share the opinion of the many unions representing Federal employees who have contacted me--among them the National Treasury Employees Union and the Overseas Education Association-that it is time for congressional action on this problem.

290,1254,11,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, I again thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking Republican member (Mr. JAVITs) for their cooperation. I want to can attention to the fact that this amendment is cosPonsored by Senators STAFFORD and MATHIAS. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1338, submitted for printing yesterday, for myself, my colleague on the Labor and Public Welfare Committee (Mr. STAFFORD), and the Senator from Maryland (Mr. MATHIAS), to the pending measure, 1.539, the proposed Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments of 1974. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Education (Mr. PELL) and the ranking minority member of the committe (Mr. JAVITs) for their able and dedicated leadership on this most complex and far-reaching measure. Mr. President, the amendment I am submitting would add a new subsection to section 524 of the reported bill, which section I authored in committee with, as to various parts, Senators STAFFORD, JAVITS, and RANDOLPH, to make certain improvements in the veterans cost-ofinstruction program-VCI. Mr. President, the VCI program-a provision I authored in the Higher Education Amendments of 1972-Public Law 92-318-was designed to provide incentives and supporting funds for colleges and universities to recruit actively returning veterans and to establish the kinds of special programs and services necessary to assist many veterans in readjusting to an academic setting. Although some 1,000 VCI programs have been successfully implemented at many institutions of higher education across the country, the limited funds which the Office of Education has made available, and certain provisions of the law have made it particularly difficult for many colleges to establish programs which meet all the requirements of the law. Consequently, during committee consideration of s. 1539, I joined with Senators RANDOLPH, JAVITS, and STAFFORD in offering various amendments to the VCI ,provision. Section 524 of S. 1539, as . reported, amends the VCI program provision-section 420 of the Higher Education Act of 1965-in two basic respects: First, the amendment in the reported bill makes the first-year eligibility requirement slightly less restrictive by providing that in order to be eligible for VCI funds, a school must either have a 10-percent increase in its GI bill trainee enrollment-which is the present sole eligibility -criterion in terms of veteran enrollment-or have at least 10 percent of its undergraduate student body composed of GI bill trainees-a new alternative criterion. Second, the amendment in the reported bill would provide for a more equitable funding procedure for eligible schools to increase the amount many smaller qualifying institutions have been receiving, by limiting to $135,000 the maximum amount of payments in any fiscal year to any single institution. Funds which become available as a result of this provision would then be reapportioned to schools which would otherwise receive a payment of less than $9,000-the estimated minimum amount needed to open a full-time veterans affairs office on a campus. The reported amendment further establishes a minimum enrollment eligibility of 25 veterans in order to avoid the funding of VCI entitlements which are too small to provide effective services to campus veterans. Finally, the amendment, as reported, provides that not less than 75 percent of the amount of payments received by any institution shall be applied to setting up the special veterans offices, programs, and services required by the law. Current law requires that only 50 percent of the VCI award be applied to setting up these veteran's programs. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the appropriate pages from the committee report, pages 97-99-No. 93-763-be printed in the RECORD at this point: There being no objection, the excerpt . was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: SECTION 524. VETERANS COST OF INSTRUCTION PAYMENT AMENDMENTS Section 524 of the Committee bill proposes a series of amendments to section 420 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amendedthe Veterans-Cost-of-Instruction (VCI) Program provision. This program was designed to provide incentives and supporting funds for colleges and universities to recruit actively the returning veterans and to establish the kinds of special programs and services necessary to _ assist many veterans in readjusting to an academic setting. Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section 420 would be amended by adding an alternative prerequisite to institutional eligibility based on numbers of GI Bill enrollees. This amendment has already been adopted by the Senate as section 11 of S. 896, the Education for the Handicapped Amendments of 1973. The law presently requires that a school, to be eligible for a VCI grant, must have increased the number of its GI Bill trainees (including veterans receiving vocational rehabilitation under chapter 31 of title 38, United States Code, and those receiving educational assistance under chapter 34 of that title) by 10 percent over the previous academic year. Under the amendment, a school could also become eligible if at least 10 percent of its current undergraduate student body is composed of such GI Bill trainees. The new 10-percent requirement in the amendment would still impose a substantial requirement on an individual institution since the national average GI Bill trainee enrollment for universities, colleges, and community colleges is 8.7 percent. Preliminary figures indicate that this new clause will alleviate the inadvertent inequity of the present 10-percent-GI-Bill-trainee-increase requirement for a number of schools which have already made impressive achievements in enrolling returning veterans. It should be noted that mere numbers of GI Bill trainees would still not be enough to qualify for a VCI grant; under the law, a school must also establish and carry out significant special veterans programs, including a veterans affairs office, a veterans tutorial program, a veterans PREP or college prepatory program, and a veterans work/study outreach program. These requirements would not be affected by the amendment. A sample of schools in areas with about 25 percent of the Nation's population shows that of 1,296 schools surveyed, only 299, or 23 per cent, increased their GI Bill trainee enrollment in March 1973 by 10 percent over March 1972; 997 schools, or 76 percent, did not meet the 10-percent requirement, although of this 997, 134, or 13.4 percent, did show some increase in GI Bill trainee enroUment. Section 420(d) would be amended by providing a more equitable funding procedure for all eligible schools. The law presently requires the Commissioner to pay to each institution of higher education which has had an application approved under subsection ( c) of section 420, the amount to which it is entitled under this section. Any in· stitution meeting the requirement of the law is entitled to payments of up to $450 for each of certain categories of veterans enrolled in an undergraduate program on a full-time basis or who have, in prior academic years, been enrolled in certain special veterans education programs under the GI Bill. Although VCI programs have been successfully implemented at many institutions of higher education across the country, the limited funds which the Office of Education has m.ade available and certain provisions of the law have made it particularly difficult for many smaller colleges to establish programs which meet all the requirements of the law. The funding procedure established by this amendment, which adds a second sentence in subsection (d), would limit to $135,000 the maximum amount of payments 1n any fiscal year to any institution, or any branch of such institution located in a community different from that in which its parent institution is located. Reports received from schools which received VCI funding for this year led to the conclusion that even large schools with large numbers of veterans would be able to establish, and had, in fact, successfully operated, VCI programs utilizing about $100,000 of their VCI grants. Only 14 schools across the country received initial grnnts for academic yeal 1973-1974 of more than $135,000. Section 420 ( d) would be further amended by adding a new third sentence which would provide that, in making payments under section 420 in any fl.seal year, the Commissioner is required to apportion the funds which become available as a result of the new $135,-000 institutional payment limitation in such a manner as will result, first, in the receipt by each eligible institution of a total payment of at least $9,000 (or the amount of its entitlement for that fiscal year, whichever is less) and, then, additional amounts distributed to all eligible institutions up to the $136,000 maximum.

291,1304,11,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, May is Older Americans Month, a time when every American should consider the concerns of our Nation's 20 million citizens 65 yea.rs of age and older. Although we have made considerable progress over the few years toward improving the economic and social conditions of the elderly, much more remains to be done. This month I have proposed a number of legislative solutions to the problems facing our elderly citizens, and look forward to discussing and debating these measures with my colleagues. The theme this year is ""older Americans are a National Resource."" No where is this more evident than in an excellent profile of Ray W. Smith, president of the Chicago chapter of the American Association of Retired Persons, which appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times edition of Monday, May 13, 1974. Mr. Smith is a most enthusiastic and dedicated leader of the 314,000 members of AARP in Illinois. In the Sun-Times article, Mr. Smith discusses many of the concerns of his members, including the level of social security benefits and the earnings limitation. He also points out a number of the association's activities, among them the youth-age alliance, a program that brings together retired person with high school or college students to exchange ideas. I commend the Sun-Times, and reporter David Anderson, for bringing Mr. Smith's story, and AARP's efforts, to the public's attention and request unanimous consent that the article be printed in the RECORD at this time.

292,1354,11,Mr. EILBERG.," Mr. Speaker, the massacre at Maalot, in Israel, is a crime which can only be compared to the worst atrocities committed by the Nazis and it is vital that the United States react properly. There can be no recognition of these people as the legitimate representatives of any group other than a gang of murderers. Their actions represent nothing but killing for the sake of killing and their only objective can be to cause more death. The United States must take every possible action to force the gover:~n~ents which provide havens for these cr1mm~ls to change their policies. This must include the use of economic sanctions if nothing else works. Finally, it is clear that the United Nations resolution of April 24 which condemned only Israel without even mentioning the murders at Qiryat Shmona EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS was taken as a sign of weakness on the part of the United States by the terrorists. I am supporting the resolution introduced by the majority leader and the minority leader which calls upon the President to have our ambassador to the United Nations introduce a Security Council resolution condemning the massacre in Maalot. But, Ambassador Scali's instructions must also include an order to veto any resolution concerning this situation which does not indict the terrorists for their acts. · The United States must never again even appear to be in the position of supporting the actions of the Arab terrorists. CONGRESSMAN McCLORY URGES ACTION ON METRIC CONVERSION HON. JOHN B. ANDERSON OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 16, 1974 · ",1974
293,1354,11,Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, our colleague from Illinois, Congressman BoB McCLORY, has long been a proponent of programs designed to convert our system of weights and measures to the international metric system. Recently, Mr. McCLORY participated as the luncheon speaker at a metric seminar in New York City sponsored and chaired by my constituent, Kenyon Y. Taylor, president of the Regal-Beloit Corp. of South Beloit, Ill.which is also in my 16th Illinois Congressional District. Mr. Speaker, American industry is converting rapidly to the metric system, and our Nation alone among the industrial nations of the world has yet to establish an official program of comprehensive and coordinated conversion to a system of metric measurements. Congressman BoB MCCLORY, who took an active part in the recent debates on the floor of this Chamber, in which the House unfortunately refused to suspend the rules and pass the Metric Conversion Act of 1973, summarized the legislative situation at the recent metric seminar in New York City. Mr. Speaker, some 200 business and financial representatives were in attendance at the metric seminar held last Friday, May 10, at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York City. I am anxious for our colleagues to have the benefit of Congressman BoB McCLORY's timely and pertinent remarks which follow: REMARKS BY CONGRESSMAN ROBERT MCCLORY REGARDING CURRENT METRIC LEGISLATION In coming to you today to report on the status of metric conversion legislation, I probably don't have much better news than is being received in the White House these days regarding the status of Congressional action affecting the President. It is entirely possible that we have underestimated the general opposition to metric legislation. On the other hand, it may be that we-in the Congress of the U.S.-have failed to serve the interests of the people of the Nation by neglecting to provide a practical and workable program for a comprehensive and essentially voluntary conversion of most segments of our society to the metric system of weights and measures. I am sure you are May 16, 1974 all aware of the three-year study conducted by the National Bureau of Standards, under legislation passed by the Congress in 1968. It is quite inaccurate to suggest that this study was slanted or in any way deficient in its analysis of the current situation in the world and in our nation regarding the impact of the metric system on our economy and our society. The report suggests the urgent need for adopting some reasonable means for a changeover to the International Metric System. Indeed, the first recommendation was the simple and straightforward statement that ""the U.S. change to the International Metric System deliberately and carefully."" Now, along with other recommendations, the report recommended that any changeover costs shall ""lie where they fall."" Indeed, it was stated flatly that this would encourage efficiency and minimize the overall cost to society. The report called for a coordinated national program. As many of you know, I have endeavored to carry out these recommendations consistent with the conversion to metric measurements, which is occurring in this countrysteadily and rapidly, even-without any legislative mechanism whatever. The great volume of literature on the issue takes account of the rapid movement toward the metric system in our schools, in our industry, and in our daily lives. When street signs report automobile speeds and distances in terms of kilometers, when skis, cameras, film, eyeglasses, pharmaceuticals, sporting events, and contents of packages on grocery store shelves are labeled in terms of metric weights and measures, we are well on the road toward a comprehensive changeover to metric measurements. What is truly astounding is that voices that purport to speak in behalf of millions of Americans in business and labor have made grossly exaggerated estimates of costs and have asserted their special interests in seeking to defeat legislation intended to aid all Americans. It ha.s never been my view that the Federal government should compel conversion to the metric system. On the other hand, it would seem to be one of the most appropriate functions of the Federal government to provide either the mechanism or the vehicle by which the private and public sectors of our nation might voluntarily-and in an orderly and coordinated and deliberate way-proceed with a comprehensive metric conversion program. My individual position and that of some 25 or so of my colleagues as embodied in H.R. 10720, would have established a metric conversion board small in number with rather broad authority to work with advisory groups and private trade associations and others to help coordinate their individual conversion programs. But from the outset-and particularly in some parts of the 1972 legislative proposal-there were provisions for large-scale Federal subsidies, grants and loans and other provisions quite inconsistent with a voluntary program in which the costs are supposed to ""lie where they fall."" It may be that a certain amount of the momentum, which developed after the metric study report was issued in July, 1971, was lost during the period-between then and now. During the intervening period, organized labor interests--and private interests involving some industry-have developed their own ideas in connection with the form and scope of Federal Government involvement in the changeover to metric standards. The size of the proposed metric conversion board has been expanded, delays involving development of some kind of comprehensive plan have been embraced by a great many proponents of this legislation, and provisions have been added to require future legislative, as well as executive action in order to implement any program whatever. It would be very easy today to lay the entire blame on organized labor for the dis-",1974

298,4,16,Mr. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker, it is becoming more and more evident that some members of the construction trades are demanding and receiving some very large wage increases this year. Mr. Speaker, as I recall, the last great surge of inflation in 1970 and 1971, and the thing that finally brought about the imposition of wage and price controls was a similar move in the construction trades industry. Mr. Speaker, I think the country should be reminded that the Members of Congress, themselves, rejected a wage increase last year in order to set an example for the rest of the country. Mr. Speaker, unless members of these trade unions wish to force another imposition of wage and price controls, with the distortions and hardships which inevitably result on our economy, I would urge them to be reasonable in their negotiations to avoid the creation in our country of those problems that will be brought about by a new imposition of wage and price controls.

300,4,16,Mr. MAHON.," Mr. Speaker, it was determined earlier this year that in light of the energy crisis the Congress would undertake to respond by taking early and decisive action on energy appropriation matters. Instead of having the energy appropriations spread through seven appropriation bills as would have been the normal procedure we would have only one comprehensive energy appropriation bill. We would bring them all together in one package and pass the appropriation prior to the beginning of the fiscal year July 1, 1974, in order that the various agencies and the departments of Government might proceed as rapidly and efficiently as possible with these energy programs. Also, by providing these appropriations in a single bill, rather than in seven bills as would otherwise be the case, we could gain an overview of the thrust of the Federal energy research and development effort. The subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations developed this bill, and they have done an excellent job in the conduct of hearings, the review of budget estimates, and the recommendation of funding levels. They have had to increase the speed of their hearings and to work nuch harder and longer, on top of an already crowded schedule, in order to have this bill before you at this early date. The seven subcommittees that developed this bill are as follows: The Agriculture, Environmental, and Consumer Protection Subcommittee headed by the gentleman from :Mississippi <Mr. WHIT· TEN), the ranking minority member be· ing the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. ANDREWS); The HUD, Space, Science, and Veterans Subcommittee, headed by the gentleman from Massachusetts <Mr. BoLAND), the ranking minority member on that subcommittee being the gentleman from California (Mr. TALCOTT); The Interior Subcommittee, headed by the gentlewoman from Washington <Mrs. HANSEN), the ranking minority member being the gentleman from Pennsylvania <Mr. McDADE) ; The Public Works, AEC Subcommittee, headed by the gentleman from Tennessee <Mr. EviNS), the ranking minority member being the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DAVIS) ; The State, Justice, Commerce, and Judiciary Subcommittee, headed by the gentleman from New York <Mr. RooNEY), the ranking minority member being the gentleman from Michigan <Mr. CEDERBERG) ; The Transportation Subcommittee, headed by the gentleman from California <Mr. McFALL), the ranking minority member being the gentleman from Mas-sachusetts <Mr. CONTE); and The Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Subcommittee, headed ",1974
301,54,16,Mr. STEVENSON.," Mr. President, I have read with grave concern recent news reports from the Soviet Union that security police have arrested at least 50 Soviet Jews in preparation for President Nixon's visit. The Soviet leaders apparently believe that by making these arrests and increasing their harassment of individuals they will be able to prevent demonstrations and appeals to the President by their Jewish citizens who want to emigrate. In· addition, security police have arrested and harassed several Jewish scientists, who have been planning a ""scientific seminar"" scheduled to be held in Moscow with foreign scientists, including several Nobel Prize winners, beginning July 1. The purpose of the ""seminar"" is to help Soviet scientists, who have been fired from their jobs because they applied to emigrate, remain current with scientific knowledge. The Soviet leaders have made a serious miscalculation. They may succeed in pre-. venting President Nixon and members of his party from seeing any demonstrations, but, in doing so, they have drawn world attention to the desperate plight of Soviet Jews. They have also cast a shadow over the President's visit. The recent arrests and harassment of Soviet Jews have only intensified the commitment of the American people to help those tens of thousands of human beings who ask only the right to emigrate to the country of their choice-a fundamental human right affirmed more than 25 years ago by the United Nations in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. President Nixon in regrettable remarks at Annapolis may have encouraged Soviet leaders to conclude that the plight of Soviet Jewry is not a concern of the United States. If so, they are wrong. The Soviet leaders should not forget that the Congress has before it both the Stevenson-Jackson amendment to the Export-Import Bank Act and the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Reform Act, and that events in the Soviet Union will have a significant impact on how the Congress deals with both of these provisions. On the eve of his trip to the Soviet Union, I urge the President to intercede on behalf of those Soviet Jews who have been arrested and harassed in anticipation of his visit, and to protest these activities to Soviet leaders. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article in today's Washington Post by Robert Kaiser, which describes in detail the recent arrests and harassment of Soviet Jews, be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Washington Post, June 24, 1974] SOVIET JEWS HARASSED BEFORE VISIT (By Robert G. Kaiser) Moscow, .rune 23.-Most Soviet citizens wUl not be personally affected by this week's Soviet-American summit talks here, but for one small group the visit has already prompted a widespread harassment campaign. They are the Jewish dissidents who want to emigrate to Israel. According to Jewish sources here, the Jewish Section of the KGB, or security police, has already arrested at least 50 Jews in various parts of the Soviet Union, all in connection with President Nixon's visit. In some cases the security police have made their arrests quietly. In others they have tracked down Jews in country retreats where they had gone in hopes of avoiding arrest. Some arrests-such as that of engineer Vladimir Slepak-have been violent. The police broke down two doors in Slepak's apartment before taking him away Thursday morning, according to his son. Slepak had spent 15 days in jail at the time of President Nixon's last visit here in 1972. In Moscow, some prominent ""refusedniks"" (the name those who have been refused permission to emigrate call themselves) are being trailed around town, some by as many a.s four KGB men. The police apparently want to head off any demonstrations by Jewish activists during the Nixon visit, or any other u.nseemingly event. They appear especially concerned · about a. scientific ""seminar"" that several Jewish scientists wanted to hold here with distinguished foreign scholars beginning July 1. There have been instances in the past when Jewish activists staged demonstrations to attract the interest of famous visitors which may help explain the police attitude now. The KGB also seems to be upholding an old Russian tradition-far older than the Communist government-by taking preventive action to avoid disruptions of important events. ""When my father was a. young student in Petersburg before the revolution,"" one of toda.y's Jewish activists recalled recently, ""the Czarist police used to pick them up, with the other Jewish boys, right before Easter. 'We don't want you ruining our Easter,' the pollee warned them."" Warnings play a. big part in the current crackdown. Several activists-Alexander Voronel, for instance-have been arrested in the morning, lectured all day and released in the evening. Voronel is one of the scientists who was trying to organize the scientific seminar with foreign scholars, including several Nobel Prize winners. The Soviets are hoping to prevent the meeting from taking place by not issuing visas to the foreigners who have expressed interest in the idea, and by arresting or otherwise dissuading the Soviet Jews who planned to take part. The original idea of the seminar was to help scientists who have been fired from their jobs because they applied to emigrate. It would give them an opportunity to present serious papers and meet with competent colleagues. The police have threatened some jews with prosecution for treason if they take part in the seminar, according to Jewish sources. When making these threats, the police reportedly said that treason was possible since the seminar was conceived by enemies of the country. The scientists involved in the seminar, like virtually all the Jews being harassed a.t the moment, have been waiting for months or years for permission to emigrate to Israel. They are among the small but substantial group that the Soviet authorities refuse to let go. One of them is Vitali Rubin, a. scholar whose specialty is Chinese philosophy of the fifth to third centuries B.C. though Soviet officials have repeatedly told American politicians and diplomats that only those Jews who had access to state secrets are refused permission to emigrate, Rubin has been waiting more than two years for an exit visa.. Gen. Shukayev, a. top-ranking official of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, told Rubin's wife, Ina, last week that Rubin's colleagues said his knowledge was unique and could be valuable to the state. His knowledge of Confucius, the general said might be used for hostile purposes if he left the country. ""It's ridiculous,"" Rubin said in a.n interview. ""In America there are 20 scholars who know as much as I do about Confucius."" Rubin and his wife are being followed by four plain-clothesmen. ""Saturday they came to the synagogue with us,"" he said. But other Jews waiting for exit vias, including some prominent ones, are being left alone by the police. It appears that the KGB is mainly concerned with organizers of the seminar a.nd Jews who had earlier staged public protest demonstrations (although Rubin is in neither category). The refusedniks who have not been apprehended appear to be maintaining their normal channels of communication~although the authorities have cut off the telephones of almost every one of them, apparently to prevent conversations with Jewish groups abroad. These Jews listen avidly to foreign radio broadcasts, hoping to hear that news of their arrests and protests is reaching the West, and their own countrymen through Russianlanguage radios from abroad. Several Moscow Jews complained bitterly that the Voice of America pays the least attention to their problems of all the Western radio stations broadcasting to the Soviet Union. ""They are helping their government, and therefore helping our government, too,'' one Jew said of VOA. This activist was partciularly angry about what he felt was a. VOA distortion of a letter released last week by 80 Jews, asking President Nixon not to ""help your partners in the Moscow talks to make our difficult situation here an unbearable one,"" and criticizing the President for failing to help them in the past. This Jew thought the VOA make the letter sound like a request to Nixon not to discuss the Soviet Jews' plight at all. Although most of the refusedniks seem to maintain good spirits, they sometimes waver. Some are afraid of the police. One told the story of Sanya. Lipavsky, a Jewi!h doctor, who parked his car in front of a Jew's apartment house that was being carefully watched by plainclothesmen. When Lipa.vsky left he drove onto a. main Moscow thoroughfare, where his brakes suddenly failed. According to his friends he narrowly averted a serious accident. Later, he discovered that his brake fluid lines had been deliberately cut with pliers. THffiD U.N. CONFERENCE ON THE LAW OF THE SEAS ",1974
302,54,16,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, the lead editorial of the New York Times on June 17 included a statement that in the coming ",1974
303,304,16,Mr. HARRINGTON.," Mr. Chairman, I support passage of H.R. 14715, a bill to authorize and limit employment of White House personnel. In one sense, I am reluctant to approve any authorization for the White House staif. I cannot help but wonder if I will be paying the salary of yet another Egil Krogh, John Dean, John Erlichman, Bob Haldeman, and even Tony Ulasciwitz, none of whom in my opinion were among the greatest public officials ever to serve this country. Nevertheless, I am aware that in dealing with the abuses of the Nixon administration, Congress must not place undue restrictions on the office of the· Presidency and future Presidents. Clearly, the President needs competent staif to help him perform his duties. However, H.R. 14715 places needed limitations for the first time on the growth of the President's office that began almost from its inception and which has accelerattd out of control in the Nixon administration. Under the Nixon administration, the growth of the Executive office of the President has increased almost 400 percent over the last part of the Johnson administration. While there is nothing inherently wrong with the concept of growth in itself, when in the wrong place and at the wrong rate, uncontrolled growth must be controlled. For at least two reasons the growth of the Executive office must be halted. First, because of President Nixon's highly original but constitutionally questionable doctrine of executive privilege extending over the entire executive staif, each new executive position results in one more policymaking individual refusing any accountability to CollfJress or to the public at large. This extension of secrecy in Government must be stopped today in order that it may be reversed tomorrow. Second, the expansion of the Executive office staif has led to needless duplication of efforts with the existing Government agencies. H.R. 14715 is not going to end secrecy in the Nixon administration or eliminate duplication between the Executive office and the executive agencies. However, it is a step in the right direction. Through the bill, Congress for the first time authorizes employment of White House personnel rather than simply leaving White House staffing questions to the appropriation process. In addition, the bill will limit the number of professionals who can work in the White House office. The bill also stops the President from hiding top level executives in ungraded positions not subject to normal Civil Service controls. While the President has long had the authority to hire ungraded employees to enable the hiring of specialists, such as groundskeepers and French chefs, not falling within normal civil service classifications, President Nixon has distorted this authority to hire 70 top level officials in ungraded positions. Finally, the bill will put a limit on the length of time the White House may detail any single individual from another executive agency to work in the White House. Despite my support for the bill, in many ways I think the bill should go further. While the bill restricts staffing of the White House office, it fails to restrict staffing of the proliferating number of councils and miniature bureaucracies within the Executive office of the President. From 1970 to 1972 alone, nine new satellite offices, many of whose functions previously had been performed by staif assistants, were created in the Executive office of the President. Some of these offices-such as the Office of Telecommunications Policy which apparently attempts to influence the Federal Communications Commission-seem to have no legitimate function at all. The bill also fails to restrict the number of employees who can be detailed from executive agencies to the White House. While the bill does restrict the length of time that such employees may be detailed, it does not restrict the total number of employees who may be so detailed. Given that in 1971 the Nixon administration acknowledged detailing 273 employees from other agencies to the White House, this is a matter of considerable concern. In a related matter, the bill does not deal with the problem of what I call ""laundered people."" The White House must be prevented from placing high level policymakers at the White House on the payrolls of outside executive agencies when these individuals have never even served a day in the agency from which they are being paid. Another shortcoming of the bill is its failure to take precautions against the possibility of the spending of White House funds for transitional activities after the resignation or impeachment of a President or Vice President. When Vice President Agnew resigned, he remained on the White House payroll sorting out his papers for 6 months. This situation must be prevented from recurring in the future. In fact, while the bill does restrict to some extent the number of staif that the White House can hire, the bill places no restrictions on the type of activities that the White House must fund. Serious consideration must be given to restricting the White House from using the taxpayer's funds for anything other than governmental functions. Certainly, it is questionable as to whether Government funds should be used to defend the President from his alleged criminal activities. In conclusion, H.R. 14715 is a good bill as far as it goes. But the bill must be kept in perspective as only a beginning in controlling the expansion of the White House staif; considerably more must be done in the future. ",1974
304,304,16,Mr. DRINAN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment oft'ered by the gentleman from Texas <Mr. PICKLE). Since President Nixon assumed office in 1969, he has carried out an unprecedented expansion of the entire executive branch of Government and the White House Office in particular. The total number of full-time stat! positions in the White House Office more than doubled between 1970 and 1973, rising from 250 to 510. Many of these new positions were created at executive and professional levels. In addition, the President has made increasing use of his blanket authority to retain experts and consultants to supplement his staif on a temporary basis. Finally, in an effort to circumvent congressional authority to enact personnel appropriations for specific Federal agencies, the President continues to detail employees of various executive agencies on to his personal White House staff. At the present time, neither Congress nor the American taxpayer knows exactly who is working for the President and how much they are being paid. Seventynine full-time members of the White House staff have been exempted from civil service classification by the President. According to a staif report prepared for the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service under the direction of Congressman UDALL: The use of the ungraded position is one method for ""hiding"" personnel so that Congress and the public have no knowledge of what work is being done or by whom. We have all recently borne witness to the tragic consequences of a Presidential stat! which has grown so large that it has lost its sense of accountability to the Congress, the Constitution, and the American people. H.R. 14715, as reported by the committee, places no meaningful restrictions upon the continued expansion of the White House Office. The President will have continued authority to hire an unlimited number of outside ""experts and consultants"" and to transfer personnel from other executive agencies to his own staff without restraint. The amendment oft'ered by the gentleman from Texas places reasonable limits on these present sources of abuse. It reduces by 25 the number of highlevel positions on the White House staff. More importantly, it sets a specific limit on the number of temporary consultants the President can add to his staff and on the nwnber of employees he can transfer from other agencies to the White House staif. I believe that these ",1974
305,404,16,Mr. KOCH.," Mr. Speaker, I am appending material from Prof. Herman Schwartz' article entitled ""A Report on the Costs and Benefits of Electronic Surveillance--1972"" for the information of our colleagues: COST OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE 1969 THE PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT ATTEND THE SOVIET SUMMIT MEE;TING HON. ANGELO D. RONCALLO 0:' NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 25, 1974 Mr. RONCALLO of New York. Mr. Spea.ker, 50 Russian Jews have been arrested, some severely beaten, in anticipation of the President's trip to the U.S.S.R. This trip is not worth the brutalizing it might continue to cause to innocent Russian Jews. It is necessary for each of us to publicly raise our voices in protest at this latest barbaric threat to Soviet Jewry. I have cosponsored a resolution calling upon President Nixon to intervene on behalf of the 50 arrested Soviet citizens and to forgo the Soviet summit meeting until Russian leaders give their assurance that the President's visit will not be used as an excuse for the persecution of Soviet Jewry. The resolution follows: DRAFT OF RESOLUTION to Whereas we along with all Americans and freedom-loving people throughout the world are outraged over the Soviet Union's arrest in advance of the summit meeting of fifty Soviet dissidents involved in the movement to free Soviet Jews, and Whereas many of these persons involved have been severely beaten, harassed, and imprisoned, and Whereas such oppression 1s contrary international moraltty and the sanctity of basic human rights, and Whereas Soviet leaders have consistently stated that political harassment is outside Soviet law, and Whereas no successful detente can be established without assurance of the preservation of fundamental human rights which are basic tenets in the American tradition: Therefore be it Resolved, That it is the sense of the Congress that the President not attend the summit meeting until Soviet leaders provide assurances that this visit wm not be used as an excuse for intensified persecution of these herotc people struggling for basic human rights; and be it further Resolved, That it 1s the sense of the Congress that the President immediately inter-With the arrival of the Nixon administration, federal wiretapping and eavesdropping began. It started slowly in 1969, but by 1971 the federal government became the single most extensive eavesdropper. The states did not slack off, however, and as a result 1969 saw a sharp increase in the overall rate of law enforcement surveillance. 1. Federal survelllance. a. Authorizations and installations. The federal government made only 34 applications for electronic surveillance authority, of which 33 were granted and 30 installed. b. Offenses. Authorizations: G, 22; 1 D, 5; 1 H, 0; K, i; 0, 5. Installations: G, 20; D, 4; K, 1; 0, 5. This predominance of gambling-67%with drugs a weak second, has continued and indeed increased, as the summary shows. c. Place. Six of the 30 installations were in New York, and 6 in New Jersey-thus 40% were in just two states, a concentration that is repeated in the state figures. d. People. The Appendix figures indicate that some 4,256 people were overheard, an average of about 147; again the Ad_nin. Off. Rep. is somewhat dlfi'erent, but the differences are not great-an average of 152 and a total of 4,308. What is especially interesting, however, are the averages per installation, by offense: G, 101; D, 145; K, N.I.; 0, 332; All, 147. As will appear below, these contrast very sharply with the State averages, which are m.uch lower. e. Conversations. Adding up the conversations reportedly overhead as individually described in the Appendix, we get an overall total of 4:1,929, and an average of 1,446 conversations per installation, a few thousand conversations less than the 44,442 total derived from the Admin. Off. Rep. average of 1444.4 for the 30 installations. The breakdown of average number of conversations per installation, by offense, is as follows: . G, 1,512; D, 1,778; K, N.I.; 0, 921; All, 1,446. It will be noted that in 1969 more was overheard on drug installations than on gambling. This pattern shifted radically in future years, without any apparent explanation. f. Duration. Of the 30 installations, some 20 were less than 20 days-generally, the average period 1 The Admin. Off. Rep. summaries show 23 gambling and 4 drug applications. but this seems wrong, according to the individual statistics in the Append~x. June 25, 197 4 of time, including extensions, has been s:Jme 13 days. However, 3 of the gambling bstallations, 1 drug and 2 others were from 20 to 29 days, and 3 installations were from 30 to 59 days. 2. State survelllance. a. Authorizations and installations. By December 31, 1969, some nine states had authorized use of wiretapping, thoug!l Massachusetts did not report any usage in 1969; the ether states were Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgh, Maryland. New .Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. The:e states obtained 269 authorizatiOI!S and made 260 installations; there were 189 ex ten >ions. Here agsin, the Admin. Off. Rep. has a muc':l lower figure for installations: again this is because the Administrative Office improperly considers installations for which there are no reports of conversations and persons overheard, as not installed. b. Offenses. The relative proportions begin slowly to move toward an lncrea!;e in gambling and a corresponding decrease in the re:;t, particularly drugs. The 1969 individual Appendix figures show the following: Authorizations: G, 79; D, 85; H, 19: K, 1; 0, 85; All, 269. Installations: G, 78; D, 80; H, 19; K, 1; 0, 82; All, 260. c. Place. Again, New York accounts for the bulk of the interceptions, this time with New Jersey a distant but clear second: 191 orders were granted in New York and 45 in New Jersey. Within New York, a preponderance in some areas appears again. This time, Queens had 51 orders and some 49 installations; Brooklyn and the Bronx dropped to 19 and 23 respectively, from the prior year's 68 and 33, even though the time period was twice as long. Elsewhere, Maryland had 15 orders and installations, Arizona had 8 orders of which at least 5 were installed, Georgia had 5 orders and at least 2 were installed, Colorado and Florida each had 2 orders and 2 and 1 installed, respectively. and Rhode Island had one. d. Persons. There is a very great disparity between the figures computed from the Appendix and those in the Admin. Off. Rep. The 1971 ACLU Report indicated that some 26,876 people were overheard-this is the difference between the average number of people overheard, multiplied by the total number of installations for all 1969 survemances ( 116 X 271 =31,436) less the federal average multiplied by the federal total ( 152 X 30 = 4,560) . But adding up the total of the individual reports in the Appendix produces only 8,590 for some 214 installations, or an average of only 40, not the 112 indicated in the Admin. Off. Rep. Even if the 40 1s extrapolated to all 260, the total is still only 10,400. Tbe 40 figure seems the more plausible, since the 1969 figure was only 25 and, as will be seen below, the 1970 and 1971 state figures from the Appendix are 43 and 34 respectively. and from the Admin. Office, 39 and 33 respectively. For this reason, the overall average for all installations is not likely to have been I 12, as the Admin. Off. Rep. indicates, but about 50. As a result, the original 1969 state figure in the ACLU report was overstated bv A.bout 16,000. The breakdown of averages of people over-heard per installation by offense is as follows: G, 48; D, 27; H, 16; K, 19; 0, 54. e. Conversations. Here, the Appendix and Admin. Off. figures are close. The Appendix figures show 1213.452 conversations in 228 installations, or an average of 555 per installation, broken down by offense as follows: G, 525; D, 405; H, 1,100; K, 21; 0, 615: All, 555. Extrapolating this 550 average to the 260 installations, one arrives at 144,300, or about ",1974
306,504,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Alabama. ,1974
307,504,16,Mr. ALLEN.," Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, the chairman of the Finance Committee, for the motion that he has made, that the pending bill (H.R. 14832) be recommitted to the Finance Committee with instructions forthwith to return the bill to the Senate shorn of the pending amendment. That then would bring back a clean, unamended bill, just exactly as it came to us from the House of Representatives. Mr. President, that is what the Senator !rom Alabama has been seeking for the last 8 or 10 days, and this conclusion would have been available to the Senate and to the proponents of this package at any time. The Senator from Alabama is a strong supporter of tax reduction and tax reform, at the proper time and using the proper vehicle. He does not believe that the time to reduce taxes is at a time when the inflation rate in this country is running somewhere around 13 percent, and he feels that a reduction at this time would only add to the fires of inflation and that it would not be in the public interest. The very people that the tax package of the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Massachusetts presented to the Senate would, in the judgment of the Senator from Alabama, actually cost the people that it sought to help more than it saved them. So the tax package would not have been in the interest of the taxpayers. Further, the so-called tax reform and tax reduction offered mighty little tax reduction to the average citizen. The bill before us at the present time provides for increasing the personal exemption from $750 to $800. One of the first pieces of legislation the Senator from Alabama ever introduced in the Senate was in the year he came to the Senate when the Tax Reform Act of 1969 was under discussion in the Senate. He introduced an amendment setting the personal exemption at $1,200. At that time it was $600. The $1,200 amendment did not pass, but the Gore amendment did pass, which raised the exemption from the $600 by degrees up to the $750. There is just a little arithmetic on really the wisdom of this tax package, this so-called tax reduction. With the $800 personal exemption, a person in the 70-percent tax bracket would have a saving of 70 percent of that amount for each of his exemptions, which would be $560; whereas the person in the 25-percent tax bracket would have received a tax reduction per exemption of only $200. It would favor or continue to favor the person of large means and large income. So it does not seem actually that this is a great measure for the taxpayer. The Senator from Alabama has felt all along that this 12-line bill having to do with the debt ceiling and extending the authorization for a temporary debt from the last day of this month or the 1st of July on through March 31 and raising it by $95 billion, that should not be amended here on the Senate floor with these pending amendments, about a pound and a half of amendments, and that is what would have happened the floodgates had been opened to the consideration of all of these amendments. It is in the public interest that the debt ceiling bill pass as it came to us from the House. The House passed this bill by only a one-vote margin, and if we had to send it back to the House there is no doubt about what they would do with it. So, Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama would certainly want to give careful and sympathetic attention to any tax reform measure when it had the benefit of the recommendations of the Committee on Ways and Means in the House, the recommendations of the Committee on Finance in the Senate, and to present a package that was well-balanced both as to tax reduction and as to replacement of those taxes, But the distinguished Senators who if sponsored this tax package-by the way, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts <Mr. KENNEDY) spoke about a minority of the Senate, in effect, thwarting the will of the majority. Well, the Senator from Alabama recalls the vote up and down on the Kennedy package was 33 votes for it and 64 against it. So it does not look like any majority was being thwarted there. On the cloture motion earlier today those advocating cloture, with the immediate vote or certain vote on the amended tax package, could garner only 48 votes against 50 for it Mr. President, I believe that this bill should pass without amendments, and that is the effect of the motion of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, and I certainly support that motion.

313,554,16,Mr. CLEVELAND.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for yielding me this additional time. There is one bit of legislative history that I would like to establish now. I will address the gentleman from New Jersey <Mr. RoE), who, believe, is knowledgeable about this section of the bill. Under section 8 of the bill there is established a title IX. In the committee report on page 6, there is described some of the examples of the structural economic changes which cause the type of major adjustment problems that we hope to attack through the provisions of this new section, for example, the closing of a Federal installation, and so forth. Without in any way diminishing that list, and it is not meant to be an exclusive list, I would like to refresh the memory of the gentleman from New Jersey. During the committee discussion of this particular section of the bill, we did have some discussion about the type of hardship that is caused in some ski resort areas of the country. Situations where you had not only one bad winter, but where they have had long and prolonged periods of bad winters, 2 and 3 years of poor snowfall, for example. We also had statistic~ before the committee as to the large amount of employment that was involved. In my own State, for example, this would be approximately 2,500. So I wanted to establish as a matter of legislative intent and history that under title IX it will be possible for the grant to be made to a State, and the State in turn could take that money and use it as a revolving fund to make emergency loans to the areas such as ours in the district of the gentleman from New Jersey and my own district; areas that have been visited with long and protracted periods of adverse weather conditions. Would the gentleman from New Jersey respond to that ",1974
314,554,16,Mr. ROE.," If the gentleman will yield, I will be glad to respond. The gentleman from New Hampshire is talking about title IX, and it is my understanding that the Secretary will have broad powers where there has been such an economic dislocation so as to cause heavy unemployment, or to cause the economy to be in a downward direction, that the Secretary has the prerogative under title IX. The recollection of the gentleman from New Hampshire is correct. The CHAIRMAN. The time of gentleman has expired. ",1974
315,554,16,Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT., I yield 1 additional minute to the gentleman from New Hampshire. ,1974
316,554,16,Mr. CLEVELAND.," I thank the gentle. man for yielding me the additional time. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to be sure that we are referring to the pilot programs under Title IX. ",1974
317,554,16,Mr. ROE., Yes. ,1974
318,554,16,Mr. CLEVELAND.," And under the pilot program a grant could be made to a State, and if the other requirements were met this could be used as a revolv-the ing fund to make loans to ski areas in trouble and of course not just such areas. This is particularly important, because some of the loans made in a State could then be outside of redevelopment areas, it could thus be anywhere in the State. ",1974
319,554,16,Mr. ROE.," That is my 1,mderstanding. I believe the gentleman is correct. ",1974
320,554,16,Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Delaware <Mr. nu PoNT). Mr. nu PONT. Mr. Chairman, I hope the gentleman from New Hampshire <Mr. CLEVELAND) and the gentleman from New Jersey <Mr. RoE) will listen to what I have to say, because I believe the point that was just under discussion is an important one. I, too, have read the paragraph at the top of page 5 of the committee report. Let me just ask the members of the committee. Is it really their intention to use the taxpayers' money to subsidize an industry because it has not snowed enough to keep that industry going? Am I right on that? ",1974
321,554,16,Mr. CLEVELAND.," Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. nu PONT. I yield to the gentleman from New Hampshire. ",1974
322,554,16,Mr. CLEVELAND.," I thank the gentleman for yielding. That is our intention. I would like to say this is our intention under the working capital loan provision. I might say to the gentleman, and I can only speak with authority for my own district, that in my own district this particular type of industry supports more than 2,500 people and is the economic backbone of certain areas, and these are the areas that this legislation is specifically designed to help. This is the type of area that 1s sometimes in the southern part of the Appalachian Mountains referred to as Appalachia. It is a way to get jobs and an economic base into that type of an area and on a year-round basis. That is specifically our intent. Mr. nu PONT. Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that we have come to the point of subsidizing people because it is not snowing. ",1974
323,554,16,Mr. CLEVELAND.," Will the gentleman yield further? Mr. nu PONT. No, I will not yield further. ",1974
324,554,16,Mr. CLEVELAND.," It is not a subsidy; it is a loan. Mr. nu PONT. I understand that, but it is still money being paid by the taxpayer. Mr. Chairman, I should like to call to the attention of the Committee the problem of the district I represent. As many of my colleagues probably know who go to Rehoboth Beach in the summertime, we have a beautiful area. But we have had 8 straight weeks of rain. The business in Rehoboth Beach is terrible. Snowcone sales are off substantially. Suntan lotion sales are down because there is no sun. The druggists are suffering. There has not been a bikini bathing suit sold in Rehoboth Beach yet this season. The clothing merchants are having trouble making ends meet. To some extent that is offset by those stores who sell raincoats, because more raincoats are being purchased. Never-theless, if raincoat sales are up, and bikini sales are down, there is a dislocation in the economy of the area, and there is a shifting pattern of income from one segment of the economy to another. I would say to the gentleman from New Hampshire that 1f it is appropriate for New Hampshire to get relief because it is not snowing enough, it is appropriate for Delaware to get relief because it is not sunny enough. I would ask that it be made part of the legislative history that it is the Committee's intent to make Delaware benefit from the same provisions as New Hampshire does. · ",1974
325,554,16,Mr. WRIGHT.," Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. nu PONT. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. ",1974
326,554,16,Mr. WRIGHT.," I thank the gentleman for yielding. I think to the extent that the community in Delaware would qualify under the meaning of the law as a depressed area, to the extent that the climate contributes to the downfall of an industry, I might say if the gentleman represents an area where there are no bikinis being worn and everybody is going around in raincoats, that has got to be a depressing area, whether it is depressed or not. Mr. nu PONT. The most depressing area of all is this bill, which pays people with taxpayers dollars because it is not snowing enough. I appreciate the gentleman's confirming that merchants in Rehoboth Beach are going to be eligible for the same kind of loans as ski tow operators in New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the remainder of my time. ",1974
327,554,16,Mr. WRIGHT.," Mr. Chairman, at this point I should like to yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. BURKE). Mrs. BURKE of California. Mr. Chairman, I wish to voice my strong support for the economic development bill we have before us today. This bill extends the current public works and economic development programs for 2 years and authorizes $510 million for each of the next 2 fiscal years. These programs have, since their establishment in 1965, contributed greatly to the balanced economic development of areas with high structural unemployment and demonstrated need. The Public Works Subcommittee on Economic Development, of which I am a member, has heard testimony this spring from a wide range of witnesses-including Governors, mayors, Federal, State and local officials, and representatives from Indian tribes-almost uniformly in praise of the purposes of these programs and in support of their extension. I believe the broad support of this bill lies in the fact that approved projects are designed to attack the roots of unemployment through positive industrial development and job creation, rather than 'through lateral income transfer programs. The importance of these EDA programs can be demonstrated by the success of the Economic Resources Corporation in the development of the Watts Industrial Park in Los Angeles. ",1974
328,654,16,Mr. ESCH.," Mr. Speaker, next month the Plymouth, Mich., Grange will mark the lOOth anniversary of its service to the community. Formed to improve farming conditions and to obtain better roads for getting produce to market, it remains a nonsectarian and nonpolitical organization for anyone interested in farming. Modern farming techniques and equipment have, of course, made very dramatic changes in the methods used on farms in America today. However, the spirit of rugged individualism and dedication to community and family remains a very integral part of farming in Plym0uth. That spirit will be renewed when the residents of Plymouth gather next month to mark the beginning of a new century in the history of the Plymouth ·Grange. The Plymouth Observer and Eccentric Tecently recounted the history of the Grange and its role in the community. I include it at this point in the RECORD. GRANGE To MARK 100TH ANNIVERSARY (By Sherry Kahan) PLYMOUTH.-The official big day is not until July but members of the Plymouth Grange are already making plans for a celebration to honor the 100th anniversary of their farmoriented organization. Chartered in 1874 whEm Plymouth was a quiet island of a few shops and homes en-tirely surrounded by farms, the Grange was formed to improve farming conditions and to obtain better roads for getting produce to market. It was and stlll is a non-sectarian nonpolitical organization for anyone interested in farming. Unusual for its time, it gave women the same organization rights as men. Recently a number of Plymouth Grange members gathered in the second story of the building at 273 Union that since 1913 has been the permanent headquarters of the organization. They were meeting in a former hay loft for the building was once a stable for the carriage horses of Phil Markham, inventor of the air rifle. Markham once lived in the large house on the corner of Penniman and Union now owned by Jack Wilcox. Purchase price of the stable was $2,500. In those days one. of the attractions of Grange a1Iil.iation was the chance to take part in purchase contracts under which members bought supplies a.t reduced prices. When the word went out that the coal, binde.rs twine, feed or fence posts ordered were due in town, horses were hitched up all over the area. Down to the railroad siding rumbled dozens of wagons to pick up whatever was brought in that day. When Mrs. Louise Spicer Tritton joined the organization 52 years ago she lived six mile~ from town on the Spicer farm at Warren and Napier (now Pilgrim Hills subdivision). The original·land grant deed signed by President John Quincy Adams for this farm is still in the possession of her sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Norman, who continues to own 10 acres at the site. ""I was 14 when I joined,"" said Mrs. Tritton. ""My parents ate, slept and drank the Grange so it was perfectly natural for me to join too. People did things as a family then."" Mrs. Mary Flllmore who joined in 1914 recalled that the Grange had dinners as well as day meetings in those days, and one of the things talked about was having better roads. ""They've worked hard to get the Canton Center Road paved from Michigan Avenue to Plymouth,"" she said ""and this was done in 1915."" The original box stalls and hay chute were still in the stable when the Grange took up its new residence. The wood was all brightly varnished possibly because the horses stabled there were considered the pride of the village. In 1932, a fire broke out in the Grange, reported Mrs. Hilda Lunn. It burned a hole up through the second tloor, destroyed records and did enough damage so that the members had to meet in each others' homes until repair work could be completed. The building now has a meeting hall on both floors, a modern kitchen and the depot toilet is long gone. ""The Grange organization has worked hard to bring about such improvements in American life as rural free delivery, parcel post, the extension service of land grant colleges, rural electrification, pure food laws and social security,"" explained Mrs. Lunn who lives at 15854 Marilyn. According to Grange records, the organization used to hold a harvest picnic every year. In 1891 it was held on Belle Isle. To help the farm families pass the time in the winter the Grange had literary contests for two winters. In 1912-13, it offered prizes at rural school fairs for farm-oriented work done by the pupils. Reminiscing about Plymouth Mrs. FUlmore recollected that the town: once had red brick pavements and street car tracks. ""It was a shame they covered up those bricks,"" she said. Jesse Tritton, a Grange member for-40 years and present Master of the organization, could well be honored as a pioneer commuter. In the 30s he drove dally to a Chevrolet plant in Hamtramck, usually taking Schoolcraft to Davison and then to John R. The trip took about an hour and a half. ""Schoolcraft had two paved lanes and very little traffic,"" he said. His wife remembers that the park in the center of Plymouth once presented a rural picture that would delight Andrew Wyeth or even Norman Rockwell. Along Ann Arbor Trail were hitching posts to which Mrs. Tritton often hitched her horse and buggy. A tank full of water for horses stood to one side. For a while a bandstand, frequently filled with local musicians, was a part of the park scene. A severe ice storm in March 1922 damaged many of the trees in this park. Saturday night movies were shown on the streets in the center of town from 1915 to about 1920. A large curtain was draped over the area where the S.S. Kresge store is now located. Across the street a projector was set up, with the viewers in between. Mrs. Tritton spent eight years in the oneroom Hanford School at Hanford and Ridge. This was not because she failed to be promoted. It was a school taught by one teacher for about 25 to 30 children scattered through eight grades. Transportation was a problem for her when she had to come into town to attend high school, then at Main and Church. The building, now Central School, was a 12-grade institution for town children. Rural students attended only during their high school years. Not being 14, Mrs. Tritton was unable to obtain a driver's license. ""But just to school and back,"" she said. ""I could only run errands if I had written permission from my parents."" Most of these Grange oldtimers regret the passing of the rural era they remember. ""When I came in to high school it was extremely unusual for me to run into someone I didn't know,"" observed Mrs. Tritton. Mr. Fillmore finds himself getting a little angry now and again at the thought of good farming land now being swallowed up by housing developments. ""Some of those money hogs have rocks in their heads,"" he said. ""There are plenty of places around with sandy soil that could serve their purpose just as well."" Trying to adapt and build for the future, the Grange two years ago started a Junior Grange for young people between the ages of five and 14. It emphasizes such things as woodworking, a growing project, cookie making, and occasionally some needlecraft. At the present time a member no longer has to be an active farmer, it is open to anyone with an interest in farming. ""Anyone who eats ought to be interested in farming,"" concluded Mrs. Tritton. ALCOHOL SAFETY ACTION PROGRAMSMUSTBEFULLYFUNDED HON. JOHN F. SEIBERLING OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, June 26, 1974 ",1974
329,654,16,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, last week the House passed the 1975 Transportation Department appropriation, and in so doing approved a $4 million cut in the budget for the alcohol safety action programs--commonly called ASAPs. ASAPs are perhaps one of the least known-and most effective-Government programs around. Briefly, they have two purposes: First, to get the drinking driver off the road before he kills himself or someone else; and ",1974
330,754,16,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, on June 16, 1949, the Genocide Convention was transmitted to the Senate by President Truman who urged that it be ratified. Every administration since 1949 has supported the Genocide Convention. Most recently, President Nixon urged the Senate ""to consider anew this important convention and to grant its advice and consent to ratification.'' Such action, said the President, ""will demonstrate unequivocally our country's desire to participate in the building of international order based on law and justice."" Despite this continuing bipartisan support for the convention, the Senate has responded neither favorably nor with due ",1974
331,854,16,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Is there objection to the present consideration of the resolution? There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. ",1974
332,854,16,Mr. GRIFFIN.," Mr. President, I shall not object, of course, to this resolution. But it might be useful to focus again on a point that I sought to make several da:vs ago when I inserted in the RECORD that letter from the President of the United States in which he declined to provide to the House Judiciary Committee, in response to a subpena, certain documents under the claim of Executive privilege. It is often said by some in Congress and some in the press, that there is no such thing as Executive privilege; that the President has no right to withhold anything from the scrutiny and examination of Congress. As we move to adopt this particular resolution, I suggest it is noteworthy that the legislative branch of Government, the Senate in this case, claims a privilege as against the other branches with respect to the documents under control of the Senate, the minutes of a meeting of a committee of the Senate, for example. Rule XXX of the Senate, to which the distinguished majority whip has referred, stakes out a claim of privilege on the part of Senate and specifically prohibits any Member or employee of the Senate from producing any Senate documents except by consent of the Senate. I do not believe it is timely or appropriate to make any judgment at this time with respect to the existence or scope of executive privilege. But it is ap-propriate, I suggest, to take note of the fact that the legislative branch, as well as the executive branch, now and over the years, has asserted the claim of privilege. The resolution we are about to adopt makes it very precise that no court, no ordinary court, can require the Senate to produce evidence or documents except by the consent of the Senate. Ordinarily, the Senate does give that consent, but there have been occasions when the Senate has not. The judicial branch also maintains a privilege concerning its own deliberations. Before the Supreme Court decides cases, it has secret meetings of its members and discusses privately and candidly, among the members, how they will decide the case. The minutes and the proceedings of those secret meetings of the Justices of the Supreme Court are available to no one. If the House Judiciary Committee were ever to investigate, for purposes of impeachment, a Justice of the Supreme Court and sought to subpena the minutes or proceedings of those secret deliberations of the Justices of the Supreme Court, I wonder what the response of that coequal branch of the Government would be. ",1974
333,854,16,Mr. ROBERT C.," BYRD. Mr. President, I should like to add my own footnote to what the distinguished assistant Republican leader has said. The point we should keep in mind in all this discussion concerning the executive branch is this: Is there privilege? Does the Executive, does the legislative branch, does the judicial branch have authority, under the Constitution, to claim privilege when it comes to withholding evidence that bears upon the possible commission of a crime? I have never doubted that some form of executive privilege exists. But where there is evidence bearing upon possible criminality, I seriously doubt that the doctrine of executive privilege can be invoked by any body of the Government. So long as that evidence is relevant, so long as it bears upon the commission of a crime, so long as it does not involve the vital national security interests of this country, I doubt that any claim of executive privilege can validly be made by any branch of the Government. Second, I also want to call attention to the fact that the House Judiciary Committee, in conducting an impeachment inquiry, is engaged in carrying out one of the highest constitutional functions mandated by the Constitution and incumbent upon any branch of the Government. It is the constitutional duty of that committee to seek all relevant evidence bearing upon possible impeachable offenses. I think it is the duty of the President of the United States-as the Chief Executive of this country and as the officer who has the responsibility. under the Constitution, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed-to respond to the House Judiciary Committee's legitimate requests for any relevant evidence bearing upon the possible commission of a crime or bearing upon any possible im-peachable offenses. If the doctrine of executive privilege can validly be invoked against the House Judiciary Committee in its legitimate and constitutional function of seekng all information so that it can make an objective and fair and reasoned judgment as to whether or not impeachable offenses exist, then indeed any President, by simply invoking the socalled doctrine of executive privilege, can stop all such inquiry and bring it to a halt. In that way, he could nullify or negate the clause of the Constitution which provides for impeachment of the Chief Executive of this country. While I do not at this moment attempt to take any position with respect to specific requests on the part of the House Judiciary Committee, I do not think that a parallel can be drawn in respect to the House Judiciary Committee's constitutional function in this regard as against the rule that governs the submission of documents, and so forth, and the requiring of information on the part of Senate employees such as that embraced in the resolution I have submitted on behalf of ",1974
334,854,16,Mr. EASTLAND.," Nor would I, as a Senator, ever defend the Senate, nor do I think any Senator would defend the Senate, nor do I think the Senate as an institution would interpose the Senate rule, in resistance to the submission of valid, relevant evidence in the possession of the Senate, if that evidence llore upon the possible commission of a crime. ",1974
335,854,16,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, will the Senator yield? ",1974
336,854,16,Mr. ROBERT C., BYRD. I yield. ,1974
337,854,16,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. He has given the Senate very helpful leadership in this regard. He is absolutely 100 percent right with respect to executive privilege. I have in my hand a copy of the Constitution of the United States, and there is not one word in the Constitution about executive privilege. Indeed, one eminent historian has said that it was 1958 before the term was ever used. Raoul Berger, who is probably the most eminent expert in the world in this field, has argued that executive privilege is simply a matter of expedience. That makes sense. The Senator from Michigan has made a good point. We should not be able to take from the President of the United States any papers that may disclose national security matters of secrets of that kind. But this is a matter of convenience, a matter of commonsense, a matter of logic, not of absolute constitutional right. On the other hand, the House of Representatives has a constitutional responsibility with respect to impeachment. It is very clear in the Constitution. So for us to permit the Executive to interpose some new motion of executive privilege to frustrate the proper role of Congress to investigate, as we must do in order to fulfill our obligations, seems to me to be unconstitutional, unwise, and improper. Mr. President, one of the most vital functions that the Senate and the House have is the function of investigation, and by the President using this notion of executive privilege, that function has been frustrated and frustrated badly. ",1974
338,904,16,Mr. STEIGER of Wisconsin., I very much appreciate the response of the Chairman on that question. ,1974
339,904,16,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 minutes. Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, in view of the number of people who are on the floor here, rather than continuing to talk to ourselves, it might very well serve a purpose to simply extend our remarks at this point in the RECORD. But I do not believe that would be altogether appropriate. As the gentleman from Pennsylvania <Mr. FLooD) indicated, during the course of his remarks, he will be making a rather extensive extension of his remarks on certain specific items, as will this Member and, I am sure, other members of the subcommittee. We have over 300 line items and to go over them item by item in detail I think would unduly take up the time of the Committee of the Whole. But if I might, I should like to address myself to some of the highlights, and several items that I am somewhat concerned about. ",1974
340,904,16,Mr. GROSS.," Mr. Chairman, will gentleman yield? ",1974
341,904,16,Mr. MICHEL.," I yield to my dear friend, the gentleman from Iowa. ",1974
342,904,16,Mr. GROSS.," I thank the gentleman for yielding. This is a bill which in all of its ramifications, as I understand the statement of the gentleman from Pennsylvania <Mr. FLooD), entails the spending of about $121 billion. Would the gentleman suggest we get 5 or 10 more Members to add to the 15 or 20 now on the House floor? That is about all a quorum call will produce under the bobtailed procedure that we have indulged ourselves in this phony quorum call procedure in the Committee of the Whole. ",1974
343,904,16,Mr. MICHEL.," I am not all that enthralled with my own voice, I will say to the gentleman from Iowa. We will try to make our case just as briefly as we can here. There is no question but what the real nitty-gritty of the debate will follow during the course of reading the bill when there will be amendments offered. And the gentleman will, of course, I hope, oppose those to increase the bill, as I will, and he might very well be supporting some of those amendments that will be offered to cut the bill. ",1974
344,904,16,Mr. GROSS.," If my friend, the gentleman from Illinois, will yield further, if he feels at any time that he needs more companionship, I will be glad to try to provide it. the ",1974
345,904,16,Mr. MICHEL.," I appreciate the gentleman's cooperative attitude. In this case it would be very cooperative if we could simply move ahead with discussion of the bill referring, as I said, to several of the highlights. ",1974
346,904,16,Mr. HALEY.," Mr. Chairman, I make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The CHAffiMAN. Evidently a quorum is not present. The Chair announces that he will vacate proceedings under the call when a quorum of the Committee appears. Members will record their presence by electronic device. The call was taken by electronic de-vice. QUORUM CALL VACATED its busiThe CHAIRMAN. 101 Members have appeared. A quorum of the Committee of the Whole is present. Pursuant to rule XXIII, clause 2, further proceedings under the call shall be considered as vacated. The Committee will resume ness. The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. MICHEL) had been recognized and at the time of the point of order had 8 minutes remaining. ",1974
347,904,16,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Chairman, as I was about to say when we were interrupted by the suggestion of the absence of a quorum, there are a great many deferred items that will not show up in this bill, budgeted at $4.6 billion, and these items Members will find displayed on page 6 of our report. So, as our chairman has indicated to the Members, we bring to the floor a bill of $32.8 billion without $4.6 billion of deferred items, which suggests that if we have no increase in the future on these deferred items we would have something in the neighborhood of $37 to $38 billion of appropriated funds here to add to the $92.5 billion of trust funds. My concern is the fact that we show a figure here of $386 million under the budget. This has got to be-and the chairman and I would have some difference as to how it would be characterized-for all inJt.ents and purposes a phony cut in the bill. It comes to the floor, as I said, showing a net reduction of $386 million below the President's budget, but the Members should be aware that the figure is achieved through a reduction of more than $878 million in estimates for public assistance. In other words, if the administration's estimates are right and the committee's estimates are wrong, the bill will be considerably above the President's budget-and the word ""estimates"" is very critical here and important. Public assistance is not controllable by congressional action. By law the Federal Government must pay its share of any legitimate welfare costs incurred by the States. In the end we will have to appropriate the necessary amount cover those legitimate costs. If the administration has overestimated them, the budget authority will revert to the Treasury. If the committee has underestimated them, we will have to provide a supplemental appropriation. to I see the gentleman from Iowa out here in front of me, who makes the point time and time again on the floor of this House, opposed to bringing in supplemental requests. This, of course, is one of those things that I would have to predict will happen on this particular item. The question is, who is more right here or more wrong about the estimates? For years both the administration and the Congress have accepted the estimates of the 50 States which are made considerably in advance of the fiscal year. As the committee report notes, for 11 years in a row these State estimates were vastly underestimated and the Congress had to vote supplementals for those years. The fiscal year 1973 was a standoff year. The original estimates were reasonably accurate; however, the administration requested and the Congress passed a supplemental which prgved to be unnecessary. In the fiscal year 1974, for the first time the pendulum swung the other way and the estimates were vastly overstated. As a result, the administration recommended a rescission, a significant one, better than three-quarters of a billion dollars; but we in the Congress rescinded $1,188 million. Mr. Chairman, I am concerned that in the fiscal year 1974 the rescission was too sharp. HEW has already had to borrow over $100 million from their fiscal year 1975 appropriation,. which is not accounted for in our committee estimates. Second, the fiscal year 1974 estimates are based on the November 1973 State estimates, reduced by the administration by more than $500 million. The May 1974 State estimates are nearly $700 million higher than the State requests. If these State estimates are more correct than the House estimates, there could be a deficit of more than $1.5 billion. There is no certainty as to who is right about this thing. It is reasonably clear, however, that even if the trend is down, as it was in fiscal year 1974, our committee has cut too much. Members should assume that there is a due bill waiting in the wings in the form of a SUIPPlemental for public assistance which will almost certainly wipe out the margin shown in our committee report as being below the President's budget. That is the point I want to make, that we do not get carried away and think that we are in such good shape that when these amendments are offered-in one item to increase public service employment by $300 million-we take the optimistic view that all is well, because it is not all well. It is pretty bad and we ought to face up to the music. The supplemental security income item, which shows an increase here of $2.6 billion over last year in the bill now to a brings that item up total of $4.8 billion. In this fiscal year we will have 5 million beneficiaries of this particular program. ",1974
348,954,16,Mr. MAYNE.," Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Mrs. GREEN of Oregon. I yield to the gentleman from Iowa. ",1974
349,954,16,Mr. MAYNE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the distinguished member of the House Select Subcommittee on Labor from Wisconsin <Mr. STEIGER), and thank my good friend, the gentlewoman from Oregon <Mrs. GREEN), for her generosity and graciousness in yielding me this time. In the last Congress, I appeared before the House Select Subcommittee on Labor in its oversight hearings with regard to the Occupational Safety and Health Act and its administration, and testified with regard to the folly of strict application of the act and the regulations which had promulgated to the small farmer and small business. Some of the regulations since have been modified, having been proved to be impractical if not ridiculous, but there is still further need for revision of the regulations toward more commonsense approaches. However, the greatest folly still remains in the act and any strict application of it-the fact that the law provides for mandatory fines and penalties upon the Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspector first coming upon the jobsite and finding conditions which he determines are not in strict conformity with the prescribed standards. It is difficult enough for the giant corporation to keep up with the many laws and regulations affecting its operations, including OSHA, but at least through its corporate network it has some chance of keeping informed and making the requisite modifications in its plants and work rules so as to be compatible with the latest rulings in Washington or the regional OSHA office. But how is a small farmer or the entrepreneur of a small family business to keep track of these complex regulations and rulings? I must confess my amazement that farmers and independent businesses are able to keep up as well as they do with the myriad regulations affecting them, but surely it can be no real surprise to find that the ""word"" does not always get around, or that small store owner, the dirt farmer, the family doctor or corner druggist, or the owner-operator of the rural gasoline station may be somewhat confused on just how a complicated regulation designed for larger operations might be applied in his particular situation. These employers do not wish to maintain unsafe conditions, but they are often not really aware that their working conditions might somehow be considered hazardous to the health and safety of their employees. Once they are apprised fully of where allegedly dangerous conditions exist and how those conditions might be improved to meet the standards promulgated for their type of operation, I believe you will find most of these employers willing to do what they can to make the changes sought. But they have found they cannot under the law ask the Federal OSHA inspector to look over their plant or operation and advise them where they might be deficient so that they can comply with the law and regulations, for it appears the law requires a mandatory fine to be imposed, as well as other action which often would impose hardship as well as inconvenience upon the employer, whenever an inspector determines that the site does not perfectly meet the uniform standards set in Washington. As I stated in the hearings in the last Congress, there is an urgent need to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act to permit employers to ask the OSHA inspector to come to the site and advise just where conditions are substandard and how the employer might correct the conditions, without rwming the risk of being subjected to mandatory penalties on that first visit. Onsite consultation should be expressly authorized for in the act and in the regulations. If, after having been informed that the worksite is unsafe or unhealthy, the employer does not make any good-faith effort to bring the worksite up to standard within a reasonable period of time, then imposition of sanctions might be considered in order to bring about compliance-but not before then. The intent of the act after all was not to see how much could be collected in fines, or to harass employers and drive them out of business, but to obtain, basically through education and cooperation, the improved conditions necessary to assure that employees are not unnecessarily subjected to hazards to health and safety which could have been avoided by use of reasonable care and precautions on the part of the employer. I have introduced or cosponsored legislation in the last Congress and again in this Congress which would amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act to provide for onsite consultation and advice. It is ridiculous and intolerable for inspectors to be required to issue citations when violations are found on the first visit, especially for small firms and farmers which cannot afford to hire their own ORHA compliance specialists. I am grateful that the Select Subcommittee on Labor has been holding oversight hearings this spring in which it has considered these and other amendments, but must regret that the subcommittee has not yet reported such urgently needed amendments for early enactment. In the meantime, however, at least 21 States presently provide onsite consultation as part of their OSHA-approved State plan. The amendment proposed by the Member from Wisconsin (Mr. STEIGER) would appropriate an additional $5 million to the OSHA for grants to States for the provision of onsite consultative services to assist employers in meeting their OSHA requirements, thus providing incentive to the rest of the States to join in providing onsite consultation as part of their respective State plans. There appears to be ample authority in sections 2Hc) and 7(c) (1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act to carry out such a program through State plans. Until such time as we are able to achieve enactment of an amendment to the act specifically providing for onsite consultation, whether by Federal OSHA or State OSHA inspectors-an amendment I would urge be given top priority by the leadership of the Education and Labor Committee and by the House leadershiP-the Steiger amendment to the present bill will provide urgently needed interim relief making it possible to ·continue efforts to enhance safety in the workplace. I respectfully request all in this House to support this amendment. ",1974
350,954,16,Mr. FINDLEY.," Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, this amendment obviously is worth while. I think it is a good one. It is good because it recognizes the problem but, in my opinion, it does not solve the problem. •. ",1974

(Mr. STEELMAN) is recognized for 5 minutes. ",1974
354,1054,16,Mr. STEELMAN.," Mr. Speaker, quite possibly one of the most telling votes of the 93d Congress was cast yesterday when the Democrats withheld from the American people the opportunity for public debate and a vote on the Committee Reform Amendments of 1974. The vote to table the appeal of the Speaker's ruling against bringing the Committee Reform Resolution before the Rules Committee not only demonstrated the Democrat's opposition to reform but, even worse, their disregard for the public's right to know. The very act of hiding reform of Congress from the public and not allowing their representatives to publicly comment or vote on this proposal is the very reason that the confidence of the public is reaching an all-time low. And what has been our response? While many felt forming a bipartisan Reform Committee was a sincere response to public concern with the legislative branch, the Democratic leadership's attempt to bury their very positive report-delivered after 14 months of extensive hearings and compromise-is evidence that this was obviously part of a charade. Apparently, the Democratic leadership is satisfied with the state of affairs in the House that has led to this level of public disdain. Mr. Speaker, once again ironclad party discipline, special interests, and power politics have denied the public the right to know and denied this House the opportunity to function effectively. As President John Kennedy said ""Sometimes party loyalty asks too much."" This was definitely one of those times. It is most unfortunate that many Democrats ostensibly so committed to reform have blindly followed this path. Mr. Speaker, this is not only a question of committee reform but of reform in general and openness in the legislative process. The day is long gone when the Congress can hide their activities in Washington from constituents. How much lower must the confidence level sink before there will be a response by the Democratic leadership. Apparently condemnation of their administration of the House by 80 percent of the citizenry is not enough. But, it is for me and every Member of this body who goes door to door listening to the concerns of their constituents. They want a change. They deserve a change. And no rationalization citing parliamentary procedure is going to fool them. They know what this vote meant. Mr. Speaker, the people deserve better. CRISIS IN THE AMERICAN DAffiY INDUSTRY-A CALL FOR ACTION The SPEAKER. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from. ",1974
355,1104,16,Mr. HELSTOSKI.," Mr. Speaker, as a result of a variety of incidents over the past few years, many people unfortunately have come to view policemen as unenlightened, uneducated, and insensitive. However, as Dr. George L. Kirkham, assistant professor of the School of Criminology of Florida State University recently found out, no point of view could be further from the truth. In an effort to see what life as a policeman was really like, Dr. Kirkham joined the Jacksonville-Duval County, Fla., force, after an intense period of physical and academic training. Dr. Kirkham subsequently wrote: Night after night, I came home with a sense of satisfaction and contribution society that I have never known 1n any other job. to The story of George Kirkham is a powerful one. Not only is it the story of one man's prejudices, but it is an overpowering tribute to the honesty, bravery, and perseverance which characterize the dally performance of thousands of police-men throughout the country. Mr. Speaker, an excellent article by Pr. Kirkham concerning his experience and entitled ""A Professor's 'Street Lessons'"" appeared recently in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin. An adaptation of Dr. Kirkham's article was published recently by the American Mercury magazine. Jn view of the fact that his EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS story is extremely moving and highly relevant to each of our constituencies, I would now like to take this opportunity to share this material with my colleagues: A PROFESSOR'S ""STREET LEssoNs"" (By Dr. George L. Kirkham) As policemen have come under increasing criticism in recent years, I cannot help but wonder how many times they have clenched their teeth and wished they could expose the critics to some of the harsh rea.Ut1es of police work. Members of the academic community, including myself, a criminologist, have been quick to find fault with the police. We have fashioned a stereotype which ignores the good and focuses on the isolated and the bad: the brutal cop, the racist cop, the grafting cop, the discourteous cop. What we do not see, however, is the image of thousands of dedicated men and women struggling against almost impossible odds to preserve our society and everything in it which we cherish. For some time, first as a student and later as a professor, I found myself troubled by the fact that most of the critics haven't themselves been policemen. This was pointed up when some of my students-many of them former policemen-would respond to my frequently critical lectures on the police with the argument that I could not possibly endure what a police officer has to endure. I decided to take up this challenge and work as a policeman myself, as a means of establishing once and for all the accuracy of what I and other criminologists had been saying about the pollee all along. My plan-which meant becoming a fulltime policemen for four months in the summer, and a part-time one during the academic year when my teaching duties resumed-not surprisingly brought skepticism from family, friends and colleagues. After all, at age 31 I had a family and an established career. A student recommended that I apply at the consolidated, 800-man force of JacksonvilleDuva.l County, Florida, an especially progressive department. I followed up the idea, since Jacksonville, with half a million residents, impressed me as a city experiencing many of the major social problems .of our time: crime and delinquency, racial unrest, poverty, and mental illness. It is a diverse city, and one with a fairly typical inner-city slum area and black ghetto. It seemed a good place to experience the stresses and strains of today's city policeman. POLICE DEPARTMENT AGREES The leadership of the police department was receptive. I made it clear that I did not want to be merely an observer, but a. fully sworn, fulltime (although unpaid) member of the department for some months. I also said I wanted to spend most of this time working as a uniformed patrolman in those inner city beats most characterized by violence, poverty, social unrest and crime. They agreed to my plan, with the stipulation that I would first have to meet all the requirements that any other police applicant would. They also stipulated, and agreed, that for the sake of morale 1n the department, every officer must know tn advance who I was an4 what I was doing. The experlm.ent began with the required 280 hours or police academy training. For 4 months, 4 hours each evening, I attended the academy, along with 35 younger classmates. At first I stood out as a.n oddity ln the class, but with tlme I was accepted by the group. When graduation came, I was indistinguishable !rom other officers in every respect, including my .88 revolver, badge and uniform. I June 28, 1974 I had always suspected that police officers greatly exaggerate the amount of verbal disrespect and physical abuse to which they are subjected in the line of duty. During my first few hours as a street officer, that bubble was burst. As a college professor, I had grown accustomed to being treated with respect. I somehow assumed that this would carry over into my new role as a policeman. I was, after all, a. representative of the law, identifiable to all by the badge and uniform I wore as someone dedi ca. ted to the protection of society. Surely that would entitle me to a. measure of cooperation. I quickly found that my badge and uniform, rather than serving to shield me from such things as disrespect and violence, only acted as a magnet which drew me toward many individuals who hated what I represented. Several hours into my first evening on the streets, my partner and I were dispatched to a bar to handle a disturbance complaint. Inside, we encountered a large and boisterous drunk who was arguing with the bartender and refusing to leave. As someone with considerable experience as a. correctional counselor and mental health worker, I hastened to take charge of the situation. ""Excuse me, Sir,"" I smiled pleasantly at the drunk, ""but I wonder if I could ask you to step outside and talk with me for just a minute?"" The man stared at me through bloodshot eyes in disbelief for a second, raising one hand to scratch the stubble of several days growth of beard. Then suddenly, he swung at me, missing my face and striking me on the right shoulder. I couldn't believe it. What had I done to provoke such a. reaction? Before I could recover from my startled condition, he swung again-this time tearing my whistle chain from a shoulder epaulet. After a brief struggle, we had the still shouting, cursing man locked in the back of our cruiser. I stood there, breathing heavily with my hair in my eyes as I surveyed the damage to my new uniform and looked in bewilderment at my partner, who only smiled and clapped me affectionately on the back. ""Something is very wrong,"" remember thinking 1o myself in the front seat as we headed for jail. I had used the same kind of gentle, rapport-building approach with countless offenders in prison and probation settings. It had always worked so well there. What was so different about being a. policeman? I ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCE In the days and weeks which followed, I was to learn the answer to this question the hard way. As a. professor, I had sought to convey to students the idea that it is a mistake to impose authority, to make decisions for other people, or rely upon commands to accomplish something. As a police officer myself, I was forced time and again to do just that. For the first time in my life, I encountered individuals who interpreted kindness as weakness, as an invitation to disrespect or violence. I encountered men, women, and children who, in fear, desperation, or excitment, looked to the person behind my uniform for guidance, control, and direction. As one who had always condemned the exercise of authority, the acceptance of myself as an unavoidable symbol of authority came as a. bitter lesson. I found that there was a world of differindividuals 1:n ence between encountering mental health or correctional settings and facing them as the patrolman must-when they are violent, hysterical, desperate. When I put the uniform on, I lost the luxury of sitting in an office, calmly discussing with a rapist or armed robber the problems which had led him into trouble with the law. Such offenders had seemed so harmless in the ",1974
356,1154,16,Mr. HUNGATE.," Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on this bill, H.R. 15461. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from· Missouri? There was no objection. ",1974
357,1154,16,Mr. HUNGATE.," Mr. Speaker, H.R. 15461, the bill now before the House, comes to the floor with the unanimous endorsement of the Committee on the Judiciary. This bill postpones the effective date of certain amendments to the Federal Ruies of Criminal Procedure from August 1, 1974, to August 1, 1975. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as the name suggests, are the ruies that govern Federal criminal trials. These rules apply not only to the trial itself, but they also apply to matters and procedures taking place before trialsuch as issuing an arrest warrant-and after trial--such as sentencing. There are presently 63 ruies. The procedure for amending the rules is set forth in sections 3771 and 3772, title 18 of the United States Code. Briefly, these statutes require that the Supreme Court report changes in the ruies to the Congress after the start of a reguiar session, but not later than May 1. Changes become effective 90 days later, all laws in conflict being of no further force or effect. Acting pursuant to this statutory authority, the Supreme Court 'transmitted certain proposed amendments to Congress on April 22, 1974. These proposed amendments will take effect Aug'USit 1, 1974, unless legislation to the contrary is enacted. The proposed amendments make changes in 10 existing rules and add 3 new rules. Thus, in quantitative terms, the Supreme Court proposes to change nearly 20 percent of the present ruies, a significant change. The proposed. amendments are significant for another reason-they affect controversial areas of criminal law and procedure. All segments of the legal profession were invited to comment upon the proposed amendments-judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, law professors, and professional organizations and agencies. The overwhelming majority of replies from these segments were critical of the proposed amendments and suggested changes in them. Only four of the proposed amendments escaped criticism. Several organizations and individuals asked to be heard on the proposed amendments. It became quite apparent that 90 days was not enough time to do justice to what the Supreme Court had sent over. Some of the proposed amendments had been under consideration for over 4% years. What takes 4% years to write deserves more than 90 days to review. H.R. 15461, by delaying the effective date for 1 year, gives Congress ample additional time to study carefuily the proposed amendments. The wisdom of postponement has been supported by such ·diverse groups as the Department of Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union. I urge a favorable vote on H.R. 15461. ",1974
358,1154,16,Mr. GROSS.," Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? ",1974
359,1154,16,Mr. HUNGATE., I would be glad to yield to the gentleman from Iowa. ,1974
360,1154,16,Mr. GROSS.," Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman does this mean a delay of justice? ",1974
361,1154,16,Mr. HUNGATE.," I wouid respond to the gentleman from Iowa that what is justice is a question, as the gentleman knows, that frequently arises in the courts, and sometimes receives a s~tis­factory answer, because what is justice to one may not be justice to another. We are concerned here with ruies that have been in existence for some time, I will tell the gentleman from Iowa. With the number of people who have contacted us wishing to express their views and have a voice in this before it becomes effective, we think it only fair to give them a chance to be heard before the committee. ",1974
362,1154,16,Mr. GROSS.," We are reminded so frequently, as the gentleman well knows, on the House floor when the lawyers are working up some kind of legislation, of that old adage ""Justice delayed is justice denied."" I just wonder if this inability to absorb in the 90 days what has been recommended is delaying justice in any way, shape, or form? ",1974
363,1154,16,Mr. HUNGATE.," I appreciate the gentleman's concern. We are hopeful on the committee that this delay will affect justice as time affects good wine. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New York. Mr. Speaker, rise in support of H.R. 15461 and wish to fully associate myself with the remarks of the chairman of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice. I The proposed amendments, sent to us on April 22 by the Chief Justice, make significant changes in the Rules of Criminal Procedur' Because of the importance of som\.. of those changes, I believe that both Houses of Congress shouid have ample time to consider them. Although I believe we should act promptly, a maximum 1-year delay in the operation of the automatic effective date, pursuant to sections 3771 and 3772 of title 18 of the United States Code, seems reasonable. Attorney General Saxbe strongly recommends this 1-year delay in these amendments. In a letter of June 17, 1974, he informed the Judiciary Committee he was offering objection on behalf of 90 of the 94 U.S. attorneys. The Attorney General specifically objects to the amendments to rules 4 and 9 regarding arrest warrants, and rule 16 regarding discovery motions. These objections point up the fact that, while these amendments purportedly affect only ""rules of procedure,"" in fact they have significant effect on the operations of the offices of the U.S. Attorneys and the operations of all the Federal law enforcement agencies. The amendment proposed to ruie 16 for example wouid require that a Federal prosecutor, before a trial, make known to the defendant and his attorneys the names and addresses of all the witnessess whose testimony will be used in the upcoming trial. As the Attorney General points out, in the prosecution of members of organized crime, witnesses are sometimes in the protective custody of the United States. Is it wise to require the Justice Department to disclose where that witness is being hidden? Whether it is or not, is a question, along with other questions raised by these amendments, which can only be answered after careful and comprehensive consideration by the Congress. As the committee report points out, these amendments to the Criminal Rules of Procedure have been under consideration by the Judicial Conference for 4% years. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill which gives us a maximum of 1 year to consider these amendments. ",1974
364,1154,16,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 15461, a bill to delay the effective date of certain amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Unless this bill is enacted, these amendments, which were promuigated by the Supreme Court on April 22, 1974, will automatically go into effect next August. 1. H.R. 15461 will merely postpone their effective date for 1 year to August 1, 1975. This bill is bipartisan. It is sponsored by all nine members of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Criminal Justice. The bill comes to the floor favorably endorsed by a unanimous Judiciary Committee. Equally important, the goal of this bill is endorsed by diverse segments of the legal profession-for example, the Department of Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union. The amendments promulgated by the Supreme Court on April 22 change Ian-",1974

366,1254,16,Mr. GUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, last week I issued a statement expressing my concern over the proposed United StatesEgyptian nuclear cooperation agreement promised by the President and my fears that this agreement would open the door for nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. I was troubled to learn some days ago that my fears were justified and that France has just concluded a trade agreement with Iran that includes provisions for the latter's purchase of five nuclear reactors. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS This agreement follows hard on the heels of a statement by the Shah indicating that Iran is about to embark upon a program for the development of nuclear weapons. When asked during a recent interview with a French news magazine whether he thought that Iran would someday possess nuclear weapons, the Washington Post, June 24, 1974, reports the Shah's reply as: Without any doubt, and sooner than one would think. Now, despite the avowed intention of the Shah to go ahead with an atomic weapons program, France is going to sell Iran nuclear reactors which will have the capacity to produce more than enough plutonium than is necessary for an atomic bomb. Plutonium, which is a byproduct of the reactor's fission reaction, is the basic building block of the atomic bomb, without which the technical problems in nuclear weapons construction are almost insurmountable for most nations. Without strict safeguards, it is possible for any country, like India, to divert sufficient quantities of plutonium for construction of an atomic device. Yet the Washington Post, June 6, 1974, reports that past French reactor sales have not had inspection safeguards which would prevent diversion of plutonium. Furthermore, France is not even a signatory of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Mr. Speaker, we must all be gravely concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons and their horrible potential for destruction. With President Nixon's recent promise of nuclear cooperation with Egypt, we are on the verge of opening the door to the spread of nuclear technology throughout the area. France has not been hesitant in following our lead and offering her atomic expertise to Iran. Other countries, like the Soviet Union, may soon follow suit and provide their client states with high-prestige and even higher risk nuclear facilities. This new form of competition between the powers-currying favor with oilproducing nations by selling them nuclear capability-must be stopped before it escalates into a grim new version of the arms race. The only way to stop this spiral is by seeing that the atom is kept out of the area. I commend the following article to my colleagues and other readers of the RECORD who are concerned about the dangers of nuclear proliferation: [From the Washington Post, June 27, 1974] FRANCE GETS $4 BILLION IN IRAN TRADE PARIS, June 27.-France achieved an economic coup today in completing a long-term trading agreement with Iran valued at over $4 billion. Iran is to deposit $1 billion with the Bank of France as advance payment for major industrial projects--including five nuclear power stations and technological assistanceto cost between $4 and $5 billion over 10 years. The shah of Iran and President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, after three days of talks, set the seal on the biggest-ever economic agreement between an oil-producing country and a European industrialized power. Shah Mohamed Raza Pahlnui told a press conference: ""We are prepared to join with France in July 1, 197 4 building a petrochemical industry and go all the way in handling oil-from the well to the gasoline pump,"" he said. He added that there was an immense field of cooperation between Iran and France to be explored and developed. The French and Iranian finance ministers signed a detailed agreement for the construction of five nuclear power plants in Iran. French Finance Minister Jean-Pierre Fourcade said payments by Iran would be made in installments over three years, starting later this year. After the initial deposit of $1 billion, the first payment would probably be about 300 million dollars. The deal will help France out of its balance of payments deficit, expected this year to be more than $6 billion. In addition to building the nuclear power plants, the French will supply uranium, industrial equipment and gas pipelines, Fourcade said. The power plants, each of 1,000 megawatt capacity, are to be completed by 1985. . France will also assist in the creation of a nuclear research center in Iran and the training of nuclear scientists. [Past French reactor sales have not carried requirements for inspections that would preclude use of the fuel for bombs.) Asked about the question of nuclear weapons, the shah replied: ""For a long time, more than five years now, we have declared that we would be ready to turn our area into a non-nuclear zone-that is, an area where no nuclear weapons should be used or stored, and we stick to this policy."" He denied having granted an interview to a French magazine which quoted him as saying that Iran would possess atomic weaoons ""sooner than the world thinks."" · He said he had told a group of French journailsts in Tehran before coming to France that if every little country tried to get atomic weapons ""we will have to think it over-but I hope this will never happen."" The shah also said today that ""all oil companies should be nationalized."" Explaining the French deal, he declared. ""When we were in a weak position and asked Europe for aid, we received it. If now the European countries have some difficulties with their balance of payments it is only natural for Iran, which has achieved a strong position to do what it can.""

Mr. Speaker, in the present reported warming of the international environment that exists between the United States and the Soviet Union it is, I feel, wise to maintain the point of view that the Soviet Union is still a totalitarian state with a vast system of slave colonies in Eastern Europe. In this vast empire exists millions upon millions of people who still yearn fo·r freedom and who are willing to bat,tle their oppressive Red Communist governments to get it. Among these heroic peoples of Eastern Europe, a special place belongs to the workers of Poznan, Poland, who on June 28, 1956, revolted puppet atheistic Communist masters in a bold attempt for freedom and self-determination.

Rev. Ralph E. Haugh has only been at Pender for a short period of time, coming to us from the Highland Park United Methodist Church in Richmond. He was born in Maryland, grew up in Pennsylvania but came to Virginia in 1939 to attend Randolph Macon Men's College at Ashland, Va., and has remained in our State since that time. After graduating from Randolph Macon, he took his theological training at Emory University in Atlanta, Ga.,and has been a minister since 1946, a period of 28 years. We at Pender Church hope that Rev.

This concurrent resolution would have no legal or binding effect. It would be an advisory opinion issued by the Congress of the United States. It would be an expression of Congress on how we, as a nation, should proceed in the event of a Presidential resignation. Some will argue that such a congressional action is unjustified. I respectfully disagree. The resignation of President Nixon would spare the country a long and harmful impeachment trial.

379,54,21,STATEMENT BY SENATOR MONDALE I ,"am pleased to co-sponsor the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. NELSON), and to urge its adoption. This issue facing us today-nuclear power plant safety-is of enormous importance to the future welfare of tens of millions of Americans, and to the future of our national energy policy. The nuclear power generating capacity of this country is on the verge of explosive growth, much O·f which will occur in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Although today nuclear reactors provide only about 6% of the nation's electricity, the Atomic Energy Commission projects that, if current plans and projections are met, this figure wm rise to about 20% by 1980 and about 60% by the year 2000. Put in a different perspective, there are now about 42 nuclear reactors operating in the United States, currently producing electricity for the nation. By the mid-1980's, if current projections are met, it is likely that the AEC will be processing each year about as many applications as the entire current nuclear generating capacity in the United States at the present time. In this context, the Price-Anderson Act is of central importance. Orig~nally enacted in 1957, the Act would be modified and extended, under the committee-reported bill, for ten additional years, until August 1, 1987. The committee bill would leave in place the present $560 million limit on liability set by the original Price-Anderson Act, subject to a gradual increase· in that limit, and a gradual phasing out of formal governmental indemnity as the number of nuclear reactors in operation increases. I believe that while, as a general approach, the committee bill is preferB.ible to the present Price-Anderson Act, there is now no pressing need to extend the act for as long a period as the committee has recommended. Indeed, I believe that there are compe111ng considerations for a shorter extension, which will be of no harm to the planning of the nuclear power industry wh1le at the same time allowing the Congress to evaluate both our long-term national energy policy and a long-awaited study on nuclear reactor safety. The two-year extension and modUlcat\.on of Price-Anderson as proposed in the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Nelson), w111 protect the legitimate interests of the nuclear power industry and will not cause disruptions in the planning of nuclear fac111ties. Proof of this is ava1lable from the statements of the proponents of the ten-year extension. For example, Congressman Melvin Price, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, in the Congressional Record of June 13, stated that: ""There is a common misconception that since the Price-Anderson Act will not expire until 1977, there is no need for immediate action. This is not the case. Since the leadtimes for construction permits for nuclear powerplants range from 2 to 4 years, depending on a number of factors, uncertainty on extension of the Price-Anderson Act until mid-1975 could create a significant disrupti>on in ut111ty planning."" And the Joint Committee, in its report on this legislation stated that: The Price-Anderson Act applies only to licenses issued prior to August, 1977. Nuclear power plants now in the planning and design phases would not receive construction permits until about 1977-1978. Thus there is uncertainty as to whether these plants would receive protection in the form of Government indemnity. Reactor manufacturers and architect-engineers are already requiring escape clauses in their contracts to permit cancellation in the event some form of protection from unlimited potential liability is not provided. Action is required soon to prevent disruption in ut111ty plans for nuclear power. In other words, proponents of this measure argue that there is a maximum fouryear lead time before the granting of a construction permit for a nuclear power plant fac111ty, at which time the protection of the Price-Anderson Act becomes operative. They further argue that we in the Congress must provide this four year lead-time in order not to impair the orderly growth of the nuclear power industry. The amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Nelson) would do precisely that. By extending the Act until August 1, 1979, the amendment would allow us to further examine the implications of the Price-Anderson Act next year, both in the light of our developing national energy policy, and the conclusions of the so-called Reactor Safety Study, which will shortly be issued in draft form. and which shoUld shed new light on the safety of nuclear power plant facllities. The Congress could then make a considered judgment by mid-1975 on the form and length of any long-term extension of the Act as might be required. In the interim, the nuclear power industry would be able to continue its planning unhampered, safe in the knowledge that the Act will continue until mid-1979, or more than the four year lead time which the proponents of this measure claim ts necessary.

380,154,21,Mr. BINGHAM.," Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, first I would like compliment the chairmen and the committee on the fine job they have done on this difficult legislation. I take this time to ask the chairman of the committee to clarify a matter that has to do with possible conflict between two sections of the bill. On page 7 of the bill there is a provision that limits a candidate and members of his immediate family to an expenditure of $25,000, and immediate family is defined in the law to include spouse, brother, sister, child, parent, and so forth; however, in the section we have been talking about earlier, on page 2 of the bill we have a limit on contributions to $1,000. Is it the chairman's intention that the limit on the candidate's family expenditure of $25,000 is the controlling section as far as members of a candidate's immediate family are concerned? ",1974
381,154,21,Mr. HAYS.," That is the intent. That is the controlling section, and if the members of the immediate family pool their resources to give $25,000, that is it. But, it does not say that any one of them can give, if there were five in a family, one can give and the others are limited to $1,000 apiece. It is a pooling affair. ",1974
382,154,21,Mr. BINGHAM.," man. $21,000 I thank the chair-The CHAIRMAN. Are there additional eligible amendments to title II? Are there committee amendments to title III? Are there eligible amendments to title IV? COMMITTEE AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. HAYS Mr. HAYS Mr. Chairman, I offer a committee amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Committee amendment offered by Mr. HAYs: Page 79, line 14, Insert ""(1)"" immediately after ""(b) "". Page 79, line 15, strike out ""407,"".

383,154,21,Mr. HAYS.," Mr. Chairman, this is a clarifying amendment to an amendment we had in the bill on the tax return, where there is no income. All this does is make it apply to any taxable year after the calendar year 1971, which is this taxable year. Therefore, it is just to wipe out the slate totally which we intended to wipe out.

Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Minnesota? There was no objection. ",1974
385,154,21,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman, this amendment is very simple in intent. It strikes from the bill the provision that provides for Federal financing of national party nominating conventions. The bill, as it is before us, provides that the party conventions will be financed out of the public Treasury in the amount of $2 million for each of the major parties. In addition, it provides that either party may spend in excess of the $2 million which they receive from the taxpayers' funds. Mr. Chairman, it is my strongly held belief that the Federal Government has no business controlling national party nominating conventions; that it should neither tell the parties of this country how much they can spend, nor should it give them any amount of money to spend. Financing can only lead to control, and we do not need Government control 9f either of our two fine parties. Mr. Chairman, this is a fundamental philosophical point. The parties belong to the people. The parties have been free of the Government. Here, unless we adopt my amendment, we are now attaching them to the bureaucracy. vve would be making them a part of the official Government establishment. VVe would be, in fact, nationalizing the political parties of this great country. Therefore, I believe that it is absolutely essential that this portion be stricken from the bill. I hope the Committee will support my amendment, Mr. Chairman. ",1974
386,154,21,Mr. BRADEMAS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman, we all now know that Presidential nominating conventions, even as our Presidential primary elec-· tions, are an essential part of the process of electing an American President, as important in their own way as is the general election in the fall. I would point out, in urging rejection of this amendment, that we already have public financing of national Presidential nominating conventions in this country because most of the money that finances these conventions comes from tax deductions for advertising, deductions that are taken by various business and labor groups for advertisements published in the convention programs that are distributed at the convention. So the present system is one whereby all of the taxpayers in the country involuntarily pay, through the tax deduction route, for the holding of conventions. However, under the language in the committee bill, only those taxpayers who voluntarily participate in the dollar check-off participate in supporting the public financing of our two national nominating conventions. A second point I would like to make, Mr. Chairman, is that the provision in the committee bill for the public financing of Presidential nominating conventions is the recommendation of the Bipartisan Commission on Convention Financing. This is not a partisan matter. The third point I would like to make, Mr. Chairmar~, is that utilization of public financing is voluntary on the part of the political parties. A political party is not mandated to receive public funds from the dollar check-off system, and if it does not wish to do so, it can use up to $2 million in private funds to finance its convention. Mr. Chairm&.n, it seems to me that if we retain the language in the committee bill, both with respect to Presidential nominating conventions and Presidential primaries, we shall be filling out the initiative that Congress undertook in 1972 in providing that, beginning in 1976, we shall have public financing of Presidential general elections. Surely, the events which are plaguing and afflicting all of the people of the United States now, Democrats and Republicans and Independents, in respect of the events associated with the 1972 ",1974

388,254,21,Mr. LANDGREBE.," Mr. Speaker, next Monday, August 12, there will be a meeting between representatives of the National Federation of the Blind, an organization of 50,000 blind persons, and the National Accreditation Council, a body which receives money from the Federal Government for the purpose of accrediting sheltered workshops for the blind. The NFB has been trying to arrange such a meeting for months, and finally they have succeeded. I would like to include in the RECORD at this point an essay documenting some of the abuses that the NFB has been maintaining the NAC is guilty of: NAC UNMASKED--THE KE>TTNER CASE (By Joyce Hoffa) It is not surprising that the Minneapolis Society for the Blind is accredited by NAC. As a matter of fact, the Society's disgraceful behavior in the Kettner Case merely bears out the Federation's contention that the agencies NAC accredits are among the worst of the lot. NAC would like the world to believe that its standards have some relevance to the nature of programs for the blind. To hear NAC tell it, one would assume that attainment of accreditation means somethingthat accreditation provides assurance to the EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS is blind and to the public at large that the agency in question operates a quality ""professional"" program-that its entire performance has been carefully scrutinized by the best available exoerts in the field and has presumably measured up. How then, does one resolve such a clear disparity between the virtuous characteristics NAC alleges can be expected of an agency which has won its coveted accreditation and the despicable behavior exhibited by the Minneapolis Society. For we are not here dealing with matters of opinion, or philosophy, or procedure, or semantics, or differing constituencies, or too small a meeting room, or any of the 101 other considerations by which NAC customarily weasels away from the issues. The Kettner travesty did occur. The documentation does exist. The Minneapolis Society is accredited. The Society did knowingly and intentionally play fast and loose with minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Society did certify Kettner as incapable of standard competitive productivity. Kettner competitively productive. Do NAC standards really condone such behavior? Do they prohibit it? Do they say nothing about it? Or are the standards themselves merely window dressing on the whole facade -with accredition having nothing really at all to do with the kind of service an agency gives-being instead a function of money, power, and prestige? Or did NAC simply make a colossal mistake in accrediting the Society? Were its ""experts"" incapable of analyzing productivity records? Or did they not dig deep enough-looking only at those things Society officials wanted to show them? Did they not bother to talk to workers in the shop? Or did they talk only with those handpicked workers brought to them by Society officials? Or perhaps were Society officials designated to be on the on-site visit teams slated to review the ""experts'"" agencies? If so, now that it knows the facts, will NAC Withdraw its accreditation? Or Will NAC refuse to acknowledge that Kettner occurred? Let us examine NAC's position for surely even NAC cannot stand idly by in this case. NAC's standards regarding minimum wage payments in sheltered workshops are woefully inadequate. Paltry as they are, the Minneapolis Society fails to meet them. NAC begins by defining a sheltered workshop as ""a non-profit organization, public or voluntary, operated for the purposes of providing work training and employment to blind persons who are unable to meet the requirements of regular competitive employment, or for whom such employment is not available."" (As a sidelight, notice the use of the word ""voluntary."" Presumably this is meant torefer to shops which are more commonly referred to as ""private."" ""Public,"" one can understand, but ""private'' [rightly or wrongly) carries a connota-tion of for the benefit of someone or something other than public. Hence NAC's euphemistic skill comes to the fore, and we have the substitution of ""voluntary"" shop for ""private"" shop.) NAC's definition employs the field's standard rhetoric. Shops are designed for those who are ""unable to meet the requirements of regular competitive employment."" If NAC had stopped there, one could have only minimal quarrel with its definition of the purpose of the sheltered shop. But NAC also envisions the sheltered shop as a fitting place for the blind person who is competitively employable, but for whom ""such employment is not available."" One cannot help but wonder if ""such employment is not available"" because as in Kettner's case and in the Sterner Company's words, ""no one ever asked before."" _No, NAC's definition of the sheltered shop makes it far too easy for the lazy agency to August 8, 197 4 2.10: use the shop as a convenient dumping ground. After all, a status twenty-six closure (federal rehab jargon) is a status twentysix-that is, the state rehabilitation agency gets the same federal credit (""status twentysix: closed employed"") for a pla.cement in the sheltered shop as for the best imaginable job in private industry. The state agency gets credit; the federal statistics get credit; the sheltered shop gets credit; and only the blind worker gets shortchanged and left out in the cold-often at less than the minimum wage. NAC officials would like to have it generally believed that NAC standards require sheltered shops to pay the federal minimum wage. Indeed, on numerous occasions their public statements have attempted to leave this implication: Direct question to Alexander Handel on the floor of the 1971 National Federation of the Blind Convention: ""There is no requirement of NAC standards, is there Mr. Handel, that you have to have minimum wage?"" ",1974
389,254,21,Mr. HANDEL.," ""You have to conform to the Federal Minimum Wage and Hour Law."" Question. ""Are you saying that NAC will not accredit or will withdraw accreditation from any sheltered workshop which doesn't pay its blind workers a minimum wage?"" ",1974
390,254,21,Mr. HANDEL.," ""You didn't understand me correctly. I said that the standards do call for conformance with the wage and hour law."" Former NAC President, Peter Salmon, also found it distasteful to admit that NAC does not require minimum wage payment. His evasion technique was to quote out of context the Comstac Report, page 296, standard ""The workshop pays wage rates commensurate with those paid for similar types and amounts of work by local commercial and industrial establishments maintaining approved labor standards."" He naturally omitted any reference to standard 2.9.1 which makes it clear that payment of wages below the minimum wage is specifically approved: ""Where applicable, the workshop has certificates, from the Wage and Hours Division, U.S. Department of Labor, and from the appropriate state agency authorizing client wages less than the statutory minimum."" In other words, when the whole of what NAC says about workshop wages is examined in context, it is seen that NAC does not prohibit payment of subminimum wages. It merely requires a certain amount of paper work before subminimum payment is allowed. To NAC's credit, however, it must be pointed out that standards 2.10 through 2.10.6 at least attempt (if somewhat vaguely) to require the shop to make an honest, good faith effort to determine the worker's productivity in comparison to similar types of work performed in non-sheltered situations. In view of NAC's dubious ethical behavior in so many instances and in view of the Widespread reports of workshop abuse of wage rate exemption procedures, the question must be raised as to whether standards 2.10 through their application deal so inadequately with the problem because of sheer ineptness on the part of tbe standard writers and appliers or whether there was, indeed, a conscious attempt to leave l'Jopholes. In any case, the Minneapulis Society's behavior is in cl~ar violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and in violation of NAC's public statements that it requires adherence to the provisions of that Act. NAC has repeatedly asked for documentation of complaints against its ·procedures and against its accredited agencies. It has chosen to ignore voluminous documentation presented it. Naturally NAC does not admit that it ignores such documentation. Rather, it uses the curious device of redefining the word ""documentation"" to meet its own narrow specifications. Here, however, is documentation that N.AC must face. It cannot redefine Lawrence 2.10.6 and ",1974
391,304,21,Mr. FULBRIGHT.," Mr. President, as they have always done in times of transition, especially sudden transitions under unhappy circumstances, the American people and Congress are united today in support of our new President, Gerald Ford. With his long experience as a leading Member of Congress, President Ford is uniquely qualified to work in mutual trust and harmony with the Congress, and in so doing to restore unity and confidence in government to the American people. As we offer our assistance to a new President, it is no less appropriate that we offer our best wishes to the departing President, Richard Nixon, along with an expression of appreciation for his contributions to world peace. As was evident. in his speech last night, that is what he hopes to be remembered for. And as one who opposed his Vietnam policy but later came to admire and support his creative and successful initiatives forpeace in relations with the Soviet Union and China and in the Middle East, I believe that hope will be realized. More than any other President since World War II, Mr. Nixon has grasped and acted upon the preeminent necessity of the post-war era. As he enunciated it in his fine speech of last June 5 at Annapolis: ",1974
392,404,21,Mr. DELLUMS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Health Services Act. Title II of this measure authorizes an extension of the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-572). Last year, prior to the passage of the Health Programs Extensions Act, I introduced H.R. 6021-along with 46 cosponsors-to extend family planning services and population research programs through fiscal year 1978. Earlier this year I testified before the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, and I wish to commend the members of that committee for their fine work as exemplified in tl:.tis bill. All of us agree that it is a fundamental human right to decide whether or not to bear or beget a child. The family planning services programs of the Federal Government provides the means by which all people-regardless of incomemay exercise this right. Furthermore, I have not heard anyone condemn either the quality or the cost of family planning services provided under title X of the Public Health Service Act. Members of the committee-and indeed a great many of our colleagues-recognize that these programs provide an excellent and needed service and that they should be continued. No one contends that the family planning project grants are ineffective, too costly or unnecessary. But earlier this year, the Nixon administration proposed an immediate halt to the growth of the program through project grants. HEW announced its intention to finance expansion through title IV-A-social services-and title XIX-medicaid-and to phase out project grants to the maximum possible extent in the near future. This shift, from a health to a welfare orientation, carried with it considerable implications in terms of eligibility for family p~anning services, in terms of standards of care for family planning, and in terms of freedom from coercion, actual or implied. I believe that had the Department's initiative been allowed to succeed, it would have done irreparable harm to what has been up to now a popular, effective program broadly accepted and utilized by low-income women and men. I support the continuation and expansion of the authorization for family planning services project grants because I believe this is the best mechanism for the provision of such services. It was on this crucial point that I was in very basic and strong disagreement with the Nixon administration. I am glad that they decided to listen, and to-finally--support this legislation. Medicaid and title IV -A programs are undesirable as primary vehicles for the provision of family planning services to women who are poor: These are programs in which eligibility is very narrowly defined. These are programs over which we Members of Congress have very little control. They make no pretense of having national standards of medical care. They are national only in the sense that they are made up of an aggregate of 50 welfare programs each having 50 varying State criteria for eligibility and quite different State standards of care. They are administered, for the most part, by State welfare agencies, some of which are not exactly known for their high level of concern for the health and well-being of low-i:qcome women or for their progressive policies with regard to such women and their personal privacy. I do not believe that State welfare agencies which staged midnight ""man in the house"" raids and have been known to threaten or actually force women off welfare rolls, can be trusted totally to insure voluntarism as a basic principle in the conduct of birth control programs. Even if they are, I am. sure that prospective patients would be leery of the intentions of these agencies and reluctant to participate in family planning programs sponsored by public assistance agencies. Furthermore, I fear that the suspicions of those who cry ""genocide"" would all too soon be reinforced if family planning services become too closely associated with these and other welfare programs. It is imperative from my viewpoint, that strong Federal direction and supervision be present in these programs at all times. Let me also point out that there is unanimous agreement that medicaid is an extremely expensive and ineffective program which has failed specifically to provide preventive health services. Many physicians refuse to treat medicaideligible patients, and the relatively few that do generally have incredibly busy practices with little time to give each patient. Women who are poor and must rely on medicaid for their health care needs are neither as knowledgeable nor can they afford to be as demanding of their physicians as can the average middleclass woman. Medicaid physicians canalways refuse services to any recipient if they so choose. We saw what happened in Aiken, S.C., when medicaid women refused to be bullied into sterilization. When the physicians who insisted on sterilization as a condition of their providing prenatal and obstetrical care to medicaid patients were condemned for their behavior, they simply refused to provide services to medicaid patients. The result, according to the Medical Tribune, ",1974
393,654,21,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, the following article from this morning's Washington Post tells about what is happening in a small community in Maryland which may be a result of our ignorance of the effect of industrial chemicals on human health. The article also gives us an excellent example of the human cost which can result from the kind of indiscriminate budget slashing which the Office of Management and Budget engaged in during the last administration. Of the 120 permanent residents of the Little Elk Valley in Maryland, 1 out of 6 has died since 1967. The primary factor in this high death rate is cancer. People in the community have been contracting cancer at more than seven times the rate of other communities in the United States. A prime suspect in this excessive number of cancer deaths is a local chemical plant. Although Congress established an agency in 1971 called the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health to investigate such health problems, the article concludes with a description of how inadequate the NIOSH efforts have been in this particular situation. This is of little surprise to those of us on the Appropriations Committee who have been concerned about the inadequate staffing and underfunding of this agency for some time. Only last year OMB forced a staff cut of 96 positions or almost one-sixth of the entire staff of this agency, which by all accounts was already critically understaffed. The cut was made in blatant disregard to language in both the House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports directing that no cut be made. The Director of NIOSH summed up what was happening to his agency when he was quoted by The New York Times on March 6 of this year as saying: NIOSH is not expanding it is shrinking. It is getting the proverbial meat axe. Our present Laboratory space isn't even adequate for any kind of research. It ls substandard. We have been frozen on hirings for most of our existence and we are losing key staff right and left because we don't have the grade point to promote them. I don't think NIOSH is a viable organization at this time. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS So, it is little wonder that the Federal Government cannot respond to the critical problem of the people of Little Elk Valley. This year the House Appropriations Committee Increased the funding for NIOSH by almost 25 percent over the President's request and directed the administration to increase the number of positions in the agency by 135. This money should have a major impact on the capacity of the agency to investigate such hazards as the one in Maryland, but there are many problems such as adequate Laboratory and office space and sufficient grade point to hire qualified staff which will continue to be roadblocks. Clearly, we are never going to have the kind of research effort that is needed in this area until the White House, the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare all come to understand that the cost of our ignorance in this area is human lives and that study of the health implications of industrial chemicals like those in the Little Elk Valley deserves a much higher priority than it has received in the past. The article follows: [From the Washington Post, Aug. 12, 1974] CANCER, DEATH RATES FOUND HIGH IN MARYLAND VALLEY (By Blll Richards) PROVIDENCE, MD.-No one is quite sure why, but for the past few years the people of the Little Elk Valley here have been dying off at an alarming rate. Since 1967, 20 of the 120 people who have lived here for more than two years have died, according to a study of the Little Elk's population by a local doctor. The ages of those who died range from 5 to 70. That figure puts the death rate for the valley about 2.2 times ahead of the rest of surrounding Cecll County, in the northern corner of the state. More ominous, Dr. Pietro U. Capurro's tabulation shows that at least eight of those deaths, and possibly more, have been from cancer, making the cancer death rate here seven times the rest of the county's 53,000 residents. The county's cancer rate is above average for rural areas in the U.S., according to statisticians from the National Cancer Institute. Suspicion concerning the valley's unusually high death and cancer levels has been compounded by several types of cancers identified here by Capurro, a 49-year-old pathologist and director of the laboratory at Union Hospital in nearby Elkton. The cancers-lymphomas, leukemia and pancreas cancer-have all been linked in the past in various studies and bV medical researchers to exposure to certain indus trial chemicals. Exposure to certain industrial chemicals can lead to cancer that possibly may not appear for 10 or more years, according to Na· tiona! Cancer Institute specialists. All of the cancer victims described in Capurro's report lived within a mile of the Little Elk Valley's only industrial plant-The Galaxy Chemical Company, which has been reprocessing chemicals here since 1961. Paul J. Mraz, the president of Galaxy, described Capurro's findings as ""unsubstantiated"" and ""nothing new"" during a short telephone interview recently. Mraz declined to comment further on the doctor's report or allow a reporter to tour the plant and conduct a lengthier in-person interview, ""I can't make any further comment on the advice of my attorney,"" he said. During the last four years a number or residents including Capurro, who lived in August 12, 1974 the valley for four years until 1972, complained that chemical fumes from the plant had made them ill. Samples of the air around the Galaxy plant, taken by investigators for the Maryland bureau of air quality control after complaints in 1970 and 1971, showed the presence of about 25 chemicals in the valley's air and water that were foreign to the area but that matched a list of chemicals handled by the plant, according to Carl York, head of the bureau's compliance section. One of the chemicals repeatedly identified in the samples, York said, was benzene, a substance that Mraz recently acknowledged his firm had handled in the past and that he said is stlll being reprocessed at the plant. Dr. Herman Kraybill, scientific coordinator for environmental carcinogens (cancercausing substances) at The National Cancer Institute, said benzene is strongly suspected by researchers of being linked to leukemia in some persons exposed to the chemical. Carbon tetrachloride, which Kraybill said has been found to produce liver tumors in laboratory rats, mice and hamsters, was found in other samples taken in the valley by Capurro. The laboratory results with carbon tetrachloride, Kraybill said, ""raises a high index of suspicion as to its human potential."" Mraz recently told a reporter that his firm handled carbon tetrachloride for only one or two weeks in the late 1960s and does not handle the chemical anymore. York said that some other chemicals discovered in the valley were so exotic that they could not be adequately identified and their toxicity was not known by researchers. Neither Capurro nor any other researcher has specifically linked the chemicals found in the valley with the cancer deaths there. capurro, however, said the findings show a strong need for more testing of the plant and the valley's past and present residents. Capurro says he has performed his own tests on air and water samples as well as on blood samples from persons living near the plant. ""I can't say that the deaths in the valley from cancer were the result of specific exposure to chemical fumes,"" he said. ""But there have been a lot of chemicals in that valley's air and water and the blood of those people we tested,"" he said, ""and some of those chemicals cause cancer. And we know there are a lot more malignancies there than you would expect. ""If you're in a room where everyone is scratched and there's a lion in there too, then you've got to suspect the lion."" Capurro is not alone in his belief that something is wrong medically in the valley. State and federal investigators who have been there said that the physical condition of a number of res:idents there is unusual. ""We know ther.e's something up there in the valley that's not right, some sort of a health problem,"" said York of the state bureau of air quality control. ""What we don't know is whether it's coming from Galaxy."" York worked for eight months in 1967 and 1968 as an engineer for Galaxy at the Little Elk Valley plant and is now responsible for inspecting it and conducting air sampling in the valley. He said that until 1971 the company dumped residues from its reprocessing operaation into an open air evaporation pit behind the plant. Among the substances put into the pit, he said, was the residue from the benzene re-processing operation. ""We know that benzene was dumped into that pit,"" said York, ""and there were several other chemicals we suspected were carcinogens. But the whole thing was such a gunky mess that it's questionable whether the company even knew what it was evaporating in there.""

394,704,21,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, the Third International Law of the Sea Conference has been underway this summer in caracas, Venezuela, to update ocean law, essentially unchanged in 350 years. United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim delivered an opening speech which underscored the purpose of this conference-The need to reach a balance which enables us to exploit the riches of the sea while preserving the interests of all ... We must try to ensure that the new law of the sea will endure as the foundation of man's uses of the sea. Mr. President, I would like to report to my colleagues on progress to date at the conference which will draw to a close on August 29 after a 10-week session. Ambassador John R. Stevenson, Special Representative of the President, has headed the U.S. delegation with John Norton Moore serving as Deputy Special Representative. Included in the American delegation are 13 alternates, 16 Senators and Members of the House, 6 educators, 10 congressional staff members, 20 official advisers and a group of experts on petroleum, hard minerals, international law, marine environment, fisheries, marine science and maritime industries. The opening days of the conference were primarily devoted to organization and procedure. The conference general committee designated three committees to handle issues under consideration: Committee !--seabed regime; committee 2-economic zone and all other agenda items not assigned to committees 1 and 3; and committee 3-pollution and research. The plenary session was assigned topics of peaceful uses of the ocean and universal participation in the Law of the Sea Treaty. All committees have considered first, regional arrangements; second, responsibility and liability for damage to the marine environment; third, settlement of disputes; and fourth, peaceful uses of the ocean. The conference established complex rules of procedure whereby a gentlemen's agreement rather than a vote has been predominantly operative. Rules permit deferment of voting on substantive matters until all possible efforts at compromise have been used. General debate, which began on June 28, has addressed a range of issues: ttrritorial seas, transit through international straits, protection of the marine environment, compulsory settlement of disputes and creation of an international regime for nondiscriminatory licensing and exploration of the deep seabed. Particular attention has been focused on consideration of a 200-mile economic zone owing to substantial fisheries interest here in the United States. The economic zone being discussed in Caracas would extend coastal State control of marine and mineral resources within and beneath adjacent waters, while guaranteeing freedom of navigation and allowing foreign fleets certain rights to fish within coastal waters. While supporting this 200-mile economic zone, the U.S. delegation has called for compulsory third party settlement of disputes. This has elicited objection from several coun-· tries and is now being debated. The 200-mile coastal State control would replace the traditional 3-mile limit established in the 17th century and subsequent delineation of a contiguous 12-mile resource zone established in more recent years. Present depletion of various species of fish coupled with inadequate and ineffective international agreements to conserve and manage threatened fish stocks has prompted legislation, such as Senator MAGNUSON's bill, S. 1988, to ad· dress the problem on an interim basis by declaring a 200-mile resource zone. Meanwhile, Mr. President, the economic zone concept has emerged as the preeminent and pivotal issue before the Caracas conference and until an agreement is reached, debate on other policies will not proceed expeditiously. Ambassador Stevenson has also stressed passage of military vessels and aircraft through and over international straits as an issue of major concern. Not only unimpeded transit but nondiscretionary transit is essential to insure unrestricted passage in terms of ship typesubmarine, supertanker, nuclear powered-and destination of cargo. Currently however, debate on these urgent issues has not produced the substantive results anticipated. The licensing aspect of the seabed question has stalemated in committee 1. Committee 2, discussing the economic zone, may complete this session with only a comparative table, not significantly different from the Seabed Committee's report available at the beginning of the conference. Scientific research, handled in committee 3, may not only be subjected to regulation inside national jurisdiction, but outside as well. Ambassador Stevenson has expressed several misgivings concerning the present tum of discussions. Canada, Chile, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Mauritius, Mexico, New Zealand, and Norway have proposed that articles be drafted as a framework for discussion of archipelagic state's rights, territorial sea, economic zones and the continental staff. Ambassador Stevenson, however, holds that these proposed articles are too general for use as negotiable items. · High seas freedom, particularly germane to the question of passage through international straits, has not been clearly preserved in proposals under consideration, according to Ambass,ador Stevenson. In addition, the Ambassador expressed reservations concerning the lack of compulsory dispute settlement provisions and absence of state duties insuring conservation and full utilization of fish stocks. Freedom of the seas has been fundamental to international law since the Dutch jurist Grotius established the principle in 1609. That principle however, derived from Grotius' view of a limitless expanse which ""can be neither seized nor enclosed,"" is not viable in a world of disparate interests seeking to exploit the ocean wealth. The major issues of resources, rights, and responsibilities immediately concern the nations of the world, and the Law of the Sea Conference is seeking to update ocean law to accommodate current and future world needs. Substantive progress in this direction, however, does not seem readily forthcoming. While the final Law of the Sea Treaty should receive our close attention and hopefully provide a step forward in an international approach to global needs, the self-interests of the United States in vital issues of ocean policy must not be ignored in our efforts to achieve international agreement. Mr. President, in order to provide a complete report for my colleagues on the ",1974
395,904,21,Mr. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Chairman, I just want to address myself to one issue raised by the gentleman from Iowa <Mr. GRoss) as to whether agriculture is included with respect to that committee. That particular committee is only intended to concern itself with the export of technology and capital goods. That would not involve agricultural technology at all. My amendment Gontinues the existing language, which is a protection we voted for on behalf of the American farmer two years ago, and one which I think most of the people from the farm States are con-. cerned about. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio <Mr. ASHLEY) for 1 Y2 minutes to close debate. ",1974
396,904,21,Mr. ASHLEY.," Mr. Chairman, I cannot imagine a more deliberate affront that could be rendered by this body to President Ford than to adopt this amendment. The President committed himself last night to continuing the foreign policy of the United States, a foreign policy which, under President Nixon, has engendered great pride, both in this country and throughout the world. If this amendment is adopted, what it is saying to the Communist countries is that it is no longer United States policy to trade with Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the Soviet Union. There will be no trade with these countries. That is what this amendment says. On page 2, line 6, it says-(1) in paragraph (1) thereof striking out 'countries with which we have diplomatic or trading relations, except those countries with which such trade has been determined by the President to be against the national interest' and inserting 'market economy countries and friendly nations-except nonmarket economy countries'. This is a deliberate slap at the President of the United States, and I should think that those who support it should be ashamed of themselves. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BLACKBURN) as a substitute for the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the gentleman from California <Mr. HANNA). The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it. RECORDED VOTE ",1974
397,904,21,Mr. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The vote was taken by electronic de-cerning the limitation of armaments, the fact remains that the U.S.S.R. and her allies continue to represent the only significant threat to our own national security in the world today. In recognition of that threat, the House has just passed last week the largest defense budget in our history. The Communist leaders, whether in Moscow, Peking or elsewhere, have never abandoned their own ideals or aspirations which clash directly in almost all important respects with our own basic commitments. Therefore, to provide the nearly unlimited flow of technological assistance to the Soviet Union, which is what our trade policy has degenerated into, we build up the very nation which directly threatens us. The direction the Soviet rulers continue to push their economy in is obvious in several recent reports. The Christian Science Monitor on July 24, 1974 pointed out that even-Pravda disclosed that the output of consumer goods in some of the largest enterprises of Ukrainian heavy industry amounted to less than one percent of the total. Where the Soviets are directing their industry is evident in their continually escalating military spending and unlike the United States they do not have to allocate as much of their defense budget to manpower. The August 5, 1974 edition of Newsweek reports that the military budget of the Soviet Union will steadily rise to $93 billion by 1975 while that of the United States is expected to be approximately $86 billion that same year. The report notes-The bulk of. the Soviet increase will go to replace existing ICBM's and to develop a new generation of missiles for future use. Those new missiles can only be regarded as threatening our own security. Yet without the passage of this legislation we will continue to export to the Soviet Union precision ball bearing grinding machines, computer technology and other ingredients that are vit~l in the production of modern weapons of war. If we had had the restrictions contained in the National Protection Act several years ago we probably now would not have to be spending as much money as we are now on our national defense. But by transferring military technological assistance through alleged peaceful trade, we have contributed to the Soviet development of MIRV's and thereby necessitated greater outlays by ourselves to counter a growing Soviet strategic threat. The Soviet consumer has not benefited from this trade policy and ob-. viously the American taxpayer and borrower have suffered as well. With the passage of this legislation we can and must bring an abrupt halt to this inde· fensible export policy. <By unanimous consent Mr. FoLEY yielded his time to ",1974

402,1054,21,Mr. PATMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present to the House this conference report which represents a great victory for the House conferees. There were some 21 meetings of the conferees on this bill over the past month attempting to do the difficult job of reconciling some 370 items in disagreement. The conference report contains the new community development block grant program, a new housing assistance program, increase in the FHA mortgage limits, liberalizing of FHA downpayment requirements, strengthening of our rural housing programs, additional funding for the 701 planning program, and liberalizing of the real estate lending authorities of Federal savings and loan associations and national banks. Mr. Speaker, the conference on this bill, as I have previously stated, was a long and difficult one. I would like to commend all of the House conferees for their patience and persistence in seeking to develop a bill which would meet with the approval of the House. I believe that this housing and community development bill is one of the finest housing bills that has been presented to the House, and I would, at this point, yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr .. BARRETT), the chairman of the Housing Subcommittee, to explain the major provisions of the conference report. ",1974
403,1054,21,Mr. BARRETT.," Mr. Speaker, the conference report on S. 3066, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, is the result of a long series of meetings held by House and Senate conferees over the past several weeks on a most important and far-reaching bill. Although both the House-and Senatepassed bills dealt with similar HUD programs, there were in fact great differences in approach between the two bills. The conferees dealt with more than 300 substantive differences between the two bills, and I believe that the resolution of these differences was as fair and equitable to both Houses as was humanly possible. In this statement, I would like to outline the major areas of difference between the House and Senate bills and briefly explain how these issues were resolved. TITLE I-cO:MMUNITY DEVELOPMENT Both the Senate and House bills consolidated a number of HUD categorical programs providing community development assistance to large and small communities· throughout the country. Both bills established a system of grant entitlements-the Senate bill generally through a ""hold-harmless"" approach, under which communities would have been assured of a certain level of funding annually; the House bill through a relatively complex formula-based on population poverty counted twice, and housing ov~rcrowding-accompanied by holdharmless provisions generally similar to the Senate bill. The conferees accepted the House ap .. proach with a modification in the treatment of the ""model cities"" component of the ""hold-harmless provisions. Under the conference bill, model cities grant recipients will receive a declining per·centage-80, 60, and 40 percent-of their average annual grant under the model cities program for a 3-year period following completion of the community's fifth action year. Th9 conferees believe that this resolution of the model cities issue is fair both to the 147 model cities communities and to the many communities throughout the country which must be assured reasonable access to community development funds. Both the Senate and House bills contained provisions designed to assure that communities would utilize block grant funds to address high priority national goals and objectives. Although the specific provisions of the two bills differed in significant ways, the thrust of both bills was clearly to channel community development funds toward long-established and identified national goals. The conference report merged these differing provisions to clarify this intent. Each community applying for block grant funds must-First, identify its community development needs and objectives in accordance with areawide development planning and national urban growth policy; Second, formulate a program of activities to meet those needs, together with estimated costs and general location of such activities; and Third, submit a housing assistance plan (surveying the housing needs of lower-income persons, specifying the number of units or persons to be assisted including the proportion of new, rehabilitated, or existing units, and indicating the general location of housing for lower-income persons; and Fourth, describe a program of activities designed to eliminate or prevent slums, blight, and deterioration where such conditions or needs exist; and to provide improved community facilities and supporting health, social and similar services where necessary and appropriate. The Senate bill authorized $2.8 billion in fiscal year 1975 and $3.3 billion in fiscal year 1975, $2.65 billion in fiscal year 1976, and $2.95 billion in fiscal year 1977, with additional special transition grants of $100 million annually for the above fiscal years. The conference bill authorizes $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1975, $2.95 billion in fiscal year 1976, and $2.95 billion in fiscal year 1977, with special transition grants of $50 million annually for the first 2 fiscal years and $100 million for the third fiscal year. The conferees believe that these authorization amounts are reasonable and necessary to continue and expand community development activities throughout the country. The bill also requires ",1974
404,1104,21,Mr. HARSHA.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman for accepting the amendment. I would like to close by saying here that most Federal projects are required to file such statements, and I see no reason why these public mass transportation projects should not be controlled by the National Environmental Policy Act. Ms. ABZUG. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike out the last word. Ms. ABZUG. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend Mr. HARSHA for bringing this amendment to strike out section 506, the provision exempting projects funded under this act from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and which directs the Secretary of Transportation to assume those functions. I also want to compliment the chairman of my committee, Mr. BLATNIK, for accepting this amendment. This is the amendment that was originally made by me in committee and was defeate~. It is also the subject of supplemental v1ews in the report accompanying this legislation signed by myself together with my colleagues Messrs HOWARD, RoE, VANDER VEEN, and TRAXLER. I include those SUPplemental views to indicate the reasons I originally brought this amendment and why myself and my colleagues support this amendment: SUPPLEMENTAL VIEWS OF REPRESENTATIVES .ABZUG, HOWARD, ROE, VANDERVEEN, TRAXLER Section 506 of the proposed legislation includes a provision exempting projects funded under the Act from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, including the preparation and circulation of environmental impact statements on major actions significantly affecting the environment. Instead, Section. 506(b) directs the !Secretary of Transportation to assure that certain environmental, economic, and social effects of the project have been considered. This approach is unnecessary, unwise, unworkable, and a dangerous precedent for the Committee to set. . It is unnecessary because no case can be made that environmental impact statements have caused delays in the implementation of the program. According to the records of the Council on Environmental Quality, which is given the responsibllity to oversee implementation of the Act, the total number of actions to which UMTA has filed impact statements in the last 4Y:z years is nine. That comes out to 2 impact statements a year. That is hardly an administrative burden, and in fact raises a question about whether or not UMTA is really meeting its responsiblllties under the Act to any significant degree. Some have argued that NEPA has delayed UMTA projects. To the degree this is true, it seems to us the problem lies not with impact statements, but with internal administrative delays blamed on alleged environmental reviews that the public never sees. The answer to this is improved internal procedures, and perhaps an investigation by this Committee into what is really the cause of these delays. Exempting the program from the major external review of environmental impacts available to the public does not seem a well-directed response by this Committee. The approach is unwise because it ignores the value of open review with agencies and the public of alternative transit plans and prograins available to localities throughout the country. The debate over how to provide for future transit needs is really just beginning in many cities. Among the options most have to consider are use of existing rail systeins, new rail systems, bus routes, expanded bus service, and other special services. The decision among these alternatives is one in which the public should have a say. Thus, it is the spirit of our proposed legislation to take the decision away from Washington and the vagaries of the Office of Management and Budget and to put it where it belongs with the people. The NEPA process, including the use of environmental impact statements, can be a useful tool in doing this. If we exempt these projects from NEPA, we have in effect chosen to replace what by law is required to be a straightforward consideration of alternatives with a set of slick promotional displays put together for presentation to the community by the proponents of one system over another. The approach is unworkable because it seeks to substitute a vague procedure of administrative findings of environmental effects by the Secretary of Transportation for the well-established and widely understood requirements of NEPA. Several hundred court cases have in the past four years made reasonably clear what is required in an impact statement, and the process is evolving and maturing into an important new tool for the public to use to hold accountable their public officials. To substitute the subjective and vague language of Section 506 (a) and (b) for this set of well-established standards simply means we will need to spend the next five years litigating what the Congress meant for the Secretary to do. Finally, the approach is a dangerous precedent. There has not yet been a broad exemption from NEPA like this applied to any public works program by this or any other Committee of the Congress. Even at the height of the energy crisis, cooler heads prevailed and NEP A reviews, while modified to take account of emergency measures required, were kept intact. To write this exemption for a program that sorely needs the kind of public overview of alternatives that NEPA requires seems particularly inappropriate. It is the foot in the door for the exemption of environmental reviews of other public worlcs projects. Before long we could well see this precedent applied to highways, water resource projects, sewer programs, and every other major construction program funded by the Federal government. Transportation plans must be made with an eye to the future and must be rigorously scrutinized as to the impact of a system on all elements of a community's socio-economic and environmental needs. To exempt the projects under this bill from NEPA will seriously weaken the entire transportation planning process. This is a serious flaw in an otherwise landmark piece of legislationa significant first step in the history of public mass transportation. Agreed to supplemental views: B'ELLA S. ABZUG, JAMES J.

406,1104,21,Mr. STUDDS.," I appreciate the gentlewoman's yielding. Mr. Chairman, I fully support this amendment. At the same time, I think that the record ought to reflect that this Member is not-and I suspect a great many other Members are not-at all happy with the lack of expeditious consideration of the environmental impact requirements by the Department of Transportation, particularly by UMT A. Mass transit projects are in and of themselves environmental pluses. It is ironic and, I think, unfortunate that in many cases-and in Massachusetts we have a glaring example of this-efforts positively to improve the environment have been delayed in the very process of attempting to assess their environmental impact. I fully support the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio, and I am delighted that he offered it. I think it would be a serious mistake in this or any other major piece of legislation to override the National Environmental Policy Act. At the same time, this Member wants to go on record as strongly desiring that the Urban Mass Transit Administration proceed with a good deal more speed than it has in the past in expediting projects which are designed positively, explicitly, in and of themselves, to improve the environment of this Nation.

409,1204,21,Mr. HUGH SCOTT.," Mr. President, David Broder's Sunday column in the Washington Post is a reminder that there were many men and women of great integrity and capability who worked in the Nixon administration-people who really devoted themselves heart and soul serving the country. As we make this transition from one administration to another, we would do well not to lose sight of this fact. Broder suggests that what these outstanding public servants need now is compassion, not stigma. I concur heartily with this evaluation, but I would add that they also deserve our thanks. I ask unanimous consent that David Broder's column be printed the to in RECORD. There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE ""NIXON PEOPLE"" (By David S. Broder) This has been a grim week for many people in Washington, but particularly for those men and women who worked in Richard Nixon's White House during the past five years. Some were still there on Monday, when the President belatedly admitted that he had kept from them, and from his lawyers and from his congressional defenders and from the American people, the full truth about his involvement in the Watergate cover-up. These men and women looked ruin in the face right along with him, and felt the added pain of betrayal. Others were working elsewhere--some of them having left the President's service by their own choice and some of them having been driven out by others who, 1n their arrogance, had convinced Mr. Nixon that the exiles were not ""team players"" by the peculiar standards of fitness those formerly mighty presidential aides chose to define. Wherever they were and however they had come there, last week these men and women shared a common burden-the knowledge that for the rest of their lives, they would always be identified as ""Nixon people."" For them, there is a special irony in the title of Carl Bernstein's and Bob Woodward's fine best-seller about the Watergate case. ""All the President's Men."" They know-if no one else does-that it was only a handful of the President's men and none of the President's women who were responsible for the scheme that brought their administration to ruin. And they know, with a special poignance that no outsider can fully share, that it need not have been. ""What I still can't understand,"" said a presidential aide seated in a West Wing office at mid-week, ""was how such stupidity and such superb accomplishment could exist side by side for so long."" Those who were still working for Mr. Nixon this week, when the roof caved in on their last hopes that the evidence might somehow exonerate him, face problems 1n the future as difficult as the task of rationalizing the past. ""Face it,"" one of them said, ""this address is not exactly the best reference to give your prospective employer."" But those who covered the White House during the years of Richard Nixon know that there was as much devotion and dedication to public service in that building as there has been in past administrations. And the historical record would be more than incomplete-it would be grossly distorted-if those guilty of the grossest arrogance and abuse of power in the Nixon White House were allowed to stain the reputations of those who set a far different standard for themselves. Any reporter who worked there could do what I have done just these past few minutes: jot down on a piece of paper the names of those he admires for their work for Mr. Nixon and the country. The problem is that any list is partial and prejudiced-and there is a danger that those omitted may be damaged unwittingly by the implication that somehow they are less deserving of praise. But let me take that risk and enter the blanket disclaimer that those mentioned here are exemplars of many more who served their country well in the Nixon White House. One thinks of those like Bob Ellsworth and John Sears, who joined the Nixon cause in the mid-1960s, when there were more risks than rewards in doing so, and were rewarded for their loyalty by being exiled early from the White House by men who were not their moral or intellectual peers. One thinks of Bryce Harlow and Mel Laird and Herb Klein and Bob Finch and John Davies and Jim Keogh and John Whitaker. friends and associates of Mr. Nixon long before his White House days, who somehow were elbowed away from infiuence in the Oval Office. One thinks of the congressional liaison staff, of Bill Timmons and Ken BeLieu, and Dick Cook and Gene Cowen, of Blll Gifford and Max Friedersdorf and Tom Korologos, men who earned the respect of the lawmakers with whom they worked, despite their constant uphill battle for recognition within their organization. One thinks of the domestic policy staffs from Pat Moynihan and Steve Hess and John Price through Ken Cole and Ed Harper and Lew Engman. One thinks of the writers, like Lee Huebner and Ray Price, and the lawyers, like Len Garment and Fred Buzhardt, and of politicians, like Harry Dent and Bill Baroody and Jerry Jones and Anne Armstrong-who put in every bit of their effort and ability, but did not park their consciences at the door. One thinks of Jerry Warren, suffering with few complaints in the no-man's-land of the war between the press corps and the President, but unfailingly courteous and patient in his own dealings. He and many others not mentioned here deserve far better than they got. They worked their hearts out for the President, and it is sympathy-not a stigma-they are entitled to now.

412,1304,21,Mr. STENNIS.," Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much for his remarks, and I especially thank him for his contribution to this question about the hopper dredges and their availability where they are needed. I know last year when we were having the floods in the Lower Mississippi Valley, these hopper dredges saved our lives, so to speak, by keeping the channels open. We intended in no way to discredit or downgrade the study that is being made with reference to what would be the best course in the future. Our position is that we must have something now, and we . want these hopper dredges to be available. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his helpful attitude. ",1974
413,1304,21,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President, will the Senator yield for just a moment? ",1974
414,1304,21,Mr. STENNIS.," Yes, I yield. ",1974
415,1304,21,Mr. HATFIELD.," I would just like to underscore what the Senator from Mississippi has stated, because he cites one of the most important examples of how the hopper dredge can respond to an emergency as compared to a pipeline dredge under private contracts which would have to go out on a bid basis. In some instances, it could take 90 days for bid process, whereas the hopper dredge can respond immediately where we have shoaling following storms. When we had the floods in the Mississippi River area, if it had not been for the possibility of transferring immediately hopper dredges into the Mississippi area, those ports could not have been maintained. Therefore, I think it is fundamental to understand that not only does the hopper dredge operate on the bar and outside the bar, but it can, under emergency circumstances, operate inside the bar, and it must be free to do that. This has been part of the difficulty we have had in trying to define the language of the moratorium. ",1974

He has remarks that he wanted make, if he could have been here on the floor this afternoon, but he sent them to me to voice his objections, particularly to one item in this report, and I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the remarks of the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. COOK) be included in the RECORD at this point.

418,1304,21,STATEMENT BY SENATOR COOK ,"Unfortunately, I am necessarily absent during the Senate's consideration of House Report No. 93-1274, the conference report accompanying H.R. 15155, making appropriations for public works and power development and for other purposes. Had I been present today, I would have been able to explain in detail why I would be compelled to vote nay on this report. I do request my remarks be included in the RECORD at this time. I would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the Public Works Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee for his gracious consideration of the many water resource development projects in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I know he and his staff have worked very hard to resolve the many problems as they relate to projects in the commonwealth. I am especially grateful for the chairman's assistance in deleting funds for the Red River Lake project in Powell County, Kentucky, from the Senate's version of H.R. 15155. However, I regret the determination of the conference committee to include $500,-000 for continued construction of the project. I remain convinced the construction of the lake is neither in the best interest of my State or the Nation. I realize my colleagues do not normally involve themselves in disputes that are of strictly local interest and take the lead from the Senator whose area is most directly affected. However, I believe the Red River Lake project warrants further scrutiny so the record will be clear. Upon my return next week I will address in detail the inherent problems associated with damming Red River. ",1974

420,1304,21,Mr. NELSON.," Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Public Works Appropriations Subcommittee <Mr. STENNIS) a question concerning funding for a project that is contained in this bill. As the chairman knows, there is pending litigation involving Locks and Dams No. 26 on the Upper Mississippi River. This bill contains a $22 million appropriation for the project. Is it not correct that the language of the conference report is not intended to affect that litigation or have any bearing whatsoever on the merits of that case? ",1974
421,1304,21,Mr. STENNIS., The Senator is correct. ,1974

423,1304,21,Mr. STENNIS.," Mr. President, as far as I know, this covers the matters that are up for discussion. The rollcall votes on this matter have been overwhelming, Mr. President. In other words, the bill passed the Senate in its original form by a vote of 78 to 17. The House had passed the bill by a vote of 374 to 21, and the House established and approved the conference report by a vote of 376 to 12. So in view of this, and this being a unanimous report by the conferees, I do not think it is necessary for us, as managers of the bill, to ask for a rollcall vote, unless someone else wishes to.

436,154,26,Mr. MOSS.," Mr. Chairman, I opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I do not think it is necessary for me to lay my credentials on the line for openness in Government and I do not intend to, but this amendment, while well intentioned by its sponsors in my judgment is the fashioning of a straitjacket and the providing of more ways of closing meetings than opening t~em. I have had a fair amount of experience both in chairing committees and in dealing with matters of disclosure and ~ondisclosure of information to the pubhe. I served in the same body as the distinguished gentleman who preceded me in this well, and during my service in the California Legislature we had no closed meetings. I do not know what happened after I left, some 16 years later, when. he became a member of that body, that It ha.d closed meetings. But I have been voting here in this House for the reforms that were true reforms that made committee meetings open. a~d we now operate in our Committee on Inters~ate ~nd Foreign Commerce most of the time Just as a matter of course with the committee being open. I ~o not think anyone wants to close meetmgs, but the invitations here to close. them are certainly numerous. In chairing the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the Committee on Intersta.te and Foreign Commerce, where I have had the jurisdiction over the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Product Safety Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, under (E) (2), and (3), I can well imagine that I would have a confrontation on almost every occasion by someone who would want to protect the so.called trade secrets. It (1), It is interesting what we here in this country call trade secrets. We all know how sensitive the petroleum industry is to trade secrets. Material they may even file with the governments of the Provinces of Canada and make widely available to all persons there, that same material is carefully foreclosed from public availability in the United States, because it is a trade secret. A trade secret can have to do with any cost figure or estimate of production, or almost anything one can think of can be called a trade secret. So as I look at this proposed change in the rules of the House, to the sponsors I say their intentions are noble, their words are confusing, they could have said in far fewer sentences much more with greater impact, and this amendment out of all charity ought to be defeated.

439,154,26,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for the gentleman from California. I serve on the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce with the gentleman. I know the gentleman from California conducts reasonable, rational, and thorough hearings when he prepares legislation for markup. What we are trying to do is provide an opportunity for committees such as ours and the subcommittee such as his to exercise judgment in this regard. If the committee in the work of markup decides there is no danger in its deliberations of exposing trade secrets or no danger of getting itself involved in a regulatory case when it is not proper to do so, then it is perfectly reasonable for the committee to determine that its meeting be an open meeting. This is exactly what we are trying to accomplish. ",1974
440,154,26,Mr. MOSS.," Mr. Chairman, let me say to the gentleman, as I said earlier, I have had a great deal of experience in chairing committees, investigating committees. We have one rUle of this House that says where a person feels that his reputation might be injured, he may request an executive session.

What we were trying to do was achieve maximum openness in meetings; but at the same time recognize certain limitations with respect to one kind of meeting' the markup session. What we ultimately decided is that a hearing ought to be open completely with the narrowest of exceptions, because a hearing produces the evidence that comes before the Congress, that the people of the United States are entitled also to know about, in order to determine why we made our decision and on what facts. There is not any excuse for closing a hearing for anything, except in narrow areas like that of national security. If there is a trade secret involved, the witness does not have to disclose it in the hearing. He can say he has a trade secret. Ordinarily nobody would push him on the point. If he insisted, he might even have the right to refuse to reveal it. Mr. !CHORD. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? ",1974
446,154,26,Mr. ECKHARDT.," Yes, surely. Mr. !CHORD. The gentleman there is only one place---",1974
447,154,26,Mr. ECKHARDT., I am getting to two others. . Mr. !CHORD. Does the gentleman not agree with the gentleman from California (Mr. Moss) that w~ are going to subject a person to ridicule by this process? ,1974
448,154,26,Mr. ECKHARDT.," If the gentleman will permit me, those are the other two points. There is one point on national security, one that recognizes that wholesome provision that was put into our rules in order to meet the old problem of the Dies Committee when persons were being investigated for alleged personal matters, and aprobrium resulted from their merely being called and interrogated in public as to whether they were Communists. Our rules say that hearings that would subject a person to aprobrium may be closed. The third exception is with respect to typical housekeeping matters within the House. What this does is enlarge the possibility of opening a hearing to another very broad exception. It says that a hearing may be closed if it will disclose information relating to trade secrets or financial or commercial information pertaining specifically to a given person, or the information is required to be kept secret in order to prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such person. So, what we are doing is giving the committee a right to close the hearing in a case which the present rules wm not permit the committee to close the hearing. The whole argument 'for openness was that no matter how much the committee wants to close the hearing, the committee should not be permitted to exclude the people of the United States from knowing what Congress was acting upon. It just passes my understanding that men can get in this well and say that: this amendment is for openness, that it 'increases openness, when in fact, as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. FASCELL), ",1974
449,204,26,Mr. STEPEN A.," JANGER, Director of Special Pro!}f'ams, Close Up, Washington, D.C. DEAR STEVE, I want to express to you my sincere appreciation for being responsive to my proposal to bring Close Up to Delaware County and for the tremendous week that we had learning about our democracy. From our initial discussion you were aware of the risk since we are a small county with only twenty-nine public, private, and parochial schools but you stm came. This decision to come reflects the purpose of Close Up which is to go wherever there is a community which wants its students and teachers to participate in a truly great learning experience. Words cannot express the iinmense happiness which I saw on the faces of the students and teachers. Despite the demanding but worthwhile and exciting schedule, the majority of students and teachers wanted another week (at the minimum) to learn more about their government and to exchange ideas with the speakers, the Close Up staff, and other students. Since our return, I have learned that students have already met to plan an agenda for their involvement in local government. During this week, I saw students and teachers with difierent interests, opinions, and aptitudes come in contact with one another and, to the best of my knowledge, really get along. Indicative of the cohesiveness of the students is that they are planning a picnic. I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to your fine staff for their responsiveness and interest on behalf of the students and teachers. Watching your very capable program director, Margery Kraus, with her enthusiasm and energy despite her pregnancy of seven months really gave me a personal lift because I sometimes felt tired. Let me conclude by again expressing my sincere appreciation. Close Up 1s a great and needed program designed to give young people and teachers a learning experience which they wlll never forget.-Certainly 1 won't. Continued success.

450,204,26,Mr. SYMINGTON.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday's article in the Washington Post concerning the cancellation of my appearance as the speaker at the annual dinner of the Georgetown University Alwnni Association in St. Louis has prompted many colleagues to inquire into the circumstances. Accordingly I am placing in the RECORD here below both the article itself, and the relevant correspondence as it appeared in the st. Louis Post Dispatch following the cancellation: [From the Washington Post, October 7, 1974] SYMINGTON TALK INVITATION WITHDRAWN (By Martin Well) An invitation for Rep. James w. Symington ( (D-Mo.) to speak at a dinner of Georgetown University alumni was withdrawn after objections from antiabortion groups. Symington had been invited by representatives of the university's St. Louts alumni club to speak at the 23d annual John Carroll awards banquet, to be held in St. Louis on Oct. 19. The St. Louis club withdrew the invitation in August after receiving protests that appeared to center on the abortion issue, a Washington-based omcial of the university's alumni association said last night. Named for the university's founder, the banquet honors distinguished alumni, and is held annually in various cities throughout the nation under joint sponsorship of the local alumni club and the university's national alumni association. Abortion proved a major issue during Symington's successful campaign last summer for renomination to the house seat he has held since 1969. Both Symington and his opponent, John P. Doyle, professed a personal abhorrence of abortion, but Symington spoke frequently about the complex legal issues involved and during the campaign last summer said, ""I believe abortion ought to be confined to cases of rape and incest and danger to the health and well-being of the mother."" He came under strong attack from anti-abortion groups. In cancelling the invitation to Symington, the local alumni club acted independently of both the university and the national alumni association, said Joseph K. Dowley, director of programs for the national group. ""The way they felt was if they had picketers, or any unpleasantness outside, it would detract from the whole program,"" he said. ""Although other people in other capaci· ties might have decided a difierent way, we weren't out there and don't know the difficulties that faced them ... "" he added. Dowley said that the invitation was withdrawn not to stop free discourse, but to prevent any incident from detracting from the dinner's purpose-to honor five distinguished alumni. He described the university itself as having a quite liberal speaker's policy, under which students have heard from ""everybody from Abby Hoffman to you name it."" About 300 to 350 persons are expected to attend the banquet. Symington has been replaced as the main speaker by the Rev. Edward O'Donnell, editor of a Catholic news • paper in St. Louis. In response to the cancellation of the invitation Symington, who could not be reached last night, reportedly expressed concern over the abll1ty of pickets to prevent a congressman from speaking and college alumni from listening. He was said to have suggested that a university and its alumni should be ""among the last to succumb to such tyranny.'1 Georgetown is a Jesuit-sponsored institution with about 50,000 alumni. Symington, an Episcopalian and a resident of the st. Louis area, is a graduate of Yale College and columbia University Law School.

455,354,26,Mr. HOLLINGS., I yield to the Senator from Utah. ,1974
456,354,26,Mr. MOSS.," I thank the Senator from South Carolina for yielding to me. Mr. President, I rise in support of the proposed amendment. This is a commonsense piece of legislation whose need is clear. The Commerce Committee's hearing record documents in ample detail the anticompetitive dangers of allowing oil companies to own deepwater ports. The joint report succinctly describes these risks to competition and consequent potential losses to consumers. Therefore, I shall not take up the Senate's time with a recitation of facts which have been set down with great eloquence and detail on the public record by the Senator from South Carolina. Every Senator knows that putting the oil companies' hand on the deepwater port spigot means tightening the majors' stranglehold on the industry. The bill itself acknowledges that deepwater ports in oil company hands are a threat to competition, by giving a preference to non-oil licensees. I ask the Senate not to stick its head in the sand and hide from the oil companies on this issue. The time has long since come when the U.S. Senate should say to ""big oil,"" ""enough."" Some might argue that, despite anticompetitive dangers, oil company ownership must be allowed because only the oil companies will have the capital to bear the risk, construct, and maintain such facilities. To so argue would be to capitulate to blackmail. To so argue is to permit a further accretion of power in hands already too strong. The necessity of oil company ownership is a contention not borne out by the record. Others might argue that adequate protection of the public interest is secured by the preference the bill grants to nonoil company licensees. To so argue is to acknowledge the problem but evade our responsibility to solve it. Similarly, to rely on prelicensing antitrust review' by executive agencies to protect the public interest is to avoid a forthright solution. None of us is blind to the influence the major oil companies hold in the councils and decisions of the Government. Why should we pretend, when facing this crucial problem,that the Federal agencies will be immune from pressures in making their antitrust decisions? No one who has so much as read a newspaper the last few years would believe such a thing. To so pretend is to slough off to another part of the Government, with a hope and a whistle, our responsibility to promote the public welfare. I am tired of seeing the Congress give away its powers in such a fashion. I hope that, by now, my colleagues are as well. They can show it by voting to adopt this amendment. The Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Delaware, our colleagues, have so eloquently stated the case that there is not much I can add. to emphasize But the thing I wanted and underline, which has been stated well by both of my colleagues, is this matter of integration that we already suffer from the oil industry. The Senator from Delaware was kind enough to mention the fact that this has been bothering me for a long time in my efforts as a consumer advocate, as chairman of the Consumers Subcommittee. As we looked into this oil picture, we found out that the same companies are exploring for, drilling for, producing oil and transporting it to refineries, refining it and transporting it again to the retail outlets, and selling it at the retail outlets, and then we find it is controlled from the very ground right to the end, and the element of competition is gone. Now, the one thing that our whole economic structure in this country is built on, and the reason we say we have the best kind of economic structure, is competition, and competition is what enables us to get the lowest price for the consumer, on the one hand, and to require efficiencies and all kinds of improvements along the way by the producers and the sellers in order to deliver at the lower price. That is what we would be giving up here. I think the Senator from Delaware said it very eloquently. We already have concentration, why should we add one more facet to it, permitting the oil companies to own or control the deepwater ports? If we are going to have any opportunity in this country to bring petroleum prices down or back in range of consumer interests, we must do it through this competition factor. Therefore, I agree with my colleagues, both of whom have stated this so eloquently, that it is time we restored a measure of competition in this industry, at least in this facet, and also to show the people of our country, the people of the United States, that we do not simply sit back and let the oil companies go their way, the big integrated oil companies. Now, of course, they will continue to utilize this means of delivering oil to us. The bill itself recognizes that there is this element possibly of preference because it sets out the A, B, C listing and puts them finally down into the C category. I think that is an admission that there is this element of monopoly that would intrude into the delivery of oil that is imported into this country. Therefore, I strongly support the amendment that has been offered. I ",1974
457,404,26,Mr. FRASER.," Mr. Chairman, I believe it is worth noting that the legislation now before us reduces by $5 million the amount originally appropriated for the special food service programs for chi!. dren. This program, which falls under the child nutrition section of title IV, coordinates nationwide meal distribution at day-care and summer feeding projects, along with various Head Start programs which were incorporated into it in January 1974. Originally, the conferees on H.R. 15472, which Mr. Nixon vetoed on August 8, had allocated $30 million for the special food service programs. That amount has been cut to $25 million, thereby prohibiting expansion into new projects and even placing many existing ones in jeopardy. Furthermore, the present bill's increase of $9 million over last year's appropriation is deceptive, since most of the additional funds will be spent toward meeting the raise in the maximum reimbursement rate for program outlets which went into effect on July 1. Inflation, then, not additional meal services, will be the recipient of the present increase. The Minnesota example serves to illustrate these points. The Department of Agriculture has informed the Minnesota program that their initial funding estimate for the State for fiscal year 1975 is $660,842. This is little more than half of the State agency's actual estimate of operating costs for the year, which amounted $1,225,031. Furthermore, the Minnesota program director notes that the agency ""allows no expansion of the progra.m and does not include the $111,581 to cover approvable applications from sponsors who did not participate in the program last fiscal year, nor does it provide for potential sponsors who have not yet made application."" Current participants in Minnesota are concerned at the budget deficiencies that will arise if the State is forced to spread its meager allotment among all of the existing programs by reimbursing sponsors at a rate far below the maximum permitted rate in this time of astronomical food prices. For a detailed analysis of the inadequacy of the funds now available and the administrative flaws in the present system, refer my colleagues to Senator HUMPHREY'S statement in the April 24 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD urging a generous appropriation for this program when the original bill was debated. Mr. Chairman, I urgently hope that to I ",1974
458,504,26,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, President Ford's economic address to the Congress demonstrated once again that his administration, like the Nixon administration, does not begin to appreciate the causes and complexity of our economic problems. Inflation continues to soar at the same time we are rushing headlong into depression. Yet the President continues to rely on voluntary restraint and minor adjustments in our tax structureapproaches which will be wholly inadequate even with full cooperation from the Congress and the American people. Our economy requires more than minor adjustments. Instead, it requires radical surgery, based on the recognition that the domestic economy is bound inextricably to our international policies. We are now paying the price for decades of mllitarism abroad and monopoly capitalism at home. As long as these policies persist, the causes of inflation and potential depression will remain. The understanding missing in President Ford's address is provided by Mr. Sidney Lens, a proliflc author on both domestic and interna· tiona! affairs. His article, which appeared in the October issue of the Progressive, follows: RUNNING OUT OF EVERYTHING (By Sidney Lens) Comedian Frank Darling says, ""The way to get prices up is to tell you there's a shortage. There's a shortage of gas, a shortage of wheat, a shortage of paper-and the greatest shortage of all is the shortage of truth."" One can hardly argue with this reflective observation. The National Association of Manufacturers, not celebrated for its sense of humor, last year distributed a poster that read: ""Yes, we have no bananas, steaks, eggs, blue jeans, candles, gas, tennis balls, freezers, wheat, leaJther, air oor .. ditioners, fuel on, pajaxnas, floor covering, sardines, chicken, paper, hot water bottles. . . ."" The poster added a touch of whimsy to an increasingly unfunny problem.

460,554,26,Mr. CLARK.," Mr. President, the oil crisis is back in the headlines. In recent appearances before the United Nations, President Ford and Secretary Kissinger emphasized the serious consequences of continued high oil prices. It was a matter of serious concern at the economic siunmit meeting. And in the past few we·eks a number of meetings in Washington and elsewhere have dramatized the re-newed concern of the oil importing nations-rich and poor-over the seriousness of the situation. A year ago, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries shut off their oil exports, we were worried that we would not have enough oil to keep our economy going, and our major concern was to get the OPEC nations to start selling us oil again. It is now clear that the reopening of the oil spigot by the Arab nations has not ended the crisis brought on by the actions taken in the past year by OPEC. It may now be worse than ever. Recent meetings of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and others have made clear the concerns that, unless something is done to change the situation, the economies of their country and almost every other oil importing nation are in serious trouble. According to some observers, it wil.lbe as bad or worse than the Great Depression of the 1930's. The high oil prices currently being commanded by the OPEC nations threaten to bring about economic and political chaos throughout the world by creating serious !nft.ationary pressures, by destroying what is left of the international monetary system, by creating serious recessions or depressions in the developed nations which import oil, and by absolutely devastating the economies of the developing nations. The gravity of the situation must be understood by political leaders everywhere, because they all have a stake in what is happening. Inflation, recessions, depressions and the political, perhaps military, turmoil they bring will not be limited to a few nations. They will severely damage all nations, including those who currently control the world's oil production. The immediate cause of this turmoil is the quadrupling of oil prices by the OPEC nations in recent years. This means that oil importing nations will spend $100 billion for foreign oil in 1974-5 times as much as they spent in 1972. The most obvious and immediately painful domestic manifestation of this development is inflation and all that it implies. Higher oil prices have meant reduced real incomes for nearly everyone the United States, with especially serious consequences for those with already low incomes. They have been a major factor in the 5 percent fall in real earnings for the average worker last year. Additionally, the impact of high oil prices continues to spread through the economy, since oil is used in the pro-· duction or distribution of almost every component of gross national product. However, as serious as this is, it is only the beginning of the problem. The high price of oil is also generating unemployment and recessions. Since the oil is :Jei::lg imported, raising its price has exactly the same effect on the level of economic activity as a tax increase. It causes unemployment by taking money out of the economy, in the same way a tax increase can cause unemployment. High oil prices, therefore, have the double-barrelled effect of simultaneously causing inflation and unemployment. Coupled with the restrictive monetary and fiscal policy brought on by inflation, this should be sufficient to cause serious recessions in many countries. This dual impact of high oil prices was one of the major concerns expressed by many of the pa:ticipants at the economic summit conference. Prospects for the developing nations are even worse. They will spend $15 billion to import oil this year, versus only $5 billion in 1972. This $10 billion difference exceeds all the foreign aid received by these countries last year. Thus, the impact of higher prices is worse than if all their foreign aid had been cut off. If we add to that the unusually high cost of food, we can see the impending disaster. On top of these internal problems. there is the impact of higher oil prices on the international monetary system and on the world trade in general. We learned recently that our balance of payments ran a deficit of $2.74 billion in the second quarter of this year. Oil import-. ing countries are now running an oil deficit of $100 ""!)illion annually, and the total deficit over the next decade may reach $1 trillion. How can this deficit be paid for? It seems impossible· that exports can be increased enough to compensate for this. If the oil importing nations simply increase their exports to each other, it will have no effect at all on their net balance of payments deficit, put there is the danger that a trade war will be generated by each country's trying to save itself by itself. And the OPEC nations will not import enough from their oil customers to make much of a dent in this $100 billion. The most obvious solution to this would appear to be lower oil prices, and there can be little disagreement that this would help. But how much, if any, reduction in the price of imported oil is it reasonable to expect? Even a drop of $2 or $3 a barrel, which may well be the most we can realistically hope for. will still result in a continued massive oil deficit or balance of trade deficit. This is an extremely unstable situation. These huge deficits cannot continue indefinitely, but there is no guarantee that whatever changes do occur will result in a higher degree of economic stability or equity. To many people, worldwide economic and political chaos is inevitable, unless rapid and dramatic steps are taken to resolve these difficulties. There are, however, many responsible and well informed individuals who do not accept this forecast. They believe that, while the situation is serious, with many consequences, very unpleasant consequences, economic ruin is not likely. It is argued that the dislocations caused by high oil prices are so painful principally because they occurred so rapidly. If the increase had occurred gradually over a 10-year period, the world's economy would have adjusted to those changes without much difficulty. At least, many would so argue. It will take a few years to adjust to the sudden increase, but the adjustment will be made, in large measure as a result of natural economic forces-the interaction of supply and demand. High oil prices will lower oil imports and consumption and provide great incentives for conservation, exploration for new oil, and the search for alternative sources of energy. It is impossible to do much in i~1 ",1974
461,604,26,Mr. JAVITS.," Mr. President, I introduce the Emergency Social Services Amendments of 1974, a bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act, to increase the availability of social services for the poor and others during the period of projected economic hardship. This measure is a special emergency authority designed to increase the avail-ability of social services for the poor and others who could otherwise fall into the ""poor"" or ""near poor"" category or face other hardships as a result of inflation and other elements of the economic crisis by-Increasing the social services ceiling, set nationally at $2.5 billion, to $4.0 btllion during each of the fiscal years 1975 and 1976; and Providing for redistribution of social services funds from States that do not use their allocations to States which require and can effectively use more funds than allocated, to meet the special needs of their citizens. Mr. President, following upon his earlier statements that he would meet the problems of those hardest hit by inflation and any down-tum ""with compassion,"" President Ford, as the fifth point in his economic address to the Congress this past Tuestday, stressed: ""Helping the casualties."" But his program to do so-while great in spirit-is inadequate in provision. During this period of economic crises-which the President des·cribes as ending with the Bicentennial, thus through fiscal year 1976-the poor and others in need are going to be hit by what one economist has called ""stagflation,"" high unemployment coupled with high inflation. To meet the first of these enemies of the poor, the President has proposed an expanded program of unemployment benefits and a new Community Improvement Corps, providing public service employment. The administration's unemployment program is clearly inadequate in terms of the amounts of funds to be availablean aggregate of $2.2 billion for about 300,000 jobs-using a cost of $7,000 per annum-if unemployment reaches a level of 7 percent nationally-for 3 consecutive months-compared with $4.0 billion for 500,000 public service jobsusing a cost of $8,000 per annum-at 6 percent national unemployment which I have proposed, with 14 cosponsors, in S. 2993, the Emergency Energy Employment Assistance Act of 1974. The administration's plan is also questionable in that it would be administered through a new program insufficiently tied to the very successful mechanism of State and local prime sponsorship established under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973. Moreover, it is only a 1-year authority, although the crisis, in the President's own words, is likely to last for 2 fiscal years. But be that as it may-and I shall fight to insure that it is not ""as it may,"" but as it ""should be""-joblessness is only one of the hardships that the ""casualties"" are facing and will face. The second is inflation itself, as President Ford noted in his address to the Congress: Now, I know that low-income and middleIncome Americans have been hardest hit by Inflation. Their budgets are most vulnerable because a l·arger part of their income goes for the highly infiated costs of food, fuel and medical care. To address this situation-which was considered so heavily by the HEW panel ",1974
462,654,26,Mr. HASKELL.," Mr. President, recently an article by Mr. Stephen S. Rosenfeld appeared in the Washington Post en-titled ""Bilingualism and the Melting Pot.""

No funds are presently included in the Supplemental for this purpose. Our amendment consists of the following: $400 m1llion for approximately 57,000 transitional public service jobs (at the Committee's estimate of $7,000 per annum per job) to be provided by some 400 State and local governmental prime sponsors under title I of CETA. (As passed by the Senate, the HEW-Labor appropriations bill for fiscal year 1975, now in Conference with the House, authorizes $1,505,000,000 for title I, of which $155,000,000 is intended by the Senate to provide approximately 22,000 public service jobs. The House provided $1,680,-000,000 for title I, which funds prime sponsors may use at their discretion for public service jobs or job training.) $100 million for approximately 14,000 transitional public service employment opportunities for areas of ""substantial unemployment"" (areas having an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent for more than three consecutive months) under title II of the Act, (Under the HEW-Labor Appropriations, as passed by the Senate, $400,000,000 would be available for approximately 57,000 jobs; the House bill provided $350,000,000, the amount of the Administration's request, for approximately 50,000 jobs.) We consider these additional funds to be crucial in Ugh t of the increase in the national unemployment rate from 5.4 percent in August with 4.9 persons unemployed, to 5.8 percent in September with 5.4 mill1on unemployment. Many experts, economists, and offi.cials in the Administration have predicted levels even higher, perhaps even as high as 6.0 percent, by the end of the year. Combined with our request, carried over fiscal year 1974 funds for public service employment, and those that would be available under the Senate version of the HEW-Labor Appropriations b111, an aggregate of about $1.5 b111ion for aproximately 226,000 public service job opportunties could be provided in this fiscal year. Yet that amount would reach only about 5.6 percent of the 5.4 mlllion currently unemployed. Experience under the public employment program (""PEP"") conducted under the Emergency Employment Act of 1971, and more recently through the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973, demonstrates that transitional public service employment programs can provide meaningful, not ""dead-end"" employment for the unemployed, and meet real, not ""make-work"" pubHe servtce needs; most crucially, testimony before the Subcommittee on Employment, Poverty and Migratory Labor indicates that appropriated funds can be translated into worthwhile jobs within thirty days of allocation. This amendment will be otrered as a modiftcation to our original Amendment# 1957 to the Supplemental Appropriations Act (see attached). ",1974
473,854,26,Mr. MATSUNAGA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report to accompany S. 3044, the proposed Federal Election Act Amendments of 1974. The legislation before the House today represents literally years of work by many dedicated people both in and out of Congress. It is our best and most constructive response to the terrible abuses of Watergate. I congratulate the gentleman from Ohio <Mr. HAYS) and the other hard-working members of his committee, for the fine job they did on this landmark bill. In my judgment, S. 3044 represents a major step forward. While I regret that public financing was not extended to House and Senate election, I believe the legislation before us today will lay the groundwork for public financing of all Federal elections. The conference report provides for a strong and independent commission to oversee all Federal elections and the Federallaws pertaining to them. It also provides for reasonable limits on both campaign contributions and campaign spending. This is certainly a welcome new change in our election laws. Most significantly, by adoption of the pending conference report and final passage of the bill, S. 3044, we will have insured that Presidential campaigns will not be dependent on huge gifts of money. from special interest .groups or individ-uals. We will have eliminated a major weakness in our elections which led to Watergate. No one can seriously doubt that the passage of the pending Federal Elections Campaign Act amendments will help restore the faith of the American people in their Government, a faith which has, perhaps, been strained more by the events of the past 2 years than at any other time in our history, We will, by passage of this act, restore the seriously damaged linkage between the electorate and elected public officials. The bill is by no means a panacea for our election ills, but it certainly is the right medicine at this crucial moment for an ailing system. I urge the adoption of the conference report. ",1974

476,904,26,Mr. MEEDS.," I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. TAYLOR of North Carolina. In response to a statement made just now by the gentleman from California, let me state there are about 250 Indians living on the 518 acres, but they also have in addition to the reservation some 2,540 acres which is in an entirely dif~ ferent location. They also Have the right to use the land for traditional uses, that is, for grazing, hunting, fishing, burying the dead and their burial grounds, 250,000 acres which is part of the Grand Canyon National Park and no one proposes to take this right away from them. We intend to let them have these tra~ ditional rights. If we are setting a precedent let it be that justice is done-",1974
477,904,26,Mr. MEEDS.," Mr. Chairman, I would like to address myself to one aspect of this matter at this time, that is what the Havasupai gave up and what they thought they were giving up in the acceptance of the award of the Indian Claims Commission. The gentleman from Washington (Mr. FoLEY) is absolutely correct. In 1946, when the Indian Claims Commission Act was passed, it was an effort to give money for land and, therefore, the Claims Commission was prevented from giving the Havasupai Indians this land as an award. They, however, relying upon a 1942 Interior Department decision and opinion. felt that their title was not extinguished; but even at that, in their dealings with the people who passed the act under which they took the money for their claim at 50 cents an acre, they depended upon those people to pass special legislation for them which would give them their land. Everyone who had dealt with this matter and who has looked at the record will find very clearly that the intention of Senator FANNIN from the other body and all the other people who worked on that matter at that time clearly intended to come in with special legislation which gave the Havasupai some land, because this could not be done by the Indian Claims Commission. Therefore, the Havasupai took their claim. But what did they do with it? They refused to accept at 50 cents an acre the money which is covered by the land we are here talking about, out of a claim for 2,500,000 acres that they had. They have refused to accept the money for years now, and that ought to be very clear evidence of their intent that they never intended to lose the title to this land. The record of the hearings in the other body, the record of the markup is very clear that, as soon as that claim was settled and paid, it was the intention of the sponsors of the legislation on the other side to come in with such legislation giving the Havasupai title to the land we are here talking about; land which, incidentally, they have lived on for over 1,000 years; land which they have treated better than most conservationists would treat it; land which is their home. That is the real crux of this controversy. It is not whether there is a deterioration of park values; it is human values, the values of these peoples' home. ",1974
478,904,26,Mr. STEIGER of Arizona.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Chairman and attentive colleagues, I agree with whoever it was-! think the gentleman from Oregon-who said that this matter is going to be decided mostly by people who have not heard the discussion, but I think the record at least ought to have a few of the bottom-line facts in which I am afraid have been ignored up to now. What we are talking about here is changing title to 459 Indians, title that is now in the National Park Service and National Forest Service, and putting it in trust for this tribe. Now, those Members who are not blessed with very tight connections to the Sierra Club will not understand the sheer horror of this statement. But, they have got to understand that there are people-and they are unique people-the environmental activists-! have a friend on this side who calls them the ""Green Bigots,"" which I think is patently unfair and I want the record to show that. They are not bigoted just things green, they are bigoted about prac·tically everything. I would like to make the equation, the impossible position this particular bill puts them in, and one frankly which I really delight in. The great number of these environmental activists are people who have a difficult time spelling ""canyon,"" for example or certainly ""Havasupai,"" but they profess a great love for mankind and certainly great concern for the future. But, here they are, willing to deny 459 impoverished people title land because the transfer of the title from one agency to a secretarial trust offends them. So, the human values are abandoned and the crocodile tears are found only for the administrative transfer. I will tell tne Members that there is no magic Forest Service administration and none in the Park Service administration. My friend from Oregon told us there were 40 million acres of forest in jeopardy as a result of these 459 avaricious, land-maddened people. That is not sophistry; that is just baloney. There is no other tribe in the United States that qualifies for this particular situation. They have had the use of these lands continuously from a period prior to the time of the granting of the to forest permit, and of course hundreds of years prior to the time of the granting of the award by the Court of Claims. As a matter of fact, if there were a tribe somewhere in this country-and there is not-that had a Forest Service permit and that had only 518 liveable acres to live on, and were starving to death, and we could help them by transferring the land to that tribe, I wcmld lead the fight to do that, because I do not see any jeopardy at all in trying to help people with a simple administrative transfer. The fact is, not one single acre is in jeopardy. What is in jeopardy is the prerogatives of the Forest Service, the prerogative of the Park Service. If anybody is in jeopardy here, it is the innate greed and innate blind parochial selfinterest of the departments and bureaucrats. I will only tell the Members that if they do not want to give these Indians the land, do not be seduced by the false statements that were made by the Sierra Club people going around today talking about a HUD plan that is really a State plan, that has already been refused by the Indians, by the July 28 resolution. Do not deny them the land because of the false statement of the Sierra Club, because you think they will jeopardize 48 million acres. That is not a fact. If you do not want to give them the land because you do not like Indians, that is one thing, and in that instance you would be truthful to your convictions. There is an obsession here that really ought to upset you, but I do not think it does. At any rate, the Sierra Club once again has been proven wrong. Those people who would defend the bureaucratic prerogatives at the expense of human values are really out of reach with the times. ",1974

481,904,26,Mr. RHODES., Would that land be held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior? ,1974
482,904,26,Mr. STEIGER of Arizona.," This land would be held in trust, and the Secretary is mandated in the legislation to approve any plan for any change in the use of the land. ",1974
483,904,26,Mr. RHODES.," So a tramway, or any device like that, would have to be adopted by the Secretary of the Interior. In other words, this is not in the control of the State of Arizona or the tribe itself. The Secretary of the Interior would have the last word and he would be bound by the legislative record that is being made here tonight. I agree with what has been said earlier, I do not want any tramways, or anything unsightly. ",1974

487,954,26,Mr. ROUSH.," Mr. Speaker, I am today introducing a concurrent resolution implementing President Ford's request before Congress for a target spending limit to help combat inflation. This concurrent resolution would establish a traget for budget outlays for fiscal 1975 in the amount of $300 billion, the amount proposed by the President. I believe that this is a realistic goal to aim toward since the Congress has already in its completed actions to date reduced the President's estimated budget outlays by $1.5 billion. I believe this resolution is clearly consonant. with the expressed will of the· Congress when we passed the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. That legislation actually provides for a congressionally determined spending target to be voted on a yearly basis. By passing this concurrent resolution we simply acknowledge the fact that although the new procedures envisioned by that legislation are not effective until 1976, the intent of Congress is to henceforth set budget targets and to try to keep budget outlays within those targets. Asking for the target spending limit President Ford promised that when Congress agreed to set a spending target he would submit a package of budget deferrals and rescissionn to meet this goal that-He would do the tough job of designating for Congressional action . . . those areas which I believe can and must be reduced. These Will be hard choices, but no federal agency, including the Defense Department, Will be untouchable. After the President makes these proproposals it will then be up to the Congress to review these budget deferrals and rescission requests, once again in the spirit of the new reform legislation we passed this year. The power of the purse is ours alone in the Congress. That authority carries a heavy responsibility. I have opposed any ceilings or targets for spending which were not initiated by the Congress and which did not provide for congressional determination of any cuts to be made. If a target is to be set, and it is needed, let us do it for ourselves responsibly. Finally, this concurrent resolution while not a binding agreement, certainly funds could be obligated beyond this proposed target ceiling if necessary, is a restraint and a guideline, a goal toward which we can direct ourselves. Passage of this resolution puts the Congress on record as willing and anxious to reduce the inflationary pressures by Federal spending. ~utting SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM (Mr. MADDEN asked and was given permission to extend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and to include extraneous matter.) ",1974
488,954,26,Mr. MADDEN.," Mr. Speaker, while the Congress seems to be in a reform mood and there are so many stories about the actuarial unsoundness of the social security program, we might well cause an in-depth study into the need for reform in the social security system. Many persons, Mr. Speaker, rely on their social security checks, unfortunately, as their entire retirement income. If the demagogs in our body who for political reasons continuously seek to raise the amount of the benefits without providing the wherewithal to finance them, the ""trust fund"" could well go bankrupt and create a shambles of the entire system. I am attaching hereto, Mr. Speaker, an editorial opinion which appeared in the August 19 issue o.f Business Insurance, entitled ""Now Let's Reform Social Security."" This editorial first appeared in the August 12 issue of Pensions and Investments and I think it should be read by all Members as well as the general public. The editorial follows: Now LET's REFORM SOCIAL SECURITY it has Now that Congress has almost finished its work on reform legislation for the private pension system, we believe it's time it got down to another major problem: reforming the Social Security system. In its new pension reform legislation, the Congress has demanded fiscal responsibility of the private pension system, yet shown little or no such responsibility With the Social Security system. It has greatly increased the system's benefits, without increasing the taxes to pay for them. According to one recent estimate, by 1990 the average worker and his employer will each be paying $2,070.45 into the system each year, but the system will be paying out $20 billion more in benefits than it takes in. And even these figures are based on obsolete assumptions, so the picture is probably far worse. According to the Wall Street Journal, deficits on the order of $20 billion a year could arrive by 1980. Meanwhile, treasury department figures show that the unfunded liabiltty of the Social Security system is already $2.1 trillion. Will Congress insist that this be funded over 30 years or 40 years as it insists companies fund their pension funds' liabilities? What does Social Security have to do with the private pension system? First, as the extent of the troubles of the system grow, the government could well eye the assets of the private pension system as a source of a much needed transfusion of new assets. Some well informed authorities in the private pension system feel that absorption of the private system by Social Security is perhaps less than 10 years away. Second, if action is taken to put the Social Security system back on a sound financial footing, the taxes willt certainly have to rise. This will be an added drain on the corporate treasury. The longer ·this is delayed, the greater will be the drain. At the same time, Social Security benefits will have to be held steady or even cut back, so that the private system's benefits will have to carry the load of keeping pace with infiatio . There is no doubt that putting Social Security back on a sound financial basis Will hurt the company and the employe through higher contributions. But it is infinitely prefer111ble to absorption of the private system by the government. As we have pointed out in the past, the costs will rise even more if the private system is swallowed up by the Social Security system. Government bureaucracies are notoriously inefil.clent compared with private enterprise, and this will certainly be true in the administration of pension assets. Further, the Social Security system, at least as presently regulated, can't invest in corporate securities, or even treasury bills. It thus misses a chance to grow with the economy, or to earn higher returns. Companies will have no control over increases in benefits which they now negotiate with their employes. And they will have no say in the timing of the payments into the system. We believe that the pension industry-that is, pension fund trustees, administrators, managers and actuaries--can act to prevent the demise of the private pension system. The industry can first of all publicize the disastrous financial condition of the Social Security system to members of the private pension system, and explain what it means to the average worker. The workers should be told that the Social Security system at present is a giant chain letter which must get more expensive if it is not to break down sometime in the future, since there Will be fewer workers to carry the loa.d. Those who wm still be working in 1990 should be gravely concerned. This warning could be achieved through corporate communications programs and public relations efforts such as speeches at well-reported conferences. Further, the industry brought a great deal of pressure to bear in Washington in an effort to influence the shape of the pension reform legislation. A simtlar effort should be mounted to influence Congress to take a new look at the Social Security system-from its objectives to its methods and its future. Congress should be exposed to the work of actuaries such as Geoffrey Calvert, a consulting actuary in British Columbia, Robert Kaplan of Carnegie-Mellon University and Roman Weil of the University of Chicago. These men have exposed the Social Security system and the dangers it is presenting. Getting a member of Congress to vote against a Social Security increase is like asking for a vote against motherhood. Many members of Congress seem to think that such a vote would jeopardize their political futures. But this can be overcome if the industry can make a sufficient number of workers concerned about the condition of the system and how it could affect them. When the workers realize that if the company's private pension plan is absorbed by government system, their benefits at some stage will have to be reduced to a level lower then they now expect, Congress will hear about it. If action is taken immediately to better fund the system, taxes will have to rise by 50 or 75 percent, according to Kaplan and Well. But that much medicine now is better than a lot more later. And it would probably allow a reserve to be bullt up. This reserve could be invested in higher-return investments than the flower bonds, and the return might eventually lower costs. We believe reform of the Social Security system is an urgent rna tter deserving the attention and efforts of all who are interested in preserving the private pension system. We also belleve that united effort on the par:t of a.ll on lines suggested above wlll be effective 1n influencing Congress to ca.n-y out that reform. Let's not leave it until it is too ",1974
489,1004,26,Mr. HANSEN.," Mr. President, the American Dental Association have a rightful interest in the Professional Standards Review Organizations procedures under terms of the Social Security Act. Because of that interest and concern, I am introducing legislation today addressed to that problem. Representatives of the American Dental Association testified before the Senate Finance Committee that while the law establishing Professional Standards Review Organizations applies to ""health care services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part"" under the Social Security Act, it excludes members of the dental profession from any meaningful participation in the program. The concern of the association is serious and substantive since a significant number of its members are providing several hundreds of millions of dollars in dental services under title V, XIX, and XVIII. With respect to institutional services, inpatient hospital admissions for dental care are well over a million per year. Additionally, as my colleagues know, the law contemplates and permits expansion of PSROs to ambulatory services which eventually will involve all of the Nation's 100,000 practicing dentists in the PSRO program. The direct effect upon the dental profession would increase manifold if any of the major pending national health insurance bills should be enacted since all of them have a tie-in with the PSRO provisions of title XI. It does not seem reasonable or sensible that the dental profession should be subjected to this highly complicated and exacting ""peer"" review system without having any representation in its development, operation, and adjudicatory functions. The report of the Senate Finance Committee on the original PSRO bill clearly indicates an intent that only dentists should review the work of dentists, but unfortunately this was not carried over into the language of the law. In order to remedy this problem, the ADA has proposed a suggested amendment which would provide: First, that in order to be approved a PSRO would be required to have a formal arrangement with dentists in a given area that is coextensive in all respects with the requirements relating to medical services; second, that dentists be appointed to the statewide councils and the national council; and third, that dentists be included in the limitation of liability section of the law. Mr. President, I am introducing the proposed amendment because it is essentialif dentists are to be required to meet the requirements of the law. The American Dental Association's 115th annual session will be held here in Washington during the week of November 10-13, at which more than 20,000 dentists and their families will be in attendance. I am pleased to introduced this proposed amendment to PSRO language to provide for the review of dental services by dentists and I urge its timely consideration.

",1974
490,1004,26,Mr. BEALL.," Mr. President, I am sending to the desk legislation that would amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to extend the time for the submission of certain studies and recommendations of the Federal Council on the Aging to the Congress. In Public Law 93-29 which was signed into law on May 3, 1973, the 15 member Federal Council on the Aging was established to advise the President, the Congress, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Commissioner on Aging on matters relating to or affecting the well-being of our Nation's senior citizens. In addition to its general oversight responsibilities, the Federal Council on the Aging was mandated by the law to conduct a series of special studies which are to be submitted to the President and/or Congress within a specific time span. Two of these studies were to be completed ""no later than 18 months after enactment of this act."" However, the nominees for the Federal Council on the Aging were not submitted to the Senate until March 27, 1974. Senate confirmation occurred on June 5 and the Council members were sworn in on June 25. The first meeting of the Council occurred in August and they have been confronted by a number of matters that have required their immediate attention. Thus it will not be possible for them to complete the studies on the interrelationship of benefit programs for the elderly and the impact of taxes on the elderly by November 3, 1974. Mr. President, the legislation I am sending to the desk would amend section 205 (g) and 205 (h) to extend the due date for these reports from November 3, 1974, to December 1, 1975. Mr. President, I am delighted to be joined in cosponsoring this legislation by my distinguished colleagues Senators BIBLE, BROCK, BROOKE, DOMENICI, DOMI• NICK, EAGLETON, FONG, HANSEN, JAVITS, Moss, PERCY, SCHWEIKER, TAFT, and WILLIAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that section 205(g) and section 205 (h) of Public Law 93-29, the text of S. 4138, and the letter from Secretary Weinberger transmitting this proposed legislation to the Congress be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in .the RECORD, as follows: ""(g) The Council shall undertake a study of the interrelationships of benefit programs for the elderly operated by Federal, State, and local government agencies.

491,1054,26,Mr. CLARK.," Mr. President, on October the American University hosted a symposium on world food and population, entitled ""To Nourish Humanity."" Under the directi·On of Dr. Darrell Randall, director, International Administration for World Human Needs, the American University, and cochaired by Dr. Howard R. Cottam, visiting professor, the American University, 60 experts and concerned individuals gathered to give their views on the world food crisis and what they hoped would be accomplished at the World Food Conference in Rome, November 5-16. These opinions represented a variety of background and expertise. Today we are faced with food shortages and an increasing number of people who are malnourished or starving. Each week the world must feed 1.4 million more people. And each week the cost of increasing worldwide agricultural production becomes greater and the resources needed to do this become more scarce. In an increasingly interdependent world, international solutions must be developed to deal with these problems. The World Food Conference provides an opportunity to do this. The American University has performed a great public service in focusing attention on this problem and thereby better informing all of us. I commend the summary proceedings to my colleagues. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the REcORD. There being no objection, the summary proceedings were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: To NOURISH !iUMANrrY (Summary proceedings of a Symposium on World Food and Population, the American University Campus, Oct. 7-8, 1974) INTRODUCTION With increasing clarity there 1s a global focus on the modalities of nourishing humanity. The theme and format of this symposi urn ""To Nourish Human! ty"" reflects the purpose and the agenda of the forthcoming World Food Conference: To increase food production where there are scarcities, to improve nutrition of the neediest and to provide food security for everyone. The Plan of Action of the recent World Population Conference emphasized nutrition and development. The crux of the world food problem is limited resources unevenly accessible to a burgeoning population in a world divided by jealously guarded sovereign rights and boundaries. Notwithstanding decades of concerted effort there are more malnourished people than ever before, nearly a ha.lf-blllion by conservative criteria. Something is out of focus. Governments will debate and decide on appropriate action in 'November on the basis of an agreed assessment of the world food situation. Americar. University arranged this Symposium to a.nalyze the U.S. role ""To Nourish Humanity."" Sixty concerned and informed professionals presented addresses in four plenary sessions, ten panels and one technical presentation. More than 500 individuals registered for the Symposium and many participated actively in discussion and debate. In a welcoming address to the Symposium participants, Dean Morris W. H. Collins, Jr., of the College of Public Affairs of The American University, declared that a modern university can not sit idly by while millions o1 persons starve. ""A university, with all its vitality and resources,"" he says, ""has much to contribute toward answers to world problems. We intend to work with others in the intellectual field with technical assistance ... Our School is called a School of International Service and we make no apologies for that name. A university in a modern society has a service role to play."" In order that the Symposium presentations-and reaction inspired among other Symposium participants-might be widely shared before the World Food Conference next month, this summary of proceedings has been compiled by a group of experienced rapporteurs and quickly, if modestly, reproduced. As would be the case in any such selective process, one might argue the validity of some Symposium themes identified as highlights here. Our purpose, however, was not to produce a definitive record of proceedings but to carry one step further, now, the process of debate and dialogue so vital to formulating U.S. policy responsive to the global challenge of nourishing humanity.

AUTHORIZING THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR TO PURCHASE PROPERTY LOCATED WITHIN SAN CARLOS MINERAL STRIP ",1974
493,1154,26,Mr. UDALL.," Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's desk the bill (H.R. 7730) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to purchase property located within the San Carlos mineral strip, with a Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona? There was no objection. The C'lerk read the Senate amendment, as follows: Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert: That the Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the ""Secretary"") is hereby authorized and directed to acquire through purchase within the so-called San Carlos Mineral Strip as of January 24, 1969, all privately owned real property, taking title thereto in the name of the United States in trust for the San Oarlos Apache Indian Tribe. SEc. 2. The Secretary is authorized and directed to purchase from the owners all range improvements of a permanent nature placed, under the authority of a permit from or agreement with the United States, on the lands restored to the San Carlos Apache Indian Tribe for the reasonable value of such improvements, as determined by the Secretary: Provided, however, That, if any such range improvements were constructed under cooperative agreement with the Federal Government, the reasonable value shall be decreased proportionately by the percentage of original Federal participation. Such permanent 1Inprovements shall include, but not be limited to, wells, windmills, water tanks, ponds, dams, roads, fences, corrals and buildings. The Secretary shall take title to such range improvements in the name of the United States in trust for the San Carlos Apache Indian Tribe. SEc. 3.

Mr. Speaker, I take this time in order that I may announce the program for the remainder of the day and for next week. This is in agreement with the minority leader and the minority whip. Today, we will take up the Ways and Means conference reports which have been scheduled. Following that, we will take upS. 3838, debt obligations conference report. There may be one or two other items to be called up by unanimous consent. We would then take up 1-minute speeches and adjourn for the day, to meet on Tuesday next. On Tuesday next, we would proceed with the remainder of the program as the Members have had it for this week, adding it S. 3979, additional housing funds. We anticipate at this time that there will be a veto by the President. The veto, we think, is coming over during the weekend. Consequently, it would be on the floor, we believe, for action on Tuesday. to ADJOURNMENT OVER TO TUESDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1974 Mr. O'NEILL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on · Tuesday next. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?

There are these Ways and Means conference reports, and I understand from the acting chairman that they are noncontroversial. When we get through with those, we will take up S. 3838, which is debt obligations. If there are any unanimous-consent requests or something of that nature, there is a possibility that they may be brought up. Then we will have 1-minute ",1974
495,1254,26,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker, in the last few weeks, I have talked myself blue in the face in an effort to counteract the powerful interest groups who oppose the expansion of rice production in this country. These people do not seem to be concerned with feeding a hungry world or a hungry America. At this point, I would like to share with my colleagues a letter from one of my constituents which perhaps states the point better than I ever can: ",1974
496,1304,26,Mr. HILLIS.," Mr. Speaker, at a time when the Federal Government needs to seriously review its spending programs, I would like to share with my colleagues the following editorial which appeared in the Anderson Herald: STOP FOREIGN AID When anyone advocates elimination of foreign aid, the cries and howls of liberals can be heard from coast to coast. Rarely, if ever, do they comNorth with any facts or figures justifying our foreign giveaways. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently issued a report that should be disheartening to every American. The committee has recommended an authorization 0'! $2.5 b1llion for certain economic, military assistance and credit sales programs. That amount is only part of $8.5 billion in total foreign aid proposed for the current fiscal year. Americans have grown numb to such figures over the years. When individual items in the proposal are studied, however, they could prompt a few hard questions. One proposal calls for $15 milllon in American tax dollars for outright m111tary assistance to African nations. What value do we receive from $11.3 million in military aid to Ethiopia, or $70,000 to Ghana, or $100,-000 in arms to Liberia? How in the name of common sense can we justify $50,000 to Mall, $860,000 to Morocco, or $300,000 to Zaire. The $300,000 to Zaire is equivalent to the total income tax paid by 200 middle-income families. In piecemeal fashion the American taxpayers have become saddled with providing an annual allowance for more than 100 countries. It has been proposed that taxpayers provide in economic or mmtary aid this year, $2.2 million to Upper Volta, $17.2 million to Afghanistan, $7 million to Nepal, and $232 million to Turkey. If that isn't enough to dampen anyone's spirits, through the Peace Corps we will spend $66,000 in Fiji, $452,000 to Swaziland, and $181,000 in Oman. How did this lunacy get started? Federal aid simply got to be a habit, according to the committee, and it has now become a ""near-addictive habit."" ""At present,"" the committee observes, ""the far-flung network of U.S. military assistance, advisory groups, military missions, and military groups gives bureaucratic momentum to the perpetuation of an, extensive program the rationale for which each year has become increasingly dubious. Through this bureaucracy, the U.S. continues-almost habitually-to dispense hundreds of milllons of dollars of weapons in pursuit of such vaguely defined goals as 'stability,' 'balance, • and the 'maintenance of friendly relations.' Yet in the committee's view, there is little evidence that such general purposes have actually been served by this massive and often indiscriminate program.'' On the contrary, milltary aid, the committee concludes, ""not only escalates the destructive potential of international conflict but also enhances the relative power of the military within those societies and thereby creates undesirable tendencies away from the democratic processes which the programs in its origins, was intended to defeat."" It seems that what the committee is saying in all that fancy language is nothing more than that we are pouring our money down the drain in more than 100 countries because Congress does not have the guts to stop the bureaucracies, set its collective foot down and deny the money to ""enhance the relative power of the mllitary within those societies.'' Regardless of how sorry we might feel for some of the other nations of the world, it is pure stupidity for the United States to bankrupt itself, or weaken itself to the point it can be destroyed by others, for the sake of being the ""good guy"" by giving away our money, military equipment and resources. After all, welfare should begin at home and the American taxpayers are in dire circumstances. The committee did recommend a threeyear phase-out of general military aid. Now is the time for every taxpayer in the country to let the congressmen and senators know that foreign aid must be stopped-and stopped now-if our nation is to survive. If the committee's recommendation sticks, American taxpayers could get a break in time. Until such a recommendation passes the Congress, however, the drain continues. S. 3838, THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND USURY CEILING LEGISLATION HON. JOHN H. ROUSSELOT OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, October 11, 1974 ",1974
497,1304,26,Mr. ROUSSELOT.," Mr. Speaker, I support the conference report on S. 3838, the debt obligations and usury ceiling legislation. I believe this legislation is a fair compromise in resolving the differences between the House-and Senate-passed versions of this legislation. Title I of the bill is substantially the same as the legislation which passed the House relating to the regulation of the issuing and sale of variable rate notes. Title II and title III of the conference report were incorporated in the Senatepassed version and were accepted by the House conferees only after careful consideration. Both of these provisions are intended to correct situations in specific States, and they are both of a temporary nature-expire July 1, 1977, or sooner if action is taken at the State level to override these exemptions. As one who has repeatedly stood before this body and argued for States' rights, I can assure you that I would not be supporting these provisions if I thought they in any way preempted State controls that could be quickly corrected at the State level if that State so desired. I am convinced that the States involved do want this immediate relief, and only in order to give them time to correct it themselves through the State process. TITLE n-INTEREST RATE AMENDMENTS REGARDING STATE USURY CEILINGS ON BUSINESS LOANS In today's money market, insured banks and savings and loan associations in Tennessee, Arkansas, and Montana are virtually unable to make business and commercial loans because of State statutory and constitutional restraints which ",1974
498,1404,26,Mr. OWENS.," Mr. Speaker, our American republic has :~aced national emergencies before. War, natural catastrophes, and economic upheavals are not strangers to the American people. To them the spirit of sacrifice is not new. When necessary, when pressed upon by nature, they are enobled by. their willingness to sacrifice. But today, we face a grave trial. Before us we see the horrible specter of inflation grown rampant. Allowing inflation is a tax without legislation, a tax without representation, an oppression to the poor. It cannot be allowed to exist unaddressed. Our situation is made more grave, unlike other times of emergency, because we also face a crisis of spirit. In 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt came before this body in times no less vexatious and declared that we have ''nothing to fear but fear itself."" I believe those words. We need that kind of leadership today. It is a quality of leadership to call for sacrifice, but the responsibility of Government is to insure that it is fairly distributed, that all will share the burden. It is to this leadership the people turn for resolution so that economic crisis does not become a .crisis of the spirit, a sacrifice of the many for the few. The time for experimentation is passed. There is no more time to trifle with the expectations and confidences of the American people. They can, and they must be told that the remedy is not easy, the causes are not singular, the recovery process not without sacrifice. They must also be told what the process is, and why the end is not in doubt. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS It makes little sense to ask the consumer for less consumption when the market already makes no exception for its limitations of their demands. The American consumer buys fewer cars, and the price goes up, he turns down his thermostat, and he pays more to make up for what he did not use. He buyes fewer clothes, gives up his vacation, and drives less, but prices continue to go up. My purpose today is not to discuss the whole problem, but to focus upon the most fundamental element, the cost of food. You have to eat. It is inescapable. The economics of consumption are not complex. Consumers are paying more and farmers are getting less. And the Goverment tells us that we spent 14 percent more for food this summer than we did last summer; 14 percent is bad enough, but it certainly seems to hurt more than 14 percent. It is the increasing price of food and our inability to deal effectively with these costs that is probably the largest single source of frustration for the American consumer. It is in how we spend our food dollar, or what we cannot buy with our food dollar, that is one of the cruelest punishments of inflation. The average American wage earner pays about 20 percent of his income for food. For the older American, it is over 30 percent of his income. The individual has already been fed his diet of austerity. It is evident that ""tight money"" or ""fiscal restraint"" alone is not a satisfactory solution to this problem. Nor can the problem be dismissed alone by the cold calculus of demand over supply. A meaningful discussion of problem and resolution must include an understanding of the data employed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us that prices for food at home have increased percent during the year beginning in July 1973 and ending this past summer. I believe that this figure represents a serious distortion of what is really happening to the American diet and obscures real problems in our food distribution and marketing system. Basically, the food price index of the Consumer Price Index is based on the increase of cost in about 100 selected food items. Each item is weighted in relation to its importance in the American diet. A tottering system, based upon 1961 eating habits, the BLS idea has not been updated to reflect changes in our eating habits. For example, meats are weighted heavily in the BLS system, and meat prices are down 9.6 percent over the last year. So this holds the index down. But at the same time, Americans are eating less meat; 6 percent less beef than last year, and nearly 20 percent less pork from 1971 levels. It also happens that pork is generally eaten more than beef by: the less affluent members of our society. So it is not coincidental that we are eating less meat and more beans. Meat prices have decreased 9.6 percent, but dried beans have increased 300 percent. So while the Government tells us that it is only costing us 14 percent more, we know that it is costing us more than that. Salt Lake City is not one of the cities sampled by the BLS. We have been informed, however, that Salt Lake City is 14 October 15, 197 4 one of the four most expensive cities for food in the United States. An independent study has been done in a large discount grocery store, comparing June 8, 1973, retail prices with the shelf prices of September 16, indicates that something is very wrong. Common brand name foods that are typical of the average American's eating habits were selected. The 1973 products were picked first, on the basis of diet, and then a comparison was made with this September's prices. 1974. It WHAT HAS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO THE COSTS OF FOOD FOR A DAY IN SALT LAKE CITY? BREAKFAST Instant Tang for your juice has increased in price by 33% . Wonder English Muffins have increased by 38%. If you spread them with Parkay margarine, this has increased by 106%, considering the tax reduction; however, butter has decreased by 1%. Welch's Grape Jelly has increased by 41%; or for those who prefer Miller's honey, it is an in<lrease of 29%. For the pancakes, Pillsbury Hungry Jack Mix has increased by 32%; Aunt Jemima Pancake Mix has increased by 36%. Log Gabin Syrup has.shown an increase of 36%, and Nalley's Lumber Jack by 43%. Mazola for the griddle has gone up 88%, or Crisco has increased 136%. Folger's regular coffee has increased 22%, but MJB instant has gone up 55% in price. Nestle's Choc Quick has increased 34%. U & I sugar for your coffee has increased 156%. For cereal, it is better to stay with ""AllAmerican Boy"" Wheaties, Breakfast of Champions, which has increased only 18%. A second choice would be Nabisco Shredded Wheat, at 27%. However, if the kids insist, Cheerios has increased 37%, Kelloggs Sugar Pops, 34%. Post Raisin Bran has jumped up 50% in cost, (yet DelMonte seedless raisins are only up 33%). 2% milk in cartons has only increased by 9%, but if you have been trying to keep costs down by using Carnation Instant, it has increased 36%, or Pet evaporated milk has increased by 58%. Fortunately your morning egg is stm within the range of the index. FOR THE SACK LUNCHES THAT HAVE TO BE PREPARED Bread costs 49% more now, than 15 months ago. Skippy Peanut Butter has increased 25%. Kraft American Cheese for sandwiches only 14%, but the Best Foods Mayonnaise Spread is up 89%. Clover Club potato chips have gone up 68%, or Doritos, which have increased by 28%, or Fritos, which have gone up in price 15%. Oreo Cookies are up 39%, Nabisco Old Fashioned Ginger Cookies up 49%. Glad Sandwich Bags have increased 16%, and Handiwrap has gone up 12%. Napkins are up 29%, and the cost of Zee Brown Lunch Bags are up 31%. THE DOG HAS TO BE FED All beef Alpo is down 6% (a bright spot for some of the poor, if reports are true and if they can afford the more expensive brand of dog food) . Friskies are up 24% and Ken-L-Ration is up 25%. A LIGHT LUNCH AT HOME Campbell's Beef Soup has increased in price by 28%, and saltines are up 54%. Cottage cheese has increased by 31%.

Senator CooK has served the people of Kentucky well, as those of you who have served with him know. He has diligently applied himself to the problems and issues that have confronted Congress. It is no sur:prise to me that Senator CooK's work here has been recognized and acknowledged in many places. Although we are from different parties, our friendship long predates his entry into the U.S Senate. I observed his performance in the State legislature in Kentucky and his subsequent duty as county judge of our largest county, Jefferson. Senator CooK devoted many years working for the betterment of the State prior to entering the U.S. Senate. That service was extended and expanded during his membership here. I feel I would be remiss, if I did not here publicly acknowledge the tremendous assistance that my senior colleague and his stat! have extended to me as a new Member of this body during the past 2 years, and I want to express my appreciation for that help and cooperation, and extend to him and to his family my best wishes in whatever new endeavors he undertakes.

532,54,31,Mr. ALLEN.," Mr. President, at my instance, the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry unanimously reported ,senate Resolution 467 which deals with the increasingly serious credit crunch in which many of the Nation's farmers now find themselves. There is no need for me to recount in any detail on the serious economic conditions which now prevail in Alabama and generally in America. But the rapidly increasing unemployment rate and many other f aotors are grim reminders of the terrible Depression of the 1930's. I would, however, remind the Senat.e that prior to that general economic collapse, our farm economy fell apar,t. Due to a lack of liquidity there were wholesale foreclosures on farmers. That same specter is raising its ugly head today. Since 1971, in response to Government urging for all-out food production, farmers expanded their borrowing by 60 percent. This was in order to purchase the essential inputs which are vital in food production. Much of this debt was incurred at record high interest rates. Farmers were able to take these credit risks because of record demand for their food and fiber and resulting good prices. But all of that has changed. In the past 2 years the livestock, Poultry, antl dairy segments of our farm economy have been decimated by higher costs of production; market disruptions and drastically lower prices. Markets for cotton have been depressed because American families, in their attempts to fight in:flation, have sharply reduced their clothing budgets. In addition, many crop farmers have had a variety of disasters which made their labor and investment a cataclysmic mockery. In spite of generally high grain prices, many farmers lost everything. As a result of this, farmers are being forced to assume even greater debts in order to refinance their pending obligations and many others are simply going out of business. Although I have not been able to find any statistics on this, my mail and personal contracts with constituents make me certain that the number of farm bankruptcies ls increasing rapidly. The loss of these farmers to the system is a direct threat to the need for IUY increased food production for America and the world. This production base must be strong if we are to meet the doublebarreled problems of inflation and recession. Further. the agriculture economy lies, at the heart of the viability of small communities. We are already aware that many rural banks have reduced their lending significantly and some have closed their doors for good. The financial liquidity of the family farm must be preserved if we are to assure adequate food supplies at fair and reasonable prices. As a result of this desperate situation, the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry has resolved that agricultural lenders immediately respond to the credit needs of agriculture. Chairman TALMADGE has resolved that immediately after the first of the year, the Committee will reexamine the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 in order to insure a fair return to the farmers. But unless agricultural lenders do their part now, those efforts will be too late. Therefore, all of those institutions which farmers rely on for credit must use every means possible to assure agricultural solvency-this includes the merchants who sell vital inputs for farming. Further, the Farmers Home Administration must fully implement all lending authority in law, including the Emergency Livestock Credit Act of 1974 and other disaster aid programs. The Farm Credit Administration must use its good offices to the fullest extent possible to insure that adequate credit is made available to farmers. Finally, the Federal Reserve Board must fully support those commercial banks which represent the largest source of farm production credit. Mr. President, I can understand that in these troubled economic times, many lenders might feel it wiser to restrict their loan activities sharply. But farmers continue to exist almost solely on the basis of huge annual loans which are essential to the production of food in this country. Any wavering in support for this credit system by any of the vital institutions involved will certainly produce famine abroad and much higher food prices at home. This is not to mention the disruption of farm families and rural communities. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has just completed the week-long exercise of its annual Outlook Conference. In my mind it was more of a back look conference, reflecting on what a good year last year was instead of the impending problems which any casual observer can foresee for the coming year in the entire food and fiber sector. If we cannot rely on the Department of Agriculture for this information, then it seems to me that it is incumbent upon Congress to come to some determination of how the problem of financial liquidity will affect the farmers themselves, the economy of rural areas and the American housewife. I intend to undertake a personal survey in my own State of Alabama, conversing with farmers, bankers, and merchants wherever I can find them. ",1974
533,104,31,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Is there further discussion? ,1974
534,104,31,Mr. JAVITS., I yield back the remainder of my time. ,1974
535,104,31,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The question is on agreeing to the conference report. CHILDREN WITH LIMITED ENGLISH-SPEAKING ABILITY Importantly, the conference report provides that, in administering Head Start and Follow Through programs, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare do all he can to meet the special needs of Indian and migrant children, and the joint explanatory statement stresses that the Secretary shall be especially sensitive to the needs of children with limited English-speaking ability in order to enhance the effect of these programs on these children. I was glad that these matters were resolved as I proposed in the conference. EMERGENCY ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM I was pleased that the bulk of the Senate amendment establishing an em·ergency energy conservation program t.o lessen the impact of the high cost of energy for low-income individuals was retained in the conference report. The conference agreement requires the Director of the Community Services Administration to consult with the Administrator of the Federal Energy Agency and other appropriate departments and agencies prior to establishing the procedures to carry out the purposes of this program. CONCLUSION Mr. President, in closing I would like to stress that the poverty programs discussed above, and others contained in the reported bill, have demonstrated their effectiveness in helping to meet the needs of the poor. In ""An Analysis of the Economic Impact of a Community Action Agency,"" prepared by the Technical ;\ssistance Division of the California State Office of Economic Opportunity the introduction states-' Because bad news makes news, the positive and vital contributions made by Community Action Agencies may have been lost or have gone virtually unnoticed.

537,104,31,The PRESIDING OFFICER ,"<Mr. CHILES). The resolution will be stated. The legislative clerk read as follows: Whereas United States Steel has announced price increases averaging 8 to 10% on two thirds of steel items produced by the Company. Whereas steel prices of major companies including U.S. Steel were increased by an average of 23 % last spring. Whereas U.S. Steel has indicated it will persist in these price increases even though it has not yet given President Ford the justification for these price increases that he has requested. Whereas for the first nine months of 1974 U.S. Steel's profits increased by 109.4% over the first nine months of 1973. Whereas an increase in the price of steel will have a deleterious effect on the already sagging auto and construction industries. Whereas an increase in the price of steel will place upward pressure on many consumer prices: Now, therefore, be it Resolved,. That the Council on Wage and Price Stability be requested t,o hold hearings on both the price increase announced by U.S. Steel and price increases that have been put into effect by other steel producers since July 1, 1974. Be it Resolved, That the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission be requested to investigate the steel industry to determine whether the industry is guilty of violations of Antitrust Laws; be it therefore Resolved, That U.S. Steel specifically and the remainder of the Steel industry generally be notified that it is the strong deSire of the U.S. Senate that no increase in the price of steel be put into effect until the recommended. hearings of the Council on Wage and Price Stab111ty have been held and the Council's report has been made; and, finally, be it Resolved, That the President use the full ",1974
538,154,31,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Is there ""bjection to the consideration of the conference report? There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the report. (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of today). ",1974
539,154,31,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I am particularly pleased to report that the conferees met and agreed upon what I believe to be an excellent bill. This legislation will authorize the establishment of local and State agencies for the development of comprehensive health plans under national guidelines to be developed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. This legislation authorizes the creation of health systems agencies, which will encompass the entire United States. In addition, it provides funds for the implementation of plans developed by the agencies, and the continuation of meritorious health development projects currently being funded under existing authorities, such as the regional medical programs. It also provides for continuation of Federal assistance for the construction of outpatient facilities with an emphasis on medically underserved areas and modernization of existing inpatient facilities. The special project grant program is earmarked to assist urban hospitals in meeting life safety and accreditation stand-ards. · · The amount of $1.13 billion is author:ized for a 3-year period. Although this authorization is somewhat higher than the Senate bill which went into conference, I believe the additional expenditures are justified. They are due primarily to increased authority for continuation of the construction program and the creation of five centers for health planning, to be in operation by June 1976. In addition, an experimental Stateoperated program of health service rate regulation under Federal guidelines is included in this legislation. The most compelling reason for our immediate action on S. 2994 rests with the strong potential for enactment of some form of national health insurance in the near future. In all of the hearings that have been held on national health insurance and through the volumes of material that have been written on the subject, considerable stress has been given to benefit packages and the financial mechanisms for supporting such a program. Such a focus has been appropriate, since they are major elements in any program: However, a major outgrowth of this stress has been an increasing concern for physical and human resources. Specifically, will there be enough resources, appropriate to the needs, and distributed in a manner so as to effectively meet the demand that will be generated through a national health insurance program? This concern leads into the question of planning and the need for an effective planning base if we are to successfully implement national health insurance. Up to this point, adequate attention has not been given to this very real question. However, we can change that situation today within the context of this bill. Quite frankly, S. 2994 gives us the capacity to implement a comprehensive planning base throughout the United States. Even more important, though, is that this can be done with a time interval that provides an opportunity to plan for national health insurance. What exactly does this bill do as far as the planning for national health in-. surance is concerned? First of all, it will support the creation of a system of regional health planning agencies throughout the country. This is contrasted with the existing situation under the comprehensive health planning program where only 75 percent of the population is covered by an areawide health planning agency. The areas currently not covered are largely rural, but under s. 2994 they would now have the opportunity to participate in regional health planning. Second. The bill would provide the financial resources necessary to employ both the number and types of staff necessary to tackle the planning issues posed by national health insurance. Under S. 2994 regional health planning agencies ho.ve a minimum professional staff of 10 compared with the average of 4 under existing comprehensive health planning program. Third. S. 2994 targets the planning activities on the personal service needs of the population and the manpower and facilities necessary to meet the needs. Finally, the bill fosters the creation of regional decisionmaking bodies encompassing providers, consumers, educators, payors, and local elected officials who in conjunction with appropriately educated professional staff can make planning and resource allocation recommendations which will go a long way toward insuring an effective implementation of a national health insurance program on a local level. There is a second important reason for the Senate to move positively on this bill today. The concepts expressed in S. 2994 have ·been under discussion for a number of years. We are aware that the administration over 1 % years ago proposed the termination of regional medical programs and Hill-Burton. The Congress responded by calling for a simple 1-year extension of the existing programs, with the expressed intent of studying the programs under considera-· tion. I believe that this was a sound move on the part of the Congress. While this action permitted us to carry out this essential review, it also had an adverse effect on the programs themselves. The 1-year extension was a signal to many that the Congress was going to make some significant changes in the near future. This lack of stability made it difficult for many programs to maintain and/or hire the high-quality personnel necessary to carry out program responsibilities. In other cases, it was hard to get communities to develop quality proposals which were responsive · to community needs since the future support of such efforts was clearly uncertain. The study the Congress authorized has been completed. We have heard from many people and have incorporated their ideas into our own analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the existing programs. The end result is a bill which significantly enhances our ability to deal with planning, implementation, and construction in a coordinated and effective fashion. The time for action is now and there is no reason to delay the implementation of the concepts expressed in S. 2994. To do so would mean that the Senate would be avoiding its responsibility and obligation to insure that programs are enacted which will benefit the total population. Furthermore, nonaction by the Senate will only perpetuate the uncertainty and instability that now faces 56 State comprehensive health planning agencies, 218 areawide comprehensive health planning agencies, 53 regional medical programs, 56 State Hill-Burton agencies, 17 experimental health services delivery systems, and their respective , constituencies. A third rationale for immediate action linked to the authority for developis ment activities . .AJ3 is well known, the regional medical programs have served as a vehicle for the development of a number of initiatives both on State and regional level. While many of the activities were consistent with community needsr, a large number of the projects were re· search projects tied to the interests of medical school faculty. This bill gives us the capacity to benefit from the strengths of the regional medical programs experience by supporting developmental projects which are responsive to the priorities set forth in a regional agency's short-term priorities plan. More importantly though this provision will allow communities to positively attack resource deficiencies that they all face in some form. Of even greater significance though is that the authority gives real meaning and substance to the planning that will be taking place.. In many parts of the country, under the existing comprehensive health planning program, planning agencies have been frustrated by their inability to get their planning priorities implemented in a viable format. There has been no mandated link between the planning under comprehensive health planning and the development under regional medical programs. S. 2994 rectifies this very condition. Furthermore, if we think back to the earlier discussion about the ties between national health insurance and planning and resource needs, we see the real promise this provision holds. · Another reason for an immediate decision on this bill rests on the question of need for facilities and services. For a number of years this country has wrestled with the problem of how to get facilities and services into areas where they are needed. To a large extent, we have been successful, as witnessed by the Hill-Burton program. Increasingly, ",1974

Dak., Nov. 19, 1974) PUBLIC OPINION MANEUVERED To ACCEPT WAR There has been growing speculation on the part of military and political leaders that it may become a necessity to effect a military takeover of oil fields under the sovererign control of Arab nations if the oil ""price gouge"" continues to affect our ""vital interests,"" as they state. This change in attitude by political and military leaders has been accompanied by the derrogatory characterization of Arabs as big, greedy, money-hungry slobs. As an example of this, this week's political cartoon was especially selected to help emphasize the point. Also, witness over the past few week's cartoons in Time Magazine showing much the same stereotype of an Arab taking a b:i.te out of the world with the caption stating, ""Arab burger."" In a recent column Jack Anderson stated that the ""repercussions of Western countries being economically ruined by the price of oil would affect the vital interests of the United States. The use of the term vital in~rests is ominous. For it is understood that the United States will go to war, if necessary, to protect its vital interests.""

542,404,31,Mr. MARTIN of Nebraska.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. McCLORY). Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to speak in support of the rule and a~so say that I share the regret of the chairman that his picture was used, and I think it gave the wrong impression. I am happy the gentleman gave a:n explanation, and I want to concur m the explanation he made. I would also like to say that the <?o~­mittee on Rules has been very fair m granting the 6-hour rule. As a matter of fact, although my colleagues on the other side of the aisle requested an 1-h?ur rule, they are getting the 4 hours which they requested for themselves, becaus~ the rule provides 2 hours to the chairman of the committee and 2 hours to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KASTENMEIER). So there are 4 hours provide~ to my colleagues on that side of the aisl~. It seems to me that it is eminently fair that distribution of time has been made as it has been made. I think we should recall that this investigation by the House c_ommittee on the Judiciary has been gomg on for 4 months and that we have carried on a thorough and complete investigation. We have had access to FBI reports. We ha:ve examined a vast amount of material which is contained in a large volume which is available to the Members. Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to commend the chairman of the committee and my colleague, the ranking min~rity member, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUTCHINSON) for the kind of thoroughgoing investigation which has been carried on to illuminate and inform the Members so they can vote intelligently on this subject today. It seems to me that we have a very compelte record available to us. I want to support the appraisal of the nominee that has been made by my colleague, the ranking member of the Committee on Rules, and I wish to state that I am hopeful that we can get on to the general debate on this subject, and that we may vote to confirm the nominee. I might say that the plans for the swearing-in are not unlike the plans which were made with respect to the other Vice Presidential nominee, Gerald R. Ford, when he was confirmed as Vice President. It seems to me the leadership is the one that has made these plans; it is not the mombers of the committee who have made the plans as to what is going to follow the vote here today. ",1974

I want also to suggest that it is precisely that type of attitude on the part of the gentleman from New York, in denying an opportunity to fully debate and to fully examine the facts of tliis nomination, that causes the nomination to be viewed with suspicion by many. ",1974
545,404,31,Mr. DELANEY.," Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? ",1974
546,404,31,Mr. WALDIE.," No, I wili not yield. Mr. Speaker, I ask for regular order. I am not going to yield to the gentleman. I suggest the gentleman can do as he required of me--make a point of order of no quorum if he wants some time. Mr. Speaker, I am taking this 5 minutes because there is not sufficient time during general debate, although I am with those Members who appreciate that we have extended the time for debate from 4 hours to 6 hours. Even so, there are those members on this committee who are asking for additional time, and they are entitled to it. So the best way we can get time is to use part of this hour on the rule to speak to the issues that we will not be able to address in general debate. One of the problems with the debate and with this issue is this: We have had given to us as of last night a volume consisting of almost 1,400 pages of hearings of the Committee on the Judiciary. I am fairly familiar with these pages, as are most of the members of the committee, but I dare say that hardly any other Members of the House are familiar with the hearings which the Committee on the Judiciary held. Although I found some objection in terms of the scope of those hearings, they still are quite instructive as to the particular holdings of the nominee and as to the potential use by the nominee of his private wealth contrary to public interest, as well as the actual use of that private wealth. Mr. Speaker, it is very difficult to examine Mr. Rockefeller in terms of his concepts of wealth and my concept of wealth. For example, when one questions him about the use of $22 million of his f ami}y's money to purchase the office of Governor-and I use that term advisedly-there is not a soul in the world, I am sure, who believes Nelson Rockefeller could have been elected without his family coming up with $20 million-Plus. The nominee does not perceive $20 million as being a great sum of money. Now, that really is not good for the system. It has little to do with whether wealthy people should be denied access to public office. The question is: Should access to public office be made equally accessible to poor people as well as it was wealthy people? With a Rockefeller in the picture, it is not equally accessible. The nominee says that was an abuse in the past that no longer will occur because New York has passed laws preventing that and the Federal Government has passed laws preventing that. I then asked the nominee: ""Do you agree that was an abuse at the time it was being exercised by you?"" And the nominee said, ""Well, legal."" I said, ""That really was not the question. Was it ethical? Was it an ethical use of your private wealth?"" The nominee said that he equated that particular issue of morality with legality. And then the most incredulous testimony of all contained in this record came when I asked the nominee if his testimony before our committee was testimony of direct recollection or if his testimony was testimony of reconstruction. He said it was all reconstruction. There was no direct recollection in his testimony. I said, ""This committee has just been through an episode of listening to one of the most famous voices in this land, the former President of the United States, on tape, advising his staff people how to testify before congressional committees under oath or before courts; and the way to testify, the former President of the United States, Mr. Nixon, said, was to say, 'You don't recall.' "" Reconstruct or reconstruction, no direct recollection. Those are precisely the words the nominee used before our committee. I am suggesting to the House that if the Members have an opportunity to read this record, they will find and conclude as I have, and as did many of the 12 members constituting the majority of the Democrats on that committee, that the nominee, charitably, was less than candid before our committee. It just simply is not correct, as the nominee says, that the loans he made were, in fact, loans. It was apparent, and the nominee admitted, that he made gifts to these individuals prior to their obtaining public employment and subsequent to their leaving public employment. But he made ""loans"" in the intervening intervals between obtaining public employment and ending public employment. Moneys given by the nominee to these officials were denominated as loans, loans not containing any interest or bearing any collateral, and loans inevitably forgiven when the nominee left public office so that they could be converted into a gift without violating a statute of New York.

Mr. Chairman, I asked that specific question of both Nelson Rockefeller and Mr. Dilworth, as well as others, and we understood there was no single instance where the use of the Rockefeller political infiuence was employed to enrich in any way either Nelson Rockefeller or any member of the family. In addition, there is no evidence that Nelson Rockefeller or his family was enriched in any way by any loans or gifts made by Mr. Rockefeller. ",1974
554,454,31,Mr. EVANS of Colorado.," Mr. Chairman, I have conversed briefiy with the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee on this question prior to this, so I will address the same questions to him that I have to the other members. Has any evidence come before the committee as to enrichment which fiowed to the nominee or to his family, or have there been any improper acts fiowing from these gifts or loans which were alluded to? ",1974
555,454,31,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield, throughout the extensive investigation, and during the course of the interrogation, there has been no such indication and there has been no such evidence. As a matter of fact, I might state that I specifically inquired of Dr. Ronan regarding some of these items. I did so because of my interest in the State of New Jersey regarding matters that Dr. Ronan might be involved in as chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. As a consequence of my interrogation, I was satisfied that Dr. Ronan was not enriched, nor was the nominee enriched as a result, in any way. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUTCHINSON) . ",1974

557,454,31,Mr. ASHBROOK.,". Mr. Chairman, I oppose the confirmation of Nelson A. Rockefeller as Vice President, or for that matter, for anything. I cannot help but recall the Broadway critic who once wrote, after viewing opening night on the Great White Way, ""A creeping paralysis set in which turned out to be the plot."" In my view, there has been nothing short of paralysis in the Congress and in the news media in the Rockefeller matter. It amounts to a crass double standard in which most legislators and reporters have fall en over themselves in heaping hosannas on the nominee. It can be argued that time spent on the Rockefeller hearings constitute adequate study. Time should not be confused with depth. Because of this paralysis, the nomination of Nelson Rockefeller has not received the type of minute attention that the cases of former President Nixon and former Vice President Agnew received. I should think that this body would have learned something from these past several years. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be the case. I ask all of my colleagues: Have the necessary questions been asked and satisfactorily answered by this nominee? Has this body had an opportunity to conscientiously and unhurriedly study the record of the hearings on this nomination? Further, has the standard applied by the press and the Congress to Nixon, Agnew, Harnsworth. and Carswell been ap-plied to Mr. Rockefeller? No, because of this paralysis of will, the former Governor of New York has been subjected to a totally different standard. As a part of this paralysis, an easy out, a wealth herring has been created. Many proponents make it sound like those who oppose Mr. Rockefeller apply a wealth test. This is not so. His wealth has clearly raised questions over misuse of that wealth and power which has come from that wealth but I do not, nor do many opponents I have heard, apply a wealth test to the nominee. I think it important to maintain the same standard for Nelson Rockefeller as maintained for others. That standard is not being maintained , because of a strange paralysis of will. In closing, I wish to ask my fellow Republican colleagues, do you plan to vote for a man who as Governor was an advocate of those same liberal policies-big government spending, bigger welfare schemes, and other liberal nostrumsthat have led this country to its present economic mess? The Republican Party has repeatedly rejected Rockefeller. Public support for his nomination is lacking. I particularly reject the Republican attitude of quote-If President Ford wants him, we should support him-unquote. This set of blinders on my Republican friends led our party to near disaster in the sordid Watergate affair and should not be repeated here as a test of loyalty. At a time the American people are weary of politics, polticians, and pas.t failures of both parties, we should be holding out some bright new hope in this rare opportunity afforded by the 25th amendment. There is no hope for change in a Nelson Rockefeller. He represents the type of spending and taxing politician we should have had enough of. A legislative paralysis has precluded a real study of the nominee. It is one of the reasons for the decline in respect for this great body. I urge a ""No"" vote. Many issues liave never really been studied. One issue is the military draft. Nelson Rockefeller was No. 10 on his local draft board but was appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt to a newly created Government post. Was the draft just one more thing that applied to average Americans but not to Nelson Rockefeller? Another issue that has received little attention is Rockefeller and Chase Manhattan Bank involvement in the World Trade Center in New York City. The New York State government is paying $16 million a year in rent for space in that building while other previously built State buildings are sitting partially or totally empty. Is there a confiict of interest in this matter? I do not know but the possibility has not been investigated. A third area where numerous questions remain is the case of L. Judson Morhouse. Senator HELMS has pointed out a' number of inconsistencies and discrepancies in this whole case and in how Nelson Rockefeller related it. Has Nelson· Rockefeller candidly related the Morhouse story? Has this issue been dealt with fully and accurately? Another area deals with American sovereignty and vital American interests. His views on American participation in ",1974

561,654,31,Mr. LONG.," Mr. President, I heard some views which I hope is not true. If so, it dismays me very much. I believe it my duty to report it, because the reports I hear seem to be sufficiently accurate that it would be worth discussing. It seems that the Special Trade Representative, Mr. William Eberle, who worked diligently and zealously to pass the trade bill, has been given notice that he is fired as of next week. Mr. President, apparently the reason this happened was that the senior Senator from Louisiana <Mr. LONG) offered an amendment to the trade bill to provide that the Special Trade Representative should have the pay of the cabinet level. The amendment was entirely my idea, and I believe in it 100 percent, that -position, being very important and more 'Significant than some of the cabinet positions, in my judgment. Mr. President, I think I know something about what the pay of a job should be. When we established the pay for all those jobs about 26 years ago I was the manager of the top pay bill. I recall all the jealousies and the various quarrels about who should be paid more than who because it might affect the dignity of their jobs. I suppose that the Senator from Louisiana, as well as each legislator, could understand the problems involved in saying whether someone should receive cabinet level pay or someone should receive lower level pay. It was also my feeling that the people who would be working the next level below the Special Trade Representative ought to be at the ambassadorial level because they would be dealing with ambassadors from other nations in negotiating the trade agreements. Mr. President, I was aware that Mr. Roy Ash, the director of OMB, did not like this. Mr. Bill Simon, the Secretary of the Treasury, did not like this. But I did what I thought was right, and the Committee on Finance thought I was right, and the House conferees thought I was right. That is why that is in the law. Mr. Eberle followed the orders of his bosses repeatedly, stating to us that he was not for the amendment, he was not asking for it, he did not seek it, he did not want it, but at the same time, as a good soldier seeking to pass a piece of legislation for this administration, Mr. Eberle expected to live with a number of amendments that he was not advocating in order to get for this administration what it was seeking. It may be that President Ford, Mr. Simon, Mr. Ash, Mr. Dent, and Mr. Kissinger might feel that Mr. Eberle was campaigning for a raise. He was not. That man is serving at a financial sacrifice even if he does receive Cabinet level pay. But, Mr. President, the Special Trade Representative is working for Congress as much as he is working for the President. It is different from the average Cabinet officer. The Special Trade Representative is serving in a somewhat unusual capacity. The power to regulate foreign trade, to fix tariffs and quotas, and to deal with unfair trade practices is in the Congress. This function is not in the executive branch. The only way that the executive branch gets into it is that the President has appointing authority and we usually call upon the President to make the appointment. Under the Constitution the appointing authority is not in the Congress and the question would then be: Who makes the appointment unless the Congress is to make the appointment? We have 100 Senators and 435 Congressmen. That is really all the President has to do with the job of Special Trade Representative. He is not supposed to be a flunky for the President. This Senator more or less resented the idea that a White House aide, like Mr. Flanigan, or a Director of OMB, or a second or third level echelon adminis·tration person, would feel that he could order around, and give commands to, someone who, in the last analysis, was an agent of the Congress. All the President did was to appoint him. At least, that is how I looked upon it under my theory of this organization. I will be disappointed, Mr. President, if Mr. Eberle is to be dismissed because he is suspected of failing to do everything he could to keep his job from having the dignity which the Congress thought it should have. The fact is he did, in my judgment, exactly what he should have done. He said he was not supporting it, he was not asking for it, he did not expect it, and he wanted it known that the administration was opposed to the elevation of the position. If that is to be done, Mr. President, we expect to take a very good look at whoever the President sends down here to replace Mr. Eberle. We expect to look at his credentials very carefully, very thoroughly, and we may want to amend that law before we confirm that man as special trade representative, to make it clear that man is not working for the President; he is working for the Congress. This is an authority and a power that is put in the Congress under the Constitution. We have delegated that to the President, but not so somebody in the State Department could command the man around, especially some second or third-level functionary over there, and not so somebody in the Treasury Department could command the man around, and not so someone in the White Housea Mr. Flanigan or a Mr. Ash, or whoever it might be, some of them unknown to me and unknown to the Congress in general--could command a man who, in the last analysis, was supposed to be representing us. As I say, Mr. President, if that is how it is to be it is a very grave disappointment to this Senator, and I believe it will be to the Congress. I regret to say I fear it would put the President's negotiations off on a very poor start if, when the Senate and the House felt the job should have that dignity, a man who served in a very fine fashion, and for whom we came to complete respect, confidence, and admiration, were to be fired for the reason that we thought enough of the position and not enough of the man that we thought the job commanded the higher pay. I have seen many things happen in Government about which I have been disappointed, sometimes things that caused me to think less of some people. But I must say, Mr. President, that this would be an extreme case in that regard. The President can do what he wants to do about the matter. I should like to remind the President, Mr. Simon, Mr. Ash, and that group that not all the power exists in the executive branch. Some of it exists here.

563,704,31,Mr. ALLEN.," Mr. President, an interesting article from the New York City Enquirer of October 17, has just come to my attention. This publication evidently set forth the pro and con arguments on the now moribund Agency for Consumer Advocacyalias Consumer Protection Agency-bill, by two very able advocates, the distinguished Senators from Connecticut <Mr. RIBICOFF) and New York (Mr. BUCKLEY). A poll of its readership was apparently then taken on the subject. The result vindicates what was said about this bill, S. 707, in our minority' views. Namely, that the ACA is a bad idea whose time has come and gone. A majority of this publication's readership is opposed to this concept. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: RESULTS OF ENQUmER READER PoLL-F'IFTYTHREE PERCENT AGAINST FEDERAL CONSUMER AGENCY A federal Consumer Protection Agency is not needed. say a narrow majority of readers responding to an Enquirer opinion poll. Latest results of the poll, which appeared in our Sept. 15 issue, show that of 957 ballots cast, 513, or 53.6 percent, were ""no"" votes to the question: ""Does the U.S. need a Consumer Protection Agency?"" The remaining 444 ballots, or 46.4 percent, were ""yes"" votes. The Enquirer takes no sides in its opinion polls. But we do present the opposing viewpoints of authorities. U.S. Sen. Abraham Ribico:ff (D.-Conn.) wrote: ""(It) would provide a single government agency to which a consumer could take a complaint-and know that it would be listened to by the right people."" U.S. Sen.

564,704,31,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. President, I have read with interest the recent speech by Congressman DAVID R. OBEY before the Society for Occupational and Environmental Health. Congressman OBEY, in his role as a member of the House LaborHEW Appropriations Subcommittee, a knowledgeable and active supporter of worker rights to an occupational environment free from hazardous exposure toxic or pathogenic chemicals. The administration has never adequately funded or staffed the Government's programs for research on occupational carcinogens or other potentially hazardous industrially used substances, and yet seemingly every week we hear that another chemical is causing illness or death among our working men and women. is going to fall the Congress again to insist, through its oversight and legislative functions, that the workers, entitlement to a safe and healthful workplace be upheld. I recommend this speech for the reading of the Members of this body, and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD.

Oh, I know that many Americans are vaguely aware that smog causes health problems, that there may be some health problem with asbestos. Some of them have just last month noticed reports about potential carcinogens being found in some communities' water supply. More have probably heard about some vague problem being associated with vinyl chloride. But mostly these bits of information are-to most Americans-a series o!f unrelated messages, of uncertain importance.

During my tenure in the state assembly, we found numerous occasions to seek his assistance, and he graciously and willingly responded to our requests. Now after 32 years CHET HOLIFIELD has decided to step aside. During his tenure in the House of Representatives, many Federal programs have been shaped by his extensive activities to improve Government and make it more responsive to the people. As chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy he has played an active role in developing energy legislation. His position on Government procurement is well documented. He served as chairman of a blue ribbon panel in 1969 seeking ways to improve Federal procurement procedures. His efforts to eliminate waste and duplication are seemingly endless. As chairman of the Committee on Government Operations, he has fought a continuing war against the evergrowing burden of paperwork in Federal agencies. In fact, he sponsored a bill to require an authoritative study to identify means to reduce the volume of paperwork. The House has already enacted the measure, and it has been referred to a Senate committee. He was one of the first to champion environmental legislation, and during his entire career, he has supported more than 200 environmental and conservation laws. As dean of the California delegation he was in a unique position to guide significant legislation through guidance, the laws to combat California's air and water pollution problems likely would not have been approved by the Congress during the late 1960's. The outstanding characteristics of Congressman HoLIFIELD's career are hard work, dedication, integrity, and leadership. His absence will leave a void in the ranks of the California delegation as well as in the House. His un:fiagging interest and dedication to public service will be sorely missed in the coming years. We commend him for an outstanding job, and we trust that he will enjoy the same degree of success in retirement as\ he pursues personal goals. In addition, our best wishes go to Cam, the lovable and dedicated wife of CHET HOLIFIELD. She has served so capably as the ""first lady"" of the California delegS1tion, and we all love and respect her. ",1974
574,854,31,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Speaker, for the past 22 years I have had the very great and distinct pleasure of serving on the Government Operations Committee with our distinguished chairman, CHET HOLIFIELD. Although many Members of Congress have served long and outstanding careers, few have risen to such a high position of respect and esteem among fell ow Members as CHET HOLIFIELD. Chairman HOLIFIELD's congressional career spans one of the most exciting periods in our history-in which our Nation moved into the atomic age. Without question, CHET HOLIFIELD will be remembered as the Congressman who did more for the peaceful use of nuclear energy than any of his contemporaries. As a member of the Government Operations Committee since its creation in 1949, Chairman HOLIFIELD has had a profound impact on the structure of our National Government. The establishment of three of our major Departments of Government-HEW, HUD, and DOT-reflect his creative leadership. His work as chairman of the Government Operations Committee has greatly enriched our national history and will continue to be felt throughout the Federal Government for years to come. In his 32 years of service in the U.S. House of Representatives, CHET HoLIFIELD has set a high standard of achievement and excellence for our country. He has worked hard at building a moral environment in which man's full potential can be realized in dignity and honor. He is recognized throughout our Nation for his compassion and understanding. His public and private acts always reflect good government, good citizenship and human brotherhood. ts in I can understand why, after 32 years~ he now chooses to take a little time for himself and his family. He has earned it. So has his lovely wife, cam, who has been so helpful to him throughout his distinguished career. When CHET HOLIFmLD retires at the end of this session, I will greatly miss his presence in the Congress and on the Government Operations Committee. He is a great American and I deeply value his warm friendship, his wise counsel, and his intense dedication to better government. ",1974
575,854,31,Mr. ANDERSON of California.," Mr. Speaker, a giant of the Congress, indeed the Nation, has decided to leave public service and enter a well-deserved retirement. Congressman CHET HOLIFIELD, the chairman of the Government Operations Committee, the chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, and the dean of the California delegation, stepping down after 32 years of dedicated and devoted service to this Nation. And over those years, the list of achievements is virtually endless-but at the top of the list, one would have to place his efforts toward the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and his leadership modernizing the Government. Not only has CHET HOLIFIELD been a national leader, he has been an international leader, recognized around the world as an expert on nuclear energy. Since 1955, he has served· on the U.S. Delegation to the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. At international conferences held from 1957 through 1970, he has been instrumental in efforts to use nuclear power in a safe, efficient method for the good of mankind. In the Congress, his leadership on the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy has led to many Sidvances in the field of energy derived from atomic power. And these Sidvances could effectively serve the energy needs of future generations. In addition, as the chairman of the Government Operations Committee, CHET has worked for an efficient, responsive Government that meets the needs of the people it serves. As a businessman, engaged in the manufacture and selling of men's apparel, CHET has used these commonsense business techniques to bring economy to the Government. Mr. Speaker, this Congress will not be the same without CHET HOLIFIELD, and the kind of caliber he brought to the Nation will be missed. Mrs. Anderson joins me in wishing CHET and his lovely wife Cam the very best in their retirement, and we hope that they will continue to be active in the community, sharing their years of experience with a grateful Nation.

576,854,31,Mr. CEDERBERG.," Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to imagine a session of Congress without our friend and colleague, CHET HOLIFIELD. In this political arena where new faces and names are a way of life every 2 years, CHET HOLIFIELD'S familiar face had become a welcomed and accepted fixture. The examples of his distinguished service are so numerous that it is impossible to do justice to his outstanding 32-year congressional career. He has made enor-",1974
577,1004,31,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Mr. Speaker, I speak on this occasion with a great sense of poignancy, because, after many years of service to our country in the House of Representatives, the dean of the California delegation, CHET HOLIFIELD, is retiring. All of us in Congress and indeed all of the people of our country are losing the privilege of having the immense skill and devotion of this :fine public servant as a Member of this body in the important years ahead. Within a few days of my coming to the House in early 1963, quickly learned to seek the counsel of CHET HOLIFIELD. I readily appreciated the high respect in which he was held by his colleagues, and so I wasted no time in trying to learn from this distinguished man. Mr. HOLIFIELD shared his expertise with me graciously and wlllingly. There was never a problem I could not take to him for guidance. think it accurate to state that the California delegation, the largest in the House, under the leadership of Dean HOLIFIELD has worked harmoniously and enthusiastically for the best interests of our State. Time after time Dean HOLIFIELD would call the delegation into emergency session to find the solution to an acute problem facing California. That we were successful in many instances is a great credit to our dean. Others will speak of CHET HOLIFIELD's accomplishments. They are major and impressive. He always fought for programs to help the poor and the elderly. His devotion to individual rights, due process, and privacy is a special star in his crown. It is not possible to talk about CHET HOLIFIELD without paying tribute to his partner of many years, our friend and his beloved wife, Cam. Cam made it possible for CHET to reach the highest pinnacles of achievement with her steady and loving support, with her warm understanding of the huge problems he faced, and her bravery and cheerfulness in times of disappointment and tragedy. Mr. Speaker, I feel confident that CHET and Cam Holifield are not retiring from public life. I pray that they will return often to Capitol Hill and share again their friendship and wisdom with, us. My best wishes go with them. ",1974
578,1054,31,Mr. CEDERBERG.," Mr. Speaker, the true stature and mark of any individual can usually best be judged as to how one serves and reacts under pressure and difficult, demanding situations. For 6 years, William E. Timmons, as Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs, has literally existed in a ""pressure cooker."" Even under normal, routine circumstances his was a difficult assignment in maintaining liaison between the Congress and the White House. We all are aware of the tremendous additional burdens of that job in the past several months. But, Bill Timmons performed magnificently-without question, ""a job well done."" As Bill now prepares to leave the White House and his service to our country, I am honored to join with so many other Members in expressing appreciation for his outstanding work and to wish him even greater success and happiness in the years ahead. It has been my distinct pleasure to know Bill personally for the nearly 15 years since he first came to Washington, D.C., as administrative assistant for then newly elected Congressman WILLIAM BROCK, now U.S. Senator BROCK, from Tennessee. Bill Timmons was a naturala great personality and with an extremely keen mind and sharpness. He joined the White House congressional liaison staff in January 1969, and quickly rose to the top spot in directing the administration's vital contact with the Congress. He was a great spokesman for the White House in his representation of the administration's positions on vital legislative issue. In my 22 years in Congress and dealing with six different administrations, I can attest that the professionalism of the White House congressional office was never higher or finer than that of Bill Timmons' group. I do not know Bill's future plans as he leaves this White House leadership role, but I am positive that whatever his endeavors he shall be highly successful. He has proved to be a man of great dedication and integrity. He has given his country the very best and for this, we are grateful. I w'ish him the greatest possible future success, happiness and good health in the years ahead. EQUIPMENT LEASING-THE INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT GONE WILD HON. ,CHARLES A. VANIK OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, December 20, 1974 ",1974
579,1054,31,Mr. VANIK.," Mr. Speaker, the current issue of Fortune magazine carries an im-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS pressive 27-page advertisement on the rapidly expanding equipment leasing industry. This industry, which is expanding at an annual rate of 15 to 20 percent is almost entirely a creature of our ta~ laws. Presently, we give a 7-percent investment tax credit on the purchase of new industrial equipment. Many companies whose tax payments are already low find that they cannot us~ the credit to the fullest extent. Through a leasing arrangement, they can convey this tax benefit to a financial institution-such as a commercial bank-in return for favorable financing. The bank buys the equipment, qualifies for the tax credit, and then turns around and leases the equipment to the original company at a cost below that of financing an outright purchase. Everybody's happy except the U.S. Treasury, which suffers a loss. The Fortune advertisement reveals the absurd extent to which this practice has grown. Among other things, the American taxpayer is subsidizing: The leasing of two portable $20,000 handball courts for the largest swim and tennis club in Northern California· A potato chip cooker for a food ~om­pany in Utah; Furniture and fixtures-everything from kitchen sinks and carpeting to beds bar stools, and chairs-for several na~ tional motel chains; Electric golf cars to country clubs; Horses and cattle to U.S. investor syndicates; and, . Elephants, zebras, lions, amusement rides and concession stand equipment for a commercial park in Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, this advertisement provides vivid testimony to what happens when a tax subsidy gets out of hand. Congress never envisioned the open market exchange of tax benefits that the practice of equipment leasing represents. It is time we carefully reviewed this area to see how effective the investment tax credit actually has been in stimulating needed investment in our economy. I suspect the answers are not encouraging for the tax avoider. WAGE-PRiCE CONTROLS PLUS JOBS NOW HON. ROBERT L. LEGGETT OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, Decem_ber 20, 1974 ",1974
580,1054,31,Mr. LEGGETI.," Mr. Speaker, it is apparent that recession and unemployment may well have moved ahead of inflation as our major economic worry. Unemployment at 6.5 percent in November is projected to reach 7 or 8 percent by mid-1975. Moreover, some economists are saying it may reach double-digit levels if we do not move firmly in the next year. We must face the agonizing dllemma of dealing with a rapidly deepening recession without abandoning the fight against inflation. December 2'0, 19 7 4 ~rthermore, many of One widely accepted remedy for our unemployment problem is a public or emergency jobs program. This is an approach that finds little opposition, and Just yesterday we approved a conference r~p?rt o:a a bill that would authorize $2.5 billion for public service jobs, with the House having originally authorized $2 billion and the Senate $4 billion. We must recognize that programs at these levels, however laudable, may not h~ve much effect on the unemployment :picture. According to a recent article m the Los Angeles Times by Robert J. Samuelson, even a $4 billion annual program would provide only 500,000 jobs, less than 1 percent of employment versus our current 6.5 percent unemployment. these jobs may disappear by ""displacement"" if State and local governments use the money to hire people they would have hired anyWay with their own funds. Mr. Samuelson says more than 50 percent of the jobs created may be lost this way. . Economi~ts such as Otto Eckstein belleve that Jobs programs of 4 or 5 times the· level we approved, together with a tax cut of at least $15 billion, would be necessary to have a real impact on une~ployment. This brings us face to face with the fundamental question of wheth-. er we can really curb inflation without a lengthy period of relatively high unemployment. Milton Friedman thinks those proposed by Otto ~c~stem. would, after an initial decline m m~ation, push us back up to 15 percent mflation within 2 years. It is analysis of this sort that leads me ~o conclude that wage-price controls are rn~scap~ble. If we are to continue to fight mflation while at the same time undertaking the jobs and tax measures needed to reduce unemployment, we must have a comprehensive program of wage-price-interest-profit controls. It is for this reason that I am introducing together with Congressmen Moss and PATMAN legislation which would mandate wa:ge-price ~ntrols. I think this measure is m lme 'Yith th~ decision taken by the Kansas City Democratic mini-convention and the House Democratic Caucus to ~ove forcefully to deal with our economic problems. Bob Samuelson's thought-provoking article on public jobs programs and the economy follows: measu~es like PuBLIC PROGRAM No JOBS FOR ECONOMY PANACEA (By Robert J. Samuelson) _As the White House and Congress grapple with the double infirmity of inflation and recession, only one widely-suggested remedy seems to -command anything like universal support: public service jobs. Almost every other proposal-wage-price controls, a tax increase, spending cuts, a tax reduction-has its own powerful camp of critics. But virtually no one i's against public service jobs. Even President Ford, cautioning against executive gloom about the economy may agree to support a larger public servic~ job program than he originally proposed. This consensus appears to represent llttle more than common sense. With the unemployment rate (6.5% in November) at its highest level since 1961 public service job proposals have an irresist~ Ible popular appeal. For the last month, the White House and Congress have been struggling less to assure that new legislation passes ",1974
581,1154,31,Mr. DORN.," Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to pay ·tribute to my good friend, the distinguished Congressman from Pennsylvania, FRANK CLARK. FRANK has rendered superb service to his Nation and his State; he will be greatly missed. Mr. Speaker, it has been my good fortune to serve with FRANK on the House Public Works Committee for a number of years. I know from personal observation of the tremendous contributions he has m·ade to the social and economic development of our country. During the period when FRANK has been a ranking member of the committee we have been able to enact truly historic and momentous legislation dealing with interstate highways, clean water programs, economic development, rivers and harbors, to name but a few . The legislative history of the past two decades is a reflection of FRANK's dedicated work. Mr. Speaker, FRANK CLARK is a patriot, a gentleman, and a dear friend. We wish for him every happiness in the future and hope that he will remain active in public service. TRIBUTE TO THADDEUS DULSKI OUR BEST WISHES TO RETIRING REPRESENTATIVE FRANK J. BRAS CO HON. JOHN J. ROONEY OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, December 20, 197 4 Mr. ROONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, with this 93d Congress coming to a rapid conclusion, I would, indeed, be remiss if I did not take time out from a busy and hectic schedule, hampered by my illness, to pay tribute to a good and loyal friend, a man who has been of great -assistance to me in reelection campaigns. The people of the 11th Congressional District in Brooklyn, N.Y., and many Members in this Chamber, will miss FRANK'S ability to help on many compli-cated and complex matters affecting the . good and welfare of the average citizen. This body and the entire country at this time can ill afford to lose the abilities of a man like FRANK BRASCO. Please forgive me if I am so brash as to predict and to feel that FRANK BRASCO will be fully vindicated of the charges brought against him in our system of laws. I earnestly hope and pray that h1s appeal will be successful and, if he so desires, that he be subsequently returned to his seat here in the House. Mrs. Rooney joins me in extending to FRANK, his lovely wife, Linda, and their four fine children many, many years of good health, happiness, and success, God speed to you. HON. JOHN M. MURPHY OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES Friday, December 20, 1974 Mr. MURPHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues to pay tribute to THADDEUS DULSKI, a leader of men and women, and a man who has left his indelible mark upon the Government of the United States. There are many things that could be said of THAD DULSKI in summing up his fine career. He served his constituents and his district in the highest tradition. He served his State and was ever mindful of New York's unique needs. And he served his country-as an individual Member of Congress, and as chairman of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee. The Federal workers of America have much for which to thank THAD Dul.SKI. He reorganized the antiquated Post Office into the improved and streamlined postal service. He has improved the retirement and health benefits systems for civil servants. He has completely reformed the salary and pay raise mechanism of the civil service. His improvemenrts to the civil service and postal service have benefited every American. Through his achievements, the most qualified employees are attracted to the Federal service and through his organization of the system, the ta:xipayers have been saved millions of dollars. Until his chairmanship of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, THAD-DEUS DuLsKI served with distinction on the Veterans' Affirui.Ts Committee where his aotions on behalf of this Nation's veterans are well known. And finally, we must not forget THAD DuLSKI's comments to those brave people living in the captive nations of Central and Eastern Europe. His devotioIJ. to the freedom of all people has served as a beacon to those who still must fight for personal and political freedom. To my friend and colleague, THADDEUS DULSKI, your leadership and guidance will be sorely missed. May your future be as bright as your past. WILLIAM M. ""FISHBAIT"" MILLER HON. JAMIE L.

582,1154,31,Mr. WHITTEN.," Mr. Speaker, I do not want the Congress to come to an end without calling attention to the services of William M. ""Fishbait"" Miller, who has served this Congress for more than 40 years, beginning as a youngster so skinny it is said that being from the gulf coast he was given the name of ""Fishbait,"" a name which stuck through the years, though he has changed in appearance. His unfailing courtesy and attention to the needs of the Members earned him steady promotion until he became Doorkeeper of the House, a title which in no way reflects the importance of his office, and where he supervised more than 300 employees with an annual payroll of more than $1.3 million per year. He has presented to the Congress Presidents, kings, and potentates and his· voice, saying, ""Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States,"" will be remembered by the thousands he served, among them President Ford who graciously wrote ""Fishbait"" that in his retirement-. Pascagoula is fortunate in gaining a senior statesman of stature, and the House of Representatives is losing a friend of renown and a Doorkeeper who has given many years of dedicated service to this position. I want to join with your many friends in wishing you well in any new endeavors you may choose to pursue. Also, I want you to know I will miss an associate and friend who has extended to me many gracious and thoughtful courtesies for almost a quarter of a century. With warmest personal regards, Sincerely, JERRY FORD. Fishbait is being succeeded in the new Congress by James T. Molloy, who though well qualified will have his work cut out for him in attaining the level of accommodation and service left by our friend, William M. Miller. To my friend, ""Fishbait,"" his wife, Mabel, and his fine daughter, Sarah Patsy, we extend on behalf of the Mississippi delegation, our colleagues, and his fellow employees our very best wishes for health and happiness in the years to come.

583,1204,31,Mr. MOSS.," Mr. Speaker, CHET HOLIFIELD, dean of California's congressional delegation, is, to the regret of his colleagues and the public, retiring from Congress after 32 years of outstanding public service; a term never exceeded by any California member since our State was admitted to the Union in 1850. It is a well-earned retirement for an outstanding, much respected, and much loved man. During his tenure in this House, particularly as chairman of the Government Operations Committee, he has made immensely significant contributions to American Government. As a result of his successful labors, our Government has become more effective, and efficient in innumerable ways. Having served with him for 22 years, I know, admire, and respect him far beyond the limited powers of words describe. Under his direction, legislation was developed and enacted into law creating several new Federal energy organizations. These include the Federal Energy Administration, Energy Research arid Development Administration, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and an Energy Resources Council. He authored the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, which created the General Services Administration, to give central direction to Government procurement and property management. Later, he developed legislation for a comprehensive, systematic review of Government procurement practices; the Commission on Government Procurement. As a result of his initiatives, procedures have been simplified to expedite smaller Federal purchases, saving taxpayers $100 million annually. He is responsible for establishing the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, carrying with it potential savings to taxpayers of billions of dollars. Without his efforts, we would have not obtained improved amendments to the Freedom of Information Act. Under his chairmanship, the Federal Advisory Committee Act was enacted, requiring Federal advisory committees to be publicly identified and minutes of their proceedings be made publicly available. As a result the public is entitled to know who advises Government and how much advice is given. CHET.'s work on legisla-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS tion to insure an individual's rights of privacy in handling Government records is another landmark in civil liberties legislation. This alone is a monument to his legislative record. His work on the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on which he has served since its inception in 1946, is an outstanding accomplishment in and of itself. He has always insisted on civilian control of the atom, vigorous research into its peaceful uses and international agreements aimed at bringing benefits to all mankind. In addition to serving on the Hoover Commission, he managed legislation creating two Cabinet-level departments; Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. CHET'S awards are as numerous as his accomplishments. These include three honorary degrees; the coveted Congressional Distinguished Service Awards of the American Political Science Association and the Henry DeWolf Smyth Nuclear Statesman Award. Throughout his career he has battled for civil liberties and civil rights with courage, consistency, and energy. Among his many successful endeavors in this field was authorship of the bill establishing the Cabinet Committee on Opportunities for the Spanish-speaking people within the Office of the President. It wotild be a simple matter to list more such accomplishments on behalf of our country, and to continue indefinitely without exhausting his credits. Yet, it is CHET'S personal qualities which have enabled him to do so much on behalf of us all. We all are aware of his warmth, compassion and dedication to public service. His personal character has been noted by everyone in this House. His private life has always been exemplary; we all know him to be an ideal husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. I know that as he and his lovely wife, Cam, leave us for what I know will be a long and fruitful retirement, they will know they carry with them the deepest affection and respect of every Member of this House and of every American. We are all the richer for his efforts and all the poorer for his retirement. ANDREY AVINOFF, ARTIST HON. LESLIE C. ARENDS OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES Friday, December 20, 1974 ",1974
584,1204,31,Mr. ARENDS.," Mr. Speaker, in the last decade we have seen greater official recognition of art and art forms and the individual contributions of native born and naturalized American artists. A good friend and a patron of the arts in Pittsburgh, George R. Hann, has called my attention to the credo of one such artist-the late Dr. Andrey Avinoff-who came to the United States from the Soviet Union in 1917 and whose work has been widely acclaimed. For the benefit of those who admired Dr. Avinoff's painting, as well as others in the art world, I am glad to include his credo herewith: December 2'0, 19 7 4 ANDREY AVINOFF: HIS ARTISTIC CREDO Ever since I can remember I have loved drawing and painting. At the age of four years I drew a mountainous landscape, the like of which I have not since equalled, if the satisfaction and pride which I felt at that time are to be accepted as criterions. The quite startling understanding of distance and significance which those receding mountain peaks, each topped by a fine eagle, gave to me was one of the important experiences in my, until then, level existence. This proved to be but a first happening, in a. chain of adventures, which seem to have put me in direct contact with an unexpected variety of artistic sources. Many of the unaccountable incidents and vicissitudes, which came to me in subsequent years, had no ·apparent connection with art, and yet from them I have · been permitted tO build a delibe;ate and not unfounded point of view, which, taken together with a conscientious attempt to secure technical freedom, have resulted in my present attitude towards aesthetics and towards art. It is the contact with many cycles and sources which leads me to believe in the desirability of a diversity of style, by which the artist may more fully reflect his own impulse and his understanding of the tendencies characterizing various artistic traditions. I always consider butterflies as my main instructors in Art. Since childhood I have made paintings of them, endeavoring to reproduce every shade of their color, and every minute detail of pattern. Naturally, my eye has been trained to notice the slightest vari·ations in this respect. The question of ornamental value of the butterfly's wings attracted me as one of the mo.st fascinating problems connected with my fravorite branch of entomology. Together with systematic and biological investigations, I regard as most instructive the study of the laws of color and the patte.rn variations and interconnections exhibited by the butterfly wings, which after all, represent the unique phenomenon ln nature of a rigid, flat and ornamented .mrface, stretched onto veins. This surface is devoid of any marked structural irregularity. The study of each pattern infinitely varies though manifestly subject to certain laws of balance, symmetry, ornamental repetitions in the very intricaite striation, peculiar ocellation and elaborate border designs-and discloses wonderfully 1lluminating material on decoration as pure crystallization of natural ornament, independent of any epoch or national taste. Perhaps one of the most instructive features of the coloring of butterflys' and moths' wings, is not so much how the colors are matched, as in what proportion of relative areas, equal or interrupted, they are combined. The elements of quality and quantity are here equally significant. One can find, on these winged jewels, examples of dynamic symmetries, ""constructi veisms,"" ""suprematism,"" so much spoken about now-a-days, and a great deal more besides, never dreamed by any modernistprophet. I decidedly consider a close and thoroughly systematic study of color rotations and pattern variations of lepidopera, most valuable guide for developing a sense of color composition and a feeling for harmonious and natural ornamentation. Besides the scientific interest and gra.t1· fication which I derived from entomology, I feel myself immeasurably indebted in my work as an artist, to the winged creatures that received from the ancient Greeks the fitting name of Psyche. Voyaging about the world brought me in contact again, at a mature age, with the magic and charm of Asia.tic art. It was a true inspiration to admire the glories of India-Buddhist, Hindu and Mahometanthe phantasmagorical temples of South India, the grace and abstract perfection of Mogul art, the fascinating mystery and pro-",1974
