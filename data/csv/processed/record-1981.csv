0,Senate,97,0.322,16,1,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, despite all  the debate over  tax cuts  in  the 96th  Congress, no action was taken to allevi ate the rising burden of taxation that  has become a drag on our economy. The  election results have given us a mandate  to reduce taxes. But whatever we do at  this point, there will be a net increase  in the taxes paid by the American people  in 1981. H;gher social  security  taxes,  the windfall profit tax, and inflation will  combine to raise the tax burden to record  peacetime levels. The tax increase from  inflation  pushing  people  into higher  brackets alone will amount to $20 billion  or more in 1981.  TAXFLATION  Mr. President,  infiation  is our No.  1  tax problem. As  inflation  increases.  a  taxpayer's income must also increase  to enable the family  to buy  the same  amount of goods and services. But, as  nominal  income rises,  the  taxpayer  pushed  into  higher  and  higher  tax  brackets-thus,  paying  a  larger  tax  bill-<lespite the fact  that no gain in  purchasing power has been  realized.  Because of our progressive tax system,  the taxpayer is required to pay a higher  percentage of his earnings in taxes. Al though  the  taxpayer  is earning more  money to keep up with infiation, his or  her real standard of living may actually  decline.  is  INDEXING  Mr. President, the legislation I intro duce today is designed to protect taxpay ers from the tax impact of inflation by  automatically  adjusting  tax  liabilities  each year to reflect increases in the cost  of  living. The Tax Equalization Act  would adjust the personal  income tax  rates, the personal exemption, and the  zero bracket amount to reflect increases  in the cost of living as measured by the  consumer price  index during  the pre vious year. The Tax Equalization Act is  effective beginning with tax years after  1981, and will  remain  in effect  for 4  years, at which point Congress will have  an opportunity to review and determine  ",1981
1,Senate,97,0.099,42,1,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, today Sen ator DOLE and I are reintroducing legis lation to correct an inequity in the im plementation of the special use valuation  for family farms.  I originally introduced this legislation  on October 4, 1979 as S. 1859. Although  the Subcommittee on Taxation and Debt  Management held hearings on my bill  last year, the Senate Finance Committee  did not have the opportunity to report  the bill. Under the very able leadership  of the distinguished Senator from Kan sas <Mr. DoLE), I am very optimistic that  the problem addressed by our legislation  will be corrected.  Mr. President, last year the Internal  Revenue Service interpreted a portion of  the Tax Reform Act of 1976 in a manner  which poses a threat to family farmers,  contrary to the intent of Congress.  In 1976, we enacted the Tax Reform  Act to make a fundamental change in  estate tax policy for family farms. Prior  to 1976, family farms, like other prop erty, were valued at their highest and  best use for estate tax purposes. This  made the continuation of farming finan cially impossible for many family farm ers. They were put out of business be cause they were forced to sell their land  to pay the tax bill.  The Tax Reform Act recognized the  importance of keeping the family farm  intact by writing into the law a special  provision-the special use valuation which valued the family farm on its in come potential as a  farm; not on  its  value as a subdivision or its speculative  agricultural value when it does not bear  a reasonable relationship to its earning  capacity. This act eased the estate tax  burden on the heirs of family farms and  made it possible for them to continue  contributing  to  the agricultural pro ductivity of the Nation. I fully supported  this change.  Unfortunately, as  too often happens  with laws of good intent, the 1976 act is  complex and its administration has been  difficult. And in this particular case it  has been grossly unfair.  The Tax Reform Act provided a for mula  to  calculate  the  special  use  valuation.  The formula simply divides  the net  annual gross cash rent for comparable  farmland in the area of the farm in ques tion by the average annual effective in terest rate charged by the Federal land  banks on new agricultural loans to farm ers and ranchers. The estate tax value is  the average of the resulting amount for  the 5 most recent calendar years end ing before the decedent's death.  A problem has arisen in Illinois, Kan sas, South Carolina, Oklahoma, and sev eral other States where little farmland  is cash rented. Most farmland in these  '  ",1981
2,Senate,97,-0.355,55,1,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, I rise to day  to introduce the State and Local  Government Fiscal Note Act of 1981.  This measure is, quite simply, a timely  and necessary  response  to  the  rising  chorus of voices  in our land who are  crylng out for fiscally prudent and ac countable behavior on the part of the  Federal Government in its dealings with  State and local governments.  Fiscal notes, or analyses of the costs  of legislation to government, are not a  new idea, although they represent a rela tively recent phenomenon at the Fed eral level. It was not until the Congress      ",1981
3,Senate,97,0.272,68,1,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President, I  rise in  support of this resolution, which would  provide the President with the tools nec essary to negotiate temporary quantita tive  limitations on the  importation of  automotive equipment. The joint resolu tion does not force the President's hand;  it gives him the means to do something  about imports if, after consultations, he  determines  that  import measures are  necessary.  Auto and truck imports threaten the  very existence of this crucial domestic  sector. Moreover, declines in these in'  ",1981
4,Senate,97,0.078,81,1,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, a  recent  advertisement which  appeared  in  the  Washington Post on January 4 dramat ically makes clear the differing points of  view about the present situation in Iran  among Iranians and Iranian-Americans  w'ho have long been interested in that  country. Just as there appears to be lit tle consensus within the Iranian leader ship over what to do about the hostages,  this advertisement suggests there is lit tle consensus among Iranians over what  to do about their government.  Without getting  into  the merits of  these obviously strongly felt differences,  I do think the advertisement contains a  useful lesson for those of us less close  to this situation-that we should not put  on all the people of Iran the burden of  our disagreements with  their govern ment. We have a long history of warm  relations with the Iranian people which  should not be forgotten by them or by  us. I hope that when the current difficul ties have been resolved we will be able  to rebuild that relationship. Mr. Presi dent, I ask that the text of the excerpt  from the Post be printed at this point in  the RECORD.  The text follows:  OPEN LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT RoNALD  REAGAN  DEAR MR. REAGAN: On two recent occasions  concerning  the U.S. hostages  in Iran, you  have made sta.tements such as ""crimin.a.ls,  kidnappers, and barbarians."" Although on  the first occasion you have made it clear you  were referring to the hostages' captors; the  lack of any specific reference on the second  OCC8iSion has caused concern among a  large  segment of Iranians as well as many Ameri cans acquainted with  Iran who maintain  close contact with their Iranian friends.  We would like to bring to your attention  and the attention of all the Americans and  the people of the free world that, there Is  distinction between the terrorist gang who  are holding power in Iran and the general  and genuine population of Iran by citing the  following facts:  Since February 1979, over 800,000 Iranians  have  left  their homeland and millions of  others would leave Iran if it were physically  and financially possible. Some have fied the  terror by risking their lives and thousands  have been victims of summary execution in  so called ""Islamic Revolutionary Courts.""  Before  the present chaos  in  Iran, over  1,000,000 members of the internation.a.l com munity were  treated  in  the best manner.  More than 50,000 Americans and other for eigners, along with  their  families,  resided  and worked in Iran, and were respected and  secured by our laws.  Americans and Iranians have h8id a. friend ship of long duration, economically, militar ily and culturally. During their period thou sands of  intellectuals and  students have  studied and were  infiuenced by American  institutions.  Thousands of Iranians who are holding  jobs in different countries are respected and  trusted for their integrity and behavior.  Therefore it is logical that the practices of  the terrorist gang in Iran, under the guise of  Islam, goes against the wishes of the ma jority of Iranians and this group's policies  are oppo3ed to the spirit of Islam and the  teaching of hold Koran.  We  definitely  understand  and  support  your concern for the lives and safety of the  52 Americans held hostages  in Iran; how ever, we hope that as the president of a free  world country, you should at least have some  concern for the 36 million Iranians who are  held captive in their own country under the  tyranny of a group of religious fanatics.  In the past fourteen months the U.S. gov ernment has tried in vain to come to some  kind of accommodation with  the  terrorist  regimes  in  Iran. However,  in spite of all  those efforts, not only the problem has re mained unresolved, but in addition, it has  caused false hopes, embarrassment, and hu miliation  for U.S.  prestige at home and  abroad.  It is our firm belief that the hostage prob lem cannot be solved until the Iranian peo ple are able to overthrow the existing ter rorist regime in their homeland. And in or der to do so they need the moral and mate rial support of the responsible freedom-lov ing citizens and countries of the world.  Therefore, we urge you Mr. President, to  distinguish between the  terrorists fiouting  international law and the majority of Ira nians who are law-abiding; to initiate a firm  policy to end the blackmail. kidna,pping and  terrorism which has been allowed to disrupt  diplomatic relations, as well as to create an  international  misunderstanding  in  the  world community  towards mlllions of Ira nians whose revolution for the establishment  of a democratic  institution,  freedom, and  the rule of law has been vanquished by the  present terrorist regime in Iran.  We hope that the revised American policy  and  the pressure of world public opinion  ",1981
5,House,97,0.372,107,1,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Louisi ana (Mr. MOORE).  ",1981
6,House,97,0.24,107,1,Mr. MOORE.," I thank the Republi can leader for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that the  American people understand what we  are doing here today. As a member of  the Ways and Means Committee,  I  would just like to give my viewpoint  on what I think is really going on.  The adoption of these rules is impor tant  to determine how  this House  shall operate for the next 2 years. But  it also amounts  to a great deal of  philosophical  and political decision making going  into what makes up  these rules.  The Ways and Means Committee is  simply being stacked. That is a good  word for it, the best word I can think  of.  I  think  the people of America  ought to understand it. The Ways and  Means Committee is being stacked. It  is being stacked by a philosophical mi nority  in  this House,  it  is  being  stacked by the same people who were  repudiated  overwhelmingly  by  the  American people on November 4,  in  order  to  block what  those  people  wanted done. A tax cut was not passed  by the 96th Congress. The philosophi cal majority of that Congress is the  philosophical minority of  this Con gress. But that group still controls the  makeup of rules of this House, and  these rules that are before us to vote  on today are nothing more than stack ing the Ways and Means Committee,  to thwart the decision of the American  people on November 4, to see to it that  we still do not get a tax cut, like we  did not get in the last Congress and  under the last administration. I think  the American people ought to under stand  that  this vote  that shall be  coming up, this vote on whether or not  to vote down the previous question,  amounts to simply stacking the com mittee and thwarting the will of the  American people and  the economic  policy they voted for.  I urge that we vote down the previ ous question so that we have an oppor tunity to vote for a set of rules that  let happen what  the American  people wanted. I think the American  people ought to understand that this  is not a mere technical vote, this is not  will  merely a procedural vote. This  is a  very substantial, substantive vote that  folks back home ought to understand  as to how their Congressman and Con gresswoman voted.  Mr. Speaker,  I urge  that we vote  down the previous question.  ",1981
7,House,97,0.581,107,1,Mr. WALKER.,"  I  thank the distin guished minority leader for yielding,  and  I would  like  to point out, Mr.  Speaker,  that  the  gentleman  from  Texas, the majority leader, described  the rules changes as an attempt to ex pedite and to facilitate. Mr. Speaker, it  seems to me that what we have here is  really an attempt to severely limit the  debate of the House of Representa tives.  Since I have been here we have had  individual gag rules on many occasions  before this House. It seems to me that  what we are being asked to adopt here  today  is a  collective gag  rule. This  House has long been a bastion of open  debate. We have had the idea in the  House of Representatives  that men  and women could exchange ideas and,  out of that, produce good legislation.  Well,  this would take away some of  that attempt to debate. It would also  mean  that  the majority would not  even hear some of the views of the mi nority on specific issues.  What we are really doing is violating  a meaningful parliamentary tradition  in this country, open debate. I would  say, Mr. Speaker, that it is time that  we stand up and do something about  it. The attempt  to gag  this House  should be roundly defeated by sup porting the motion to defeat the previ ous question.  ",1981
8,House,97,0.601,107,1,Mr. ROUSSELOT.," Mr. Speaker, this  is an economic fight. It is a mistake to  gag this House and prevent it from  fulfilling the promises that were made  during this past election. If this rule is  passed as  it  is, we will not have a  chance to fulfill the economic prom ises  that  the American people  are  waiting  for. And make no mistake  about it, that is exactly what we will  be doing if we pass this rule as is.  It cannot be passed over as easily as  the majority leader would like to make  us believe. It is saddling this House  with an inability to fulfill the econom ic promises that were made by Mem bers of this House, by the President,  and by Members of the other body. I  think it would be a major mistake for  this country to believe that we are ful filling  their promises  if  this rule  is  passed as is.  So I urge my colleagues to vote down  the previous question, so that we can  free up  this rule by several amend ments that will be offered.  ",1981
9,House,97,0.371,107,1,Mr. CONABLE.," Mr Speaker, there  are lots of things I would like to talk  about in these rules. For instance, I  think  the clustering of votes  is an  abomination. It reduces the attention  of the House,  the understanding of  the issues, it usually reduces the at tendance  at debate  considerably.  I  think, also, the minority leader is ab solutely right when he says that the  economic issue is central and that we  should give control over this issue to  the Budget Committee rather than to  the Rules Committee, which, as we  know, has been splendidly stacked by  the rules we are about to vote on.  I want to spend most of my time,  however,  talking about what is hap pening to the Ways and Means Com mittee. You know, one of the things  that saddens the American people is  that elections come and elections go,  but politics  is always with us. Elec tions should make a difference. We  had in the 95th Congress 12 members  of the Republican Party on the Ways  and Means Committee. In the 96th, we  had 12. In the 97th, we have 12. By  this rule we have moved, of course, the  ratio from 2-to-1 plus 1 in the 95th to  2-to-1 minus 1 now; that is all the re sponse we have had to two elections  which have added 45 Republicans to  the House. Now, I say that is grossly  unfair.  It  is manipulative. That  is  reason enough to oppose this rule. But  it is also unrealistic.  The power reality on the the floor is  going to be different from the commit tee ratio of the tax-writing committee  and there is no more important issue  between  the Government  and  the  people than taxation. Taxation is an  issue that should be dealt with by a  body representative of the House as a  whole. Under this rule it is not going  to be handled in that way.  Now, another probably effect of this  change is going to be to shift the tax  initiative from  the House of Repre sentatives to the Senate. The adminis tration will much more easily  inter face with the Senate, which is going to  be representative of the popular vote,  while in our body we will find a meas ure prepared by the Ways and Means  Committee going to the floor in unac ceptable form, an impasse inherent in  the process, and the inevitable result  is going to be a proliferation of non germane  amendments  from  the  Senate. Rules can impose a restriction  of  amendments  to  the Ways  and  Means bill, and the floor as a whole  will have no alternative but complete  rejection when it finds the committee  work out of phase.  ",1981
10,House,97,-0.448,120,1,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, as this  97th Congress convenes,  I  invite all  Members of the House  to cosponsor  the nondiscrimination in insurance bill  which I introduced today.  This  bill  has one  single,  simple,  narrow,  objective-to  eliminate  dis crimination, on the basis of race, color,  religion, sex, or national origin, in in surance  and  annuities.  It prohibits  such discrimination in all phases of in surance and annuities-in access and  availability of coverage and underwrit ing;  in  the  terms, conditions,  rates,  benefits, and requirements of the in surance and annuity contracts; and in  the methods for determining them. It  would not do anything else. It would  not in any other way interfere with  any State's power to regulate the in surance industry. It would not affect  any other type of action by any insur ance company.  This bill, like the bill <H.R. 100) in  the 96th Congress on which 85 Mem bers joined me as cosponsors and on  which preliminary subcommittee hear ings were held last year, is patterned  after three major laws which are now  in the United States Code, namely:  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of  1964, which prohibits such discrimina tion in employment;  Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of  1968, which prohibits such discrimina tion in housing; and  The Equal Credit Opportunity Act  which prohibits such discrimination in  consumer credit and finance.  Like  the employment and housing  antidiscrimination laws, this will place  primary jurisdiction in the States to  deal with such discrimination in insur ance and annuities. Thus, the bill spe cifically provides that any complaint  that an insurer has committed an un lawful  discriminatory  act-that  is,  based on race, color, religion, sex, or  national origin-must  first be  filed  with the appropriate State agency, if  the State has a  law prohibiting such  discrimination and an agency  to ad minister and enforce that State law.  Only if the State has no such law or  agency, or fails  to resolve  it to  the  complainant's satisfaction, will  this  bill allow the complainant to seek the  next remedy, namely, to file a judicial  action in a State or Federal court. The  availability of  that  judicial  remedy  will, of course, encourage the enact ment of State laws prohibiting such  discrimination. It will also help make  the administration of the State law  more effective, because the State can  then proceed to eliminate discrimina tion based on race, color, religion, sex,  or national origin, without any fear  that such action may result in insur ance  companies  or  their  contracts  moving to another State which allows  such discrimination.  WHY THIS BILL SHOULD BE ENACTED  The principle of prohibiting discrim ination based on race, color, religion,  sex, or national origin is now part of  our fundamental law and doctrine. We  have  made  great  strides  toward  making that principle into living reali ty-in employment, public accommo dations, housing, credit, government  regulation and government benefits,  transportation, recreation, voting, edu cation, athletics, and many other areas  of life.  But one of the greatest remammg  gaps  is  in  insurance and annuities.  Blacks  are  heavily  discriminated  against in property, accident, casualty,  and health insurance, and more subtly  in other forms of insurance. Sex dis crimination is blatant and widespread.  These  discriminations  have  wide spread impact on millions of people.  Our national policy of ending discrimi nation on the basis of race, color, reli gion, sex, or national origin demands  that such discrimination in insurance  and annuities also be ended.  This bill will not harm the insurance  industry. It will help to protect con sumers, business, poor people, widows,  and orphans. It will not intrude on the  ability or powers of any State, which  complies with  the nondiscrimination  principle, to regulate the insurance in dustry. Most defined-benefit pension  and annuity plans, and much of the  group forms of insurance, already op erate without  such  discrimination.  Several Federal courts, including the  Supreme Court of the United States,  have already ruled that sex discrimi nation in pension plans violates title  VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but  many insurance companies still engage  in such discrimination in their annuity  plans. This bill will eliminate that dis parity between  the  requirements of  title VII as now applied by the courts  in employment-related plans, and the  industry's  discriminatory  practices,  and will thus prevent possible frustra tion of  title VII's nondiscrimination  mandate. It is a bill whose enactment  is long overdue.  Last year, many organizations en dorsed H.R.  100,  including  among  them the Leadership Conference on  Civil Rights; American Association of  University Professors;  the AFL-CIO;  National Women's Political Caucus;  NAACP; American Association of Uni versity Women;  Women's  Equity  Action League;  American Civil Lib erties Union; Mexican-American Legal  Defense Fund; National Organization  for Women;  Interdepartmental Task  Force on Women; Women, U.S.A.; and  many other groups.  I  invite all Members  to cosponsor  this bill. I  intend, after a reasonable  time for responses, to ask that the bill  be reprinted to list all cosponsors.e  THE HANDGUN CONTROL ACT  OF 1981  The SPEAKER.

11,House,97,-0.509,120,1,Mr. BINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, today  I am offering legislation which could  save the lives of some 10,000 people  each year. Passage of this legislation,  H.R. 40, could mean the difference be tween life and death to these individ uals by placing stringent controls on  the manufacture, sale, and possession  of the deadly handgun.  ",1981
12,,97,0.146,146,1,Mr. WAMPLER.," Mr. Speaker, last  February 13, I  introduced legislation,  H.R. 6521,  to divide  the  regulatory  decisionmaking  process  into  two  stages. The first stage would have a  scientific council define and evaluate  the scientific question of whether or  not a substance was a risk-a hazard and to what degree it was a hazard. In  the second stage, our current regula tors would assess the significance of  the risk-the benefits, if any, to be de rived from the substance and the ap propriate means, if any, for limiting its  use.  To accomplish the first stage would  require the creation of an independent  science body of the highest qualifica tions to make the scientific risk evalu ations, to assure that our regulatory  decisions are based on the best objec tive science available. A section-by-sec tion analysis of my earlier bill, titled  ""The National Science Council Act of  1980,"" Was placed in the CONGRESSION AL RECORD page 2791 on February 13,  1980. As a  result of favorable com ments received from numerous scien tists in academia and industry in a de tailed review of my bill, I have made  one modification to the bill I am intro ducing  today. H.R. 6521 would have  placed the task of selecting the scien tists after they were nominated by the  National Academy of Sciences in the  President of the United States. Many  of those commenting on the bill felt  that allowing the President to select  the Council members would make the  Council subject to political manipula tion. Most of them would have pre ferred having the Academy nominate  and select the Council. But the Acade my itself opposed the task of selecting  the final makeup of the Council and  also providing for its facilities, admin istrative staffing, and furnishing other  administrative  activities  required  to  support the Council. H.R. 6521 would  have required the Office of Science  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to have pro and Technology Policy  vided this support.  The bill  I  am  introducing  today  would transfer these tasks-that of se lecting the scientists to make up the  Council and that of providing for its  administrative support-to the Chair man of the National Science Board,  the independent governing body of the  National  Science  Foundation.  This  action, it is thought, would further in crease  the  independence of the Sci ence Council.  Mr. Speaker, we must halt the con fusion now existing  in the different  regulatory decisionmaking agencies of  our Government over whether or not a  particular substance should or should  not be banned from our food or use in  the workplace, such as saccharin and  nitrite, to name a few.  The failure of Federal agencies  to  adopt a consistent approach to identi fying and regulating these substances  has imposed an increasing number of  stringent and desperate restrictions on  the uses of chemicals, without a sound  scientific basis for many of these ac tions,  thereby  limiting the quantity,  quality, and variety of food, fiber, and  forest products available  to consum ers. The failure on the part of the reg ulators in Government to follow good  scientific procedures has evoked such  severe criticism by consumers and by  scientists in Government, academic in stitutions, and industry, that the Con gress has become increasingly involved  in  implementing  regulatory  policy  with respect to these substances.  Hopefully, Mr. Speaker,  this prob lem can be cured administratively but  in the event it cannot, this bill will go  a long way toward correcting this most  severe regulatory problem.e  NO MEDICAL DEFENSE TO A  NUCLEAR ATTACK  HON. JONATHAN B. BINGHAM  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 5, 1981  e ",1981
13,,97,-0.509,146,1,Mr. BINGHAM.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  during the past year Dr. Howard H.  Hiatt, dean of the Harvard School of  Public Health, has performed a great  public service by pointing out the im possibility of providing anything like  adequate medical care  for  the vast  numbers of people who would be criti cally injured in a nuclear attack, re gardless of any alleged civil defense  preparations. His efforts have struck a  responsive chord in the medical com munity, both here and abroad.  Last month  leading American and  Soviet doctors met in Switzerland and  agreed  that ""Physicians  in a  post attack period would be unable to pro vide effective care for the sick and in jured."" The following article about the  meeting  from  the Boston Globe of  January 5, 1981  Sunday, December 7, 1980, is of partic ular interest now that some American  leaders are saying a nuclear war would  be survivable:  [From the Boston Globe, Sun., Dec. 7, 19801  UNITED STATES, SOVIET DOCTORS AGREE  N-DEFENSE AN ILLUSION  <By Richard A. Knox)  A group of Soviet and American physi cians meeting in Switzerland agreed yester day that nuclear war between the superpow ers would be ""an unparalleled human disas ter"" and  that civil defense measures de signed to save significant numbers of civil ians in either country are ""an illusion.""  The outcome of the unprecedented discus sions, which  included three of the Soviet  Union's most prominent medical authori ties, was  learned  in  telephone  interviews  with members of both delegations at the  conclusion of the two-day sessions.  The doctors' talks also produced agree ment that:  ""Physicians in a postattack period would  be unable to provide effective care for the  sick and injured.""  Even if nuclear weapons are never used,  the enormous price tag of the nuclear arms  race ""is diverting scarce resources desper ately needed for medical and human needs.""  ""Physicians can and should make impor tant contributions to the prevention of such  a disaster,"" the bilateral group said.  The doctors' joint declaration was adopted  during the first-ever formal discussions be tween medical leaders of the two leading nu clear powers on the human consequences of  nuclear war and the arms race.  The talks, which took place Friday and  yesterday, officially launched a new doctors'  organization called International Physicians  for the Prevention of Nuclear War. Mter  the  two delegations agreed on  the main  principles behind  the group,  the Soviets  asked to add a plea for ""all physicians of  the world to raise their voices against nucle ar war and for nuclear disarmament.""  ""Our task is to show the people of the  world what nuclear war  is,"" Dr. Eugene.  Chazov, Soviet deputy minister of health,  said yesterday in a telephone interview with  The Globe from Geneva. Chazov is co-chair man of the new group with Dr. Bernard  the Harvard School of Public  Lown of  Health.  ""In some countries there is a new under standing of  the consequences of nuclear  war,"" he added, speaking through an inter preter. ""In this sense I would like to recall  the words of Albert Einstein when he was  asked a question concerning when World  War III would start. He said: 'I don't know  when it will start. But I know for sure there  will be no World War IV.'""  The Geneva meeting is the latest in a rap idly growing new movement among physi cians designed to call attention to the hor rors of nuclear war, which Dean HowartH.  Hiatt of  the Harvard School of Public  Health has called ""the last epidemic.""  The effort, which began  last February  with a much-publicized conference in Cam bridge on the medical consequences of nu clear war, has since spread to the medical  communities of other countries-and even  captured  the attention of  the politically  conservative American Medical Assn.  A group of British doctors last month an nounced  the formation of a group called  Medical Campaign against Nuclear Weapons  ""to heighten the awareness of the medical  profession and of  those  concerned with  ",1981

21,,97,-0.416,237,1,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Mr.  Speaker,  today my  colleague Representative  BARBER CONABLE. and I are introducing  legislation to permit all taxpayers to  claim a tax deduction for their contri butions  to  charitable  organizations  whether or not they itemize their per sonal deductions.  This legislation has received serious  attention  in previous Congresses  in  both  the Committee on Ways and  Means  and  in  the Senate Finance  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Committee. A large share of the credit  for the substantial progress made in  the last 4 years toward enactment of  this concept must go  to our former  colleague,  Representative  Joseph  Fisher of Virginia. His leadership on  this issue was invaluable, and the fact  that the bill we are introducing today  stands such a good chance of enact ment during the 97th Congress is due  to his considerable efforts and influ ence on its behalf.  Joining with us in cosponsoring this  legislation  are Senators DANIEL  P.  MOYNIHAN  and  ROBERT  PACKWOOD,  who are introducing an identical bill.  In the 96th Congress, this measure  was sponsored by 253 House Members  and 43 Senators.  I  trust  that  this  breadth of support from both sides of  the aisle will soon be evident in the  97th Congress as well.  The rationale behind this bill contin ues  to be both  timely and relevant.  The major idea is that people ought  not be taxed on money they contrib ute to charitable causes. This should  be true whether or not other economic  actions make it advantageous for them  to itemize personal deductions. Allow ing everyone to deduct charitable con tributions from taxable income, as this  bill proposes, would restore the badly  eroded  incentives for supporting the  independent  sector  and  would  strengthen the precarious position of  charities in today's inflationary econo my. We need to reestablish a proper  and appropriate balance between the  Government and the voluntary sector.  Reaffirming this balance is crucial in  today's tightfisted environment, which  is restricting Government's ability to  support social services, cultural activi ties,  health,  education,  and many  other important services.  The Tax Code currently discourages  many  individuals  from making  the  contributions  that are necessary  to  sustain the vitality of the independent  sector. Two-thirds of the tax returns  filed currently use the so-called stand ard deduction rather than itemization  of personal deductions. This is particu larly true for taxpayers in the middle  and lower income brackets where in flation  is  already  viciously  bearing  down on people's ability  to support  themselves  and  their  families  and  eroding their support for charity. For  many, it is becoming increasingly im possible to continue making contribu tions of after-tax dollars.  These  same  economic  conditions  which are adversely  impacting peo ple's ability to make charitable contri butions are simultaneously  reducing  the Government's ability  to provide  services and creating greater needs for  such services than ever before. Trans ferring some of this necessary work of  society out of the public sector and  into the community-the independent,  the  voluntary  and  the  nonprofit  sector-offers a way out of this dilem235  ma. H.R. 501 provides an incentive to  taxpayers to make the charitable con tributions which are necessary to ac complish this goal of disengaging the  Government from doing many of the  things that could be accomplished just  as well or even better through volun tary, charitable organizations.   TRIBUTE TO RETIRED  MEMBERS FROM CALIFORNIA  HON. FORTNEY H. (PETE) STARK  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 6, 1981   ",1981
22,,97,-0.631,237,1,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  express my gratitude to Bizz Johnson,  Jim Corman, Jim Lloyd, and Lionel  Van Deerlin who retired at the end of  the  last Congress. These men have  served their districts, the State of Cali fornia, and the entire Nation well and  faithfully. Their leadership will be es pecially missed by those of us who are  their colleagues from California.  If I may, I'd like to express my per sonal thanks to Jim Corman for 20  years of service to the people of Cali fornia and the Nation.  It has been my  rare privilege  to  serve with  Jim on  the Ways  and  Means Committee and on the Subcom mittee on Public Assistance and Un employment Compensation, which he  has chaired so ably.  I can say with confidence that no  Member of this body has better repre sented the needs of the poor and the  disadvantaged  than  Jim  Corman.  We've all been educated by his elo quence and his sincerity on welfare  reform and national health insurance.  But Jim Corman's constituency  is  larger than the disenfranchised of this  Nation-it  includes  every American  taxpayer who is concerned about tax  equity and justice.  Jim Corman is above all a man with  a vision of the United States where no  person is cold or hungry, sick, or left  by the wayside because of social or po litical forces beyond his control. He  has shared that vision with me and  with all of us. We are better legisla tors,  better men  and women,  and  better Americans because of it.  Thanks are not enough. We have  come a long way in the last 20 years  toward  the  realization of  the goals  that Jim Corman and I share. But the  job is not done, and I know that Jim  Corman will not stop working in the  years ahead. So I would like to say to  that  distinguished  gentleman  from  California-you have my thanks and  my promise to continue to work with  you to realize the vision we share.  And  to  all my  retired  colleagues  from California we are honoring,  I  offer my thanks.e  ",1981
23,,97,-0.106,276,1,Mr. APPLEGATE.," Mr.  Speaker,  over the Christmas holidays, I had the  opportunity  to be viewing  television  when a commercial came on about the  U.S. ski team, and, in particular, the  official car of the team, a Subaru. As I  am sure you know this is a Japanese produced vehicle.  At a  time-of most severe economic  hardship in one of,  if not the most  basic  industry  in the United States,  that being the auto  industry,  I am  quite dismayed  that an entity  that  represents America, such as the U.S.  ski team, would favor foreign products  over those made in America. I do not  January 13, 1981  iD.  claim  to be qualified  to  judge  the  merits of the official car versus those  of American products, although I am  sure there are American products of  equal quality; however, I believe that  the underlying theme of the U.S. ski  team, that of pride in America should  be carried out in every way possible.  To only take this concept to the slopes  of mountains and then forget about it  when it comes  to strengthening our  national economy, and,  turn, our  national  security,  is hypocritical at  best. I do not mean to imply that a  single Subaru is a direct threat to our  national security, but certainly, when  it is promoted as it is by the ski team  and then grouped together with other  foreign makes, there is a definite detri mental overall effect.  In light of current economic and in dustrial conditions, I strongly urge the  U.S. ski team to take immediate action  and reject this or any other foreign  product as an official car of the team.  If an official car is indeed needed at  the team should select one that  promotes American industry and helps  our economy to grow and prosper. I  further believe a public statement to  this affect should also be made.e  all,  GERALD R. FORD PRESIDENTIAL  MUSEUM  HON. HAROLD S.

The museum, built  to honor our  38th President, marks  a  significant  step in the redevelopment of the city  of Grand Rapids, just as the tenure of  President Ford marked a  significant  transition for our Nation.  There can be no doubt that Jerry  :ford helped shape the successful all American  image  of Grand Rapids,  which  he  represented  in Congress  before assuming the responsibilities of  Vice President and' later President.  The residents of the Fifth Congres sional District are excited to be joined  by the entire Nation in saying a well deserved  ""thank you""  through  the  grand opening of the Ford Presiden tial Museum.  I am pleased to  include an article  from the Grand Rapids Press of De cember 16, 1980, which tells more for  those who may want to know about  the Ford Presidential Museum open ing:  ",1981
25,Senate,97,-0.492,289,1,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President, I  am pleased to join my colleagues in in troducing  this  legislation  to designate  January  15,  the birthday of Martin  Luther King, Jr., a legal public holiday.  I do not know of any legislation more  worthy of our immediate attention than  this measure. Dr. King was not only  one of our finest and most courageous  leaders, he was a teacher of the highest  order as well. He taught us about justice  and decency, about the basic goodness of  human beings and about the need  to  better  the  lot of  those  less  fortunate  than we. He  taught us  to  stand up  against intolerance, prejudice, and in justice, whatever  the  source  and  to  struggle nonviolently and with dignity  for the goal of equality of opportunity  for all. He taught us to hope and dream  of better times when ""justice rolls down  like waters  and  righteousness  like  a  mighty stream."" And perhaps most im portant of all, he taught us  that one  man-one committed, caring, courage ous and selfless man-can make a differ ence.  Legislation to designate January 15 a  national holiday has been introduced in  every Congress since Dr. King's death in  1968. And frankly I am baffled that there  can be any question about honoring the  gr.eatness of Dr. King in this way. Dr.  Kmg transformed the spirit of this Na tion. H~ kindled a passion for  justice  and social reform that will forever burn  in our hearts. I will always be proud that  I had the privilege of marching with him  from Selma to Montgomery. The least  we can do is acknowledge Dr. King's un selfish contribution  to  this society by  commemorating his name  through  a  national holiday. And perhaps ln these  troubled  times such remembrance will  79-059 0 84 19 (Vol. 127 Pt. 1)  also serve to keep our own commitment  to  justice, equality, and peace burning  bright. As our distinguished former col league Senator Birch Bayh, chief spon sor of  this  legislation during  the  last  Congress,  so  eloquently  testified  at  hearings on S. 25 in the 96th Congress:  I! we  as a nation remember Dr. King's  birthttay each year, it wlll provide us with  an annual  reminder  that  the pursuit of  equal justice for all is a task we all share as  American citizens-a task which wlll not be  completed until we can truly say that no  American is a second-class citizen.  Dr. King committed his life to the bet terment of his  fellow human beings.  From Selma to Montgomery to Birming ham to the Lincoln Memorial to Mem phis, Tenn., Dr. King carried his mes sage of hope, peace, and  justice. His  vision of true equality for all Americans  has continued  to shine brightly years  after his tragic death. By honoring Dr.  King through the creation of a national  holiday commemorating his name, we  help to build a greater national commit ment to the goals which Dr. King dedi cated his life to achieving.  As in the past, the effort in this Con gress to enact the Martin Luther King,  Jr., bill is a truly bipartisan effort. And  that is as it should be. For Dr. King's  message  of hC'Pe  transcends political  parties. The goals he helped us set for  ourselves and our society are goals that  all  just men  and women  strive  for  regardless of political affiliation. It is my  fervent hope that this will be the year in  whioh my colleagues on both sides of the  aisl~here and in the Hous~will join  together a.nd finally succeed in properly  honoring Dr. King's memory by making  his birthday an occasion of national  celebration and remembrance.

NUCLEAR WASTE MANAGEMENT REORGANIZATION  ACT OF 1981   ",1981
26,Senate,97,0.382,328,1,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I am to day  introducing  the  Comprehensive  Health Care Reform Act  to  contain  health care costs, provide protection to  individuals against catastrophic medical  expenses, and encourage greater avail ability of preventive health benefits. I  was cosponsor of this bill when it was  introduced in 1979 as S. 1590 by Senator  Richard S. Schweiker. This bill  is an  important part of the so-called competi tive approach to a more comprehensive  health benefit program for all Ameri cans.  At  the  time  the  Comprehensive  Health Care Reform Act was first intro duced, I stated:  In these fiscally austere times, this 1s a  commonsense approach to the problems fac ing our health care delivery system and a  sane alternative  to the $18  to $60 blllion  proposals now being bandied about congres sional circles.  The Comprehensive Health Care Reform  Act will address  the health care  issues of  catastrophic  health  insurance,  preventive  medical care, and hosnital cost containment.  The beauty of it is that it wlll do so, not  with further regulation or new government  programs, but by usin!l!;  the tax system to  promote more competition in health deliv ery and to put more emphasis on controll1ng  costs.  The advocates of sociallzed medicine never  point out that only 5 nercent of Americans  lack any health  insurance. and a  slightly  higher nercentaae lacks catastrophic cover age. Both  these groups could be protected  by slightly expanding coverage of existing  health programs. We are told that without  more Government  control,  costs will  go  through the roof. But it was precisely when  all the Government's programs, regulations,  and paperwork began weighing down on the  health care community that medical costs  first took off. How will even more bureauc racy lead to lower costs?  We  can solve  the pressing problems of  escalating medical costs, but only by reduc ing Government control and regulation and  by simultaneously promoting more compe tition. The Comprehensive Health Care Re form Act  is a  sensible  step  In  the right  direction.  I pledged then to work with Senator  Schweiker to assure that a fiscally pain less, comprehensive health bill would be  enacted. Little did I know when I made  that pledge  that  the Senator would  become the new Secretary of Health and  Human Services, providing an oppor tunity for us to continue working  to gether toward improvement of this bill  and its eventual adoption.  In the year and a half since we first  introduced  the Comprehensive Health  Care Reform Act there has been con siderable  dialog  a;bout  ""competitive   programs. Support for this approach has  broadened. However  the  overall  eco nomic  situation has greatly worsened  and the immediate nat!onal environment  is not favorable for comprehensive re form of the health care system, even if  it ultimately results  in more competi tion, less regulation, and containment of  coots.  The  importance of  intra:iucing  the  Comprehensive Health Care Reform Act  at this time is to continue the nation wide  discussion  of  competitive  ap proaches. Hopefully  this dialog will:  Stimulate  experiments,  models,  and  studies that will refine the ""competitive""  approach; suggest interim measures that  lead toward comprehensive reform; and  shorten the final debate when the Nation  is able to fully focus on this issue.  Senator Schweiker acknowledged these  circumstances at his recent confirmation  hearing when he predicted that, rather  than offering a comprehensive package,  the new administration would probably  propose demonstration projects relating  to health care competition. This caution  is appropriate. Demonstration projects  will find support even among enthusi astic  advocates  of  a  comprehensive oriented  reform. This  reftects an ac knowledgment of the complexity of the  health care system, not evidence of doubt  that  the competitive approach  is su perior to a federalized health insurance  and delivery system.  In continuing the debate on competi tion, I am particularly interested in re ceiving information on the strengths and  weaknesses of the Comprehensive Health  Care Reform Act, particularly any evi dence that its provisions would or would  not work.  Among the questions which need an swers are:  First. Is the requirement  that large  employers provide three plans by differ ent carriers a realistic one? Should it be  required that an HMO be one of  the  plans?  Second. Will large numbers of individ uals accept the risk of 25 percent copayment, up to 20 percent of family in come? Will  individuals  accepting  the  risk use  the health care system  less?  Will they be as healthy?  Third. Will States be willing to form  insurance pools  to provide coverage to  uninsured individuals?  Fourth. Will  the  savings  from  in creased health care competition offset  the cost of  increased health and  tax  benefits?  Fifth. Is it appropriate for the Federal  Government to load onto the minimum  benefit package  requirements for pre ventive care services? Is it cost effective  to do so?  In sum, I believe that national health  policy should deal with cost containment,  catastrophic health insurance, and pre ventive health care. A unified compre hensive approach to  these problems  is  possible and this bill attempts to do just  that.  As Richard Schweiker correctly stated  nearly 2 years ago:  The fundamental cause of rampant health  cost infiation and lack of catastrophic and  preventive health insurance benefits is a non competitive third-party reimbursement sys tem weighted too heavily toward first-dollar  hospitalization  coverage.  Scarce  resources  and disenchantment with government regu lation make  it unlikely  that yet a~other  public program wlll be the solution.  In this situation, we can use  tax incen tives to offer Americans a  tradeoff: If they  are w1111ng  to pay slightly more in copay ments for  low-cost medical care,  they can  save enough money  to obtain catastrophic  protection and preventative care. In addition,  they can stop  the health cost  infiationary  spiral without new Government regulation.  We can also use tax incentives to help restore  competition to health care by giving our citi zens a greater variety of health  insurance  choices and ensuring  that  they wlll  save  money on premiums if they choose more em cient providers of care.  The Comprehensive Health Care Re form Act is more realistic, more effective,  and clearly less costly than the regula tory alternatives. Consequently I will hP.  advocating this nonregulatory approach  with the hope of achieving a most worth while goal: That all Americans havP. A"" cess to quality health care at a reasonahl""  cost.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the bill and a summary be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill and  summary were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  s. 139  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That this  Act may be cited as  the ""Comprehensive  Health Care Reform Act"".

I would like to speak spe cifically of two people  in the Baltic  countries who have been taken up and  who are now on trial for nothing more  than exercising the rights guaranteed  to them by a treaty which we signed  together with the Soviet Union on the  1st of August, 1975.  I do not know how long this kind of  thing is going to continue in the world;  how long this empire, which acquired  these lands by a treaty between Molo tov, the Foreign Minister of the Soviet  Union, and Ribbentrop,  the Foreign  Minister of Nazi Germany, allowing  them to march their armies into these  three helpless countries at the edge of  the Baltic Sea.  I do not know how long this can last,  and these people, trying to speak for  some  religious  and other  freedoms  which are precious to them, how long  they must suffer as they are now suf fering.

ENERGY IMPACTED RAIL AND  HIGHWAY SAFETY ACT  <Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska asked and  was given permission to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend her remarks.)  ",1981
32,House,97,0.238,406,1,Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to introduce des perately needed  legislation  to help  solve one of our most pressing energy related  problems. My  bill  is  the  Energy  Impacted Rail and Highway  Safety Act.  This vital measure contains essential  language  passed  in  1980  by  both  Houses in S. 2720, the Surface Trans portation Act. Although the 96th Con gress did not have time to complete  action on this bill, I feel it is vital and  necessary for the well-being of hun dreds of thousands of people adversely  affected by the soaring rail traffic of  coal trains.  This  legislation will authorize  the  Secretary to make cost-sharing grants  for transportation projects to alleviate  the  environmental,  social,  and  eco nomic impact of increased train traffic  to meet national energy requirements.  It will  also  authorize  cost-sharing  grants  to  reconstruct,  resurface,  re store, and rehabilitate nontoll public  roads that have incurred a substantial  increase in use as a result of energy transportation activities.  Funding for the measure will come  from the windfall profit tax, with the  Federal cost share to be 80 percent. No  State shall, in any fiscal year, receive  less than one-half of 1 percent or more  than 12 percent of the total apportion ment made in that year.  Mr. Speaker, all across this country,  communities  are  experiencing  the  impact of increased use of coal. Our  drive  for energy  independence  is at  long last at the top of our agenda, but  we must remember those who are ad versely affected by the boom in coal resource development.  As I have stated many times, Nebras ka has become the coal chute of the  Nation. My State, especially the west em part that I represent, is a major, if  not only,  route  for almost all coal  going to southern and eastern markets  from the coal-rich Powder River Basin  in Wyoming and the eastern coalfields  of Colorado.  Railroads are  the exclusive  trans porter of  this vast  resource, and as  many of you know most of our towns  in the Western States grew up around  or alongside a rail line. The rail sta tion and railroads were the lifeblood  of western development. These  rail roads are still vital to the economy of  my State for movement of agricultural  products as well as freight.  We in the West are now seeing a new  and difficult problem arise with the  growth in coal transportation by rail.  We have 44 communities in my district  alone and  thousands more  in other  districts and States that are  in fact  split in half by a set of railroad tracks.  With  the drastic  increase  in coal  traffic, essential services such as pro vided by hospitals, fire, and police de partments are cut off from major seg ments of these communities for many  hours daily with tracks crossable only  intermittently  between  trains.  Schools,  businesses,  and  residential  areas are separated. This has caused  and will continue to cause increasingly  severe  problems  for  the people  of  these communities.  The State of Nebraska is served by  11 railroad companies with a total of  5,494  railroad crossings. Our fatality  rate is double the national average for  vehicle-train collisions. In 1978 alone,  183  accidents occurred at Nebraska  grade crossings, resulting in 18 fatali ties and 79 injuries. This rate is bound  to increase as coal traffic more than  triples, as estimated,  in  the coming  years.  One  railroad alone expects  to  in crease from 15  trains per day  to 70  trains a day by the year 2000. If you  consider the average unit train takes 3  minutes  to pass  through a crossing,  that translates to a total of 3.5 hours  daily that the essential services I men tioned  earlier  are  cut  off.  If you  happen to be on the wrong side of the  tracks,  it could mean the difference  between life and death.  The Nebraska State Department of  Roads in a recent study indicated that  76 grade separations are needed in the  State at an average cost of $2.5 million  each. This study also  indicated  the  need for 10  flashing  lights and 154  flashing  lights with gates for safety  purposes. The study projected a cost  of $207 million  for  these  improve ments in Nebraska alone.  ",1981

35,,97,-0.564,523,1,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  today reintroducing legislation to re quire  distinctions  in  the  Federal  budget between capital outlays and fi nancing on one hand  and  current  operational expenditures and revenues  on the other.  When a business, a city, a State, or  practically any other enterprise con putes its profit or loss or its surplus or  deficit for a given year, it does so by  deducting  expenses  from  revenues.  Separate and distinct consideration is  given to any long-term expenditure for  capital needs it may have as compared  with current operating expenses. Such  a two-part budget is a much more ac curate, rational, and useful portrayal  of actual financial status than is the  cpmbined budget currently employed  by the Federal Government. By bal ancing current operating income with  expenses and by comparing long-term  capital outlays with long-term financ ing, a much clearer and concise budg etary picture emerges.  521  It is, for example, most instructive to  note that more than one-fifth of the  fiscal 1982 Federal budget-$161.5 bil lion-represents  capital  investments.  The  remaining $576  billion  in  the  fiscal 1982 budget represents operat ing expenditures and should, under  standard and universally accepted ac counting  methods,  be  measured  against the $711.8 billion in revenues  for fiscal1982. A $135 billion operating  budget surplus results when this com putation is used.  Were  the Federal Government  to  employ the budget methodology used  by almost every other financial entity,  it would be clear to the public that  there is, in fact, no operational budget  deficit whatsoever.  The $27.5 billion deficit shown  in  the fiscal 1982 Federal budget is in re ality  the difference between capital  outlays and  the operational surplus.  The Federal budget deficit, which we  have all heard so much about, actually  finances capital items exclusively. And  these  capital  commitments  in  turn  represent sound investments in Ameri ca's  future-investments  that  yield benefits in the years to come.  Borrowing  to  finance  capital out lays-which is what, in effect, the defi cit  represents-is universally consid ered sound business practice. Borrow ing to meet operational needs is not.  In  proposing  a  capital-operational  breakdown in the Federal budget, I am  not suggesting that the Government  need not exercise sound fiscal plan ning, nor am I arguing that this kind  of budgeting be used as an excuse to  ignore  waste  and  cost  overruns.  Indeed,  I  believe  that  the  type of  budgeting I am urging would facilitate  identification of poor fiscal manage ment and increase accountability.  it  exists  today,  the  Federal  budget is grossly misleading. The legis lation  I  am  offering would  bring  needed  and  helpful  clarity  to  the  budgetmaking process and would also  encourage more  informed participa tion by both Congress and the public  in this process.  I urge my colleagues to support this  effort to regularize and simplify the  Federal budget.

At this point the expenses of main taining that force there are coming out  of the services' hides, primarily out of  the Navy's hide, which also means what  the Navy should be doing is suffering. 1  think we need to make special provision  for the costs of maintaining the perma nent deployment in the Indian Ocean.

39,Senate,97,-0.313,627,1,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President,  the  nomihation before us poses one of the  most diflicult deliberations in which the  Senate will engage dur~ng the process of  giving its advice and consent on the pro posed Cabinet of President Reagan. This  would be the case even if Gen. Alexander  Haig were not such a controversial figure.  The deliberation on the next Secretary of  State would be difficult under any cir cumstances because we are at crossroads  in American foreign policy. That we are  being asked to take as our guide a man  who,  though unquestionably able, ex cites strong emotions for and against him  makes the responsibility of the Senate  weigh doubly heavy.  I believe we finally are pulling out of a  post-Vietnam disorientation concerning  the proper balancing of the responsibili ties and the limits of American power.  The ruthless Soviet invasion of Afghani stan helped wrench us out of that numb ing condition.  It started us  thinking  again  in  terms of how  to apply U.S.  power to protect our vital interests, not  whether it could or should be applied in  their defense. But no one will doubt we  still have a  long way to go in defining  a prudent framework for realizing our  national interests, which must always be  at the base of our foreign policy. We also  need some urgent work on developing a  range of effective instruments that can  be used, as appropriate, in varying cir cumstances.  The world  is changing rapidly, and  there are dangerous possibilit~es ahead.  Relations between the two superpowers  are at their most tense moment since the  Cuban missile crisis,  there are nascent  signs of potential shifts  in alliances,  there is an ever growing diffusion of eco nomic power and perhaps the most po tentially volatile reality is the recurring  threat  the  economic  base of  the  Western countries-the threat of a cata strophic interruption of our oil supplies  from the Middle East.  The days ahead will be challenging  to an American Secretary of State in deed. We will  require many  things of  him, but none more important than that  he bolster American power, crystallize a  unifying vision of our national interest,  and reinforce American credibility. Any one who has seen or met General Haig  knows that he is an imposing man with  a keen sense of the use of power. Anyone  who has heard him has little doubt that  he puts a premium on coherence in U.S.  policy and on the protection of American  credibility concerning our commitments.  The lines of his  testimony before  the  Foreign Relations Committee that gives  me  greatest  encouragement  are  as  follows:  to  I  firmly  believe  that American  foreign  policy should have some permanent bedrock.  The United States has been most effective  in the world arena when the solid foUill.do. tions of its forei~n policy has been recognized  a.nd understood-by our people 8IIld by the  nll!tions with which we must dea.l.  He has  stated  three qualities  that  above all must guide  the conduct of  American foreign polic!':_ First, consist ent action;  second,  reliable behavior;  and  third,  the balancing of pressures  that must be weighed and reconciled in  our responses regarding the complex is sues of foreign affairs.  These are good pillars for U.S. foreign  policy. General Haig's intention of re l,ring on the first two offers additional  evidence that he has a strength of pur pose. His  listing of the third suggests  ",1981

Whether the subject be  health services, hospital costs, health re search, elementary, secondary, higher,  or vocational education-Dick Schweiker  was always in the forefront. He never be came insolated, as some in this body are  accused, from the realities of the world  beyond Washington.

Mr. Speaker, over the past 2 years I  have served on the Committee on the  Judiciary. We have been outnumbered  by a very, very large number. We have  had 11 members on  the Republican  side.

48,House,97,0.177,705,1,Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama.," Mr.  Speaker, the fiscal year 1982 Federal  budget was presented to the Congress  last week.  In  the days  and weeks  ahead, we will be hearing a great deal  about it. I would like to speak for a  moment on the Defense Department's  portion of the new budget.  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW  The Department of Defense budget  request  for  fiscal  year  1982  totals  $196.4 billion in obligational authority.  If approved in full and if a proposed  supplemental for fiscal year 1981 and  a planned fiscal year 1982 supplemen tal were also approved, the new budget  would  exceed  last  year's appropri ations by $25.2 billion or 14.7 percent  in current dollars.  According  to Defense Department  estimates, the bulk of the proposed in crease would be consumed by  infla tion, yielding real program growth in  constant dollars of only 5.3 percent,  the same  level of growth  requested  last year. Thus, of the proposed  in crease, $15.3 billion would be absorbed  by inflation and the remainder-$9.9  billion would constitute real program  growth.  The new 5-year defense plan proj ects 5 percent real growth annually  through fiscal year 1986.  Defense expenditures, by compari son, are expected to rise by $22.4 bil lion or by 14.2 percent from an esti mated $157.6 billion  in  the current  year  to $180 billion  in  the coming  fiscal year. Once again, if allowances  are made  for  inflation,  the Depart ment estimates expenditures would in crease by only $7.5 billion or 4.3 per cent. At the projected fiscal year 1982  level, defense expenditures would rep resent  24.3  percent of  the Federal  budget and 5.6 percent of the gross na tional product-up  slightly  as  com pared to last year.  DEFENSE APPROPRIATION BILL  The Defense Appropriations Sub committee will be reviewing the larg est portion of the proposed fiscal year  1982  defense  budget-$185.2  billion.  The amount requested is $25.5 billion  over  the $159.7 billion appropriated  for fiscal year 1981.  Within the defense bill, the request ed funds, excluding supplementals, are  distributed among the major accounts  as follows-all current dollars:  First. Military personnel: $38.4 bil lion, up $5.3 billion;  Second. Retired pay: $16.1 billion, up  $2.2 billion;  Third. Operation and maintenance:  <O. & M.>: $61.8 billion, up $10 billion;  Fourth. Procurement: $49.1 billion,  up $4.2 billion; and  Fifth. Research  and  development  <R. & D.>: $19.8 billion, up $3.8 billion.  Although  increases  are  proposed  across the board in every account, the  vast majority-70 percent or $18 bil lion, of the overall increase is concen trated  in  three accounts-0. & M.,  procurement, and R. & D.  On  the  surface,  the new budget  would appear to strike a good balance  between modernization and readiness,  but closer scrutiny suggests that this  may not be the case.  This budget clearly places heavy em phasis on combat readiness, which is a  significant departure from budgets we  have seen  in  the past, and  that  is  clearly a  step in the right direction.  But I feel that it may also favor readi ness at the expense of near-term mod ernization, and this is not a prudent  course of action. We must proceed  with both  readiness and moderniza tion  simultaneously  in a more bal anced program.  ",1981
49,House,97,-0.139,718,1,Mr. STRATTON.," Mr. Speaker, last  week there passed away, at the age of  92 in New York City, one of the real  giants of all time of this House of Rep resentatives, Hon. Emanuel Celler of  New York City.  ""Manny"" Celler not only served as a  Member of the House for a half-cen tury, just short of the all-time record  set by Carl Vinson of Georgia, but he  also  presided  as  chairman  of  the  House Judiciary Committee at a time  when some of  the most progressive  legislation in our history, especially in  the field of civil rights, was enacted  into law. Chairman Celler was in fact  the author of much of that legislation,  and  successfully  steered  all  of  it  through the legislative mazes of Con gress.  Most of this legislation is taken for  granted  today,  the Public Facilities  Act, the voting rights legislation, the  Civil Rights Act of 1964. But it was  bitterly controversial at  the  time  it  was  before Congress. And  it was  Manny Celler, with his ever-present  wit, his warm,  friendly personality,  and his knowledge of the rules of the  House and his acquaintanceship with  his fellow Members that enabled him  to bring these historic measures into  enactment.  It has often been said that we  in  New York State have failed to exercise  the clout to which the great Empire  State-until a few years ago, the most  populous State  in  the Nation-was  justly entitled, because our Members  of Congress tended not to remain too  long in this House.  They ran for the other body, or they  went home and ran for Governor or  mayor, or they got themselves elected  to  State  judgeships.  But Manny  Celler, single handedly, made up for  some of  the  seniority which other  members of  the delegation had not  managed to achieve. And as a result he  became not  only  a  power  in  this  House, but  also  a  shining political  figure in New York State.  When I came to this House following  the 1958 election, Manny Celler was  the first colleague I met. He was the  dean of our delegation, and soon to be  the dean of the House. He ran the del egation with  skill  and humor,  and  what was  especially  remarkable, he  worked closely and in a very friendly  way with the newly elected Governor  of our State, Nelson Rockefeller. To gether, Manny and Rocky got the del egation working closely in Washington  to push the legislation most needed by  New York. We have tried to keep that  approach going ever since.  Actually,  it was his health more  than anything else that brought an  unexpected  end  to  Congressman  Celler's congressional career. As he  moved  into his 80's his  legs slowed  down a bit, and he began  to use a  wheelchair to move from the Rayburn  Building to the House floor. His mind  and his wit were as sharp as ever. But  the limitations on mobility proved, as  we all recognize these days, a definite  political  liability. He could not get  around as much and as often as he  used to, and as a result he found him self in 1972 defeated in a Democratic  primary-by a  young, brilliant Har vard Law School graduate, 30 years of  age-our former colleague Liz Holtz man. Actually, when it came to basic  political  ideas  and objectives  there  really was not much difference be tween Manny and Liz. It was just a  matter  of  approach. But  a major  change had come to the House when  that great giant was toppled.  Chairman Celler never lost his inter est in the House, however, in spite of  his defeat. He lived here in Washing ton and also back in New York City.  He practiced law in both places. And  although he rarely came back to the  Capitol to greet his former colleagues,  he followed our actions closely. I was  surprised, and of course pleased, that  every election year Manny was listed  among my contributors.  And as a result, I have tried to carry  on, as Manny and Rocky did, the fight  for increased attention to the special  needs of New York State. But those  are very big shoes indeed to try to fill.  In any event we will  indeed miss  Manny Celler. But as New Yorkers we  will always be proud that his career as  a Member of this House is one of the  real landmarks in American constitu tional history.  On behalf of all the members of the  New York delegation  I  extend our  sympathy  to  the members  of  the  family of Emanuel Celler.  Under leave to extend my remarks I  enclose an article from the New York  Times  on Mr.  Celler's  remarkable  career:  ",1981

I thank the distinguished Senator from  Kentucky,  the ranking minority mem ber of the committee, for yielding a brief  moment to me to express my warm sup port for the nominee, John R.

I say to my colleagues in the Senate  that I have known Jack Block for more  than 3 years during the time I served in  the elective position of Secretary of State  in the State of Illinois, a position which  many people consider the second most  important position in our State, next to  that of Governor.  On many occasions, I visited with Jack  Block pertaining to State affairs, and I  can report to the Members of the Senate  on both sides of the aisle that he is a  very fine, decent, warm, forthright per son who has served with great distinc tion as the director of Agricul.ture in my  State. He is a corn, bean, and and hog  farmer-a ""hands-on farmer,"" as we call  them in our State--of excellent reputa tion, warmly supported by the Farmer's  Union, the Illinois Farm Bureau, and all  the other organizations in our State.  I believe he is an excellent choice. With  John R. Block as Secretary of Agricul ture,  this administration has made a  fine .start with the American farmer. I  predict a bright future for agriculture  in this country under the stewardship  of Jack Block.  I thank the ranking minority member  o! the committee for yielding me  this  t1me to express my suppOrt and the support of my State for Jack Block to be  Secretary of Agriculture.  ",1981

55,Senate,97,0.495,757,1,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President,  I would  like to respond to my distinguished col league from Wisconsin and the former  chairman of  the Banking Committee  that I agree with about 95 percent of  what he has just said, and my colleague  knows that. Many of the things he talked  about were things we worked on together.  No one has spoken more vocally over the  last 6 years over and over again, and I  am  sure both Senator PROXMIRE  and  Senator WILLIAMS have my speech mem orized. They know as well as  know  what needs to be done with HUD.  We are in complete agreement there.  Although Mr. Pierce was not my first  choice for Secretary, I think he is an ex cellent choice and will do an extremely  good  job. My disagreement comes with  the expression by the distinguished Sen ator from Wisconsin as to his disappoint ment in the lack of specific responses  from Mr. Pierce to these areas that both  Senator PROXMIRE and I agree about.  Just for the record, I should like the  Senate to know that Judge Pierce ha~  been the nominee for less than 2 week~  when he came to those hearings, and r  would not expect him, in that period of  time, with a department with more than  16,000 employees, with all  housing programs we deal with in 23fi.  236, 232, and section 312-I could go on  with all these programs it has taken me  13 years to learn as a city commissioner,  a mayor, a Senator, and  the ranking  minority member of  the Housing Sub committee.  So it needs to be said that it is unfair  to expect Judge Pierce to come in 2 weeks  after he was nominated by President  Reagan and give specific comments on  all this.  ",1981
56,Senate,97,0.391,757,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President,  rise today to voice my support for the  nomination of Samuel R. Pierce of New  York to be our next Secretary of Hous ing and Urban Development.  Mr. Pierce will bring with him to this  high office  excellent credentials  as  a  lawyer and administrator. A graduate of  Cornell University and  its  law school,  Mr. Pierce has been a practicing attorney  a State judge, and general counsel  to  the Treasury Department from 1970-73.  In each of these positions, he has per formed with diligence and unquestioned  integrity.  Mr. Pierce has pledged that, as HUD  Secretary, he will do all that he can to  work with President Reagan so that the  administration can successfully cut Gov ernment spending and  reduce  regula tion. At the same time, he has pledged  to maintain our country's historic con cern for the needs of the poor and dis advantaged. I believe Samuel Pierce is  the man  ideally  suited  to undertake  these important responsibilities.  Mr. President, I hope that the Senate  today will overwhelmingly confirm  the  nomination of Mr. Pierce for the position  of Secretary of Housing  and Urban  Development.  ",1981
57,Senate,97,-0.362,783,1,Mr. BUMPERS.," Yes; I am sorry, my  staff savs it was not the same afternoon.  It that correct?  Mr. McCLURE. Mv understandin~ is  that the first request, on which  there  was a delav, was not about those cases  which the legal foundation had brought,  or, as the Senator said, which he brought  himself, in which he agreed immediately  he would recuse himself, but it was on  all future litigation in which the Rocky  Mountain Legal Foundation might be a  party even though not yet commenced.  ",1981
58,Senate,97,-0.362,783,1,Mr. BUMPER'S.," The Senator is correct.  I did not make that clear. I  thought I  said all cases. I want to clarify that. He  said he would recuse himself in all cases  now pending or those hereafter brought  by the Mountain States Legal Founda tion.  The important point is that he still  steadfastly refuses to recuse himself fur ther, for example, in 58 cases in which  the Department of the Interior is  the  defendant and the case was brought by  contributors to Mountain States Legal  Foundation.  Considering  the  casinos,  I  asked  whether  these casinos-Harrah's and  Harvey's Wagon Wheel-were contribu tors.  Mr. Watt said that he hoped they were.  I explained that was not my question.  My question was whether  they  con tributed.  He said he hoped everybody contrib utes.  I  agreed  that might be nice, but I  wanted to know, did these two people  contribute?  There was absolutely no way  to get  that answer, and it seemed like a fairly  simple thing, because it would have ab solutely ended the matter. All he had to  do was say, ""Yes.""  Despite this, he refused to recuse him self of any actions with regard to the 58  cases now pending this minute against  the Department of  the  Interior  and  brought by contributors to the Mountain  States Legal Foundation. These are peo ple that he solicited for contributions.  These are the cases over which he will  exercise considerable control. That pales  compared to the literally thousands of  administrative decisions he will have to  make in which contributors and board  members of the Mountain States Legal  Foundation are appellants.

60,Senate,97,-0.214,796,1,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I thank my  friend from Arkansas for yielding.  Mr. President, I  rise  to address  the  nomination of Mr. James Watt as Sec retary of the Interior. I seek neither to  praise nor to bury this nomination, but  only to express my concerns and to out line the Jong-term goals which this Sen ator from the State of Nebraska believes  should be the appropriate quest of the  Department of the Interior.  I may support the nomination of Mr.  Watt, but if I do it will not be without  reservations. I am  inclined  to support  his confirmation because the President  wants Mr. Watt for this imoortant Cab inet position. Since the role of a Cab inet o:flicer  is  to  implement the policy  of his President,  the President is en titled to a great deal of deference with  regal""n  to his preferred choice. As a  former Governor, I can appreciate the  need for executive o:flicers who can re flect the policy wishes of the Chief Ex ecutive. The responsibility for the actions  of the Cabinet then rests squarely upon  the shoulders of  the Chief Executive,  where such a burden properly belongs.  Neverthelass, Mr. Watt has aroused  the concerns of some who fear that he  may not be committed to those environ mental values which the Congress has  traditionally sought to protect.  The Secretary of the Interior has the.  primary responsibility for America's nat ural resources and the environment. As  the pressures for accelerated energy and  economic development proceed through  this Nation, those resources which all cit izens of this country share in common the air, the water, and our public lands must be conserved and enhanced by and  for every generation of Americans today  and tomorrow. An intelligent chief stew ard of ""Spaceship Earth"" must strive to  achieve a balance between our immediate  needs and our conservation goals. This  will require that the Secretary of In terior be a forward-thinking person who  will serve the interests of all Americans  today and, where  the environment  is  considered more important, the future.  Mr. President, it is  true that many  Federal policies and  regulations exist  which unnecessarily burden our eco nomic progress and the development of  our energy resources. I believe the execu tive branch and the Congress must ag gressively  identify and eliminate these  unnecessarily burdensome controls. On  the other hand, I hope that the new Sec retary and the Congress will review in  detail the policies and programs of the  Department in order to assure a proper  compensation  to  the  Treasury,  and  therefore, the taxpayer, for the removal  and depletion of the people-owned re sources. The protection and evenhanded  management of this Nation's resources  is not  guaranteed without  vigilance,  especially on the part of the Secretary  of the Interior.  The American people have come  to  realize that a blind neglect of the en vironment, in the name of progress, car ries with it economic, social, and health  costs wh1ch are unacceptable. The air  we breathe is indeed the breath of life  itself. The water we drink and employ is  a depleting resource. Our rivers, parks,  recreational areas, and reserves are a  sacred trust for mankind and the other  God-created  living  things. The  land  which nourishes us with food is the sub stance of life for which there is no sub stitute. The world we live in can be de stroyed by its inhabitants.  In  this  light, Mr. President,  I  am  proud  to  say  that my own State of  Nebraska  is  the home of the National  Arbor Day Foundation which seeks  to  preserve our  appreciation of  the en vironment. Nebraskans  are dependent  upon the State's natural resources, being  an agricultural State. We have recog nized the need for a balanced environ mental policy and, I believe have demon strated  that environmental protection  and economic progress need not be mu tually exclusive, but can be equal ob jectives within the same overall goal.  This Senator anticipates that Secre(Mr.  tary Watt may demonstrate by actions,  and not just his words of record, that  he will seek and implement a truly bal anced policy, giving proper weight  to  both our fragile environment and our  need for economic and energy develop ment. The Senate and the Nation cannot  expect, accept, or afford anything less.  I yield back the remainder of my time  to the Senator from Arkansas.  ",1981
61,Senate,97,0.241,809,1,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. President, today as  the Senate prepares for final considera tion of the nomination of Mr. James G.  Watt as Secretary of  the  Interior.  I  would like to express my support for the  gentleman from Colorado.  I  am convinced  that Mr. Watt will  bring a balanced and deliberate perspec tive to his duties which include the over sight of over 500 million acres of Federal  land 8illd trust responsibilities for nearly  50 million additional acres.  Jim Watt  is especially qualified  for  this position of trust because of his vast  experience in dealing with the complex,  and often emotional issues surrounding  the stewardship of this Nation's natural  resources. He has spent the better part  of his adult life working on these issues  and no one is better prepared to assume  this post than Jim Watt.  During his confirmation hearings, Mr.  Watt has proven himself to be an in formed, open, candid and knowledgeable  nominee as he presented his views on a  wide range of vital issues he will deal  with as Secretary.  James Watt will be an excellent Sec retary of Interior and I am convinced  that he will work to see that a responsi ble balance of environmental, energy  and economic factors is maintained.  While standing in support of Secre tary-designate James Watt, I would like  to comment on two water policy issues  relating to the authorities of the De partment of the Interior.  First, rules promulgated by the Carter  administration refiect their attitude and  intent to discourage water resource de velopment.  Specifically,  in December  1979 the Water Resources Council pub lished rules on principles and standards  that do not allow an increase in produc tion of livestock and specialty crops to  be counted as a benefit in determining  the economic feasibility of an irrigation  project. Probably the best commentary  on  this rule came from an economist  within  the Carter administration who  called it philosophical and arbitrary.  We in South Dakota who have a deep seated interest in irrigation hope the Secthe distin retary and his assistants at Interior will  be equally interested in water develop ment and will address the problem these  rules have created.  A second water policy  issue of con cern to people in South Dakota is the  prospect that Federal action to grant a  right-of-way for the so-called ETSI coal  slurry pipeline will adversely affect the  water rights of our State. The Bureau of  Land Management has not adequately  considered the effects on southwestern  South Dakota. I have urged that the  draft environmental  impact statement  published in November be corrected to  address  these effects, and I shall con tinue to work to see that the water rights  of my State are upheld.  ",1981
62,Senate,97,-0.296,822,1,Mr. JACKSON.," Mr. President, I  in tend to support the President's nomina tion of Gov. James B. Edwards  to be  Secretary of Energy. On January 12,  Governor Edwards appeared before the  Committee on Energy and Natural Re sources  to answer questions about his  qualifications  for  this  job.  I  th\nk he  learned something from those hearings.  The Secretary of Energy  is an ex tremely  important person  in  the U.S.  Government. Our management of en ergy policy is an essential comoonent of  our economic policy. It is a fundamental  component of our foreign policy.  The functions of the Department of  Energy are essential  functions. These  Federal  responsibilities cannot be ad equately managed in a piecemeal fash ion without firm and informed central  direction and coordination. This kind of  coherent effort is vital if we are to assert  control over our national welfare.  Governor Edwards  is  taking  on  a  backbreaking job. It is a  job which re quires  technical expertise. It is a  job  that requires diplomacy and consulta tion. It is a  job which requires forceful  and skillful management. It is a  job in  which your mistakes are  immediately  visible and painful, whereas your suc cesses only manifest themselves over the  longer run.  I wish Governor Edwards good luck,  and urge him to take seriously the im portance  of  listenmg  to  the  advice  which will be available from  the Con gress and others. Energy policy is a very  serious, difficult business. He will need  the consultation and cooperation we in  Congress are offering.  Mr. President. I ask unanimous con sent that the text of my remarks at the  hearing on Governor Edwards' nomina tion be  inserted in the REcORD at this  point.  The statement follows:  SrATEMENT OF SENATOR HENRY M. JACKSON:  NOMINATION OF DR. JAMES B. EDWARDS TO BE  SECRETARY OF ENERGY, JANUARY 12, 1981  Certain statements made during the 1980  Presidential campaign suggest that the Sec retary of Energy may not be regarded by the  new adininistration as an important member  of the President's cabinet. I will tell you my  view of the matter.  Energy 1s the lifeblood of our economy.  Without adequate supplies of energy we  cannot provide the goods and services our  people deserve. We cannot provide jobs.  Without adequate supplies of reasonably  priced energy, we cannot control  the cost  spiral which drives our infiation. We cannot  create the confidence in the health of the  economy which is essential if we are to invest  in the future.  So the Secretary of Energy 1s very impor tant. And the implications of the policies of  the Department of Energy are not confined  to domestic energy markets.  The cornerstone of any U.S. energy poUcy  is petroleum policy. Because of  this, U.S.  energy policy  is dominated by the charac teristics of the world oil market. The avail ability and price of oil on the world market  is determined by a myriad of social, eco nomic, political and other factors which are  far more complicated  than  the  relatively  simple dynamics of market price, supply and  demand. Access to oil on the world market in  the 1980's is a matter of international politics  and national security. The probability that  this access will be restricted by design or by  accident is alarmingly high. Any prolonged  restriction in access to oil would have the  most serious consequences  for  the United  States and its allies.  The Department of Energy organizes the  international renresentation for the United  States at the Jnternational Energy Agency  and provides  the  leadership  role  in energy  emergency contingency planning.  The Deoartment of Energy  directs  the  national effort in research and development  and  production  of  nuclear weapons  and  serves as  the prime cm,tractor for the na tional laboratories.  The Department  ooerates  the  strategic  petroleum reserve and serves as the focus for  energy information and analysis and energy  policy development. It is  the entity which  not only directs efforts at energy research,  ",1981
63,Senate,97,0.2,835,1,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President, the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 was,  and is, one of the truly monumental and  significant congressional reforms in re cent history. Monumental, because an  overwhelming majority in both Houses  voted to adopt a consensus measure in corporating procedures  restrict  the  most protected of all congressional pre rogatives: Spending public money. Sig nificant, because those procedures have  worked, and for the most part, worked  well.  Much to their credit, the authors of  the act envisioned both the need for, and  the desirability of,  incorporating  lan guage  to  encourage  improvements  in  their work on a continuing basis. As one  who is privileged to serve on the Budget  Committee, where business is conducted  in accordance with the provisions of the  act, I can attest to their wisdom. There  is, indeed, latitude for improvement.  Having said that, I would suggest that  the most discouraging  aspect of our  otherwise commendable effort to fulfill  the Senate's budgetary responsibility has  been our inability  to exercise effective  control over the revenue-raising side of  the budgetary process. While we have  made great progress  in our ability  to  monitor and  regulate direct spending,  our progress in coming to grips with is sues relating to taxation has been prac tically nonexistent.  From  a  budgetary perspective, our  unbalanced  growth under  the  act  is  embarrassing.  From  a  congressional  oversight and fiscal  responsibility per spective,  it is downright  irresnons;ble.  Our need to develop and implement a  coordinated anproach  raising reve nue  and  soending  Federal  funds,  whether  through  direct  subsidies  or  through tax expenditures, has never been  greater. For that reason, I am today in troducing the Tax Expenditure Limita tion and Control Act of 1981. Enact ment of  this  legislation would greatly  enhance the ability of Congress to exer cise effective judgment and pursue a ra tional approach to oversight of Federal  programs, budgetary planning, and con trol and fiscal policy.  Those of us charged with responsibil ity for Federal program oversight have  made the point on many occasions that  tax spending and direct spending are  two sides of the same Federal-subsidy  coin. Both mechanisms  transfer  reve nues for purposes that are perceived to  be  in  the national  interest. However,  there  are  critical  differences  in  the  amount  and  degree  of  congressional  oversight that accompanies these fund ing mechanisms.  to  to  Direct program funding must be au thorized on a continuing basis, money  for such funding must be appropriated  annually, and program sponsors must  justify their use of  this money before  Congress. Additionally, all of  this au thorizing, appropriating, and justifying  must be accomplished within congres sional  budgetary  parameters.  Such  activity  tends  to serve  the public  in terest in that it assures intense review  over  the distribution of limited funds.  The  case with  respect  Federal  subsidies  through  tax expenditures  is  much different. The committees with  responsibility  for programs  supported  through  tax expenditures neither au thorize such funding nor review its ef fectiveness. Once  such  subsidies have  been enacted,  they have a  remarkable  tendency  to remain on  the books  for  years and evEmtually become  institu tionalized within the tax code.  The total figure for revenue collected  in fiscal year 1981 will be approximately  $607.5 billion. The best estimate for the  total amount of revenue that wlll be ex empted from collection through tax ex penditures is a staggering $208 billion.  Over 25 percent of all revenue desig nated by the general provislons of the  tax code as collectable will be exempted  or excluded from collection by specific  provisions of the code. We forgo $1  in  taxes for every $3 we  raise, solely be cause of the revenue-reducing effect of  tax expenditures. That, I suggest, is bad  policy and worse Government. Enact ment of the bill I am introducing would  provide a beg!nning to the effort Con gress must undertake to reverse this un desirable practice.  The  bill  I  am  introducing  today  would: First, limit future loss of revenue  from  tax  expenditures;  second,  dis courage the proliferation of such reve nue-reduc;ng measures  in  the future;  and third, improve budgetary accounting  for tax expenditure-related revenue loss,  throough provisions that:  Place a  statutory  limitation on  the  total amount of revenue loss from tax  expenditures at a figure not to exceed 30  percent of net revenues collected;  Provide for authorization of new tax  expenditures by the committees of the  House or Senate with legislative juris diction over the activity such tax expen ditures would affect;  Require  legislation  authorizing new  tax expenditures be sequentially referred  to the Budget Committee of the House  or Senate, as appropriate;  Require all legislation authorizing new  tax  expenditures  be  reported  to  the  House or Senate on, or before, May 15;  and  Provide  appropriate  provisions  for  waiver of the May 15 reporting date in  the Senate.  Enactment of these provisions would  constitute a significant improvement jn  the existing congressional approach to  budgeting.  Budgetary planning and control is, as  we have all learned since 1974, no easy  task. Even with the advantage of precise  figures, we would face problems in our  attempt to allocate a  limited amount of  funds. However, our current procedures  for estimating revenues are so imprecise  that  the  problem  is  becoming  quite  serious. The accounting impact of tax  expenditures  greatly  resembles  the  accounting impact of entitlements. Just  as we are unable to predict the level of  annual funding that will be required to  support entitlement programs, we are  unable to predict with a high degree of  accuracy the annual revenue loss result ing from tax expenditures. The more tax  expenditures we enact the greater the  revenue mystery becomes.  Presently, there are 92 such tax provi sions on the books accounting for a reve nue  loss of--depending on which of  many equally valid Government guesses  you  use-approximately  $200  billion.  That figure has grown at an annual rate  of 14 percent since 1975 when it was  approximately $90 billion.  Effectively estimating revenue dollars  is critical to the success of the budgetary  process. Tax expenditures greatly ag gravate revenue estimation. To the ex tent that their purpose can be achieved  through direct expenditures, with  im proved oversight, they should be curtail ed. That is a primary objective of this  bill.  One final advantage of this legislative  proposal relates to the effect its passage  would have on our ability  to exercise  fiscal policy options in a  fashion con sistent with promoting a sound economy.  The secret to choosing the right fiscal  options for national economic purposes  li.es in being able to gage their imoact.  The improvements this would provide in  our ability to judge the economic effects  of tax measures in terms of their impact  on the availability of private sector funds  for  investment  and  consumption  are  definitely needed.  In our efforts as Members of the Sen ate to address national priorities in an  effective fashion, our results are many  times a reflection of the quality of the  legislative tools with which we work. The  better the available tools, the better the  results. The bill I am introducing pro vides us with an opportunity to upgrade  the legislative process.  To the authors of the Congressional  Budget Act, this bill may not seem mon umental. But to those of us who must  operate under the results of the work,  the  improvements  it mandates would  certainly be viewed as significant.

65,Senate,97,-0.095,848,1,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, I am de lighted to say that I have been added as  a cosponsor of the Commuter Transpor tation Energy Etficiency Act of 1981. I  cosponsored  a  similar  bill  that was  introduced in the 96th Congress on Au gust 6; 1980. It is an excellent,  timely  piece of  legislation, and  I  support  it  wholeheartedly.  The facts concerning our addiction to  foreign oil are depressing. They also serve  as strong reminders that America is be coming more and more vulnerable to im ported oil dependency and internal, eco nomic  disorder.  Unfortunately, Mr.  President, these alarming facts are the  result of our gluttonous oil appetites.  If war occurred today in the Middle  East, the United States could be drawn  into armed conflict in order to insure a  continuous flow of oil  throughout  this  country. As we well know, the President  has firmly committed the United States  to protect its vital strategic interests in  the Middle East.  It is most regrettable that our American  economy bordered on the brink of ruin  throughout the seventies partly because  of our great dependence on foreign oil.  The energy crises during the past decade  caused two recessions in this country and  double digit  inflation. It is no wonder  then that strong, but inexpensive solu tions to our energy problems are desper ately needed. It is undisputed that energy  conservation is our cheapest way to re duce our dependence on foreign oil.  The Commuter Transportation Energy  Etficiency Act of 1981 contains an excel lent proposal  for energy conservation.  The act would create no costly programs,  no counterproductive bureaucracy, and  no waste or inetficient squandering of the  taxpayers' money. Instead,  the legisla tion proposes a simple, time-proven solu tion of rewarding the energy thrift.  There are several provisions  in  the  Commuter Transportation Energy Etfi ciency Act of 1981 that are also so logi cal and simple that they form a very  wise and much needed bill. This legis lation encourages the use of car pooling,  van pooling. 11uses. and other forms of  mass  transportation as energy conser vation measures. Our  highways  are  choked with numerous motor vehicles.  Millions of Americans waste gas and  pollute  the environment by using an  astronomical number of single passenger  cars. In so many of these cases, multi passenger vehicles could easily substi tute for them, but old habits are very  tenacious creatures. Without some  in. centives, massive car and van pooling  will never become a reality.  Mr. President, this act creates several  different tvpes of incentives. It provides  a 15-percent tax credit to  individuals  purchasing vans  for van pooling,  in creases  the  investment  tax credit  for  employers who purchase vans for van  pooling  to 20  percent,  excludes  em ployer  subsidies  for  ride-sharing pro grams from the taxable income of the  employee, provides a  tax credit to the  employer for the administrative costs of  ride-sharing programs, and restores the  gasoline tax reduction for motor fuels  used in ride-sharing vehicles.  Mr. President, imagine the results if  all employees were to take advantage of  the ride-sharing programs outlilled  in  this magnificent  piece  of  legislation.  Imagine  the money and gasolme  that  would be saved, the pollution that would  be curtailed, and the highway congestion  that would be sizably reduced by par ticipating in these various ride-sharing  programs. The results would, indeed, be  profound.  Mr. President, such results would do  ernormous good  for  this Nation and  would put it back on the road to con tinuing progress for the benefit of all.  In my mind, this bill is one of the most  important pieces of energy  legislation  that will come up during the 97th Con gress. Its potential is enormous and its  contributions are vast.  Mr. President, I urge all of my col leagues  to support  this bill. We must  show our Nation and the world that the  U.S. Government  is determined  to re verse its present decline due to energy  inetficiency and neglect. We must dem onstrate to the world in general and to  our country in particular that energy  waste and inetficiency will no longer be  tolerated. We must prove that this Na tion will do everything possible to free  itself from being a hostage to foreign  oil. For these reasons, Mr. President, I  urge speedy passage of the Commuter  Transportation Energy Etficiency Act of  198l.e  8 ",1981
66,,97,-0.483,887,1,Mr. LEHMAN.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am  reintroducing  legislation which  would allow a person over 65 a refund able  credit  against Federal  income  taxes  for  the amount of State and  local  real property  taxes  they pay.  This credit could be taken for taxes  paid  directly  or  indirectly  through  rent.  Elderly  homeowners  often  have  their homes paid  for,  and  in most  cases they do not have the opportuni ty  to deduct real estate  taxes from  their  incomes. Because of  their  re duced incomes, a credit will be more  beneficial  to older taxpayers than a  deduction. For many elderly home owners, real estate taxes are a major  expense and often can force them to  sell  their homes as  inflation pushes  property values, and therefore proper ty taxes, higher and higher.  Our present tax policies have a defi nite bias  toward homeownership.  In  an attempt to assist elderly renters,  however, my legislation will permit eli gible persons to take a credit for the  portion of their rents which are used  to pay property taxes. As defined in  the bill,  rent constituting property  taxes shall equal 25 percent of  the  rent paid during a taxable year.  Tax credits are especially helpful to  low-income persons who usually do  not itemize their deductions. In order  to insure that the tax credits allowed  by this legislation go to those most in  need,  there  is a  limit  to  the credit  based on the adjusted gross incomes of  the eligible persons. The credit will be  reduced by the amount by which the  taxpayers' adjusted gross  income ex ceeds $10,000. In addition, there is an  absolute  limit of $300 on the credit  itself.  Mr. Speaker,  I believe  this  legisla tion merits  the serious attent)on of  the Congress. It will provide some real  assistance to our elderly homeowners  and renters alike.e  DEPOLITICIZING HEALTH CARE  HON. LARRY McDONALD  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 22, 1981  93-641  (1) Di e Mr. McDONALD.  Mr.  Speaker,  today  I  am  reintroducing a  bill  to  repeal titles XV and XVI of the Public  Health Service Act, which were cre ated by Public Law 93-641, the Nation al Health Planning and Resources De velopment Act of 1974.  Public Law  should be  re pealed immediately for the following  reasons.  First,  the  law  provides both  the  mechanism and the means for  total,  centralized control of health care by  the Federal Government. Title XV es tablishes  the mechanism by:  recting the Secretary of the Depart ment  of  Health,  Education,  and  Welfare to issue guidelines concerning  national health planning policy,  setting national health priorities, and  (3) creating a nationwide network of  health systems agencies, health serv ice areas, and State health planning  and development agencies.  Title XVI provides  the means by  authorizing Federal aid for developing  health resources-essentially building  new medical facilities or modernizing  old ones-and Federal funding for the  Health Systems Agencies established  in title XV. Acceptance of these funds  brings a medical facility under Federal  control,  if  indeed  it  is not already  taking  orders  from HEW  through  prior acceptance of funds from Feder al programs such as medicare, medic aid, Hill-Burton, and so forth.

67,,97,-0.49,900,1,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker, recently I  introduced a bill, H.R. 170, the postal  employees' right to safety bill, which  establishes the right of a postal em ployee to choose not to perform his or  her assigned task because of a reason able fear that death or seriouS injury  will result from the performance of a  specific task.  In effect, the bill makes applicable  to the Postal Service, that provision of  the National Labor Relations Act (29  U.S.C. 143) which provides  that the  quitting of work under such circum stances  shall  not  be  considered  a  strike. In addition, the bill codifies the  recent Supreme Court decision, Whirl pool Corporation v. Marshall, 445 U.S.  1, which held that the Secretary of  Labor was authorized to promulgate  such a regulation and that the regula tion conformed  to  the  fundamental  objective of preventing occupational  death and serious injuries.  Related legislation, authorizing the  Occupational Safety and Health Ad ministration to conduct unannounced  inspections of postal facilities and to  impose civil penalties for repeated and  flagrant violations of Federal safety  and health laws, was approved by the  House of Representatives during the  96th Congress. That bill was reported  favorably by the Senate Committee on  Governmental Affairs but was  not  acted upon by the Senate. I have in troduced similar legislation, H.R. 168,  during this Congress.  The House Subcommittee on Postal  Personnel and Modernization has con tinued its extensive oversight hearings  and investigations into the safety and  health program of the Postal Service.  The program was found to be deficient  in  several  respects.  Indeed,  shortly  after House approval of H.R. 826  in  1979, an accidental fatality at the New  York Bulk and Foreign Mail Center  revealed several serious safety defects  at that facility.  In Miami, Fla.,  the  USPS was sluggish in taking action to  examine employees who were exposed  to excessive levels of cancerous fibers  in the atmosphere. Finally, in Decem ber 1980,  two postal employees were  victims of fatal accidents in Los Ange les, Calif., and Portland, Oreg.  The Postmaster General's response  to  the earlier  fatality was  to give  safety somewhat higher priority than  in  the past. However, enactment of  this  legislation  is essential  if postal  employees are to be afforded the same  protections that are already available  to employees in the private sector.  899  Enactment of H.R. 170 would not au thorize postal employees to strike with  pay over unsafe working conditions;  nor would it permit malingering. The  bill simply subjects the Postal Service  to the same standards as private sector  employers by providing that an em ployee who in good faith believes that  performance of a  specific  task may  result in death or serious injury may  refuse  to perform that specific  task  and shall not be subject to discharge  or discrimination by his employer.e  AMERICA'S FOREIGN POLICY  PROBLEMS  HON. ROBERT J. LAGOMARSINO  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 22, 1981  e ",1981
68,,97,0.378,900,1,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker,  I wish to submit to my colleagues a  very incisive analysis of America's for eign policy problems. It was written by  Irving Kristol and appeared on  the  January 13, 1981, Wall Street Journal  editorial page.  Anyone  interested  in or concerned  about our foreign relations will benefit  from the author's effort to refocus our  national principles of international be havior. The article follows:  [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 13,  19811  FALSE PRINCIPLES AND INCOHERENT POLICIES  <By Irving Kristol)  It can hardly be doubted that American  foreign policy today is such as to make the  world perceive us as incompetent, while we  increasingly sense ourselves to be impotent.  Unfortunately, both the incompetence and  the impotence are not accidental, transient  features of  the policy. They derive  from  false  principles, which  lead  to problems  being badly defined. And seeking solutions  to problems that are badly defined is a cer tain path to frustration.  At the moment, there are three striking  instances of such a condition. They involve  the following questions:  (1) What should we have been doing about  our hostages in Iran?  (2) What should our attitude be toward  the threat of a Soviet invasion of Poland?  (3) How should we be weighing the pros pects of intervention or nonintervention in  such  troubled countries as Nicaragua, El  Salvador, the Philippines or Saudi Arabia?  Our basic error in Iran has been to define  our problem in tenns of a primary concern  with the safety and ultimate release of the  hostages. Having made such a definition, we  had no choice but to negotiate the ransom  payment demanded.  U.S. PRINCIPLES  Another-and  in my opinion more cor rect-definition of tpe problem would have  taken as its point of departure the following  principles: <a> As a general rule, the United  States government does not negotiate with,  or pay ransom to, terrorists. <b> As an abso lute rule, the United States does not ever  negotiate with, or pay ransom to, a foreign  government that behaves like a gang of ter rorists.

69,,97,-0.042,913,1,Mr. HOLLENBECK.," Mr. Speaker,  63 years ago the proud and fiercely in dependent Ukrainian people attempt ed to win freedom when a group of pa triots proclaimed the independence of  their native land from Russia. I would  like to take this opportunity to  join  my colleagues in commemorating this  important event, which should remind  us that the Ukrainians now, as in the  past, are determined  to guide  their  own future in a sovereign state.  The Ukrainians' unique cultural, his torical, and intellectual traditions pro vide a source of continuing national  pride that can never be subdued by  the forced ideology of a foreign state.  We must never be allowed to forget  the unceasing efforts of the Ukrainian  people in their campaign for renewed  independence.  As we express our concern for the  citizens of Ukraine, we must also pay  tribute to the many Ukrajnian Ameri cans who have made significant politi cal, economic, and cultural contribu tions to the well-being of this country.  They have distinguished  themselves  by constructive citizenship, by  their  dedication to America, and by  their  unyielding devotion to the cause of lib erty.  In remembering this anniversary of  Ukrainian  independence, we  in  the  United States are expressing our sup port for the aspirations of the Ukraini an people and our fervent hope that  the Ukraine will again recover its free dom. I only wish for that day in the  near future when, instead of marking  January 22, 1981  the anniversary of an  independence  since lost, we will celebrate a renewed  independence of modern times.e  STATEMENT  UPON  INTRODUC TION OF LEGISLATION TO PRO VIDE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR  ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT AND  TREAT THE PROBLEM OF DO MESTIC VIOLENCE  HON. MARIO BIAGGI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 22, 1981   Mr. BlAGG!. Mr. Speaker, today I  am introducing legislation which ad dresses  a  growing problem  in  this  Nation which  begs  a  solution-the  problem of physical abuse and neglect  of family members of all ages, better  known as domestic violence.  This bill is very similar to legislation  approved by this House by a vote of  292 to 106 on December 12, 1979, and  the Senate on August 26, 1980. As New  York's senior member of the House  Education  and  Labor  Committee  which  considered  this  legislation,  I  was also a member of the conference  committee which fashioned the final  version. Unfortunately, the last days  of the 96th Congress did not allow us  to complete our business on this vital  piece of  legislation. At that time,  I  pledged to reintroduce this bill again  so that we may begin to address the  issue of domestic violence prevention  and treatment.  My  involvement with  the  issue of  family violence has been lifelong, be ginning with my 23-year career in the  New York City Police Department. I  was a firsthand witness of the victims  as well as the abusers. This involve ment stimulated my interest and con cern in this area and prompted me to  introduce the first child abuse preven tion and treatment legislation in this  House. The 197 4 Child Abuse Preven tion and Treatment Act created the  Federal response to this problem. Our  work in this area has been invaluable  for many helpless children. Today, we  must seek to expand our efforts in this  area  in order  to assist other family  members-spouses,  parents,  and  grandparents-who have also become  the tragic victims of domestic violence.  In order to help the nearly 2 million  victims of family violence, this bill au thorizes a total of $65 million over the  next 3 years, in the form of grant as sistance to States, localities, and orga nizations, in order to assist in the pre vention and treatment of domestic vio lence. The emphasis is upon fiscal re straint-it is a  realistic authorization  in order to provide seed money to en courage effort within the States. The  emphasis is also upon State and local  control-it has been our experience  ",1981
70,,97,-0.444,926,1,Mr. STUDDS.," Mr. Speaker, Carlos  Fuentes  is one of Mexico's greatest  novelists and political  thinkers. Re cently he wrote an article for the Los  Angeles Times which  I believe pro vides  a  brilliant  summation of  the  challenges and opportunities confront ing President Reagan with respect to  our foreign policy in Central America.  I recommend the article highly both  to my colleagues in the Congress and  to interested officials in the executive  branch.  We had hardly settled down to coffee in  front of  the TV set  that wet November  night when  the President of  the United  States came  into  the comfortable  living  room of William and Mary Bundy, courtesy  of ABC. Carter was conceding the election  and our warm and brilliant hosts, as well as  their guests from the Princetonian realms  of literati and academe, were keenly analyz ing  the whys and wherefores of Ronald  Reagan's victory.  The fact of Reagan's success sank in very,  very slowly. Many different  things raced  through our heads at that moment. I  told  myself that this was, on the face of it, not  the best news for Latin America. Even more  than that, I silently repeated what I have  been murmuring for  the past 10 months  during my stay at the University of Penn sylvania  as  a  guest  lecturer-before my  mirror, into my early 'morning teacup and  sauntering next to the imaginary Pancho  Villa who, Harvey-like, accompanies me in  my forays into the editorial rooms, political  parlors and university halls in your country.  The president of Mexico and the presi dent-elect of the United States met Jan. 5 at  the border city of Juarez. Now let me recall  what old Pancho said to me  last Nov. 4:  Repeat  to yourself what you have been  saying all  these months. Mexico has no  cause for alarm, whatever the outcome of  the U.S. election. Mexico can deal with a  Carter or a Reagan administration because  Mexico has a history and a conscience of its  past, a clear set of present-day priorities and  a formidable sense of what relations with  the United States  Inight mean  for  the  future.  Because it has all  this, Mexico has the  most far-sighted, morally courageous and  pragmatically  justifiable foreign policy  in  Latin America and, perhaps, in the Third  World.  I  thought,  shifting my gaze  from  the  mournings and the celebrations on the tele vision  to the flickering fire  in the Bundy  chimney, of my country's constant struggle  for independence since the early 19th Cen tury: against colonial Spain, against Presi dent James K.

71,,97,0.115,939,1,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. President.  on several occasions during  year, I have attempted to outline_ a na: the pa.st  tional problem that I call fiscal diSpan ties. This problem  takes many forms.  The actors may differ, but the elements  are often the same.  We are witnessing a fundamental re location  of  America's  economic  re sources--investment,  jobs,  communi ties-which will  be  accompanied  by  significant social and political problems.  I am convinced that we are not yet fully  aware of the magnitude of this shift.  This week, I, along with several of my  colleagues, introduced a bill which would  limit the amount of severance tax any  State could impose on coal that has been  extracted from Federal or Indian lands.  This legislation represents the most ex treme form of a{'.tion that the Congress  might  take  to address  the  fiscal dis parities problem. But one which I believe  is warranted in light of the unreason able coal severance taxes that have been  imposed by Montana and Wyoming.  Mr. President, on Sunday, January 18,  the Washington Post published an ar ticle by Mr. Neal R. Peirce which dis cusses many aspects of  the fiscal dis parities  problem.  I  recommend Mr.  Peirce's article to my colleagues as it is  an excellent  contribution  to  this on going discussion.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous ~on­ sent that this article, with the accom panying table be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  and table were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follOWS:  OFFING  THE  FROST  BELT:  STUPm  WHOSE TIME HAS CoME  A  IDEA  938  Ukrainians all over the free world, including  the United States, will celebrate the Proc lamation of the Independence of Ukraine.  January 22nd, 1981, wlll mark  the 63rd  Anniversary of  the Proclamation of Inde pendence of Ukraine and the 62nd anniver sary of the Act of Union, whereby all Ukrain ian lands were united into one independent  and sovereign nation. Both the Independence  of Ukraine and the Act of Union were pro claimed by a duly elected parliament (Cen tral Rada)  in Kiev. capital of Ukraine. on  January 22nd, 1918 and in January 1919.  This  sovereign  Ukrainian  state-nation  was immedla tely recognized by a large n um ber of nations, including France and Eng land. Diplomatic relations were established  with them. Recognition was also granted by  Soviet Russia. But despite the fact that the  Soviet government had officially recognized  Ukraine as an  independent and sovereign  state, communist  forces attacked Ukraine  both by m111tary aggression and by subver sion from within.  For three and one-half years the Ukrainian  people waged a gallant struggle in defense  of their country, alone and without aid from  the western nations, and unfortunately were  overpowered by the numerically stronger and  better equipped Russian Bolsheviks. They  destroyed the Ukrainian National Republic  and created a Communist puppet govern ment known as the Ukrainian Soviet Social ist Republic, U.S.S.R.  The entire history of the Soviet dominated  Ukraine is a ghastly record of inhumanity,  outright persecution and genocide and in  the last years--Russification and violation of  human and national rights on a  scale not  known in the history of mankind.  In summing up, the colonial rule of Soviet  Communism in Ukraine can be characterized  by the following:  A. During the sixty years of Moscow rule  in Ukraine, literally millions of Ukrainians  have been annihilated by man-made famines,  deportations, and executions.  B. Both the Ukrainian Orthodox and the  Ukrainian Catholic Church have been ruth lessly destroyed and their clergy, along with  hundreds of thousands of their members were  arrested, persecuted and mostly killed.  c. All aspects of Ukrainian life are rigidly  controlled and directed from Moscow.  D. Permanent violation of human and na tional  rights was  instituted  in Ukraine.  Thousands of Ukrainians have been charged  with ""anti-Soviet propaganda and agitation"",  arrested, tried and sentenced for many years.  Many have been tortured. incarcerated and  confined to psychiatric asylums where drugs  and chemicals are forcefully administered.  All members of the Ukrainian Public Group  to Promote the Implementation of the Hel sinki Accords were arrested, tried. and sen tenced from 7 to 10 years, among them such  prominent members  as Mykola Rudenko,  Oleksa Tykhy. MyJrola Ma+usewych. Myro slaw Marynowych, and Lew Lulcianenko.  The Russian Communist enslavement of  Ukraine has brought much suffering to the  people of Ulcraine. In spite of this op!Jressive  voke. Utrrainians have never accepted foreign  domination and are continuing to struggle  for human rights, freedom. and national in dependence. The new breed of young and  adamant fighters for human and national  ri~hts gives us hope that Ukraine will be free  again.  The Ukrainian people in the free world are  celebrating the memorable January 22nd as  their ~eatest holiday. Also. for many years  the 22nd of Januarv has been oroclaimed in  our American cities. and states from coast to  coast as Ukrainian Tnoependence Day.  Therefore. it is in the common s~irit of  libertv. fa!~h . and iu.,ti~e t'h~t tr.e ftme:::-i~a~  people. and especially the U.S. Congress, join  Ukrainians all over the world in giving moral  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE  January 23, 1981  are  reported. Since 1970, nearly a mlllion  manufacturing  jobs have been lost in the  region stretching from the chemical plants  of Wilmington and the factories of Balti more  to the steel mllls of Pittsburgh and  Youngstown, the rubber plants of Akron and  the auto plants of Dayton, Pontiac and  Flint.  Now Detroit, quavering at the prospect of  a Chrysler bankruptcy, faces a massive def icit last estimated at $150 milllon, and grow ing. New York City's welcome short-term  budget surplus is said to be but a prelude  to further crisis in a year or two. Accelerat ing de~ontrol of oil and gas prices floods the  treasuries of such states as Texas, Oklahoma,  Louisiana and Alaska with blllions of dollars  in severance taxes and royalty payments even while  service  cutbacks  and  budget  emergencies are the order of the day in Wis consin, Michigan and Massachusetts.  Finally, in an act of monumental inepti tude,  the outgoing Carter  administration  allows its President's Commission for a Na tional Agenda for the Eighties to produce a  report belittling hopes for the older indus trial states and cities and suggesting instead  that Washington assist able-bodied workers  to  find  jobs  in  the Sun Belt. The report  stands as a  total repudiation of the Carter  urban policy, perhaps  the best  conceived  and sensitively applied new domestic initia tive of the last four years.  Thus the president, in receiving the com mission report, finds himself obliged to dis own its principal urban pollcy recommenda tions and to point to the success of his ad ministration's efforts to target economic de velopment aid to distressed areas. The dis avowal  is a highly unusual occurrence  in  the history of presidential commissions, but  not as strong as some of his advisers urged.  The leaking of the report has already left  the authors and 1mplementers of the cities  policy in HUD and other departments tear ing their hair in anger and frustration. They  fear that the report, privately characterized  by a top White House aide as ""an abomina tion,"" wlll be seized on by some policymakers  of  the new administration as  justification  for an attitude of benign neglect  toward  Frost Belt states, cities and  their people,  whose taxes made possible the federal growth  subc;idies that triggered the Sun Belt boom.  Thus fears mount that the 1980s could be  an era of two Americas--one thriving, one  hemorrhaging at every pore; one  reaching  new levels of growth and prosperity, one on  a  slippery slide of permanent decline. This  was the grim specter raised a few months ago  by Felix Rohatyn, chairman of New York's  Municipal Assistance Corporation, when he  wrote of ""half the country nearly bankrupt,  many of its major cities pools of unemploy ment and unrest, and the other half swim ming in oil. industry and wealth.""  It would be a tragedy of unspeakable pro port-ions-akin to the North's blindness to ward Southern needs in the Reconstruction  era following the Civil War-if the new ad minio;tration and  to accept  such a  scenario  a-S  inevitable. And  in fact  a key Reagan adviser, Rep. Jack Kem!J  (R N.Y.).  has  characteri?:ed  the  presidential  commission's  urbq,n  proposals  as  ""out r('.~eops"" and said Reagan ""will not write off  the Northeast and de""Jre~Ssed cities.""

In  these troubled times when our stand ards of patriotism, our concepts of  what is good for America or what may  not be good, are in doubt, I commend  to everyone to read Tiger Teague's bi ography.  Tiger Teague was a truly great man,  a great Congressman, a great Ameri can, and a great patriot.

75,House,97,-0.042,965,1,Mr. NICHOLS.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week, in my hometown of Sylacauga,  Ala., Prof. C. S. Crowther celebrated  his lOOth birthday. It was my privilege  to  attend  elementary  school under  this beloved Christian educator and I  have fond recollections of each day's  chapel program attended by all ele mentary students, where  the Scrip tures were  read and where we  all  joined in prayer.  It is indeed regrettable that the Su preme Court of the United States has  decided that such participation is con trary to the Constitution in that, in  their judgment it violates the separa tion of church and state.  I  disagree. This Nation was  con ceived in the minds and hearts of men  and women who desired to form a new  country where they could indeed wor ship as they pleased. In our 200-year  history as a nation, we have been a  Christian  nation  and  prayer  has  played an important part in the basic  beliefs  of generations,  shaping  the  minds, character, and lives of young  people in these United States.  It is because of these strong beliefs  which I hold that I am today introduc ing legislation which,  if passed by a  simple majority of both Houses of  Congress,  would  permit  voluntary  prayer in our public schools.  I am also introducing a proposal to  amend  the  Constitution  of  these  United States which,  if  ratified by  three-fourths  of  the States, would  allow the same thing.  Alabama Governor, Fob James has  stated:  That to deny 40 million American school  children the privilege of voluntary prayer  and Judea-Christian  influence under  the  guise of separation of church and state is  tampering with the heartstrings of America.

On  January  27,  1981, we celebrate the eighth anniver sary of the signing of the Paris peace  accords which  signaled  the  formal  ending of the Vietnam war.  It is  indeed unfortunate, however,  that for some 2,500 American families  the war still  lingers. These are  the  families of our missing in action and  known prisoners of war who never re turned from Southeast Asia.  At this time, there is substantial evi dence that the Governments of Viet nam and Laos have not provided us  with all the information with respect  to our MIA's and POW's in their re spective countries. While  those Gov ernments have repeatedly stated that  they are holding no Americans,  re ports coming from many knowledge able and reliable Southeast Asian refu gees have flatly contradicted this.  I  find it a cruel and odious act to  continue to deliberately withhold in formation regarding American MIA's  and POW's. I join with the rest of my  colleagues  to  implore  the Govern ments of Vietnam and Laos to free any  of our citizens they now hold because  of the Indochina conflict and to pro vide  any  information  regarding  the  whereabouts of those still missing.  It is time we put the whole question  of Vietnam to rest. The families of the  MIA's  and  POW's  have  suffered  beyond what most of us can compre hend.

77,House,97,-0.153,978,1,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Speaker, today  has been a day of national rejoicing at  the return of our hostages from Iran.  The release of our 52 citizens has been  greeted by  all of our people with  prayers of thanksgiving for their safe  return and with a national party of  unprecedented proportions.  We should remember that this was  the occasion for similar prayers and  happiness 8 years ago when our coun try signed the Paris peace accords sig naling the formal end to the war in  Vietnam,  a war which divided our  countrymen and which took the lives  of many  thousands  of  our  young  people.  We would be remiss, even on this  day of national celebration, if we did  not remember that as a result of that  terrible conflict there are still Ameri cans in captivity, Americans who have  been seen by the refugees who have  come into our country and into Thai land, escaping the Communist regimes  in Laos and Vietnam which have ter rorized them. They tell us that some  of our people are still held in horren dous conditions, kept from their fami lies and loved ones, denied even the  basic rights of prisoners of war to have  contact with the outside world and to  have their conditions of imprisonment  monitored.  This captivity  is a  source of grief  and despair for 2,500 American fami lies who wonder every day about the  treatment of their sons, husbands, and  fathers and about whether they will  ever see them again.  I am deeply saddened to have to join  with my  colleague,  Representative  GILMAN,  in his special order today to  call attention  to  this heinous crime  against our soldiers and their families.  A civilized community of nations must  hold in contempt any member nation  which would refuse to notify the fami lies of those they are holding as pris oners of war.  International  law and  convention and the laws of the reli gions of all people dictate the basic  human  courtesies  of  contact with  family and of information about con ditions of imprisonment, especially in  a war now officially over for 8 years.  I call upon the Governments of Viet nam and of Laos to provide for our  country and for the families of these  men a full accounting of our missing  and of our known POW's who were  never returned. I further call upon our  allies  and upon  all nations of  the  world to join us in this request and in  our condemnation of the conduct of  the Governments  of Vietnam  and  Laos. If this kind of treatment of pris oners of war is permitted to continue  in this instance it can happen again  and it can happen to the prisoners of  any nation. This kind of barbarism by  governments must come to an end. It  is the responsibility of all nations to  see that it does.e   ",1981

However,  these  celebrations  cannot  cause us to forget about the hostages  of 8 years, those soldiers who never re turned from Vietnam, who were never  seen or heard from again.  For these 2,500 soldiers, and their  families, it has been 2,922 days of wait ing and hoping-8 years ago today, we  initiated  the  Paris  peace  accords,  which brought a  formal end  to  the  conflict in Vietnam. The peace accords  meant an end to the military conflict,  but not to the personal conflicts suf fered during a time the families have  wondered whether their loved ones are  still alive.  Live  sighting  reports, which num bered over 300  last year, keep  the  hopes of these families alive, and dis prove the claims of Vietnam and Laos,  who maintain they hold no prisoners  of war. Just as  the country united  behind the hostages in Iran, we cannot  forget the plight of the missing sol diers in Southeast Asia.  Our prayers have been answered and  the Iranian crisis is over. Let us con tinue to keep the POW's and MIA's in  our prayers,  never  forgetting what  they and their families have sacrificed  for our country.e  e ",1981
79,House,97,0.398,978,1,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Speaker, as  we in this country rejoice at the free dom of the 52 American hostages who  endured 14 months of savage captivity,  I want to take a moment to reflect on  the 2,546 civilian and military person nel whose fate  is still unknown-our  missing in action and POW's who have  never returned from Southeast Asia.  As a member of the task force of  POW /MIA's in the 96th Congress, and  as  ranking minority member of  the  House Armed Services Committee,  I  have reviewed information that indi cated to me that there are Americans  in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia being  held against their will. These are men  who selflessly fought for their country  and the principles we hold so dear,  and  I  hope  that everyone  in  this  Chamber will  work  to  determine  beyond a shadow of a doubt, if possi ble, the fate of those captured or miss ing in action who are still unaccounted  for.  As we listen to our 52 heroes tell of  the horrors they endured, let us not  forget those who may still be living a  life of terror. They,  too, are heroes,  and I pray that we will have the op portunity  to welcome  them  home  soon.e   ",1981
80,House,97,0.368,978,1,Mrs. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, all of us  were overjoyed that Americans held in  cruel captivity by the Iranian Govern ment were released on January 20, and  some of us were reminded of the dis turbing and depressing  reports  that  American prisoners of war may still be  captives in Indochina.  Refugees from Vietnam, Laos, and  Cambodia have reported seeing Ameri can prisoners. There have been a con siderable number of these reports, and  the governments of those Communist  nations  have  never  provided  the  United States with a full accounting of  MIA's and persons known  to have  been POW's before the Vietnam war  ended.  Those Communist governments say  they are not holding any Americans,  but there are reasons to doubt their  claim. They say they have provided us  with all the information available, but  I doubt it.  Let us not forget  that Americans  may still be captive in Indochina, and  let us not cease our efforts to verify  any reports that would enable us to  find them and secure their release.e  e ",1981

82,Senate,97,-0.301,1004,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," I  thank the Chair;  I thank my distinguished chairman, the  Senator from Arizona.  Madam President, with the indulgence  of the Chair and the Senate, I have a  brief statement which I feel it important  to read in the Senate on this occasion.  Madam President, I rise in support of  the confirmation of William J. Casey, of  New York, as Director of Central In telligence. I think it is particularly im portant to inform the Senate of those  parts of Mr. Casey's testimony before  the Select Committee on  Intelligence  which concerns his understanding of the  relationship  between  the  intelligence  community and the Congress.  I should point out that our statutory  intelligence oversight provisions, which  are contained in the Intelligence Author ization Act enacted by the 96th Congress  in 1980, are unique. There is no other  democratic nation in the world in which  there is such a close, confidential rela tionship between the intelligence com munity and the legislature. There is no  other democratic nation in the world in  which the legislature has such a wide ranging statutory right to  intelligence  information.  These oversight provisions require that  the congressional  intelligence commit tees be kept fully and currently informed  of all  intelligence activities,  including  significant anticipated  intelligence ac tivities; that they be furnished any in formation or material concerning intel ligence activities which they request in  order to carry out their authorized re S!.'onsibilities; and that they be informed  of any illegal  intelligence activities or  significant  intelligence  failures. When  the President determines that ""extraor dinary  circumstancec;  affecting  vital  interests of the United States"" require it,  he may limit the prior notiflcation of a  significant anticipated  intelligence ac tivity to eight Members of Congress, the  majority and minoritv leaders of the two  Houses and of the two intelligence com mittees.  In  it was  These  requirements, while  creating  the presumption of the fullest coopera tion,  are  not,  however,  absolute.  drafting the  legislation,  recog nized that there are conceivable circum stances in which the President, as Com mander in Chief, might act alone. In  consequence, two preambular clauses of  the statute provide that the exchange of  information will  take place to the ex tent consistent with all applicable au thorities  and  duties,  including  those  conferred by the Constitution upon the  executive and legislative branches of the  Government, and to the extent consis tent with due regard for the protection  from unauthorized disclosure of classi fied information and information relat ing to intelligence sources and methods.  Madam President, because Mr. Casey  will be, if confirmed, the first Director  of Central Intelligence to take office un der the new oversight regime, and be cause of the reservations contained in  the oversight law itself, I judge it neces sary to return to this subject during the  committee's  questioning  of  him.  It  seemed important to me to insure that  when difficult questions arose under the  law the Director of Central Intelligence  would be inclined to put the narrowest  possible interpretation on those clauses  which could be used to restrict congres sional access to information. After out lining  the oversight  legislation,  I put  the matter  in  the most severe  terms,  asking Mr. Casey:  (H) ow do you feel about telllng this Com mittee things we need to know (that) you  would just as soon not more than two people  in the world knew?  Mr. Casey's reply,  I believe, demon strated his intention to continue the sat isfactory relationship our committee had  with the intelligence community during  the past administration:  Senator, I intend to comply fully with the  spirit and the letter of the 1ntell1gence over sight act. I intend to provide this Committee  with the Information it believes it needs !or  oversight purposes.  I  believe  the detalled  implementation is something we wlll work  out as we go along. I would intend to follow  the practices  that have been worked out  with the President (and with)  the Incum bent of . .. the office !or which  I've been  nominated. And there are some reservations  of constitutional authority that relate to the  President's constitutional authority.  I  cannot conceive now of any circum stances under which they would result in my  not being able  to provide  this Committee  with the information it requires. I wo'..tld ob viously have  to be subject  to and discuss  with the President any particular situations  which  I cannot now  foresee, and I would.  do that ln a way that this Committee would  know about.  It should be noted, however, that with  respect  to activities conducted abroad  other than those intended solely for the  collection of necessary intelligence. the  President has an unconditional obliga tion to report to the intelligence commit tees ""in a  timely fashion."" This insures  that, regardless of the sensitivity of the  operation or of any other circumstance,  the Congress will eventuallv be informed  of any covert action undertaken  in a  foreign country.  Mr. Casey took note of this develop ment in his opening statement:  ",1981
83,Senate,97,-0.262,1030,1,Mr. GLENN.," I thank the distinguished  Senator very much for his consideration.  Mr. President, I would like to wrap up  and summarize some of the comments I  made this morning.  I would say that absent any personal  lack of integrity or completely lacking  qualification in a particular field, I think  the President does deserve to get his man  in whatever job he is nominating him for.  I am sure that should be  true of Mr.  STOCKMAN also. But I  think we should  be pointing out to the American people  and our colleagues in the Senate exactly  what we are getting when we get this  man that the President has nominated  because he comes as close  to being a  complete worldwide, laissez faire, Adam  Smith-type economist as  I have  read  anything about in recent years.  Let me repeat a few of the areas of  concern  that I  covered  this morning.  For instance, on energy policy, he felt  that our policy to develop our own do mestic energy sources may prove, in his  words, ""to be the most costly national  error of the last half of the twentieth  century       .""  In other words, he would see us be come more dependent on  foreign oil  sources and help develop foreign oil fields  rather than our own domestic alterna tives.  ",1981
84,Senate,97,0.115,1095,1,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. President,  a little more than 3 years ago, America  lost one of its greatest leaders, Hubert H.  Humphrey. Senator Humphrey's passing  left a void that no one will ever fill.  Mv election in 1978 carried wlth it a  special  responsibility-to continue  the  record of service to people that marked  the career of Hubert Humphrey. When  I accepted  the Humphrey chair, I ac cepted a  tradition of dedicated service,  openness, honesty, unabiding trust and  faith in people, and a commitment to  individuals.  Senator Humphrey's record  is one I  am proud to continue. I believe in the  goodness of people.  I  believe  in  their  strength, their creativity and their abil ity and desire  to work for a common  goal.  Philosophically, I may not always have  agreed with Senator Humphrey, but.  like most Americans, I found his spirit,  his enthusiasm, and his love for people  to be inspiring.  Mr. President, I submit the syndicated  column by Nick Thimmesch on Hubert  H. Humphrey, the Happy Warrior, to be  printed in today's REcoRD.  The column is as follows:  HUBERT H. HUMPHREY, THE ""HAPPY WARRIOR"":  A RECOLLECTION  (By Nick Thimmesch)  WASHINGTON.-Among  the  sorely missed  human qualities in this town are the effer vescence, optimism and  spirit of Hubert  Horatio Humphrey. It was nearly three years  ago that H.H.H., the ""Happy Warrior,"" died  after struggling to shake an insistent cancer.  We haven't seen anybody  like Humphrey  since, and probably won't for many years.  Humphrey loved the political game with  passion. He was a strong Democrat, and al most always fought for what he regarded as  principle. He panted for humanity, and too  often implemented such impulses by whip ping up another federal pro.,.ram. Humphrey  displayed a sharp edge in debate, but he was  also a concmator. He often vehemently dis agreed-as veteran Republicans will  smil ingly  testify-but Hubert was never dis agreeable. There was no more popular man  in the U.S. Senate.  Despite setting some sort of record-per haps it belongs in the Guinness Book-for  the volume of his rhetoric, Humphrey was  respected as a senator of stature, a highly  intelligent man always bristling with ideas.  Two of Hubert's best qualities were his in ablllty to be angry at anyone for very long,  and his empathy for fellow political warriors  of either party. There's no question in my  mind that if Hubert were alive, he would be  on the phone every other day with President  Jimmy Carter, trying to buck him up as he  prepares for the sad trip home to Plains, re minding Carter of his accomplishments and  the fact that there is much of llfe before  him.  When he was ridden with cancer, pale and  feeble, scarcely able to rise in his bed, and  only  four  days  from  death, Humphrey  phoned Richard M. Nixon, Jan. 9, 1978, to  wish  him Happy Birthday. According  to  Muriel Humphrey, Nixon was very touched,  but not quite as much as on Christmas  Day-two weeks before-when Humphrey  phoned Nixon to wish him Merry Christmas.  ""Nixon cried on the phone,"" Muriel once re called, ""probably because he realized where  Hubert was at. You have a  lot in common,  being in poll tir.s.""  If any opponent had scathed Nixon in cam paigns, it was Humphrey. In 1968, when the  two fought a close battle for the presidency,  Humphrey once  introduced Emmett Kelly,  the famous clown done up with outlandish  pants,  sad eyes and  rubber-ball nose,  as  ""Nixon's campaign manager and chief eco nomic adviser.""  Robert Kennedy's campaign tactics savaged  Humphrey in the 1960 West Virginia primary,  and later, when R.F.K. demanded that Hum phrey release his Minnesota delegates, Hubert  snapped: ""Bobby, go to hell."" But Humphrey  reconciled with Bobby and all others by  whom he was roughed up in politics.  He forgot and forgave the hurts 1n1Ucted  by Lyndon B. Johnson;  Joseph Rauh  the  Americans  for Democratic Action  (ADA)  chieftain who turned on Humphrey and the  scores of demonstrators who spat on, and  reviled him, during the acrimonious Vietnam  period. Even in late 1971, when he held anti war views, Humphrey was pelted with toma toes thrown at him during a convention of  scientists where  protestors waved  signs  reading:  ""Humphrey Wanted  for Murder,  Rape, Genocide.""  Humphrey shook it all off. ""He quickly got  it out of his system,"" recalls David Gartner,  Humphrey's longtime aide, now a U.S. com missioner. ""He lived at peace with himself.  He was always phoning people on their birth days or when they were 111. He couldn't stop  himself from doing that.""  Humphrey was such a blend of civlllty,  warmth, humor and professional politician.  He was no saint. As a poor boy in the trade,  he had to look the othe~ way in the old days  so he wouldn't see where the campaign bucks  were coming from. He also liked a good time,  and perhaps that's why he understood hu man frailty.  The game of politics, as played in the U.S.  Senate,  should be one where  the Hubert  Humphreys prevail, no matter what  their  views. When Humphrey arrived there in 1949,  he WlaS brash, and full of himself for having  led the civil rights fight at the Democratic  convention the summer before. He was given  the cold shoulder by many senators and was  embarrassed to hear Sen. Richard Russell, the  titan from Georgia pointedly remark: ""Can  you imagine the people of Minnesota sending  that damn  fool  down here  to  represent  them?""  However, as one sage observed, ""In Wash ington, some grow, and some swell."" Hum phrey grew. He won the respect of all the  titanc;, including Russell, was elected Major ity Whip, and became the man many sena tors turned to for advice or even consolation.  He and Barry Goldwater were buddies, and  his old duc;t-ups with the Kennedys never  prevented him from becoming a warm friend  of Sen. Edward Kennedy.  The new Senate is distinctive, not just be cause it is Republican and conservative, but  alc;o because a maJority of its m~mbers are  relative newcon;ers to politloallife. Let's hope  th~t this Seng.te develope; warmth, clvillty,  an'\ an a""1111ty to nisagree without 1'-einP"" rUs av-eeable--qualltll!'s with whi~h Humphrey  was ri~~ly '>le!'sed.

85,,97,-0.562,1108,1,Mr. ROSENTHAL.," Mr.  Speaker,  today  I  am  introducing, with Mr.  BRODHEAD, of Michigan, H.R. 1338, a  bill designed to discourage and limit  tax evasion  and  shelter activity  in  ""straddle"" and ""cash and carry"" trans actions.  Although  the  Internal  Revenue  Service ruled 4 years ago that tax-mo tivated commodity trading was riskless  and without  real economic purpose,  unscrupulous promoters continue  to  attract high-income clients eager  to  reduce or eliminate tax liabilities by  creating  and  deducting  enormous  paper losses from their income 1 year  while deferring offsetting gains to a  later year. Some try not only to defer  their taxes, they also try to convert or dinary  income or short-term capital  gain to long-term capital gain which is  taxed at significantly lower rates.  Tax -straddle  promoters make  it  clear that they are offering tax sav ings, not an investment opportunity.  Commissions  frequently  are  deter mined as a percentage of the desired  tax writeoff. Offering materials tout  alleged tax benefits. Some even prom ise to provide clients with legal repre sentation in the event of IRS audits.  The promotional materials for one  offshore straddle shelter blatantly ad vertises tax deferral as a certainty:  The first objective of the <tax shelter> is  deferment. And since our taxing system re quires voluntary reporting, deferment is a  virtual certainty. Losses are created and  claimed. The burden of review falls upon  the IRS, thus tax payment is deferred until  the IRS acts. <Sometimes years.)  If the IRS rejects the claims of the <tax  shelter),  their decision  can be  appealed  through the tax appeals process. This proc ess can take years to complete. Deferment  can be further stretched out through part  of the appeals process.  Successful tax reduction is the goal. De ferment is a certainty.  In the last few years,  the number  and variety of these shelter deals have  1107  increased, and conservative estimates  put the revenue loss to the U.S. Treas ury at more than $1.3 billion annually.  Straddle shelters have been structured  in many commodities. Popular offer ings  include  straddles  in  precious  metals, especially silver and silver fu tures contracts, arid in financial paper,  particularly Treasury bills and Treas ury bill futures. Individuals can pur chase a single straddle, engage in mul tiple transactions through matched ac counts, or  invest  in partnerships or  subchapter S corporations participat ing  in  these shelters. Some persons  take advantage of  straddle shelters  through offshore promoters, especial ly in foreign countries which refuse  the IRS access  to  their records  for  audit purposes.  The  following  examples, currently  under audit by the Internal Revenue  Service, illustrate the enormous reve nue  losses attributable to tax strad dles:  First,  an  executive with  annual  income of over $250,000 from salary,  dividends, and  interest and substan tially appreciated  stock, used  silver  straddles and other tax shelters over  the course of several years as a means  of not reporting any taxable income.  In 1975, this taxpayer had long-term  capital gains from the sale of stock of  more than $600,000. Toward the end  of the year this executive purchased  silver  straddles which  produced  a  paper loss of $600,000. Other tax shel ters were  used  to  eliminate  the  $250,000 in income. In the next year,  more silver straddles were used in an  attempt  to  continue  to  defer  the  $600,000 gain.  Second, another wealthy executive  with annual income. from salary, divi dends, and  interest of over $200,000  sold the stock of his business for a $10  million profit in 1976 but reported no  net capital gains because of a reported  offsetting $10 million short-term capi tal loss from silver straddles. This re ported  loss was generated from  the  loss  leg of  the straddle-silver con tracts were purchased for $140 million  and sold for $130 million. Of course,  the gain leg which was not reported in  this year had an unrealized profit of  about $10 million so that the taxpayer  had no  real  loss. Additional  silver  straddle  transactions were  entered  into in subsequent years in an attempt  to continue to defer the gain.  Third, one corporate executive had  income from salary and investments of  over $500,000. This taxpayer attempt ed to report a loss in excess of $500,000  from a Treasury bill tax straddle and  consequently showed a net loss for the  year. The  taxpayer even  received a  refund  of withheld  taxes  of  over  $38,000. This case, which is currently  under examination by the IRS, illus trates the gross distortions in income  that taxpayers may attempt to claim  ",1981

I am fully aware of the major  contributions Mr. Farrar has made to  the area over the past 60 years and  want to join his family and friends in  paying him tribute.  In his early years, Mr. Farrar prac ticed law and became a successful busi nessman. He served as the first presi dent of the Hemet Chamber and later  headed  that  organization  for  the  entire county of Riverside. Additional ly, he was a founding member of the  Hemet Kiwanis Club and was  twice  lieutenant governor of the California Nevada-Hawaii District of Kiwanis In ternational. He has also served as a  member of the local school board and  held posts in many other civic organi zations.  But it is for his contributions in the  area of water management, conserva tion, and control that he will be most  remembered. Since 1951, he has served  as the Eastern Municipal Water Dis trict representative on the board of di rectors of the Metropolitan Water Dis trict. He currently serves on the water  problems,  executive,  and  legal  and  claims committees of that board. In  this capacity, he has been intimately  involved  in both acquiring necessary  water supplies for southern California  and  for overseeing  the distribution  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  and use of this precious resource. His  latest project is the Peripheral Canal  issue scheduled for  inclusion on the  State ballot next June. Additionally,  in the past, he has served as president  of the San Jacinto River Conservation  District, as chairman of the Riverside  County Flood Control and Conserva tion District  organizing  committee  and, subsequently, as one of the dis trict's first commissioners. Finally, he  also joined the ranks of academe when  he served for 5 years as a member of  the Advisory Council of the Water Re sources Center of  the University of  California.

Since then, the Soviet Union has  consistently  exploited  Castro's  de pendence on their aid and guidance.  The events of  the Cuban missile  crisis, when the Russians attempted to  place nuclear missiles at our doorstep,  and  finally were  forced  to  remove  them by President Kennedy, are familiar to us.    The reports and sightings of Soviet  armaments,  installations,  subsidies,  and advisers have been too numerous  to mention.  At this very moment, Castro main tains about 40,000 of his troops on the  African Continent. I am reintroducing  today a joint resolution expressing our  determination  to  vigorously  oppose  Soviet  penetration  of Cuba,  using  Cuba to extend its military influence  into Africa and the Americas, contrary  to the Monroe Doctrine. I hope I will  be  joined by other Members of the  House in making this effort for free dom in the Caribbean.  The text of the resolution follows:  H.J. RES. 136  Joint resolution expressing the determina tion of the United States with respect to  the situation in Cuba  Whereas the Soviet Union has deployed  military personnel to Cuba for the purpose  of piloting and maintaining Cuban Mig-22  fighter aircraft, to operate Cuban radar in stallations, and for other military purposes;  and  Whereas this Soviet deployment of mili tary personnel into this hemisphere has oc curred in conjunction with the depletion of  January 27, 1981  Cuban military forces through the interven tion of tens of thousands of Cuban troops in  Africa in support of various Communist-sup ported military actions on that continent;  and  Whereas such deployment of Soviet mili tary personnel  to Cuba, and Soviet and  Cuban military personnel, arms, and sup port to Communist forces in Africa, is in the  interests only of Coinmunists expansionism  and not in the interests of world peace; and  Whereas  such Soviet military presence  and buildup in Cuba is in violation of the  Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which termed any  attempt on the part of European powers ""to  extend their system to any portion of this  hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and  safety,"" and of the Kennedy-Khrushchev  agreements of 1962, which assured no de ployment of Soviet forces of offensive arms  in Cuba; and  Whereas in the Rio de Janeiro Treaty of  1947  the parties agreed  that ""an armed  attack by any State against all the Ameri can States shall be considered as an attack  against all the American States, and, conse quently, each one of the said contracting  parties undertakes to assist in meeting the  attack in the exercise of the inherent right  of individual or collective self-defense recog nized by article 51 of the charter of the  United Nations""; and  Whereas the Punte del Este Resolution II  of the Organization of American States of  January 1962 agreed ""to urge the Member  States to take those steps that they may  consider appropriate  for  their  individual  and collective self -defense, and to cooperate,  as may  be  necessary  or  desirable,  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to  counteract  threats or acts of aggression, subversion, or  other dangers to peace and security result ing from the continued intervention in this  hemisphere of Sino-Soviet powers,  in ac cordance with the obligations established in  treaties and agreements such as the Charter  of the Organization of American States and  the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal As sistance"": Now, therefore, be it  Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America  in Congress assembled, That  the United  States is determined(a) to prevent the Communist regimes of  the Soviet Union and Cuba, acting individ ually or collectively,  from  extending by  force or threat of force their aggressive or  subversive  activities  to any part of  this  hemisphere;  (b) to prevent in Cuba the creation or use  of an externally supported military capabili ty, or the deployment in Cuba of military  forces from another nation, for the purpose  of establishing a stronger base for Commu nist expansionism in this hemisphere, thus  endangering  the  security of  the United  States and other non-Communist nations;  and  (c)  to work with  the Organization of  American States and with  freedom-loving  people of all nations to implement collective  security agreements and to support the as pirations of all people in this hemisphere  for freedom and self-determination; and be  it further  Resolved,  That  the  President  of  the  United States take every possible action to  carry out the intent of this resolution.e  ",1981

This  resolution is modeled after a similar  one I introduced in the last Congress  which was consponsored by over 70  Members and which generated hear ings before several foreign affairs sub committees. As a result of these hear ings and in consultation with both pri vate sector and governmental leaders  in all three countries, I have broad ened the scope of my original proposal  to cover a wide range of issues affect ing  the United States, Canada, and  Mexico.  This North American summit meet ing is designed to provide a forum for  discussion of key issues that have, in  the  past,  caused  strained  relations  with our border  neighbors  to  the  north and south. Potential conflicts  should also be studied at such a top level meeting. It is important to em phasize that the spirit behind this res olution is one of mutual cooperation  and benefit to all three nations. This  spirit has often been lacking in previ ous negotiations and, for this reason,  it is imperative that President Reagan  act expeditiously to improve our rela tions with Mexico and Canada, as he  has promised to do during his Presi dential campaign.  As cochairman of the House North  American Trade Caucus with Con gressman JoHN BREAux, it is our inten tion to urge greater sensitivity to the  issue of North American relationships.  The summit meeting will be an impor tant first step and strong signal to our  neighbors that we are, in fact, serious  about this proposition.

89,House,97,0.221,1134,1,Mr. REGULA.," Mr.  Speaker, we  Americans,  in  every  comer of our  great Nation, have just experienced a  marvelous week, an historic week, a  week which drew us together in love of  country and  in determination  to be  resolute in the protection of our great est blessing-freedom.  I think it is appropriate at this par ticular moment in our history, when  America is reasserting itself as a world  leader,  to recall an American leader  who stood for the values and princi ples we cherish as a people.  Tomorrow  is  the birthday of our  martyred President William McKin ley. It was during his administration  that the United States moved onto the  world scene as a great power and it  was generally recognized that isolation  was no longer desirable or even possi ble.  Our 25th President led our country  to accept its international responsibil ities and commitments. The history of  the world was greatly influenced as a  result.  If he had been present here in the  Nation's Capital yesterday, I am sure  he would have strongly endorsed the  words of our 40th President when he  warned  international  terrorists  that  our patience has a limit.  A religious man, President McKinley  found it necessary to lead us in war.  His goal, however, was peace. He said,  in one of his speeches:  Let us ever remember that our real emi nence lies in victories of peace, not those of  war.  William McKinley served the 16th  District of Ohio, which I am proud to  call my own, for 13 years and, in his  last term, was chairman of the Ways  and Means Committee. Before being  elected President  in  1896,  he  also  served 4 years as Governor of Ohio.  His favorite flower was the red car nation, Ohio's State flower. The car nations you see  today  in the House  dining room honor his memory.  CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT  TO BALANCE THE BUDGET  <Mr. HARTNETT  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1981
90,House,97,0.503,1134,1,Mr. HARTNETT.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  today I have introduced legislation to  provide  for a  constitutional amend ment  to  balance  the  budget. The  American people spoke on November 4  and  they  said  they  are  tired  of  runaway government. In order to con trol  the growing bureaucracy  there  must be  some belt  tightening. The  businesses and workers of the United  States are required to balance their  budgets, why should they not be able  to expect the same from their Govern ment. The actual 1980 budget had a  deficit of almost $74 billion. President  Carter's 1981 budget has an estimated  deficit  of  $78.4  billion.  Need we  wonder why inflation has been in the  double digits for 2 consecutive years,  only for the second time since 1917.  The budget  is  full of fat.  Joseph  Califano,  former Secretary of HEW  admitted his agency  lost billions of  dollars through fraud and waste. As  another example, OSHA has had a  constant budget increase for 5 years  while  job-related accidents have sky rocketed. This to me indicates ineffi ciency in the OSHA program not to  mention  the cost  to businesses and  consumers in paperwork.  In the past 4 years the majorities in  the House and Senate have not acted  on their own to balance the budget,  therefore, I feel it is time to listen to  the American_people.  Former  President  Carter's  1982  budget shows a deficit of $27.5 billion,  but his estimate  includes a 10-cent per-gallon gasoline tax. The American  people have spoken and I for one have  heard. The  heroes  that President  Reagan spoke of in his inaugural ad dress do not need more taxes, they do  not want more government, they want  a government that can live as they do,  within their means.  ",1981
91,House,97,0.253,1160,1,Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Speaker, we who are Members of this  body have been honored to serve with  individuals of strength and courage.  Some have been known for the distinc tion of their intellect, others for the  broad  range of  their  interests;  still  other Members of the House were re nowned for their character and integ rity.  To me, there was one Member who  combined all these noble qualities and  that was Tiger Teague. The passing of  Olin E. Teague in the early morning  hours of January 23 was a personal  loss  to me. He was chairman of the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee  when I was first elected to Congress in  1966. After being assigned to the com mittee he gave me one of those big  bear hugs of his and announced that I  was his Congressman.  He had once been a resident of the  small town of Mena in my district some of his people still lived there and he said with a smile, he was hon ored that I was here to represent him.  Our friendship began on that note,  and it flourished over the years.  Tiger left the Veterans' Affairs Com mittee  to serve as chairman of  the  House Committee  on  Science  and  Technology, or as it was then known,  the Committee on Science and Astro nautics. The future of America's space  program was  in  some doubt when  Tiger took the gavel. During the early  days of the Apollo program, there had  been numerous failures-all well publi cized-and the early enthusiasm of the  Nation was waning. But Tiger Teague  believed in the program and accepted  it as his responsibility to make Con gress see  its  importance  to  the Na tion's future. Had he not put his great  prestige and powers of persuasion to  work when he was chairman of the  Subcommittee  on Manned  Space  Flight, billions of dollars in appropri ations would have been shunted away  from this vital program and our na tional defense would  be  in deadly  peril.  But Tiger never  let his attention  drift far away from veterans and their  families. Although chairman of  the  Science Committee, he  retained  the  chairmanship of the Subcommittee on  Education, Training and Employment  of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.  He had developed the GI bill for veter ans of the Korean war. In the 82d  Congress he investigated abuses that  had crept into the administration of  the World War II GI bill. Thus, he  was better qualified than any other in dividual in this body to write a GI bill  for Vietnam veterans. The high qual ity of that legislation can be seen in  the fact that it provided a free college  education to 7.8 million Vietnam-era  veterans.  Consider, Mr. Speaker,  the  enor mous impact this great man had on  the lives of veterans. Behind his leadership, the House approved extensive  compensation  programs  for  them,  their dependents and  survivors. He  was the congressional overseer for the  construction of most of the V A's net work of 172 hospitals and 222 outpa tient clinics. I have heard it said by  VA officials that the Tiger might not  have actually set the bolts that went  into building that great health system,  but he saw to it money was available  to buy the bolts and he knew where  every one was.  As he was a veterans' veteran, so he  had been a  soldier's soldier during  World War II. He commanded an in fantry battalion and was in combat for  6 months before severe wounds drove  him to a bed at the McCloskey Army  Hospital. It was a proud moment for  Tiger when the 96th Congress redesig nated that same hospital the ""Olin E.  Teague Memorial Hospital.""  Tiger Teague represented the Sixth  District of Texas while he sat with us  in this Chamber but to many of us he  also represented the best qualities in  the  American  character.  He  was  strong and unrelenting in the pursuit  of hi,s goals, yet he was compassionate  and kind in their formulation.  He was the most decorated combat  veteran  to  sit  in Congress-that  is  true-but history will write of him as  one of  its most distinguished orna ments as well.e  e Mr. DE LA GARZA. Mr. Speaker, last  week we  lost a great Texan, and a  great  American,  Olin  E.  ""Tiger""  Teague. Tiger Teague led a long and  distinguished career in the service to  his  country,  a  highly distinguished  combat veteran of World War II, and  as a Member of Congress from 1946 to  1973. In Congress, Tiger Teague distin guished himself for his service to his  constituents in the Sixth District of  Texas and for his work on behalf of all  veterans  of  our  country's Armed  Forces.  As a member of the Veterans' Com mittee, and as chairman from 1963 to  1973, Tiger Teague oversaw and was  responsible for many of the veterans  benefits which we  take  for granted  today, the GI bill of rights which pro vided an education to untold numbers  of veterans,  the War Orphans Act,  which provided college educations for  the children of those who died in serv ice to their country, and for a medical  system to  take care of  their health  needs.  I know of no other country  which provides as much for its veter ans, and we owe much-of it to this one  man.  As much as he was concerned by the  needs of our veterans, Tiger Teague  also had other interests. In 1973, he  took over the chairmanship of the Sci ence and Astronautics Committee, a  strong believer in our Nation's space  program. While many scoffed at the  idea of spending money to send people  into space, thanks to the foresight of  men like Tiger Teague, all of us now  benefit in an untold number of ways  from the by products of the research  conducted for space exploration.  It was  a  great privilege  to have  known and been able  to work with  Tiger Teague, a great soldier and a  great statesman. Our society is richer  and our country stronger thanks  to  Olin Teague's great  dedication  to  public service.e  e Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Speaker,  the  passing of our former colleague,. Con gressman Oli,n ""Tiger"" Teague marks  the close of a long, productive and yet  a  hard  and  courageous  life. Tiger  Teague's leadership in veterans affairs  and in behalf of programs related to  the whole areas of science and tech nology establishes an enduring record  which few in this body can match.  Mr. Speaker, my close relationship  with Congressman Teague in connec tion with the interests of our veterans  demonstrated  to me  his  thorough  knowledge of the veterans' rights and  interests and enabled me  to  render  maximum  service  in behalf of  the  many veterans who are served by the  North Chicago Veterans' Administra tion facility in my congressional dis trict.  Mr. Speaker, likewise on the subject  of science and technology, and more  particularly, in my constant sponsor ship of an orderly and essentially vol unteer  conversion  to  the metric  system of weights and measures, Con gressman Teague was most coopera tive.  Mr. Speaker, I know that my wife,  Doris, had a close relationship with  Mrs. Teague and we have expressed  between ourselves our profound  re spect  for Congressman Teague and  Mrs. Teague and their family. We take  this occasion to pay tribute to Tiger  Teague's useful and distinguished life  and to extend to his widow, Freddie,  and other members of the family our  deep sympathy    e ",1981

100,,97,-0.578,1186,1,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to take this opportunity to join  my colleagues and fellow Americans  across  this great  land  in welcoming  home our 52 countrymen who were  held  hostage  in  Iran  for  over  14  months. In many respects, this Nation  during the last few days has hosted a  great  homecoming  celebration.  Pa rades, receptions, cards, gifts, and fire works exemplified our relief and hap1185  piness about the release of our countrymen.  Ironically,  it has  taken  this crisis  and the final resolution of it to bring  us together as one big family. Every  American,  regardless of  the city or  region of the country they live in, has  shared in the suffering of the hostages  and in the jubilation about their re lease in some way.  Their release was a sweet moment  for us all. Appropriately, the American  public chose  to decorate our home coming  celebration with American  flags and yellow ribbons.  Mr. Speaker, keeping  in  tradition  with great homecoming celebrations  and reunions, I think that we should  pause  to pay  tribute  to our  fellow  Americans who are no longer with us  as a result of the hostage crisis in Iran.  I am referring to the eight courageous  American soldiers who gave their lives  in an attempt to free the 52 hostages.  They not only gave their lives but also  gave us a renewed sense of patriotism  and courage.  I hope that this homecoming and re kindled patriotism signals a new begin ning for our Nation as well as for the  52 freed Americans and their families.  With that thought, Mr. Speaker, I  welcome the 52 Americans home.e  HUMAN  RIGHTS:  AMNESTY  INTERNATIONAL  REPORTS  SOVIET REPRESSIONS  HON.

Furthermore, in  order  to  silence  opponents  of  the  Soviet  regime,  courts  are  handing  down severe sentences.  Amnesty,  an  international human  rights organization and winner of the  Nobel Peace Prize, further states:  In the general repression of the last 15  months, three types of dissenter appear to  have been especially hard-hit,       mem bers of unofficial groups trying to monitor  Soviet observance of human rights agree ments reached at the 1975 Helsinki Confer ence  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe, national rights campaigners in the  non-Russian  Soviet  republics,  including  Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Estonians and Ar menians; and religious believers, particular ly Baptists, Seventh Day Adventists, Pente costalists, and Russian Orthodox believers.  It should be noted that Soviet Jews  have not been immune from this spe cial  treatment. In 1979, 54,320 Jews  were allowed to emigrate, but in 1980  that level fell to 21,470 persons.

Buffalo's Lafayette Square was  the  tribute offered  to Dr. King by  two  schoolchildren, one black,  the other  white.  Reflecting the display of racial unity  among the 5,000 persons gathered in  the  square, Derrick Houstin,  14,  a  black student at School 80, and Anna  Lynn Furst, a 17-year-old white stu dent  from  the City Honors School,  gave  their insights into the achieve ments and vision of  the slain civil  rights leader.  These students and  their  teachers  are to be commended for the inspira tional and meaningful role their com ments played in Buffalo's commemo ration this year of Dr. King's birth day.  Also to be commended are the many  public officials  and private  citizens  who helped make Buffalo's observance  a stunning success, despite the adverse  publicity associated with a new-Nazi  rally  scheduled  the same day. The  community owes particular thanks to  so many individuals and organizations  but especially to the following mem bers of the Black Leadership Forum,  who  spearheaded  the  Lafayette  Square observance:  BUFFALO, N.Y.: BLACK LEADERSHIP FORUM  Daniel Acker, NAACP.

Following are the complete texts of  the tributes offered by Derrick Hous tin of School 80 and Anna Lynn Furst  of the City Honors School respective ly:  TRIBUTE TO DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.  <By Derrick Houstin)  When we  think of Rev. Martin Luther  King, Jr. we think of those who came before  him who  symbolized his  leadership  and  spirit-Sojourner Truth, Frederick Doug lass, Abraham Lincoln, Mary McLe'Od Beth une, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and William  DuBois.  We are reminded of his contemporaries  such as Mohandas Gandhi, Andrew Young,  John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Roy  Wilkens, Whitney Young.  Today we  see his dreams of universal  brotherhood and his belief in God's wish  that each man reach his full potential being  carried on by people such as Rev.  Jesse  Jackson, Benjamin Hooks, Rev. Ralph Loew  of  the Chautaqua Institute and our own  Rev. Bennett Smith as well as many educa tors, public spirited citizens, and community  leaders. Many of these people including you  in the audience are here today.  When  I  think of Rev. Martin Luther  King, Jr. I think of the March from Selma  to Montgomery, Alabama, the March to the  Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the  moral wrongs of the VietNam War, Oper ation Bread Basket, The Southern Christian  Leadership Conference, nonviolent demon strations, the philosophy of nonviolence and  the winning of the Nobel Peace Prize.  When I as an eighth grade student think  of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. I think of  him as a man of honor, trustworthiness and  vision, a friend of mankind and a model to  look up to.  The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was  an author and educator who stood for uni versal excellence and for being responsible  as a citizenship of the world.  When we think of the achievements of Dr.  Martin Luther King we are reminded of the  quote from former President John F. Ken nedy who said, ""Ask not what your country  can do for you, ask what you can do for  your country.""  I  and my  friends at School 80  took a  pledge to excel whiqh was written by the  Rev. Jesse Jackson. This pledge exemplifies  Dr. King's philosophy of the achievement  of excellence that students must aspire to so  that they can be responsible .citizens. The  pledge to excel reads:  We will take the opportunity to learn all  that we can about life. We will help our  school and community by exercising disci pline and by becoming a positive thinker.

105,Senate,97,0.219,1264,1,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President,  the  Senator from West Virginia is correct. It  is my opinion that that was our original  intention, but the resolution was modi fied somewhrut after it had been taken  from the continuing resolution, as the  Senator from West Virginia will recall.  In the process of taking that out of the  bill and making it into resolut;on form,  it became clear. In effect, this treats all  employees alike, as I understand it, and  by doing so, pr~vents the original intent  from being expanded to open the vistas  for these larger demands.  ",1981
106,House,97,-0.397,1303,1,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. Speaker, let me say  to my colleagues in. the House that I  picked up this morning's Washington  Post and read on  the front page a  story  that  is hair-raising and  is  in credibly shortsighted. The heading is  ""Huge Cutback Proposed in Foreign  Aid.""  This OMB document, which I hope,  for the sake of this Nation and other  nations, will not become policy, calls  for,  among  two  things-and  let me  quote-a  reduction  in  aid  which  ""would mainly affect the poorer coun tries of Africa and the Asian subconti nent.""  I hope that we do not want to adopt  such a policy.  Second, it says that aid-and I quote  again-""could be concentrated on a  small number of countries of key im portance to the United States, perhaps  at the loss of influence in countries of  lesser importance.""  Now, what are countries of lesser im portance? Well, a couple of years ago  we might have said Afghanistan; a few  years prior to that we would have said  Vietnam. There is no such thing as a  country of lesser importance.  The security viewpoint of the United  States cannot be  solely and simply  that we build submarines and missiles  and things like ' that. It has to be a  much larger concept than that.  Let me just close by citing one in stance. What is the chance, I ask my  colleagues, that the Soviets will send  their tanks through central Europe?  Well, it is a fraction of 1 percent, but  we cannot take a chance on it and so  we devote approximately one-fourth  of our defense budget to that fraction  of 1 percent possibility.  But what is the chance that the So viets will  take advantage of hunger,  desperation, and chaos in a developing  nation? The chance, let me say to my  friends, is 99 percent, and we are talk ing about cutting back in that area.  Mr. Speaker, I  just think that it is  an incredible policy  if it is followed,  and I hope the policy will be reversed.  ANOTHER AMERICAN REMAINS  HOSTAGE IN IRAN  <Mr. WAXMAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1981
107,House,97,-0.473,1303,1,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, on this  day of national thanksgiving for the  safe return of our 53  fellow citizens  from Iran, I must bring to the atten tion of the Nation the continued cap tivity in Tehran of Mohi Sobhani, a  naturalized American citizen.  Mr. Sobhani was  arrested at  the  Tehran airport last September 6, as he  and his family were about to leave the  country  for  the United States. The  revolutionary  authorities  gave  no  reason at that time for his detention.  But Mr.  Sobhani  is  a Baha'i-a  member of a religious faith that has  been marked for persecution by the  Ayatollah Khomeini. Already  seven  Bahai's have been executed during the  course of the revolution.  The  arrest  of Mr.  Sobhani was  broadcast on  Iranian  television and  radio. People were invited to inform  the  authorities  of  any  allegations  against him.  Iranians came and de nounced him as a Baha'i. Others ac cused him, since he is a naturalized  American citizen, of being an Ameri can  agent-a  spy  for  the  ""great  Satan.""  Mohi Sobhani has never had a trial.  He has no means to defend himself or  prove his  innocence. His oniy crime  appears to be that he is a member of a  religious minority.  Mr. Sobhani's sister, brother, and  son live in Los Angeles as did Mr. Sob bani. They are terribly afraid for his  life. After my own  inquiries on his  behalf, I have every reason to believe  Mr. Sobhani is in the gravest personal  danger.  I have appealed to the State Depart ment, and through them to the Swiss  Embassy, which represents our interests in Iran, to ascertain the precise  status of Mr. Sobhani, and to appeal  for his freedom.  Mohi Sobhani is an American citi zen. In this moment of rejoicing over  the freedom for the 53, we must not  forget the fate of an American who re mains in captivity. Mr. Sobhani must  be freed as well.  I appeal  to all  to  assist him.  INTRODUCTION  OF  GOVERN MENT  CONTRACTORS'  PROD UCT LIABILITY ACT OF 1981  <Mr. McCLORY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  Mr. McCLORY. Mr. Speaker, in 1977  the Supreme Court issued its decision  in the case of Stencel Aero Engineer ing Company v. United States,  431  U.S. 666. The rationale espoused by  the Court in that case underlines the  unfair, counterproductive, and inequi table situation faced by Government  contractors. The Stencel case stands  for the principle that a Government  contractor cannot obtain indemnifica tion  from  the Federal Government,  when the contractor is held liable for  money damages to a service man for  injuries caused by a defective design.  This is so even if the Federal Govern ment is responsible for and mandates  the design of the defective product in  question.  The problems presented by federally  mandated design specifications have  also  recently  received  considerable  press attention in connection with the  so-called Flxible bus. Both the Grum man Corp. and General Motors manu factured these buses according to the  exact requirements of the Department  of Transportation's White Book. DOT,  through its Urban Mass Transporta tion Administration, imposed this new  bus design on both the manufacturers  and  their municipal customers as a  prerequisite for receiving urban mass  transit funds. The DOT design specifi cations have been an admitted failure,  with  the resulting buses being both  unsafe and uncomfortable. Grumman  recently  notified  27  municipalities  about a newly discovered problem that  could cause drivers to lose control of  the buses. But while the design defects  are directly the fault of Federal bu reaucrats, Grumman would solely be  liable  for  any  resulting  injuries or  damage.  Today, I am introducing legislation the ""Government Contractors' Prod uct Liability Act of 1981""-which aims  at rectifying this situation. Under the  terms of this measure, a manufactur er-supplier could seek indemnification  from  the Federal Government  for  losses incurred unless the court deter mines that the contractor was guilty  of willful negligence or that the injury  ",1981

109,,97,0.246,1381,1,Mr. FINDLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  President wisely decided this week to  end controls on U.S. oil production  and marketing.  Recently the Wall Street Journal in cluded a piece by a former energy reg ulator who presented quite well the ar gument against continuing those con trols. His comments follow:  [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 5, 1981]  CONFESSIONS OF AN ENERGY REGULATOR  <By Thomas L. Jackson>  In the spring of 1979 every telephone in  my office in Washington rang off its hook.  The Shah had been toppled and Iran's oil  production was drying up. Gasoline station  owners from all over the U.S. were calling  me demanding more gasoline.  I didn't own a drop of the stuff myself. I  didn't even own a car. I was a lawyer just a  year out of school, but I had been given the  power to order Exxon and other refiners to  supply gasoline.  I was part of an ""allocation task force""  within the Department of Energy's Office  of Hearings and Appeals. We were a sort of  regulatory emergency room where patients  suffering from an overdose of competition  came for help.  My power  flowed  from a  law Congress  passed in 1973  in the panic following  the  Arab oil embargo and OPEC's first quadru pling of crude oil prices. The  law holds  down  gasoline  prices  to  artificially  low  levels.  It also  gives  station owners  and  wholesalers a legal right to continue getting  gasoline  in  times of  shortage  from  the  people who had supplied it to them earlier.  A YEAR TO RUN  The gasoline price controls aren't sched uled to be phased out fully until the end of  1981,  though some of President-elect Rea gan's people would  like  to  remove  them  sooner. The allocation madness could recur  any time gasoline supplies run short.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  I  discovered  that  the  allocation  rules  didn't always work  the way  the  station  owners wanted. When they felt the Energy  Department was unjustly depriving them of  Exxon's gasoline, they could appeal to my  office. And appeal they did.  Nearly 14,000 applications for special ex ception were  filed  between March  and  August 1979. Some came with aerial photo graphs,  tri-color maps with  circles  and  arrows drawn in or letters from the Cham ber of Commerce,  the  local bank or  the  family doctor. Everybody had a reason why  his station should get more gasoline to sell.  In my office, people who had processed  perhaps 25 cases a year were soon faced  with backlogs of 200. Morale plummeted.  I had reservations about writing decisions  that encouraged gasoline guzzling. After all,  the Iranian gasoline ""crisis"" wouldn't have  happened  had motorists  conserved  fuel  before the way they did later. And all this  map marking, letter-writing and paper-shuf fling was consuming thousands of hours of  labor by station owners, oil-company  law yers and government officials like me-with out producing  a whiff  of  gasoline. We  simply spread around the shortage-and the  profits-and kept open a lot of stations that  might have been put to better use as, say,  bus stations or bicycle shops. Despite reser vations, I surrendered to my duty.  It was thankless work. The average appli cant seemed to expect the government to in tervene in the economy like God in history  to ensure that his business outdistanced in flation, competition and world events.  I recall one who had expanded his station  in Rancho Cucamonga,  in  freeway-happy  Southern California, and he wanted more  gasoline. He argued that the public interest  would be served because ""the community""  was growing rapidly. I felt that the Los An geles area was sprawling more than growing,  and as a direct result of too much cheap  gasoline. But neither my feelings nor his  about ""growth"" mattered legally. The de partment granted special relief only to the  down and out, and the financial filings of  the gentleman  from Rancho Cucamonga  showed he wasn't doing so badly. Relief  denied.  Many  applicants  had  difficulty  under standing that they had to prove they de served more  gasoline.  A woman  from  Tampa, Fla., upset at being told her facts  didn't support her case, confided that deal ing with a ""snippy"" bureaucrat like me had  been so disconcerting that she and her hus band found it necessary to take a short va cation. In the Bahamas. Other applicants  just resorted to foul language.  The major oil companies, whose gasoline  we were handing out, were understandably  reluctant to part with the stuff. Mobil Oil  Corp. in particular could be counted on to  contest every request for its fuel, no matter  how small the amount. The company rou tinely  ignored  our  regulations  requiring  compliance with orders transmitted by tele phone, holding onto  its gasoline until we  sent orders in writing, by facsimile, at con siderable expense to the taxpayer.  The big companies sometimes seemed as  inefficient as my government agency. One  Gulf official on the East Coast tried to com plain to me about all the gasoline the gov ernment was handing out, unaware that in  California another Gulf official was ignor ing our orders  to  stop  supplying  extra  amounts to favored stations.  Exxon was so unprepared  for  the 1979  shortage that for a while I  found myself  acting  as  a  go-between  for  independent  January 30, 1981  wholesalers in North Carolina who couldn't  get  the  company's  regional  officials  to  comply with our regulations. Exxon's brass  later made sure the regional officials under stood what the law required.  The impossible backlog of allocation cases  at the DOE forced some bending of due  process. We developed a couple of shortcuts  for weeding out applicants who we thought  could look after themselves.  Sometimes we would call to ""explain the  standards"" for relief, a strong hint to dubi ous applicants that they were wasting their  time. Those who persisted were sometimes  lumped with others  into  a  single mass  denial, which saved us the trouble of writing  individual  opinions. Unfortunately, many  just resubmitted the same weak applications  and got their Congressman or Senator to be devil us. Elected representatives are a con stant nuisance in this sort of bureaucratic  government.  Applicants always found our red tape frus trating. One small wholesaler from Arkan sas, after a year of waiting, insisted that his  case be dropped even after I strongly hinted  that he would prevail if he'd just stick it  out.  Another man,  from  Illinois, became fu rious after only a few months of inaction.  One morning he arrived unannounced  in  Washington  demanding  to  see me  and  threatening to call the news media. Riding  the elevator down to meet him, I happened  to hear that there was ""someone  in  the  lobby with a reporter."" I scrambled off at  the second floor and rode back up to my  office at the eighth. The man from Illinois  later got the fuel he wanted, but no thanks  to his badgering.  Like most regulatory schemes designed for  mass application, the Energy Department's  rules often inflicted a dumb sort of cruelty  on those who didn't fit the mold. I remem ber particularly a young man from Green  Bay, Wis., who had lost the ability to speak  when his brain was damaged in an auto mobile accident. Undaunted, he had bought  a gasoline station and found that pumping  gas and servicing cars had been so therapeu tic that he had begun to regain his speech.  He needed more gas  to stay  in business.  Could I please help him?  BRIGHT MEMORY  He was in trouble because the gasoline al location  depended  on  the  amount  sold  during a previous ""base period."" But the  regulations didn't allow for businesses that  were just starting and therefore had unusu ally  low base-period sales. The man from  Green Bay was saved by a last-minute regu latory amendment that cured this problem.  Telephoning him with that news is among  the happiest memories of my life as a bu reaucrat.  Others weren't so fortunate. Some were  buried in the avalanche of paper work and  went out of business before we could help.  I quit the government last summer, but  the allocation cases will grind on until gaso line price controls wind down next October.  Some businesses may go under. Motorists,  however, will have more incentive  to con serve, and so the public won't need so many  gas pumps. A lot of station owners, pump  jockeys, bureaucrats and oil:company  law yers will be free to pursue more useful work.

Get hold of the entire article, but  here is a preview:  Western Europe is the great sacred cow of  American foreign policy. We haggle endless ly over whether West Germany should up  its contribution to Western defense spend ing by two percent instead of three, but we  almost never stop to ask the larger question:  When was the last time the foreign policy  establishment took a fresh look at whether  it still makes sense even  to have a  joint  Western defense or a NATO umbrella? Or  whether it was really in America's best in terest to continue spending upwards of $81  billion a year to keep NATO in business? Or  whether the strategic interests of West Ger many and those of the United States are  still virtually one and  the same?  In  the  world  of  foreign  policy,  these  are  all  ""givens""-accepted as truth by just about  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  everyone.  But  they  shouldn't  be;  the  postwar world whence they came is now so  far in the past that these beliefs are precise ly the ones that need to be called into ques tion. That isn't happening largely because  the people who are in a position to question  the dogma are the very ones so tied to it.  These people include not only the diplomats  who live and work in Europe, but the jour nalists who write from there, the military  brass who operate from there, and even the  congressmen who junket there.e  VVILLIAM K.

JOHN EDWARD PORTER  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 2, 1981   ",1981
112,,97,0.217,1407,1,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, former  Secretary  of State Ed Muskie,  on  Thursday, January 29, in an interview  with VVashington  Post  editors,  re vealed convincing evidence that arms  to leftist guerrillas fighting in El Sal vador are combng from Nicaragua. Mr.  Speaker,  if  this  is  true,  then  the  United States should suspend further  assistance to Nicaragua at once. I have  addressed this day a  letter to Presi-.  dent Reagan spelling out this abuse of  neutrality by the Nicaraguan Govern ment and urging the President's stipu lation to an immediate American aid  embargo. I have also written Secretary  of State Haig requesting his support  for  an  immediate Nicaraguan  aid  cutoff.  Mr. Speaker, on February 27, 1980,  at the time when this House voted for  foreign aid to the leftist Sandanista  government in Nicaragua, some of us  warned  that American generosity  in  this bnstance would be abused. But  that vote carried over our objections  by the thin margbn of 202 to 197. Con gress at that time did write into the  legislation  the  proviso  that  should  Nicaraguan aid be misused to aid left ists in Central America, there would  be an immediate American aid cutoff.  VVe now have that clear evidence of  Nicaraguan abuse of American aid as sistance. Arms and supplies used in El  Salvador's bloody leftist assaults are  flowing  through Nicaragua. And  to  quote former Secretary Muskie, ""cer tainly with the knowledge and to some  extent  the help"" of Nicaraguan au thorities.  Mr. Speaker, I call upon the admin istration and the Congress jointly to  urge an immediate halt to American  assistance  to the Sandanista govern ment in Nicaragua. Nicaraguan neu trality is a fiction favoring a Cuban and Soviet-backed  takeover by anti democratic forces in El Salvador and  in Central America.e  ",1981

114,House,97,-0.225,6,8,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker,  most children of  famous people  try  hard to disassociate themselves from  their parents and prove that they are  individuals  of worth  in  their  own  right. Not Michael Reagan. To him,  daddy's fame and power is his bank roll. So,  scarcely 100 days  into  the  Reagan administration, we come face  to face with Michaelgate.  Michael Reagan, evidently not one  to let a good business proposition pass  him by, sent 8 or 10 letters to defense  installations on behalf of Dana Ingalls  Profile, a firm of which he is not even  an employee. Claiming  to be a  vice  president of the company, Reagan vio lates generally held ethical standards,  to say nothing of English grammar, by  writing:  I know that, with my father's leadership  at the White House, this country's Armed  Services  are  going  to  be  rebuilt  and  strengthened.  William Safire, where are you when  we need you?  While  this  episode  entertains me  more than enrages me, it does shine a  ray of light on the fetid world of gov ernment contracting out and procure ment. The budget of Reagan here calls  for massive increases in the contract ing out of Government functions and  in the procurement of military goods  from the private sector. While regula tions call for good business practice in  negotiating contracts and competitive  bidding for them, the day-to-day reality is one of sole source contracting,  self-dealing, and giving work to friends  and political allies. We must start po licing the glut of new contracts being  let by this administration.  As one parent to another, my advice  to the President is to scold Michael for  his  embarrassing  behavior  and  to  forbid him  from watching any  late  night movies for the whole month.  GEN.

For we  have defiled our intellect by the creation of  such scientific  instruments of destruction  that we are now in desperate danger of de stroying ourselves ....  This  is  the  real and-indeed-the most  strenuous  challenge  to man's  intellect  today. By comparison with it, the conquest  of space is of small significance. For until  we learn how to live together, until we rid  ourselves of the strife that mocks our pre tensions of civilization, our adventures  in  science-instead of producing human prog ress-will continue to crowd it with greater  peril.  General Bradley said:  If I am sometimes discouraged, it is not by  the magnitude of the problem, but by our  colossal indifference to it.  Mr.  Speaker,  General  Bradley's  speech,  as  it appeared  in  the New  York Times of Friday, April 10, 1981,  is as follows:  THIS ULTIMATE THREAT  <By Omar N. Bradley)  <Following are excerpts from a talk that  General of the Army Omar N. Bradley, who  died Wednesday at 88, gave at a convocation  at St. Alban's School,  in Washington, on  Nov. 5, 1957. It is reprinted from the Nov.  18, 1957, issue of I. F. Stone's Weekly.)  The central problem of our  time-as  I  view  it-is how  to employ human  intelli gence for the salvation of mankind. It is a  problem we have put upon ourselves. For we  have defiled our intellect by the creation of  such scientific  instruments of destruction  that we are now in desperate danger of de stroying ourselves. Our plight is critical and  with each effort we have made to relieve it  by further scientific advance, we have suc ceeded only in aggravating our peril.  As a result, we are now speeding inexora bly toward a day when even the ingenuity  of our scientists may be unable to save us  from the consequences of a single rash act  or a lone reckless hand upon the switch of  an uninterceptible missile. For 12 years,  we've sought  to  stave off  this ultimate  threat of disaster by devising arms which  would be both ultimate and disastrous.  This irony can probably be compounded a  few more years, or perhaps even a few dec ades. Missiles will bring anti-missiles, and  anti-missiles will  bring  anti-anti-missiles.  But inevitably, this whole electronic house  of cards will reach a point where it can be  constructed no higher.  At that point we shall have come to the  peak of this whole incredible dilemma into  which the world is shoving itself. And when  that time comes, there will be little we can  do other  than  to  settle  down  uneasily,  smother our fears, and attempt to live in a  thickening shadow of death.  Should  this situation come  to pass, we  would have but one single and thin thread  to cling to. We call it rationale or reason.  We reason that no government, no single  group of men-indeed, not even one willful  individual-would be so foolhardy, so reck less, as  to precipitate a war which would  most surely end in mutual destruction.  This reasoning may have the benefit of  logic. But even logic sometimes goes awry.  How can we assume that reason will prevail  in a crisis when there is ordinarily so little  reason among men? To  those who would  take comfort in the likelihood of an atomic  peace to be secured solely by rationale and  reason, I would recall the lapse of reason in  a bunker under the Reich Chancellery in  Berlin. It failed before, it can fail again.  Have we  already gone  too  far  in  this  search for peace through the accumulation  of peril?  Is  there any way  to halt  this  trend-or must we push on with new devices  until we inevitably come to judgment before  the atom? I believe there is a way out. And I  believe it because I have acquired in my life time a decent  respect  for human  intelli gence.  It may be that the problems of accommo dation in a world split by rival indeologies  are more difficult than those with which we  have struggled in the construction of ballis tic missiles. But I believe,  too, that if we  apply to these human problems the energy,  creativity, and the perseverance we have de voted to science, even problems of accommo dation will yield to reason. Admittedly, the  problem of peaceful accommodation in the  world is  infinitely more difficult than the  conquest of space, infinitely more complex  than a trip to the moon. But if we will only  come  to  the  realization  that  it must be  worked out-whatever it may mean even to  such sacred traditions as absolute national  sovereignty-I believe that we can somehow,  somewhere, and perhaps through some as  yet undiscovered world thinker and leader  find a workable solution.  I confess that this is as much an article of  faith as it is an expression of reason. But  this is what we need, faith in our ability to  do what must be done. Without that faith  we shall never get started. And until we get  started, we shall never know what can be  done.  If I am sometimes discouraged, it is not by  the magnitude of the problem, but by our  colossal  indifference to it. I am unable to  understand why-if we are willing to trust  in reason as a  restraint on  the use of a  ready-made ready-to-fire bomb-we do not  make greater, more diligent and more imagi native use of reason and human intelligence  in seeking an accord and compromise which  will make it possible for mankind to control  the atom and banish it as an instrument of  war.

116,House,97,-0.398,19,8,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker, 33  years ago, at midnight, May 14-15,  1948, the fifth and sixth days of Iyar,  5708, under the Jewish calendar, the  people  of  Israel  declared  their  independence and the British mandate  for Palestine came  to an end.  I am  proud to join in commemorating this  event of stirring significance and inspi ration in mankind's continuing strug gle for freedom and dignity.  Throughout  the Middle Ages,  in  most of the countries of the world, the  Jews were severely restricted in their  civil and religious liberties, as well as  being subjected  to periodic physical  harassment or outright persecution by  fire and sword. This sad history culmi nated in the 20th century holocaust  with the unspeakable horror at Ausch witz and Buchenwald.  Seen  in  this context of  tears and  tragedy,  the  establishment  of  the  State of Israel is, therefore, a momen tous  turning point in the history of  the Jewish people. The nation was  carved out of bedrock, desert, and ma larial swamp at great sacrifice and, in  addition, was  surrounded by hostile  neighbors. Yet the courage and tough  determination forged during their cen turies of exile enabled the Jews to face  these problems with vigor and enthu siasm.  Almost  immediately  after  Israel  became  independent,  President  Truman extended U.S. diplomatic rec ognition to the new nation. Unf ortu nately, however,  true peace has not  yet been realized. For 2 years after  proclaiming  its  independence,  Israel  had to fight for its existence, and ten sion still remains high.  In addition to the current tension re lating  to Syrian aggression  in Leba non, Israel must now contend with the  nine nations of the European Econom ic Community which last year began  their own efforts  to  intrude  them selves into the ongoing Mideast peace  negotiations, now known as the Camp  David peace process.  These  continuing  intrusions  can  only further confuse an already diffi cult diplomatic situation in the Mid east, and further divide  the United  States and its Western European allies  at a  time when unity is essential to  bring a halt to Soviet aggression, not  only in the Middle East, but elsewhere  in the world.  The Camp David agreement signed  by  the United States,  Israel,  and  Egypt establishes a framework for on going peace negotiations, and under scores the delicate nature of the rela tionships among the countries of that  area of the world. Not only must a  peace settlement deal with  issues of  major importance to the Middle East ern parties themselves, it must also ad dress the need to assist the entire area  in protecting itself from Soviet Com munist aggression and encouragement  of violent extremists.  The  attainment  of  a  permanent  peace in the Middle East is a difficult  task indeed, and I urge the European  Economic Community to act more sup-  portively in order to insure that the  peace process  that was  adopted at  Camp David be allowed to work. It is  my hope that the members of the Eu ropean  Economic  Community  will  carefully scrutinize  their statements  and their actions so as not to create  the impression that they are thwart ing  the efforts of  the Camp David  peace process. It concerns me deeply  that the European Economic Commu nity has recommended that the PLO  be given an official part in the negoti ations. This attitude on the part of the  European Economic Community is de terring progress in the peace process. I  fervently hope that the European Eco nomic Community will  take a more  constructive and productive attitude  toward the peace process without un dermining  the progress  that has al ready been made.  President Truman's policy  toward  Israel was based on the desire, he later  wrote, to find a peaceful solution in a  world  trouble spot,  to see promises  kept, to relieve human misery, and to  open the door for the development of  the productive potential of the Middle  East. Today, as a nation of about 3  million people,  Israel can  rightfully  boast of its astounding record of eco nomic, political, and social accomplish ments in spite of the continuing prob lems of heavy armament expenses.  To the citizens of Israel and their  friends in this and every other nation,  I join my colleagues in the Congress in  a tribute during this celebration of the  founding of Israel as a modern nation.  May the State of Israel continue to be  a source of encouragement and inspi ration for all peoples of the world.e  A BROKEN PROMISE  ",1981
117,House,97,-0.318,19,8,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I have  with me today an example of one of  the  cruelest  hoaxes  perpetrated  against  the  senior  citizens  of  this  country.  Let me read a little for you. This is  the front page of the Republican Na tional Committee's Senior Republi cans newsletter  for April-May 1981.  The headline across  the  top of  the  page reads ""President Reagan Keeps  Promise, Retirement Benefits Go Un touched."" The article goes on to say  that the plan for budget reform pre sented by President Reagan not only  maintains social programs  important  to  senior  citizens  at  their present  levels, but provides for an increase in  spending for  these services over the  next 4 years.  It also says  that suffering on the  part of the needy is by no means a  part of the new President's plan and  that  the  overwhelming  evidence  is  that there is plenty of room to cut the  budget without unjustly hurting the  poor and the elderly.  I scarcely need to explain why this is  such a cruel hoax.  Not more  than a  few weeks after  this  newsletter  reached  seniors'  homes, the President proposed drastic  cuts in social security.  ",1981
118,Senate,97,0.467,71,8,Mr. DENTON.," Mr. President, I  thank  the Senator from New Mexico.  rise on the same subject, Mr. Presi dent,  an  amendment which  also  cosponsored.  Mr. President, the authorization bill  which is now before this Senate goes a  long way in redressing the neglect which  our defense policy has endured for much  of  the past decade. The conscientious,  bipartisan effort which is manifested in  this measure serves notice to our allies  and potential adversaries alike that we  are serious about our security and com mitments.  As I have stated before in this Cham ber, the one indispensable service which  a government must provide for its citi zens is national security: the capacity to  defend effectively the Nation and its way  of life. The stark reality which we are  compelled to address is that our national  security is no longer assured. There is  a growing defense imbalance between the  United States and the Soviet Union, both  strategically  and  conventionally. The  quantit~tive military advantage which  we once maintained has vanished, and  even the qualitative strategic superiority  which has served as a basis for deterrence  is being eroded at an alarming rate.  It is for this reason that I have co sponsored the amendment offered by my  estemed colleagues  from Nevada  and  New Mexico, which would greatly en hance our strategic early warning and  attack assessment capability. The $31.2  million authorization contained in this  proposal establishes a program to develop  a survivable optical forward acquisition  system <SOFAS), which would provide  vital, timely information to the President  regarding the strategic nature and scope  of a nuclear attack.  Recent  technical  progress  in  the  Army's ballistic missile defense program  has made it possible to develop and de ploy SOFAS as an augmentation to the  Nation's  tactical warning and  atta.ck  assessment capability. The SOFAS is a  rocket boosted survivable optical forward  acquisit:on sensor capable of high qual ity ballistic missile attack assessment of  a U.S.S.R. attack on U.S.  land-based  strategic offensive  forces. The SOFAS  vehicles become operational quickly after  activation and are virtually invulnerable  to attack.  Building on  the forward acquisition  system <FAS), as well as other related  technology in the BMD program, SOFAS  could be confidently and expeditiously  developed  for  the vital early warning  mission. SOFAS is less technically and  economically demanding than the BMD  mission, and could there! ore be fulfilled  at less risk, and at an earlier date. In  addition, provisions can be made  for  SOFAS  to grow into a BMD role at a  later date.  Given the relatively low startup cost,  $31.2 million, along with the increased  warning time which this program would  provide, the deterrence credibility of our  launch-under-attack  response  option  can be greatly enhanced  in a  fiscally  controlled manner.  In conclusion, this proposal is a well founded  complement  to  the  strategic  portion of the fiscal year 1982 authori zation, and I respectfully urge my col leagues on both sides of  the aisle  to  join me in moving for its adoption.  Mr. TOWER addressed the Chair.  ",1981

125,Senate,97,0.304,188,8,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, Edwin  Feulner,  president  of  the Heritage  Foundation, has written a  perceptive  piece on the imperial tendencies of Colo nel Qaddafi. He points  to  the efforts  which Qaddafi has made over the years  to found a Mediterranean empire cen tered in Libya. He notes, too, the danger  which lies down the course which Colonel  Qaddafi is following.  It would be comforting to think that  Colonel Qaddafi himself is aware of the  dangers of his actions. However, Qad dafi's past adventures have given no indi cation that this will occur. For this rea son,  I  commend  to all colleagues Mr.  Feulner's article ""Further Adventures of  an Imperialist"" and ask that it be printed  in the RECORD.  The article follows:  11  FuRTHER ADVENTURES OF AN  IMPERIALIST  (By Edwin J. Feulner, Jr.)  The world has a new imperialist power:  Llbyia..  The expansionist dreams of  the Libyan  head of state have never been a secret. Dur ing  the past  years Colonel Muammar  Qaddafi has made several attempts to in corporate Syria, Egypt, Tunisia and Malta  into a new Mediterranean empire. Fortune  has not smiled on his efforts and his various  approaches have been repulsed with ease.  However, after years of frustration,  the  Colonel finally has a success on his hands.  He has taken advantage of a civll war within  Chad to invade that country, install his own  puppet ruler and station 6,000-7,000 Libyan  troops there, and proclaim the incorporation  of Chad into a new Islamic Saharan Republic.  The distribution of benefits within this new  empire wlll not  of  course, be  equitable.  Llbyia. has already annexed the mineral-rich  Azou Strip and similar confiscations wlll  follow.  The invasion has frightened a dozen neigh boring countries in northern Africa, but the  leading western powers did not evince major  concern over these developments. Carter Ad ministration advisor Zblgnlew Brzezinski de clared that ""this was not a first-line Ameri can problem."" French President Valery Gls card d'Estaing made growling noises  from  Paris and strengthened the French mllltary  presence in North Africa, but the Libyans  were allowed to retain their hold on Chad.  Such indifference may prove to be regretta ble, for the Ohadla.n borders do not define the  limits of Qaddafi's horizon.  Within the next few months Qaddafi, who  has built up a $12 billion stockpile o! Soviet  arms, wlll probably make a direct or an in direct attack upon Sudanese sovereignty. He  w~ll be drawn into Sudan, a country friendly  to the U.S., both by his own imperial ambi tions and by a variety of circumstantial fac tors beyond his control.  Qaddafi appears fully intent on continu ing his drive toward a Libyan empire. How ever, when he contemplates the direction of  that drive, he ls faced with a Hobson's choice.  His neighbors, Egypt and Tunisia, have al ready spurned his advances. Should he de cide to move southward from Chad, he will  encounter  the French mlllta.ry garrison in  the Central African Republic. Libyan troops,  which were badly mauled by the Tanzanian  army, cannot be expected to stand the test  of the French Foreign Legion.  Similarly, should Colonel Qaddafi set his  sights westward, he wlll be  trespassing  in  a  zone of French  influence. France main tains more than two thousand soldiers with  air support in Gambia, Gabon, Senegal and  the Ivory Coast. These troops could be rein forced and resupplied swiftly, as was clearly  demonstrated during  the French raid into  Zaire.  Consequently, Libyan aspirations are al most forcibly  turned eastward from Chad.  Local circumstances reinforce this tendency.  HLssene Habre, Qaddafi's chief mllltary op ponent in Chad, has withdrawn his forces  into the eastern part of Chad, close to the  Sudanese border. These forces will, presum ably, flee over that border when attacked by  the Libyan artlllery and  tanks which are  presently poised at Abeche, within 80 miles  of Sudan. Will Qaddafi resist the opportunity  to pursue his  fleeing enemies, particularly  since they draw him along the only course  which he can concewably follow?  The internal Sudanese situation wlll likely  serve only to fortify Qaddafi's resolve. Unlike  his West African colleagues, President Nu meirl does not enjoy a  close  relationship  with France. His grip on the country ls weak.  (The president was almost overthrown by  a Libyan-backed coup  in 1976.) Moreover,  the situation in Defiir, tha.t part of western  Sudan which abuts Chad, ls enough to tempt  any potential aggressor. Defur ls  impover ished,  isolated  and discontented. Protests  against the Khartoum government are com monplace, and earlier this year the provin cial capital, El Fa.sher, was the scene of major  riots which were finally quelled by regular  troops.  What would be an appropriate response to  a Libyan invasion of Sudan? It would cer tainly be a mistake to adopt Mr. Brzezinski's  position and to trust in Giscard d'Estaing.  As already noted, French interests are not  closely involved in Sudan. Libya ls a major  oil producer and, as such, should be able  to pressure the French government into ac quiescence. Moreover, the exploits of French  troops in Africa have not usually been well  received in the French national press and, 1n  this heated election year, d'Estaing wlll likely  keep a closer eye on the opinion polls and  on Socialist challenger Francois Mltterand  than on the North African situation. With  the elections  (April 26 and May 10)  just  ahead, this would seem the most opportune  time !or Qaddafi's move.  On the other he.nd, Egyptian President An W&r Sadat appears eager  to assist his Su danese neLghbors. Sadat will not wish  to  countenance Libyan troops on both his west ern and southern borders when he enters  the next round o! Middle East peace nego tiations. Moreover,  a. Li'byan defeat at the  bands of the Egyptian army could discredit  the  radical Ara.b  coalition which ha.s op posed Sadat's peace inltia.tlves. It might also  serve ito make more moderate Arab nations  change their political course.  The U.S. is in a particularly dimcult po& tion, caught between  its much-publicized  determination to fight global terrorism and  the fact that Libya ls the third largest sup plier of oil to the U.S. In addition, about  2,000 Americans, many of  them connected  with U.S. oil companies,  live in Libya.

126,House,97,-0.004,201,8,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  I  support H.R. 1526,  the Federal Managers Accountability  Act, which seeks  to amend  the Ac counting and Auditing Act of 1950 by  requiring ongoing evaluations and re ports on the systems of internal con trol used by each executive agency. It  is a good product, one that reflects the  continuing interest of the Government  Operations Committee in financial ac countability, effective audit followup,  and other basic ingredients of sound  financial management and good gov ernment.  The bill has active support among  accountants, auditors, professional as sociations, and the General Account ing Office, each of whom testified in  our hearing that the absence of strong  internal systems of control frequently  translates into waste, fraud, and mis management of Federal programs and  activities. By having in place a system  to evaluate and report on the eff ec tiveness of  internal control systems,  top agency management officials will  be better able to spot weaknesses in  the system and to devise and schedule  plans to strengthen any weaknesses.  H.R. 1526 would require the estab lishment of  internal accounting and  administrative controls at each execu tive agency in accordance with stand ards prescribed by  the Comptroller  General. These controls would provide  assurances  that  all  obligations  and  costs are in compliance with the law;  that all  funds, property, and other  assets are protected against waste and  mismanagement; and that all transac tions are properly recorded. Standards  would also be prescribed by the Comp troller General to insure the prompt  resolution of all audit findings.  Once the standards have been pre scribed by  the Comptroller General,  the Office of Management and Budget  would be required to establish guide lines for the evaluation by agencies of  their internal control systems. By De cember 31 of each year the head of  each executive agency would be  re quired to prepare a statement certify ing that the agency's control system  either is in compliance with the stand ards or is not in compliance. If the  system is not in compliance, weakness es must be identified and a plan and  schedule  for correcting  those weak nesses must be described in detail. The  statements would be signed and trans mitted  to  the President and  to  the  Congress.  There are safeguards in the bill to  protect against submission of false or  misleading information in connection  with  the evaluation of an agency's  control system. There are also safe guards to protect against public disclosure of sensitive or classified informa tion.  Finally, the bill would require addi tional efforts on the part of the Presi dent and of the agency heads in prepa ration of annual budget documents.  The President would be required  to  submit with annual budget  informa tion a simple statement on both the  original amount of appropriations re quested by the Inspector General of  each agency, and any changes OMB  made in those requests. The head of  each  agency would be  required  to  submit with  any  appropriations  re quest a report on the status and prog ress that agency has made in having  its accounting system approved by the  Comptroller General as  required by  the Accounting and Auditing Act of  1950.  I should point out, Mr. Speaker, that  we were very careful in giving to the  Comptroller General the authority to  prescribe standards on which internal  accounting  and  administrative  con trols will be established and to OMB  the authority to establish the guide lines for agencies to use in their evalu ations of internal control systems. We  agreed at the subcommittee and at the  full committee that such a balance is  necessary and is  in keeping with the  missions of both GAO and OMB.  As  far as  the reporting process  is  concerned, I pointed out at the hear ing that I would be reluctant to re quire  yet  another  congressionally  mandated report unless that report re sults in either a long-term increase in  administrative  efficiency or  a  longterm decline of Federal paperwork. I  am satisfied that H.R. 1526 will pro vide the bureaucracy with the kind of  impetus  that could meet either or  both of those criteria.  For those and other reasons, I sup port H.R. 1526, Mr. Speaker, and urge  its prompt approval here today.  D 1215  ",1981

131,,97,-0.384,383,8,Ms. FERRARO.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to take this opportunity to  offer my congratulations on the 50th  anniversary of Grover Cleveland High  School.  Education  is  the  foundation upon  which a society is built. Quality educa tion is the foundation upon which a  great society is built. For half a cen tury Grover Cleveland High School  has been educating the young people  of the Ridgewood community. Grover  Cleveland offers students the opportu nity to excel  in the academic, voca tional, and athletic areas.  Grover  Cleveland  High  School  opened in September 1931, under the  leadership of Dr. Charles A. Tonsor.  Dr. Tonsor maintained extensive ties  with the community during his entire  tenure. In June 1955, Dr. Tonsor re tired and was followed by Mr. Edward  Kramer. Mr. Kramer continued  the  traditions of Dr. Tonsor until 1966.  The next principal was Dr. Philip L.  Groisser who left the school in 1971.  Dr. Groisser is presently the superin tendent of high schools for Brooklyn.  Since 1971 the principal has been Mr.  Myron L. Liebrader.  The school has continued to meet  the needs of the young in the commu nity. The educational programs have  changed with the times to meet the  demand and needs of the business and  academic worlds. The commitment to  the community continues. The  stu dents of Grover Cleveland are exten sively involved in volunteer work with  the Ridgewood-Bushwick Senior CitiARMED FORCES DAY 1981  HON.

132,,97,0.178,383,8,Mr. EVANS of Delaware.," Mr. Speak er, at this time when Congress is pre pared to make a new commitment to  our national defense efforts, I believe  it is particularly appropriate that we  focus special attention on the men and  women  in our Armed Forces as we  celebrate Armed Forces Day.  In 1949 Armed Forces Day was desig nated as the third Saturday in May.  This commemoration dedicated to the  U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,  and Coast Guard emphasizes the unity  and mutual goals of the branches of  the U.S. military.  We owe an incalculable debt to all  those who have served our Nation in  the past and to those who serve now.  We must not underestimate the value  of maintaining a strong and effective  national defense. President Reagan's  comprehensive  economic program  is  not only critically important to the re vitalization of our economy, but also  will make the desperately needed im provements  in our national defense  program. The President's proposal in cludes not only the funds needed to  obtain top-quality military equipment,  but more  importantly,  increases  the  benefits and pay scales of our soldiers.  If we are to continue as a leader in  the world community, our men and  women in uniform need to be honored  not only on Armed Forces Day but  every day of the year. I am sure that  all Delawareans join me as we reaffirm  our support for those men and women  who  serve  and  protect  our  great  Nation on Armed Forces Day, 1981.e  ",1981
133,Senate,97,-0.347,461,8,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, no body ever said that cutting the Federal  budget would be easy.  But we were told that the budget cuts  would be fair.  The proposed reductions in social se curity benefits are not fair and should  not be adopted.  I have supported many of the proposed  budget cuts-in fact, I voted to cut Fed eral spending even more than the Presi dent proposed. I have also fought for  fairness in budget cutting by seeking to  eliminate  tax loopholes  that benefit a  handful of very wealthy Americans with out  serving  any productive  economic  purpose.  I have done so because I believe the  goal of fighting  inflation  important  enough to warrant severe reductions in  Federal spending. Inflation hurts every  working person, every family, every re tiree: every American. It must be con controlled.  So I have voted for budgetary restraint  to help in that effort.  But I will not support further budget  cuts that make the elderly the principal  casualties in that effort.  Fairness requires that everyone share  in the necessary sacrifices.  Nothjng is more important than the  recognition by all Americans that this is  a shared responsibility and a joint obli gation. And  the American people have  is  ",1981
134,House,97,0.207,513,8,Mr. WORTLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I  am pleased  to  join  the distin guished chairman of our Subcommit tee on Consumer Affairs and Coinage  in supporting the enactment of H.R.  3484,  the George Washington Com memorative Coin Act. Except for the  coins authorized for the Bicentennial  this will be the first commemorative  coin authorized since 1954. In report ing this bill  to you, your committee  has given due consideration  to  the  problems which were associated with  the  commemorative  coin  issues  au thorized prior to that time.  First of all we think commemorating  the  250th  anniversary  of  George  Washington's birth is an occasion of  national significance. His  importance  to our Nation is unquestioned and his  strong personal interest in the estab lishment of a mint and our coinage  system make it particularly significant  that we honor him with a commemo rative coin.  Second, we provide in this bill that  the coins be priced to cover all costs  and that profits from the sale of them  go into the U.S. Treasury. It is our in tention that the silver used in these  coins be valued at current prices. The  bill authorizes the Mint to use silver in  inventory which had previously been  set aside  for  the Eisenhower dollar.  Assuming that silver prices remain at  the current high levels-$11-plus per  ounce-a substantial profit will be re alized for the Treasury.  Unlike  some previously authorized  coins these coins may only be issued  during a specific period, 1982 and 1983.  Thus if for any reason the 10 million  coins authorized have not been sold  the issue will be discontinued.  I also favor this bill because I think  it is a good idea to off er commemora tive U.S. coins. Such coins are issued  by many other nations of the world  and are widely collected by U.S. citi zens. It makes good sense economical ly and as a matter of national pride  for us to enter this market. I am sure  that  the Mint can  select  a  design  which will be more attractive than our  dollar coin and if they do I am confi dent this will be a successful program.  I urge enactment of the bill.  ",1981
135,House,97,-0.028,513,8,Mr. BARNARD.," Mr. Speaker, I ap preciate the kind words of my good  friend, Mr. ANNUNZIO, and I would like  to take this opportunity to thank him  for all of his assistance in bringing this  legislation  to  the floor. There  is no  question that without his able advice  and counsel, we would not be here  today,  and  the George Washington  half would be but a dream.  Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of  George Washington, and of the many  things that he did to shape our Re public in its early days. However, we  tend to view him more as a marble  statue to be honored, than for what he  was, a very human person, who did his  best in trying circumstances, and cre ated a Republic that is still the hope  for  freedom of much of  the world  today.  It is my hope that the issuance of a  commemorative  coin  for  his  250th  birthday will cause people  to  think  about his life as that of a man who  lived, rather than just as a historical  subject.  H.R. 3484 provides for the striking  of a special silver dollar by the mint to  honor this important anniversary. The  coins, when issued next year, will have  a composition of 90 percent silver and  10 percent copper,  identical  to  the  silver  coins  struck  in  this  country  before 1965. They will be available for  2 years, 1982 and 1983, and will be  legal tender for half a dollar, although  they will be sold for more than that.  H.R. 3484 provides that a maximum  of 10 million of  these coins will be  struck, with the actual number issued  being limited to those ordered during  1982. The number 10 million is admit tedly arbitrary, but was chosen as the  number most  likely  to approximate  the actual demand for the coin. At its  maximum, demand for the Eisenhower  silver dollar ran at close to 7 million,  and while I believe that the Washing ton half will attract more interest, I  believe that 10 million is a fair esti mate. In addition, I felt that the mint  should have some way to plan its pro duction, and that a ceiling would prob ably heighten the interest in the coin  and encourage early orders.  My  legislation  provides  that  the  price will  cover all costs associated  with the coin, plus a profit of up to 20  percent. The sales will be handled ac cording  to regulations  issued by the  Secretary of  the Treasury,  and all  profits will go into the Treasury gener al fund.  Briefly, there are three reasons why  H.R. 3484 should be approved:  First. A commemorative half dollar  is a  fitting way  to honor  the 250th  birthday of George Washington.  Second. There is a market for the  coin, and it will provide an American  alternative for the millions of collec tors and investors who invest in silver  coins yearly, and are now limited to  foreign coins. As such, it will help our  balance of trade to some extent.  Third. The sales of these coins will  provide a profit to the Treasury, that  will help to reduce the deficit in fiscal  year 1982.  Of these three reasons, the first, the  desire to commemorate George Wash ington on his 250th birthday  is  the  most important. In honor of this anni versary, a silver coin is particularly ap propriate, as Washington took a spe cial  interest  in the establishment of  our Nation's first mint, and was  re sponsible for our first silver coinage  personally.  The establishment of a mint was one  of Washington's main priorities when  he became President in 1789, but cir cumstances delayed it for over 2 years.  In a speech to Congress on September  25, 1791, he again urged the establish ment of a mint to remove ""the scarcity  of small change, a scarcity which is so  peculiarly distressing  to  the poorer  classes.""  The Congress responded to this plea,  and not only established a mint, but  also provided for a national coinage  system. Washington  took a personal  interest in the establishment of this  coinage system, and intervened when  the Senate bill provided for the pic ture of the current President on the  coins.  Instead, he successfully urged  that a  representation of  liberty be  placed on the coins.  The next year, 1792, he used $100 of  his personal silver plate for the mint ing of the first U.S. coins, silver 5-cent  pieces,  according  to old mint docu ments. He had not forgotten his con cern about the need of the poor for  coins, and the coins were promptly re leased  into circulation, as shown by  the heavy wear that most of them ex hibit today.  The coin that you are considering  today will not be the first time that  Congress has decided that a coin is an  appropriate way to commemorate an  anniversary of George Washington's  birth. Fifty years ago, for the 200th  anniversary  in 1932,  a  special com memorative quarter was  issued, sup posedly for 1 year only. However,  it  proved  to be so popular  that it re mains in circulation today.  The second reason for passing this  legislation is that not only is there a  market for the coin domestically, but  79-059 O 84 33  (Part 8)  ",1981
136,House,97,-0.384,526,8,Ms. FERRARO.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  Sunday night, I had the pleasure of  attending  a  dinner  celebration  in  honor of the lOOth anniversary of the  founding of the New York Board of  Rabbis. Former President Carter, who  was honored at the dinner, used the  occasion to reiterate the necessity of  protecting human rights  throughout  the world.  In recent months, we have seen our  Government become less and less con cerned about human rights violations.  We now have an administration that  seems to believe that the condemnation of human rights violations is not a  proper duty of the American Govern ment.  Upon hearing President Carter de nounce  the  deprivation  of  human  rights throughout the world, my com mitment to speaking out against such  violations was  renewed. My pride  being  a Democrat,  a member of  a  party that consistently strives to pro tect and improve the lives of not only  Americans, but peoples  around  the  globe, has never been stronger.  I would like to insert a copy of Presi dent Carter's speech in the RECORD to  remind my colleagues of the reasons  the protection of human rights has  come to play such an important role in  U.S. foreign policy:  in  I appreciate that introduction from Rabbi  Mowshowitz. I am going to tell you a little  story. Last October, Rabbi Mowshowitz  came  to the Oval Office for a delightful  visit. While there, he invited me to attend  this lOOth anniversary celebration, and I ac cepted with one  reservation-I knew  the  economic summit meeting of Heads of State  was usually held sometime in May, and I  was concerned that I would have to be out  of the country on this evening. This worried  me-needlessly, as it turned out.  I understand that my appearance marks a  first for this venerable organization. This is  the first time in 100 years that The New  York Board of Rabbis has been addressed  . . . by a Baptist Sunday School teacher . . .  from Plains, Georgia.  Things are not really so different between  Plains and New York. Last Sunday was also  Mother's Day in Plains. We hear a lot about  Jewish mothers, and I believe that even our  mothers are about the same. The word of  encouragement is always coupled with an  admonition about limitations. For example,  the day I was sworn into office my mother  congratulated me but  added,  as  only  a  mother can, that she never expected me to  get this far in life. This was when I first  became a member of the Georgia legisla ture.  This  public  appearance  tonight  has  become a rare event in my life, but I par ticularly wanted to be here to celebrate with  you. We don't celebrate enough! More often,  we need to be actively involved in an expres sion of joy and thanksgiving, and not just  derive our excitement from the passive role  of being entertained by others. I have come  to  join  the  celebration  and  to  express  thanksgiving for the contribution this orga nization has made in protecting the rights  of human beings, in caring for the needs of  so many people, and in working for peace.  For all of you this is a special seven-week  period between two holidays. The first com memorates freedom, the second the giving  of the law on Mt. Sinai. The history of our  own nation is bound up in these two ideals the right of human beings to be free, and  the promotion of a society that deals justly  with its people.  We celebrate tonight in the midst of tur moil: War threatens again in a part of the  world very close to our hearts. Children in  my home state are being murdered and no  one knows why. A good and loving man who  has sought to foster peace and brotherhood  lies wounded by an assassin's bullet.

137,,97,-0.269,552,8,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker,  in  June of this year Dr. William J. John ston, superintendent of schools for the  Los Angeles School District, will vol untarily retire after 31 years of skilled  and dedicated public service  to  the  people of Los Angeles.  His record of achievements  in the  field of education is one which any in dividual would be proud to have. After  beginning his career in education as a  math  instructor  at Gardena High  School, Bill steadily advanced through  the school system until he was chosen  as superintendent of schools in 1971.  This is a job which few men or women  are capable of holding as well as Bill.  Speaking just in terms of sheer num bers, the district's operating budget is  currently set at $1.7 billion, and em ploys approximately 65,000 individuals  who serve the estimated 543,000 public  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  school students. Within the Los Ange les School District boundaries are 654  square miles  in which  the cities of  Washington, D.C., Boston, Providence,  Detroit, Philadelphia, and Cleveland  would fit. Obviously, this superintend ent's position  is no simple  task;  the  people of California are fortunate that  Bill was available to fill this demand ing job.  While Bill has worked long hours to  improve the quality of education for  the children in the Los Angeles area,  he  has  always  found  the  time  to  become involved with numerous com munity  activities  and organizations.  He is vice president of the Boy Scouts  of America, and vice chairman of the  United Way Corporate Board; he is on  the board of directors of the Califor nia Special Olympics, Blue Shield of  California, California Congress of Par ents and Teachers, Foundation  for  Teaching Economics, Constitutional  Rights Foundation,  Industry Educa tion Council  of California,  Junior  Achievement of Southern California,  National  Alliance  of  Businessmen,  Management Council  for Merit Em ployees, and the YMCA of Metropoli tan Los Angeles. Bill has also made  time to serve as an active member of  the following groups: Ad Hoc Commit tee  on  Juvenile  Justice, California  Museum  Foundation,  Council  for  Peace  and  Equality  in Education,  Invest-in-America, Japanese American  Citizen League, League  of Women  Voters of Los Angeles, Los Angeles  Chamber of Commerce, Los Angeles  County Museum of Art, Los Angeles  Urban League, Los Angeles World Af fairs Council, National Association for  the Advancement of Colored People,  and  the Town Hall  of California.  Through his involvement in the field  of education, Bill has been affiliated  with numerous professional organiza tions: Adult Education Association of  Los Angeles, president, 1962; American  Association of School Administrators;  Association of California School Ad ministrators; Big Eight Association of  Public School Districts; California As sociation of Adult Education Adminis trators, president, 1969; Council of the  Great City Schools; Educare, USC,  president, 1973; National Association  for Public Continuing and Adult Edu cation; Southern California City Su perintendents; and the UCLA Dean's  Council, Graduate School of Educa tion.  In the past 10 years southern Cali fornians have been witness to an enor mous  increase  in population. It has  been individuals such as William John ston who have met and conquered the  many challenges which must be faced  whenever tremendous population ex plosions occur. Bill has emulated the  basic goal of education: To foster, pro mote, and develop children  to  their  full potential so that when they leave  the  educational  system  they  will  May 19, 1981  become contributing members of the  community.  Mr. Speaker, Bill is a man who is ad mired and respected by all those who  have  the pleasure  in working  and  being associated with him. Without  hesitation, I can say that this man's  career of public service is a model of  citizenship. He has extended himself  and worked  tirelessly as  few people  have for the benefit of others. Bill has  left a mark in the field of education  which will not be forgotten, but in stead will be long appreciated. He can  certainly reflect with pride and satis faction upon  the many accomplish ments of his career and his dedicated  involvement on behalf of the people of  southern California.  My wife, Lee, joins me in congratu lating Bill Johnston for his admirable  career as superintendent of schools for  the Los Angeles School District and  his sincere dedication to the communi ties in which he served. Through his  excellent work, the Los Angeles Uni fied School District has become one of  California's finest school districts. We  send out best wishes for continued suc cess  in all their future endeavors to  Bill, his wife Oma, and their two chil dren, Kathy and Michael.   NOVEL APPROACH BY  CLEVELAND HOMEBUILDERS  HON.

138,,97,-0.242,552,8,Mr. ECKART.," Mr. Speaker, we are  all aware of  the  tremendous slump  that has beset the housing industry.  High interest rates and uncertainty in  the mortgage markets resulted in 1980  being the worst year for housing pro duction since World War  II.  In my  own State of Ohio, housing starts were  off 50 percent.  Homebuilders in Cleveland have un dertaken a novel approach in an effort  to  combat  these  problems.

139,,97,-0.599,565,8,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  as part of my continuing  effort  to share with  this body  the  learned views  of America's  leading  constitutional scholars on the subject  of H.R. 900 <S. 158), I am today sub mitting excerpts from the legal opin ion prepared by the Congressional Re search Service of the Library of Con gress, long respected for its objectivity  and expertise.  I. CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY TO ALTER THE  SUPREME COURT'S RULING IN ROE AGAINST  WADE  A. THE OBJECT AND PREMISE OF SECTION 1 OF S.  158  The object of section 1 of S. 158 is to legis latively overturn the ruling of the Supreme  Court in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 0973>  ""that the word 'person', as used in the Four teenth Amendment, does not  include  the  unborn."" (410 U.S. at 158). It accomplished  this purpose, not by a direct overruling but  indirectly through a legislative fact.finding  process. First, the statute makes two find ings of  fact:  that scientific evidence sup ports the existence of life at conception and  that the framers of the Fourteenth Amend10289  ment meant to protect all human life. Then,  on the basis of these findings, it invokes the  legislative authority of section 5 to declare  that human life begins at conception and  that the term person is deemed to include  all human life for purposes of future en forcement of the Amendment's protections.  This fact-finding process is premised on a  reading of the Roe opinion which concludes  that the Court's failure to determine when  human life begins was the result of its self confessed inability to find an answer. Propo nents of this approach point to language of  the Court noting that the issue of when life  begins is ""sensitive and difficult,"" that there  is a ""wide divergence of thinking"" on it, and  that the judiciary ""is not in a position to  speculate as  to the answer."" <410 U.S. at  159-160; see also, Galeback, supra, n. 10, pp.  at 156-157).  6-7). Indeed, the Court, it is pointed out,  conceded that ""If the suggestion of person hood is established, the appellants' case, of  course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life  would  then be guaranteed specifically by  the Amendment.""  (410 U.S.  Thus, it is concluded that the failure of the  Court to afford constitutional protection for  the unborn stems from an institutional inca pacity of the judiciary to make the requisite  fact-findings  and  policy  determinations  based upon those findings.  The line of argument continues by urging  that such an incapacity on the part of the  judicial branch should not and does not  leave a void in the government's capacity to  enforce constitutional guarantees. Section 5  of  the Fourteenth Amendment provides  that: ""The Congress shall have the power to  enforce, by appropriate legislation, the pro visions of this article.'' This grant of legisla tive authority recognizes  the proper fact finding and policy determination role of the  Congress.  It is contended Congress has the power  under the Constitution to  investigate and  determine when human life begins, just as it  has  the power  to decide countless other  policy questions involving difficult decisions  on unclear facts and conflicting values. Con gress' power is especially clear, it is claimed,  when those questions are related to the en forcement of rights guaranteed by the Four teenth Amendment. When the courts are  not capable of resolving a difficult question  which is fundamental to the application of a  provision of the Amendment, that provision  can be effectively enforced only if Congress  addresses the question through the vehicle  of section 5. This Congressional capacity to  interpret and apply constitutional terms has  been recognized by the Supreme Court even  in instances when the Congressional action  has differed from and even contradicted Su preme Court  interpretations. See South  Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 0966);  Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 0966);  Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 0970); City  of Rome v.  United States,  156  0980); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 100 S. Ct. 2758  0980).  446 U.S.  From the foregoing it is clear that an as sessment of the validity of S. 158 will turn  in large measure on what the Court in Roe  precisely held. Therefore it is appropriate to  tum at this point to that decision before  proceeding with further analysis.  B. THE COURT'S HOLDING IN ROE V. WADE  Proponents of  the Human Life Statute  rest their basic premise on a reading of the  Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113  0973)) which may telescope  two separate  parts of the Court's opinion into a conclu sion not supported by close analysis.  ",1981
140,House,97,-0.166,591,8,Mr. SHARP.," Mr. Speaker, I believe  most of us in this body agree we have  a mandate from the American people  to pass a budget which puts the coun try on the soundest possible financial  base as fairly as possible. Because I  made that commitment to the people  of  Indiana,  I  supported  the House  Budget Committee  alternative. Ac cordingly, I believe passage of the con ference report today is a mistake.  The American people expect Con gress to pass a budget based on sound  and  reasonable  assumptions  about  what is possible for  the economy to  achieve next  year. The  alternative  budget I supported was put together  on a solid foundation of realistic pro jections about  interest  rates, unem ployment, and other  important eco nomic indicators. On the other hand,  most private economic forecasters of  authority  believe  the  economic  as sumptions in the conference report to  be  unrealistically  optimistic. Basing  the budget on those projections will  mean  greater  expenditures  and  a  greater deficit  than  the people are  being told.  The American people expect Con gress to cut deficit spending. Yet the  conference report we are considering  today would create a deficit of be tween $45 and $69 billion next year,  and a  deficit of anywhere between  $169 and $190 billion between now and  1984.  The alternative budget I supported  would have sharply reduced the Fed eral deficit. It would have held next  year's spending  to  the  level  recom mended by the President, but it would  have cut in different ways  to make  planned reductions in education, nu trition, and  transportation programs  less severe.  The alternative would have allowed  a  tax cut, but not one as extensive,  and potentially inflationary, as envi sioned by the Kemp-Roth plan.  I  believe  the  alternative  budget  would have been far fairer to working  and middle-income  families and  far  wiser in terms of controlling inflation.  Heavy  Government  borrowing,  of  course,  contributes  to high  interest  rates. This week's new surge in inter est rates demonstrates once again that  Government cannot continue borrow ing to pay for huge deficits without  also inflicting further devastation on  the auto industry, the housing indus try, agriculture,  small business, and  consumers. The  people  of  Indiana  want those interest rates lowered, and  that view  is  clearly  shared by  all  Americans.  Mr. President,  I  opposed  the  last  three Carter budgets  because  they  failed to control Government spending  and  added  significantly  to Govern ment borrowing. Regrettably, Presi dent Reagan's first budget may well  bring about a larger deficit than Presi dent Carter's last.e  e ",1981

142,House,97,-0.429,617,8,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to take this opportunity to wel come Iosif Mendelevich to the United  States,  and  to Washington.  Just 3  months ago, Iosif was released after 10  years as a Prisoner of Conscience in  Soviet  prisons  and  labor  camps.  During that 10 years, Iosif became a  living testimony to true courage in his  endurance of hardship, hunger, and ill  health. He retained his devotion to Ju daism throughout his ordeal, and was  subjected to repeated punishment for  his persistence in observing Jewish re ligious laws.  Iosif Mendelevich not only retained  his personal faith during his time in  prison, but also served as a source of  strength to his fellow Jewish prison ers. As one of the these former prison ers said, ""Iosif was the Jewish 'soul' of  our group and perhaps the rabbi of  Soviet prisons."" For example, at the  time of his release, Iosif had just ter minated a 54-day hunger strike held to  protest  the confiscation of  religious  and Hebrew study books and notes,  which  he  used  in  teaching  other  Jewish prisoners. This strength and  unselfish perseverance on behalf of  his fell ow prisoners is an inspiration  for us all.  Mr. Mendelevich's presence  in  the  House Chamber today also serves as a  reminder of  the  importance of con tinuing efforts to pressure the Soviets  to release Prisoners of Conscience and  refuseniks. I am certain that the storm  of  protest  on  Iosif Mendelevich's  behalf from Members of Congress and  the  thousands  of  constituents who  continue to bring these matters to our  attention helped to secure his release,  and we all must continue to apply this  pressure  to  obtain  the  release  of  others unjustly held  in  the Soviet  Union. Indeed, the best tribute we can  pay to Iosif Mendelevich is to renew  our commitment  to our  efforts on  behalf of these beleaguered people.e  e ",1981
143,House,97,-0.562,617,8,Mr. ROSENTHAL.," Mr. Speaker, it  is a pleasure and an honor to welcome  Iosif Mendelevich  to Washington.  Iosif's arrival in the United States is  visible proof that congressional efforts  to persuade Soviet authorities can suc ceed. At a  time when the number of  Jews permitted  to  leave  the Soviet  Union is declining, Mr. Mendelevich's  release  serves  as  an  encouraging  morale boost to those still striving to  be free.  Having spent nearly a  third of his  life in the Russian gulag, Iosif Mendel evich  endured his  11-year captivity  through mental discipline and an un relenting desire  to practice Judaism  freely in Israel. He refused to eat non kosher  food and subsisted on  little  more than bread and water; he refused  to work on the Sabbath and was fre quently punished. Over the course of  his imprisonment, he taught himself  nearly  flawless Hebrew, and despite  the risk of severe punishment, taught  Hebrew to other prisoners.  Iosif Mendelevich's dedication  to  freedom is exemplary. Upon arrival at  Israel's Ben Gurion Airport on Febru ary 18, Mendelevich proclaimed, ""the  fight goes on.""  For the past 3 months he has been  recuperating in Israel. Today we can  take this opportunity to applaud Iosif  Mendelevich's tenacity and determina tion. Equally important, we can renew  our pledge to work for the release of  those who remain Prisoners of Con science in the Soviet Union.e  Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Speaker, I am de lighted to join my colleagues today in  welcoming Iosif Mendelevich, and in  recognizing his hard-won freedom. He  lives as a reminder of our own price less freedom and an example of the  sacrifices that men will make  to be  free. He lives as proof that world opin ion  in support of human rights has  been heard.  The story of Mr. Mendelevich's sac rifices  is  long and painful. After he  and his family were refused permis sion three times to emigrate to Israel,  he was arrested at Leningrad's Smolnil  Airport  for  the  alleged attempt  to  steal a plane to leave the country. He  was sentenced to 15 years in a Soviet  labor camp-a sentence later reduced  to 12 years in response to worldwide  outrage at his treatment.  During his eventual 9 years of incar ceration, Mr. Mendelevich persisted in  the strict observance of his religious  beliefs, a right so many of us take for  granted. In his case, his determination  earned him the wrath of Soviet au thorities. In 1977, he was accused of  ""maliciously violating  the  regime of  confinement."" His punishment: trans fer to the notorious Chistopol prison.  Meanwhile, because he refused non kosher  foods,  he  lost  considerable  weight, subsisting on the two meager  food parcels he was allowed to receive  each year.  Even after others sentenced at the  same time were released, Mendelevich  remained  a Prisoner of Conscience,  very much to the dismay of his family  and those people everywhere who re spect individual rights. Finally, in Febfreed him  ruary, Soviet authorities  and allowed him to go.  Yes, Mr. Speaker. His sacrifices took  a  toll in his physical health but his  spirit  flamed  bright  and  hopeful.  Today, he stands with us a free man,  free  to practice his  religion  as he  wishes, free to go as he wishes.  But others remain. Not  just those  sentenced  for other  alleged  crimes.  But those who sit and simply wait for  permission to leave. Solomon Alber is  one  such person  for whom  I  have  spoken before. A person who wants  only to emigrate to Israel-and exer cise a fundamental human right-but  is forbidden to do so.  In welcoming Mr. Mendelevich, we  remember that our job is not done and  that we must press ahead with our  campaign of world opinion  for  the  others left behind.  On October 1, I will again speak on  behalf of Solomon Alber who remains  in the Soviet Union against his will.  Perhaps by then we will be able towel come Mr. Alber as we have welcomed  Mr. Mendelevich today    ",1981
144,Senate,97,-0.145,643,8,Mr. NUNN.," Mr. President, first let me  thank the Senator from Alabama for  his  leadership  in  this very  important  area. He has done a superb job. He has  many bills that he has introduced him self. He was one of the leaders who went  to the White House about a week ago to  meet with the President to try to make  the fight against crime in America at  least the No. 2 priority behind our eco nomic recovery program.  I really wish to express my apprecia tion to the Senator from Alabama for  his superb leadership in this area.  Mr. President, I am delighted that the  chairman of  the Judiciary Committee,  my colleague and  friend  from South  Carolina, is in the Chamber th'.s morn ing because he has been a  leader for  many years in this area, and I am also  pleased  to hear his firm statement of  commitment about the planned actions  of  the  Judiciary Committee making  these bills and this legislation, that could  at least help in the fight against crime  in strengthening law enforcement, a real  priority. I am delighted that he is go ing to make these a real priority.  I might say to the Senator from South  Carolina that when we went to the White  House a week ago, there was a group of  Democrats who went down there not in  a partisan sense but in a sense of telling  the President that we wanted to make  crime the No. 2 priority of this Nation,  only behind our economic program, and  we wanted to offer him a bipartisan-type  support for this kind of emphasis.  I also might say to the Senator from  South Carolina that a couple of the bills  th3.t we listed as the top priorities were  the bills of the Senator from South Car olina which we have already as a group  endorsed.  One of them with habeas corpus and,  of course, the Senator from South Caro lina is either the author or the cospon  sor of many different bills that I think  are enormously important.  I also am interested in the statist!cs  th-:tt  the Senator from South Carolina  cited. I have other statistics which tell  the horror that is going on in America  today.  in  On the average a murder is committed  in the United States every 24 minutes.  On the average a house is burglarized  every 10 seconds. Every 10 seconds  this country we have a burglary. And  every 7 minutes a woman is rdpeu some  where in America.  Arrests for violent crime in our sub urbs climbed 7.5 percent last year and 13  p3rcent in our once peaceful rural areas.  I have been particularly active in the  area of  investigating organized crime.  'I'he Senator from Florida and I for the  last 3 % years have looked at the serious  problems of organized crime in narcotics  and labor racketeering. We have spent  literally hundreds of hours  looking at  these areas, and the Senator from Flor ida knows better than anyone in this  body the effect crime can have on his  own State. He has seen it in the State of  Florida with the terrible narcotics prob lem of trafficking through there.  I might add also that problem occurs  to a lesser degree but a significant de gree in my State of Georgia.  The illegal narcotics traffic now does  as much business as Exxon, the leading  and largest corporation in America. A  recent study found that 237 drug addicts  were responsible for more than 500,000  crimes over an 11-year period.  This is an astounding growth of crime,  and it has led to a change of !if estyles  by many people in America, those who  cannot escape from high crime districts.  City dwellers, suburbanites, and even  farmers are triple-locking  their doors,  keeping ever larger watchdogs, putting  bars across their windows, and carrying  mace in their pockets and handbags.  Average citizens in many places feel  unsafe, especially after dark. They no  longer go for walks in the evening. They  have become prisoners  in  their own  homes. Fear and despair have replaced  security and hope in high-crime areas.  The growing crime rate cries out for  governmental and citizen action at all  levels-Federal, State,  and  local-yet  very little  is being done  to strengthen  law enforcement and our criminal justice  system.  I was very interested in reading about  Chief Justice Burger in his comments re cently and some of the responses to those  comments.  Instead of concentrating on ways  to  allow our criminal justice system to pro tect the victims of crime, many influen tial and sincere Americans believe we  must await vast social changes. which  they contend will eliminate the roots of  crime--prejudice, poor housing,  inade quate education and medical service.  A leading proponent of this view  Judge David L. Bazelon of the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  In a recent speech, Judge Bazelon said  thatis  The real roots of crime are associated with  a constellation of suffering so hideous that,  as a society, we cannot bear to look it in the  face ... Nobody questions that street crimi nals typlcallv come from the bottom of the  socioeconomic ladder-from among the ig norant,  the 111-e:iucated,  the unemployed  and the unemployable.  Judge Bazelon is right in one respect:  few of us would disagree  that street  ",1981

147,Senate,97,-0.192,786,8,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr. President  the  Canadian Government, through th~ activities of  its Foreign Investment Re view Agency and its proposed national  energy plan, has elevated economic na tionalism to a position of primacy in its  national policies. In doing so it has pre sented the potential of eroding the value  of Canadian assets owned by U.S. inves tors; adversely affected the ground rules  originally used to attract such investors,  and appears to deny to those U.S. inves tors a favorable operating environment  comparable to  that afforded Canadian  companies active in the United States.  I am concerned that the Canadian Gov ernment's pursuit of its present policies  will make it impossible to maintain rec iprocity of the fair and constructive busi ness environment that has contributed  greatly to the economic progress of both  Canada and  the United States  in  the  past.  I do not question the right of countries  to restrict the activity of foreign inves tors in selective areas. However, the pre vailing assumption in the United States  has been that such restrictions would be  limited in scope. and would not be de signed  to provide  long-term  artificial  competitive advantages to domestic con cerns.  Our friends to the nor.th are pursuing  their nationalistic goals through two pri mary instruments. The first is the For eign Investment Review Act which es tablishes Canada's Foreign Investment  Review Agency <FIRA>. That agency  has been given wide discretionary powers  over foreign investors' activities in Can ada. Its mandate extends over a wide  range of investment opportunities.  FIRA's primary tool is control of the  investment  approval process. For  in stance, it must give prior approval to:  U.S.  acquisition  of Canadian  busi nesses,  Establishment by a U.S. concern of a  new enterprise in Canada, or  Expansion by anv existing U.S.-owned  enterprise in Canada into a new business  area.  Various examples of the effect of FIRA  activity on U.S. business interests exist  among which are the following:  '  A prooosal bv General Electric's sub sidiary  in Canada  to acquire Federal  Pioneer, Ltd.. of Toronto was  turned  down by FIRA in late 1979.  In 1979, FIRA rejected two proposals  bv a subsidiary of Gulf Oil to acquire oil  and gas properties in Canada.  In March 1981, Getty Oil was not al lowed to acquire a majority interest in  Canadian Reserve Oil & Gas, Ltd.  FIRA is unfettered by any strict defi nition of the criteria on which its deci sions are to be based and there is no  requirement that it make known its rea sons for rejecting an application. There fore, Mr. President, it is difficult to avoid  the appearance that FIRA is a political  instrument of the Canadian Government  designed to promote policies of economic  nationalism.  The introduction in October 1980 of  Canada's national  energy program NEP by  the Trudeau government has  begun  to bring  into focus  the overall  intent signaled by the existence of FIRA.  The  program's discriminatory nature  relative  to foreign  investment is made  clear by several of its anticipated provi sions. Under it:  Canadian-owned firms are to receive  subsidies for oil and gas exploration and  development which, in all cases, will be  substantially greater than those received  by the United States or U.S.-controlled  firms.  A minimum of 50-percent Canadian  ownership is to be required for oil and  gas production  in  the Northwest and  Yukon Territories and offshore proper ties.  Takeovers of foreign firms by state owned PetroCanada and by private Ca nadian companies are to be actively pro moted.  The National Energy Board is to take  into account the level of Canadian own ership in considering oil and gas export  applications.  New  large  nonconventional  energy  projects such as synfuels are to be care fully scrutinized by the Government to  insure conformity with the basic tenets  of ""Canadianization.""  A Government institution is to be set  up  to purchase natural gas  from Ca nadian-owned  firms  that cannot  find  markets;  to enter  into  joint ventures  with such firms; and to provide  them  production loans. U.S. natural gas firms  operating in Canada are  to be denied  access  to this facility.  The Canadian Government has sig naled that it will deal with the nonpe troleum energy sector in a similar man ner. It has stated in the NEP thatThe Government is concerned about own ership trends in the non-petroleum energy  sector .  .  . Canadians would not be wise to  let the pattern of ownership that occurred  in the oil and gas industry repeat itself in  the uranium and coal industries.  Thus, the implied intent as evidenced  by the above language is to discriminate  against  the  foreign  investor over  the  wide spectrum of energy activities.  The effects of these provisions of the  NEP on U.S. investors could be pernicious  and wide ranging, especially as they be come intertwined with the functioning  of the FIRA. One such effect is to penal ize U.S. investors who, in good faith, pre viously entered  into extensive  invest ments in Canada under ground rules and  expectations for the future dramatically  different than those that will result from  the NEP. On a retroactive basis they are  being penalized for their original confi dence  in  the  integrity of Government  policies existing at the time of their in vestment. Such discrimination is one of  the reasons  the NEP has elicited nu merous protests from Canada's OECD  partners and,  indeed,  from  large seg ments of the Canadian business commu nity. The NEP would thus seem to vio late the spirit of the OECD guidelines  encouraging equal treatment in member  countries of foreign and domestic invest ment.  .  A particularly alarming result of the  NEP is its depressing effect on the value  of Canadian oil assets owned by U.S.  citizens. The provisions of the NEP thus  put unwarranted pressure on U.S.  in vestors  to sell. At  the same time,  the  existence of the Foreign Investment Re view Agency effectively precludes non Canadians from bidding on such assets.  ",1981
148,,97,0.183,812,8,Mr. LENT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  have  today joined with the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. LoNG)  in introducing a  bipartisan resolution of disapproval in  the matter of the sale of additional  equipment for the F-15 fighter planes,  and the AW ACS E-3C sentry planes to  Saudi Arabia. We  separately  intro duced identical resolutions on April 27  because of our concern for the secu rity of Israel, and peace and stability  in the Middle East. Since that time,  the need  to block  this unfortunate  action  by  the  administration  has  become more apparent because of the  deployment of Syrian  surface-to-air  missiles  in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.  The placement of these threating mis siles,  the subsequent positions  taken  by  the  Israeli  and Syrian Govern ments, and the heightening of tension  on a global scale provide us with an  important lesson as to the instability  and political volatility  the  introduc tion of new weapons produces in this  troubled region.  The balance of power in the Middle  East is very fragile, and the introduc tion of new weapons system, like the  Syrian missiles, or an advanced tech nology like the AW ACS E-3CX sentry  planes, can do great harm to the bal ance and stability we try so hard to  maintain. This  is  the  lesson of  the  Lebanon crisis for the United States.  The sale of the AWACS and the addi tional equipment for the F-15 fighter  planes will not guarantee the security  of Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, if  Saudi Arabia does  acquire AW ACS,  the  security  of  Israel  is  seriously  threatened, and it is with good reason  that  the  Israeli people oppose  this  sale. The delicate balance will be tilted  ",1981
149,,97,-0.351,825,8,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. Speaker,  the  administration that was mandated by  the American  people  to  eliminate  wasteful  spending and Federal pro grams of little value has abandoned  that mandate in the increasing fury of  its own program slashing. How else  can we perceive the administration's  proposals to take a knife to one of the  most successful, citizen-supported pro grams to endure since the days of the  New Deal: the social security system?  Income security for senior citizens  originated as an American tradition in  1935. Since that time, the social secu rity program has progressed and ex panded to provide necessary, even life saving benefits for 36 million Ameri cans. Over half of all older Americans  today depend on  social  security as  their main source of income, and dis abled  persons  and  financially  dis tressed surviving spouses have avoided  economic disaster with social security  income  support and medical  assist ance.  The administration, however, in the  name of saving a sinking ship, is pull ing back  the social security  lifeline  from the grasp of those most unable  to stay afloat. Many older Americans  today are forced from employment be cause of a disability or long-term ill ness, and they are able to receive 80  percent of the social security benefits  that they would have received if they  had retired at the age of 65. Can we in  all conscience  today  tell  the elderly  and sickly who retire at the age of 62  after the first of next year that they  will only be able to receive 55 percent  of the beneifts they would receive at  age 65-for the rest of their lives? In a  time of spiraling inflation that threat ens even the most wealthy, do we have  the right to ask the most economically  vulnerable  to wait months  for  the  basic cost-of-living  increase  in  their  social security benefits? The adminis tration has consistently asserted that  basic social security benefits will not  be reduced, but those who reach re tirement age within the next several  years can expect up to 9 percent less  in monthly benefits than retired work ers receive now. The proposed changes  in  disability  eligibility  are  unduly  harsh, coldly discounting the needs of  those who face long-term disability of  a year or longer.  Salvaging the social security system  is a difficult task that the 97th Con gress  confronts,  but  denying  older  Americans the security that they have  worked their entire lives to earn only  attests to congressional inability to re vitalize the system through innovative  legislation. A number of alternative fi10549  nancing proposals are being consid ered by the Subcommittee on Social  Security, including the limited use of  general revenues to help fund the pro gram. Our responsibility is to examine  critically  these proposals, or explore  viable  new  ones,  not  sacrifice  the  needs of  the very people  that  the  social security system was designed to  protect.e  SMALL BUSINESS WEEK  HON.

This year,  in light of all the  challenges small business faces, I hope  it is an occasion of more than lip serv ice to the concept of small business.  Small business creates 87 .6 percent  of all jobs in the private sector. Small  business  employs  over  100 million  Americans. Small business contributes  more than two-fifths of the gross na tional product.  Yet small business  is under heavy  strain. The failure rate among small  businesses was some 57 percent in the  period 1969  to 1976. Small business  loans are almost impossible to get; if  someone in small business is fortunate  enough to otain such a loan, the inter est rates are prohibitive.  Small business  suffers heavy bur dens from our tax system; it suffers  heavy burdens from well-meant but ill applied regulations; it suffers from the  terrible ravages of inflation.  Mr. Speaker, our most recent census  underlines what has been pretty well  known. There is a movement in this  country away from the great cities to  the small towns of the United States.  This, of course, is the reversal of an  historic trend.  But what does this movement mean  in economic  terms? Mr. Speaker,  it  means  small  business will  become  more influential. Those living in the  small towns and rural areas will buy  and shop in smaller enterprises. This  is very, very important. It may mean a  small business economy.  Unhappily, we know all too well that  small businesses are sometimes taken  over by large businesses. According to  the White House Conference on Small  Business, held in January 1980, when  a large corporation takes over a small  business there is a severing of ties with  local  banks,  local  insurance  firms,  local merchants, local business. Small  business is at the nexus of the small  town economy. Frankly, it is healthy  to have a variety of small entrepre neurs, working in their own business es. It is healthy for the free enterprise  system. We do not need giant corpo rate structures marching about our  ",1981

These  ambitious  and  enterprising  young Americans plan to bike 12,000  miles through 18 nations in an effort  to raise contributions for the interna tional and domestic health education  programs of Project HOPE.  These bikers, on a mission to convey  what is best about American values to  our neighbors around the globe are to  be highly commended. I off er my full  support and urge my colleagues in the  House  of Representatives  to wish  them well on  their World Bike  for  HOPE.e  U.S. AID TO AFRICAN REFUGEES  HON. WILLIAM F. GOODLING  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 20, 1981  e ",1981
152,,97,0.336,838,8,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker,  in  recent weeks, the Committee on For eign Affairs has been involved in the  markup procedure of the fiscal year  1982  foreign  assistance  authorizing  legislation. During debate on the bill,  a number of Members sought to mini mize  the role played by  the United  States in providing for those in Third  World countries facing starvation and  deprivation.  I would submit  that our Govern ment has played-and continues  to  play-a very important role in bring ing relief to the world's needy. Last  month, I  joined a number of our colEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  leagues and a delegation of adminis tration officials in attending a confer ence focusing on African refugee prob lems. The United States made a gener ous pledge of financial assistance at  the conference. Although the cynics  might contend that it was not enough,  I would suggest that we, as Americans,  have much  to be proud of  in  this  pledge, as well as in our annual and  emergency  foreign  assistance meas ures. I, like the editors of the Wash ington Post, feel that our good-faith  efforts  should be measured  against  those who  turn  their backs on  the  world's deprived, and who indeed help  to cause the very problems leading to  their condition.  To quote from a Post editorial of  April 15, 1981:  The West, especially the United States, is  expected to respond with compassion, if not  with guilt. The Soviet Union hides behind  its Marxist cliches and sends in more guns,  which create more refugees.  The editorial in its entirety follows:  THE CYNICS  With depressing regularity, the nations of  the world are asked to band together and  act as a ""community"" to care for the least  fortunate among them. A few years ago it  was Cambodians and Vietnamese, victims of  separate Indochina outrages, for whom in ternational relief was sought. Now it is the  turn of the several million Africans turned  into refugees by a combination of war, civil  strife and economic calamity. Many  lived  harsh  lives  before  they were  uprooted.  Their situation now is scarcely imaginable.  At a meeting in Geneva the other day on  African refugees, the United States offered  $285 million, more than half of what all the  Western nations pledged. There are various  ways  to make  this contribution  look  less  generous than it is. It is said, for instance,  that because the United States has more  blacks, naturally  it gives more. It is said  that this country was  looking  to demon strate that it is not neglectful of African  refugees. It is said that the Reagan adminis tration saw an opportunity to counter some  of the bad publicity its African policy had  otherwise been  receiving. We  suggest  it  would be  fairer  to  say  that  the United  States gave generously and that it did so be cause this administration, like many of its  predecessors,  recognizes  the country's hu manitarian obligations. Why must the mo tives of  the most forthcoming donors be  picked at?  Why not, instead, examine the motives of  those who share in  the responsibility for  generating  the  refugees but who  accept  none of  the responsibility  for  tending  to  their misery? The Soviet Union and its cli ents are deeply and directly involved in the  conflicts whose  human  flotsam  is  now  strewn across Africa. They shunned Geneva.  It is bad enough that Moscow and its clients  do not respond with human feeling and pick  up their share of what ought to be regarded  as a common  international burden. What  makes it sting is the readiness of so many  Third World nations to let them get away  with  it. The West, especially  the United  States, is expected to respond with compas sion,  if not with guilt. The Soviet Union  hides behind its Marxist cliches and sends  in more guns, which create more refugees.e  May 20, 1981  JOINT MARITIME CONGRESS OB SERVES NATIONAL MARITIME  DAY  HON. WALTER 8.

153,,97,-0.259,838,8,Mr. JONES of North Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, as this Congress began, I was  granted  the  privilege  to  serve  the  House and  the American people as  chairman of the Merchant Marine and  Fisheries Committee.  Shortly  thereafter  in a  speech  New York, I declared in part:  in  We will not sit by and watch our maritime  power dissolve. We will  face  the  issues  squarely and do our very best  to  resolve  them in this Congress.  I am glad to report to my colleagues  that the Merchant Marine Committee  has completed its work on this year's  maritime authorization bill, H.R. 2526,  which soon will come before the House  for consideration.  Work on the annual authorization  bill  is an  important prelude  to  the  work the Subcommittee on Merchant  Marine and the full committee will un dertake this year to develop various  bills designed to revitalize our declin ing merchant marine.  We are, to be certain, looking to the  White House to provide timely mari time policy leadership so that the Con gress can meet its challenges of pro viding maritime regulatory reform and  developing promotional policies.  The Nation needs updated maritime  policies that will be in tune with the  realities of  today's governmental cli mate and international commercial re alities.  The United States once possessed  the  largest commercial  fleet  in  the  world. Today,  the United States  is  hardly a maritime power. If we allow  our merchant fleet to continue its de cline, we do so at the risk of complete ly  losing  our Nation's oceanborne  supply line independence in times of  peace and war.  The contributions of our merchant  marine and the men and women who  serve in the maritime industry on land  and sea have  long been  recognized.  This week, however,  those contribu tions merit special recognition nation ally under a Presidential proclamation  which declares May 22  as National  Maritime Day.  In observance of National Maritime  Day, the Joint Maritime Congress, an  association  of  oceangoing American  ship-operating companies, has issued a  ""State of the Industry Report"" which  provides needed focus on the decline  of the U.S. maritime industry. Only by  recognizing the degree of decline can  the Congress and the administration  move forward to create initiatives that  ",1981
154,House,97,-0.671,864,8,Mr. SAVAGE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  proud  that yesterday House Demo crats,  encouraged  by  the  Speaker,  unanimously went on record in opposi tion to President Reagan's social secu rity proposals, especially in regard to  his proposal to cut benefits for early  retirees. Mr. Speaker, yesterday  the  Senate, of all places, passed a sense of  the Senate resolution in opposition to  any proposal that would precipitously  and unfairly penalize early retirees or  reduce benefits to any level more than  necessary  to  achieve  a  financially  sound system.  Ever  since  the Republicans were  swept into power back in November of  last year, they have been harping on  the theme that the American people  want a change-a new beginning.  And President Reagan certainly has  made some changes-although  I am  convinced that most of the American  people will be the worse off because of  his philosophy on the role of Govern ment.  Only yesterday, the House approved  the  conference  report  to President  Reagan's  first  budget  devastation,  thereby serving notice to the poor and  ill placed that they will be shunted  aside to dark and soon-to-be-forgotten  terrain  of  the American  landscape.  Now, following on the heels of that de bacle,  the administration has turned  its stoney glance  in the direction of  millions of Americans who either are  receiving social security benefits or are  potential beneficiaries.  While the plans that the administra tion has  in store for social security  have not yet been formally submitted  to Congress, we do know what is blow ing in the wind. And, what is blowing  in  the wind are proposed sweeping  changes that amount to nothing less  than abrogation of the tenets under girding social security. What is being  proposed  by  the  administration  amounts  to a  retreat from  the firm  pact first established by the Federal  Government  with  the  American  people over 40 years ago as a guaran tee that there would be a way to sup plement their retirement income.  Every one of us here recognizes that  some restructuring of the social secu rity  system  is  necessary  to  insure  sound financial  footing  for  the pro gram in the future. However, this ad ministration, with  its usual blunder buss approach  to matters, has pro posed a series of changes that, once  again, demonstrates its lack of sensi tivity  and  compassion  for  common  folk.  Probably the most egregious exam ple of President Reagan's lack of sensi tivity  for  the plight of  the average  worker who is approaching age 62 and  looking toward his retirement is  the  recommendation  in regard  to  retire ment and survivor's  insurance. Presi dent Reagan has proposed  reducing  the percentage of benefits that per sons who retire at age 62 can expect to  receive, by some 25 percent of the cur rent levels. This proposal would not  only penalize those who are contem plating voluntarily retiring at age 62  but would also penalize those who in voluntarily retire at this age because  of job loss or crippling illness.  Early retirees cannot live on 80 per cent now, so, how can they make it on  social security?  Further, President Reagan wants to  delay cost-of-living increases: Wants to  manipulate the present index for de termining recipients' initial benefits to  reduce these benefits.  The  touted ""mandate  for change""  that the Republicans have been crow ing about is starting to become a reali ty-but the reality is that there is al ready  overwhelming  opposition  to  President Reagan's social security rec ommendations. I submit that the tide  is already beginning to shift-and that  the American people will be  totally  disenchanted with the so-called man date for change by the time the 1984  elections roll around.  In the days and weeks ahead I hope  that we all can join hands and work  out approaches to financing social se curity that are fair and equitable. We  owe  present  recipients  and  future  beneficiaries a better deal than what  this administration has proposed in its  package of misery proposals. We must  stand firm to the principles that un derlie the establishment of the social  security system over 40 years ago.  Let us categorically reject Reagan's  proposals and work  to fashion solu tions that are right by the American  people.  We must not cut costs by reducing  the value of life for our senior citizens,  as well as for the needy.  As one distinguished colleague has  observed, too many of us, Democrats  and Republicans, know the cost of ev erything, but the value of nothing  AGRICULTURAL  COMMODITIES  STORAGE  FACILITY  BANKRUPTCY BILL  <Mr.  ANTHONY  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1981
155,House,97,-0.254,864,8,Mr. ANTHONY.," Mr. Speaker, I am  introducing  today a bill designed  to  provide  relief  to American  farmers  who may in the future have the mis fortune to entrust the produce of their  labors to local grain elevators or ware house  storage  facilities  that  subse quently experience bankruptcy.  This is a growing problem that can  encumber or  tie  down  agricultural  commodities  that are  farmer owned  but held by the elevator awaiting more  favorable prices. Farmers today have  all the risk they can bear. In my State  and district, farmers are still reeling  from the combined effects of drought,  low prices, high interest, and growing  indebtedness. Their ability to continue  to produce is in doubt in many cases.  At the same time, the increasing fre quency of bankruptcy among agricul ture storage facilities has added new  fears and doubts about the ability of  farmers to reclaim their commodities  once  they have  entrusted  them  to  local elevators for storage.  The Secretary of Agriculture has  had an elevator task force at work on  this problem for a number of months.  They  report  that since 1975,  there  have been 177 grain elevator bank ruptcies and more are apparently on  the verge of bankruptcy, given  the  current state of the economy. High in terest rates and the extremely risky  nature of the grain business have com bined to threaten even the best man aged elevators.  When these economic conditions or  poor management are combined with  possible  illegal activity, diversion of  assets, or commodity futures specula tion, the threat to the viability of the  entire agricultural commodity storage  system becomes very real-with farm ers as the innocent victims.  I  commend  the Secretary  for  the  tentative findings of the elevator task  force. This report suggests that higher  performance bonds, more stringent li censing, and closer supervision by the  governmental agencies may reduce or  prevent the problem in the future. I  hope this is so. However, nothing in  the USDA report addresses the prob lem of how to bring relief to farmers  who have entrusted their grain to stor age elevators but have retained title to  it. If a bankruptcy occurs, they are the  most immediate victims of the bank ruptcy and an  innocent party with  little recourse but to await the lengthy  bankruptcy  procedure  in  order  to  ",1981
156,House,97,-0.506,877,8,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  next week  the American  Association  for  the Advancement of  Science  (AAAS),  together with  the  Western Center for Health Planning,  the American Lung Association  of  California,  the U.S. Department  of  Health and Human Services, the Cali fornia Energy Commission, the Inter mountain Consortium for Energy, the  University of California and Sigma Xi,  the Scientific Research Society, are  cosponsoring a  timely and important  conference on ""Energy Independence:  Consequences for Human Health.""  This conference is one of a series the  AAAS has organized throughout the  United States over the past 2 years to  promote  constructive  dialog  among  leaders in government, industry, labor,  community organizations, scientific or ganizations, and other groups, on as pects of our energy concerns.  I am  pleased  to note  that these activities  were possible due to a grant from the  U.S. Department of Energy, which  clearly has a responsibility, under the  law and by commonsense,  to under stand all the ramifications of various  energy strategies. With better under standing  of  the  potential  impacts,  Government policies can be modified  to eliminate or mitigate the most seri ous problems.  The conference next week in many  ways epitomizes the type of multiple  concerns  leaders  in  all  fields must  have. We can no longer look at health  care planning separate  from energy  planning, educational planning, envi ronmental planning, or economic plan ning. Similarly, we can no longer look  at the issue of energy development in  the West, or MX missile deployment  in the West, in isolation from concerns  about community development, water  resources, labor availability, and simi lar factors, which have not traditionally been the concern of energy compa nies,  or  other  institutions with  a  narrow goal or mission. We may try to  proceed with a tunnel-vision approach  to any one of  these major develop ments, but that will only increase the  ultimate costs and disruption which  will follow.  Recent human history  is  replete  with examples of  instances where a  major change in society is attempted  indirectly  through  technological  change, only to be thwarted by public  protests or accomplished at great costs  to the society that change was expect ed to help. Massive new energy proj ects have the potential for great social  disruptions  and  strife. Conferences  such as Energy Independence: Conse quences for Human Health off er hope  that  these  problems  are being  ad dressed in a timely fashion.  What are the human health prob lems associated with major energy de velopments? This  is a question that  several  governmental  agencies  have  been examining for many years. Thou sands of researchers throughout the  country are attempting to obtain an swers, and millions of people are vital ly concerned with the results.  No energy strategy or development  is risk-free. Even energy conservation  has  the potential  to  impair human  health through the increase in indoor  air pollution. Some energy develop ments have even greater risks, howev er, and these adverse impacts must be  minimized, as should indoor air pollu tion.  When looking at the human health  effects of a particular energy strategy,  it is important to consider the entire  fuel cycle-from mining and manufac turing, through combustion or use, to  permanent waste  disposal.  In  the  West, where both coal and uranium  are mined, where much of the combus tion will occur, and where the waste  products will probably end up,  the  consequences of energy development  may be much  larger  than  in other  parts of the country. However, long range transport of pollutants, such as  sulfates from coal combustion, make it  unlikely that any region can be free of  the pollution which escapes as we seek  our goal of energy independence.  The environmental consequences of  increased energy production do have  health implications. Health care costs  will increase if pollution is allowed to  increase. This fact was the subject of a  conference I was privileged to cospon sor in 1978 with former Congressman  Paul G. Rogers, who was known as Mr.  Health, and as an effective protector  of the environment. That conference  in 1978,  the National Conference on  the Environment  and Health Care  Costs, was conducted at a time when  the Congress was being barraged by  complaints that environmental protec tion costs too much.

161,Senate,97,0.196,968,8,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President, there  are three reasons for opposing this com mittee amendment.  The first reason is that, in effect, it  abrogates an international commitment  which was made by this country in 1979  tio replenish the IDA fund.  The second reason is that the funds  made available bv IDA go to the poorest  of the poor countries. Some 75 percent of  the funds go  to countries which have  per capita incomes of less than $360 per  year. Much of that money is used for  agricultural  and  rural  development- much of it in Africa and in India and in  PJ.iaces where there is now acute starva tion.  The final reason, Mr. President, is that  the Reagan administration strongly opto be  poses  this  committee  amendment,  strongly believes that the amount in the  House bill is a necessary part of the ad ministration's foreign policy and a nec essary part of its economic development  policy.  For all those reasons, I believe it is a  most unwise practice for the committee  amendments to be adopted.  ",1981
162,,97,-0.506,1111,8,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  the Subcommittee on Sci ence, Research  and Technology on  which I serve has heard much concern  voiced with respect to the administra tion's deep cuts in selected National  Science Foundation programs. At a  time when the new administration is  embarking on a major effort toward  increased innovation and productivity,  the social and economic sciences have  been so severely cut as to make their  important job of measuring and evalu ating innovations and their effect on  the economy virtually impossible.  Dr. Philip Handler, president of the  National Academy of Sciences,  and  others appearing at  the subcommit tee's recent NSF budget authorization  hearings expressed alarm that cuts in  the Federal science budget were made  without  input  from  scientists  and  others knowledgeable in the sciences  involved. I should like to call my col leagues attention to pertinent excerpts  from Dr. Handler's report to the Acad emy's annual meeting in April. These  appeared on the editor's page of the  May 4, 1981, Chemical and Engineer ing News:  WHO WILL BE NEXT?  Philip Handler is president of the Nation al Academy of Sciences. The following are  some verbatim excerpts  from his annual  report prepared for  the academy's annual  meeting  in Washington, D.C.,  late  last  month.  Given the magnitude of reductions in fed eral expenditures proposed for all agencies  but Defense, the overall science budget was  treated quite fairly; what is troublesome is  not the magnitude but the highly specific  nature of certain reductions and how they  were made.  A substantial  increment  is proposed for  relevant basic and applied research funded  by the Department of Defense, in line with  the general increase in the Defense budget.  These funds should be welcomed as should  the expanded pool of scientists who will  become  somewhat  knowledgeable  of  the  problems of the Defense Department, per haps the final stage of our post-Vietnam  reconciliation. The recommendations of the  Carter budget with respect to increased reEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  search in the natural sciences to be funded  by the National Science Foundation remain  essentially intact.  It is  the Office  of Management  and  Budget proposals for major reductions  in  the  [total] National Science Foundation  budget that are particularly troublesome. It  is not the total reduction that is disturbing;  it is the nature of the individual actions and  the manner of their doing. And the very  limited reprograming authority of the foun dation is insufficient to undo the damage.  The considerable  reduction  in  the pro gram in behavioral science at NSF and the  National Institute of Mental Health strikes  one as peculiarly  ill-advised,  in  that  the  recent  successes  of  neurobiology  have  opened one of the most exciting frontiers of  all of science. The profoundly reduced sup port of social science in the NSF and NIMH  budgets seems interpretable only as a delib erate ideological action, for which the over all program of general reduction in federal  expenditures affords an opportune ""cover.""  It is now evident in the national debate  concerning the validity of supply-side eco nomics, in the confusion as to the possible  consequences of alternative schemes for re duction of taxes, and in the general uncer tainty concerning the social and economic  consequences of reductions in federal social  programs, that the current state of under standing of our society  is  insufficient for  confidence  in any specific social and eco nomic policy. The Administration is about  to launch us on a large experiment, in the  belief that increased technological vitality  and increased innovation and productivity  will correct our economic and social woes  and that this can be achieved by tax reduc tions that will increase the availability of in vestment capital while  industry  is unfet tered of excessive regulation. I most fervent ly hope so. But this vast experiment can be  appraised only  those  trained  in  such  skills-however  unscientific  they  may  appear  to  ""hard"" scientists-are afforded  the means and given  the opportunity so  that, however it all turns out, we may learn  by the experience.  I hope that that was a persuasive, rational  argument. Be that as it may, on a quite dif ferent level I must confess a sense of out rage with the notion that OMB, rather than  appropriate scientists, may dictate which  fields of scholarly endeavor are acceptable  or important at NSF.  Moreover, we natural scientists would be  ill-advised  to  stand  aside  and  allow  the  social scientists to carry that battle. The en tirety of science is a ""seamless web."" If the  government's science budget can be fash ioned by such ideological behavior, which  field of science will next suffer political  attack? There are indications.  If social science can be ordained by OMB  to be outside the federal ken, then the way  is paved. Creationists and Right to Lifers  and the Moral Majority will seek to have  education concerning evolution and human  reproduction expunged from the secondary  schools while exercising pressure to secure  removal  from  the appropriations  to NSF  and NIH of any funds that might be used  for research on evolution or reproductive bi ology. And if the physical scientists are feel ing  relaxed-I  remind  them  of Galileo.  Again, one must hope that Congress will re verse this decision.   if  10835  SETBACK IN RELATIONSHIP  WITH DEVELOPING NATIONS  HON. WILLIAM M.

163,,97,-0.463,1111,8,Mr. BRODHEAD.," Mr. Speaker, by  planning  to vote against  the World  Health Organization's proposed code  regarding the marketing of infant for mula in developing countries, the ad ministration  is  contemplating  an  action which  is both  inhumane and  contrary to the interests of the United  States.  There  is  little serious debate over  the  harmful  effects  of  persuading  mothers  in developing  countries  to  give up breast feeding in favor of com merical infant formula. The incidence  of  disease  and  infant mortality  in  areas where infant formula has been  heavily promoted indicates conclusive ly that the unchecked, unethical ad vertising of this product leads to tragic  results. The seriousness of this prob lem, which has evoked almost univer sal concern, has been challenged only  by those who benefit financially from  the continuation of these practices. At  last, an international organization has  developed a reasonable solution to this  problem, yet all reports are that the  President will instruct our delegation  in Geneva  to oppose  the code, and  that he will not consider the matter  further.  It is no secret that the United States  has suffered setbacks in its relation ships with developing nations. In spite  of massive support  for governments  which  supposedly  have  represented  our interests, we have watched these  governments fall and be replaced by  ones hostile  to our country. Surely,  one reason why this has occurred is  because  the United States has been  perceived as insensitive to the needs of  Third World nations. We have been  seen as more  interested  in our own  short-term economic gain than in de veloping mutually  cooperative  and  beneficial relationships. Our active op position to the infant formula market ing code can only be viewed around  the world as a continuation of  this  type of  insensitivity and selfishness.  Our  country  is  heavily  dependent  upon developing nations, especially as  sources for the raw materials our in dustries need. How  can we  expect  them  to  cooperate with  us  if we  oppose their interests on an issue as  basic as infant health? The answer is  that we cannot.  Instead, we will be  opening  the door  to  acceptance  in  these countries of the doctrines pro moted by the Soviet Union, Cuba, and  other regimes  that prey on internal  dissatisfaction within developing coun tries.

171,House,97,-0.267,1176,8,Mr. BENJAMIN.," I thank the chair man for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R.  3520,  the Steel Industry Compliance  Extension Act of 1981. This legislation  is critical to the economy of northwest  Indiana and  the Nation and  I  com mend Chairmen DINGELL and w AXMAN  for its production and development.  The steel industry experienced tre mendous  difficulties  in  1977.  The  Youngstown plant closing focused na tional  attention  on  its  deep-rooted  problems.  Bethlehem  and  United  States Steel, the Nation's leaders, ra tionalized older facilities. The obvious  trend demanded action.  In short, the industry was retrench ing because of losses and  threats of  more on the horizon. Former Treasury  Under Secretary Anthony Solomon  recommended  the  establishment  of  the Steel Tripartite Committee with  representatives  from  the  industry,  labor, and Government.  The  stretchout  proposal  of H.R.  3520  is a major development of  the  Tripartite Committee. The proposal  has been agreed to by the EPA, United  Steelworkers of America, natural re sources defense council, and several  steel companies.  The steel industry's capital position  matched  to  environmental  require ments is unique. No other industry is  so capital intensive or in need of capi tal-intensive modernization. A  study  by Arthur D. Little & Associates fore casted annual capital requirements of  $7 billion for the industry.  Unfortunately, the industry is only  expected to generate $3.5 billion annu ally for such purposes-consequently,  a significant capital shortfall. At the  same time, pollution abatement co5ts  for  the industry are estimated to be  $1.4 billion by 1982, or $700 million an nually. These estimates are shared or  supported by the Council on Wage and  Price Control, General Accounting  Office and the Office of Technology  Assessment.  H.R. 3520 stretches out the $1.4 bil lion over 5 years, for a savings to the  industry of more than $400 million a  year.  The savings are to be used for mod ernization. The modernization will in crease productivity. Productivity will  assure  competitiveness. Competitive ness will assure  jobs. Jobs will mean  taxes. In short, we are talking econom ics, employment and survivability of  the industry with due consideration of  energy and environmental concerns.  Inland Steel Co.  in northwest Indi ana would have saved approximately  $100 million in environmental expend itures over the past 3 years if it had  been able  to utilize  the stretchout.  This capital would have allowed con struction of a new continuous caster.  The caster would have increased pro duction  and  productivity  in  recent  years.  Essentially, the cost savings df the  missing caster over the past 3 years  and costs related to the operation of  substituted environmental equipment  would'have saved Inland Steel $50 mil lion in current year dollars. This capi tal would have invoked further mod ernization or been used to reduce the  cost of steel products to compete more  effectively with  foreign  steel  pro ducers.  Please note that the unaltered air  quality standards must be met no later  than December 31, 1985, under H.R.  3520. The  stretchout may  only  be  granted in the areas where it will not  significantly  reduce  air quality and  must be accompanied by moderniza tion of the industry.  This legislation does not alter any  OSHA regulations which protect the  workers health and safety. An enforc able schedule of compliance deadlines  is mandated by this legislation. Coke  ovens, along with all other facilities,  must attain 40 percent of total compli ance by the end of 1982 and 100 per cent by the end of 1985.  This legislation will encourage and  facilitate  the modernization  or  re placement of coke ovens, which will  actually assist  the workers and  im prove the community's environment.  It is  imperative  that the Congress  act in an expeditious manner on this  legislat.4ln. The steel  industry must  make co~itments of finances on a  long-term ba.Sls. If the industry is to be  allowed to mc)(:lernize utilizing capital  gained through stretchout legislation,  passage must  '{le  immediate-before  commitments ar~ made for  the 1982  deadlines.  If we  fail  to act,  it  is conceivable  that  this  industry will not be suffi ciently solvent  to meet  the  full  re quirements of the law, which may, of  course, benefit the environment by in activity  but will  dramatically  and  equally impair the economy and the  self-sufficiency of the steel production  for our Nation.  I am proud to join in the sponsor ship of H.R. 3520-the first leg of eco nomic incentives to be considered by  the 97th Congress-and hopefully a  bellringer for domestic steelmaking in  the 1980's.  0 1100  ",1981

173,House,97,-0.3,1189,8,Mr. YOUNG of Missouri.," Mr. Speak er, I rise in support of H.R. 2957, legis lation  to amend  the Federal Water  Pollution Control Act  to delete  the  limitation on  the use of grants  for  publicly owned  treatment works  for  treatment, storage, or conveyance of  industrial wastes.  Mr. Speaker,  I am pleased to  join  the  distinguished  chairman  of  our  Committee  on  Public Works  and  Transportation in supporting the en actment of H.R.  2957. My purpose  here today is to briefly: First, review  the history of the industrial cost ex clusion <ICE) provision of the Federal  Water Pollution Control Act <Public  Law 96-483) and second, urge my col leagues in the House of Representa tives to delete the industrial cost ex clusion  requirement without  further  delay.  The reasons for repeal of industrial  cost exclusion are well documented in  an EPA report on the impact of ICE  sent to Congress in March of 1981.  In the report, EPA concludes that  ICE will have a negative effect on the  EPA grants program. The report also  states that important national water  cleanup projects will be delayed from  1  to 3 years. EPA states that these  delays are environmentally undesira ble.  LEGISLATIVE HISTORY  In 1972 the Congress passed the Na tion's landmark water pollution con trol law, the Clean Water Act <Public  than  Law 92-500). The Clean Water Act set  ambitious goals  for cleaning up our  Nation's waterways by 1985. The Con gress  recognized  that  these  goals  would not be achievable without sub stantial financial assistance to munici palities and treatment authorities to  enable them to construct the new and  upgraded  treatment facilities needed  to meet the act's stringent treatment  requirements. While the construction  of new treatment facilities under the  section 201 grants program has not  proceeded as fast as we all wish, there  have been remarkable  improvements  in our  rivers and  lakes  since 1972.  These improvements would not have  occurred without Federal assistance.  As  the members of the Committee  on Public Works and Transportation  are well aware, industrial cost exclu sion-ICE-was adopted in the closing  days of the 96th Congress as a short term substitute  for another mecha nism contained in the original Clean  Water Act-industrial cost recovery ICR.  The members of this committee, as  well as our colleagues in the Senate,  voted to eliminate industrial cost re covery, because we concluded that our  purpose in establishing industrial cost  recovery was not being achieved.  Unfortunately,  ICE  is worse  the ICR provisions if replaced.  Stated briefly, the industrial cost ex clusion requirement prohibits the use  of Federal construction money to treat  industrial discharges  in excess of a  flow equivalent to 50,000 gallons per  day.  I believe industrial cost exclusion is  a flawed concept for several reasons:  The  committee held  hearings  on  H.R. 2957 and received testimony and  other material from a large number of  industries, cities, trade and profession al associations, and the Environmental  Protection Agency.  Testimony was  overwhelmingly in favor of repealing  the industrial cost exclusion provision.  On the basis of the EPA study, the  testimony of all those concerned, and  our own examination of the issue, the  committee concluded that the indus trial cost exclusion should be repealed.  All available evidence indicates that it  is arbitrary, inequitable, and not likely  to produce significant cost savings to  the Federal Government.  ICE will discourage  joint industrial  municipal  sewage  treatment.  The  original Clean Water Act was ground ed on the concept of joint-treatment  facilities. Such  joint  treatment has  long been considered the most sound  from both an environmental and cost eff ective point of view. We believe the  new law will have a damaging effect  on the environment since  ICE sepa rates  industrial and municipal users  into  arbitrary  classifications.  Joint  treatment facilities provide for more  efficient and ultimately lower use of  resources. Less land, energy, and fewer  people are required in continued oper ation  of  joint  treatment  facilities.  Also, fewer larger facilities are easier  and less costly to manage, operate, and  enforce than a large number of small  treatment facilities. Since continuing  annual costs associated with the above  factors are ultimately greater than the  initial  construction  cost, we  should  strive  to control these at the lowest  possible level. ICE would favor nonre gional  facilities  and  the  aforemen tioned benefits could not be realized.  The 50,000 gallons per day cutoff  stipulated under ICE is discriminatory  in that it has no rational basis. For ex ample, Federal funds will continue to  be available for small  industries dry  industries, and residential users, but  not for wet industries such as brewers  and food processors with a waste flow  in excess of 50,000 gallons per day.  Despite what many would have you  believe, industrial cost exclusion is not  necessary to achieve a level of parity  between  industries  using  publicly  owned  treatment works  and  those  using self-treatment facilities. Various  tax credits already achieve this result.  IMPACT ON MAJOR INDUSTRY  I believe it is worthwhile to review  the impact of industrial cost exclusion  on selected major industrial users.  In St. Louis, near my own congres sional district, Anheuser-Busch, Inc., is  a major water user and as a conse quence,  the brewery discharges over  12, 700,000 gallons per day into the Bis sell Point treatment plant of the Met ropolitan St. Louis Sewer District MSD.  The  impact of  ICE on MSD, An heuser-Busch  and  other  industries  could be serious and far-reaching.  Other St. Louis firms, such as Pet,  Inc., Ralston Purina, Chrysler, Mon santo, and over a dozen hospitals with  daily flows in excess of 50,000 gallons  including the Veterans Memorial Hos pital have told me of the financial bur dens presented by ICE.  The St. Louis brewery of Anheuser Busch is the firm's oldest plant and al ready has the highest manufacturing  costs of any brewery in the system.  The operating costs of this St. Louis  facility are substantial. These costs,  however, will be increased dramatical ly when industrial cost exclusion goes  into effect. It should also be pointed  out  that  ICE will  adversely  affect  MSD's new Meramec River plant for  which step 2 funds will not be avail able until 1982.  In urban areas such as St. Louis,  these older plants provide needed jobs  and tax revenue. I believe the poten tial costs of industrial cost exclusion  will weigh heavily in any future ex pansion  or modernization  decision.  With respect to shifting production ca pabilities out of the older, urban areas  of the Midwest and Northeast into the  Nation's Sun Belt, it can be safely as",1981

Rarely in public  life does one encounter a man who  combines the public and private sides  of his life so easily, and to such good  purpose, as Frank Lanterman.  I suppose Frank's outstanding qual ity was his bluntness. When he saw  good he praised it and left it alone.  And when he  saw bad he did not  engage in political sophistries to justi fy it, but roared as loudly as he knew  how and acted swiftly to change it. A  powerful and very capable assembly man, Frank worked most energetically  to protect those least able to care for  themselves, the mentally ill. He was,  of course, responsible for much of the  legislation protecting  their constitu tional rights in the State of California.  ",1981

178,House,97,-0.194,1215,8,Mr. NELSON.," Mr. Speaker, on May  12,  1981,  the General Accounting  Office  issued a ""Report to the Con gress"" which began with a chilling sen tence:  The Federal Government is not now pre pared to handle a long-term national or re gional disruption in electric power, from an  act of war, sabotage, or terrorism.  I need not point out the devastating  results of such an event. Virtually no  segment  of  activity  in  the United  States is free from reliance on electric  power. To put the impact of such an  outage in perspective, GAO examined  a specific region of the United States.  In that region, it found that<Rifle> damage to a single <utility) substa tion could leave a key military facility with out power;  Damage to just four substations could dis rupt power to one city for up to a year; and  An attack on just eight substations could  disrupt power to an entire region for a long  time.  The crucial factor here, beyond our  obvious dependence on electric power,  is the decentralized nature of the elec tric power generation and distribution  system  in  this country. Some 3,500  utility companies produce electricity  at almost 11,000 generating facilities  in  the United  States.  Thus,  the  number  of  potential  targets, many  with minimal or no security,  is stag gering.  Further, these many companies are  interconnected in three primary grid  systems. This  interconnected system  permits utilities to assist each other in  meeting  temporary  demand  peaks.  However,  the same grid system can  serve to spread the disaster, at least  temporarily.

There was also the added exhilarating fea ture of rolling into first place from behind,  even though there was only a very small  margin of points between  the competing  teams. The first eight were separated by  only 47 points out of a possible 3,000, and a  slim 14 points between the top four, as it  came down to the finish line.  In each of the five categories-operations,  maintenance,  security police,  communica tions  and, civil  engineering-experts  are  pitted against experts.

This legislature will be a model 3day session, and will be comprised of  134 representatives, age 60 and over,  elected throughout the State by their  peers.  The silver-haired legislature will pro vide these individuals with an under standing of the legislature process. It  will allow them to devlop a forum for  senior citizens to set their own legisla tive priorities, and it .will educate the  public and Government officials on  the  issues and concerns  that affect  West Virginia's older population.  The silver-haired legislature concept  has already proven to be a success in  eight States, and in some cases, silver haired legislative bills have served as a  basis  for new State  laws. For  this  reason, I would like to thank and com mend the West Virginia Commission  on Aging  for organizing  the  silver haired legislature so that senior citi zens in West Virginia can have a simi lar experience.  The silver-haired legislature concept  is an excellant forum for elderly citi zens from diverse social, economic, and  geographic backgrounds to determine  their  legislative  priorities.  Because  they receive training and firsthand ex perience in drafting bills, determining  costs,  hearing  testimony  and  floor  debate, the bills tend to be reasonable,  10965  realistic, and feasible responses to the  needs of the elderly.  At a time when older Americans are  facing severe hardships due to infla tion and the elimination of important  assistance programs, this silver-haired  legislature will  allow  them  to voice  their  opinions  and  to make  their  voices heard.

184,Senate,97,0.333,1267,8,Mr. MATTINGLY.," Mr. President,  I  would like to say a few words in praise  of one of the finest men ever to serve in  Congress. Carl Vinson died  last night,  but the legacy of his record 50 years in  Congress  lives on. He understood  that  America can only have peace through a  strong national defense. That was true  in 1915 when he first went to Congress,  it was true when he retired in 1965, and  it is  just as true today.  In his 50 years on Capitol Hill, Repre sentative Vinson served nine Presidents  from Woodrow Wilson to Lyndon John son.  Johnson,  in  fact, was placed on  Vinson's committee when he first arrived  in Washington in 1937. Johnson always  credited Vinson with teaching him the  ways of Congress, something that served  him well when he became majority lead er of the Senate.  As  chairman of  the House Armed  Services Committee from 1946  Vinson fought to further strengthen our  military forces. But the little man from  Milledgeville was not a wed by Army or  Navy brass. He always demanded a dol lar's worth of defense for every dollar  aopropriated. But it was through Repre sentative Vinson's efforts that America  did not totally dismantle its Navy dur ing the Great Depression. As chairman  of the Navy Affairs Committee from 1931  to 1946, he fought for a modern Navy. In  October 1962, Vinson wrote:  to 1965,  Mistakes have been made, and more mis takes are to be expected. We have not, how ever, made the mistake of doing nothing.  This is advice we should heed in 1981.  Of all the great Georgians who have  served in Congress, I would put Repre sentative Vinson at  the  top with  the  legendary Senator Richard Russell. We  remember his contributions to our Na tion and praise them. We also pledge to  follow his example of service.  ",1981
185,House,97,-0.343,1306,8,Mr. PERKINS.," Mr.  Speaker,  on  May 5, 1981, by unanimous voice vote,  the Committee  on  Education  and  Labor ordered reported the bill H.R.  3337, which extends the authorization  for the youth employment and demon stration programs under title IV-A of  the Comprehensive Employment and  Training Act through fiscal year 1982  CH. Rept. 97-36). Since the authoriza tion of appropriations for the youth  programs  expired  last  September,  these programs are currently funded  under the resolution continuing appro priations for fiscal year 1981. On May  12, the Senate passed S. 1070, an iden tical  version  of H.R.  3337,  under  unanimous consent.  H.R. 3337 was authored by Congress man AUGUSTUS F. HAWKINS, chairman  of our Subcommittee on Em11>loyment  Opportunities which has  jurisdiction  over the CETA program; the ranking  minority member of that subcommit tee, Mr. JEFFORDS, and myse~f. At the  time that the committee ordered H.R.  3337  reported, Mr.  ASHBROOK,  the  ranking minority member of the com mittee, and Mr.  JEFFORDS  requested  that the bill be brought to the floor as  quickly as possible under suspension  of the rules.  Historically, the youth employment  and training programs now authorized  under title IV-A have enjoyed broad  bipartisan support in the Congress as  well as strong endorsements from the  business community,  labor organiza tions,  and  public  interest  groups.  While the committee has not received  any formal comments on this legisla tion from the administration, it is our  . understanding  that  they  do  not  oppose  this  reauthorization of  title  IV-A.  The committee's bill authorizes such  sums as may be necessary for title IV A of CETA for fiscal year 1982, leaving  the amount to be funded in the discre tion of the Appropriations Committee  and  the appropriations process. The  amount available for youth programs  under CET A will ultimately be subject  to the budget ceiling for function 500,  as  finally adopted by  the Congress,  and the recommendation of the Ap propriations Committee for the level  of  funding  for  the  respective  pro grams,  including youth employment,  under that function.  I urge my colleagues to suspend the  rules and adopt H.R. 3337. The pro grams which  this  bill  reauthorizes  have served over 1,060,000 disadvan taged youth from  their inception in  fiscal year 1978  through the end of  fiscal year 1980. With youth unem ployment consistently hovering at or  just below 20 percent-or in excess of  50  percent  for  inner  city minority  youth-we  cannot  allow  these  pro grams of demonstrated effectiveness  to expire next year. The Senate real ized this when they adopted the iden tical bill S. 1070 several weeks ago. It  is my sincere hope  that we  in  the  House do likewise today    ",1981

As you know, during the 96th Con gress the House moved with deliberate  speed to approve H.R. 6711, the Youth  Act of 1980. Since it was not possible  for  the Senate  to consider  its bill  before adjournment, H.R. 3337 is nec essary to extend the authorization for  youth employment and demonstration  programs through 1982.  The extension of title IV gives the  Congress the much needed time to de velop a comprehensive youth employ ment bill. Our youth unemployment  rate  is an alarming 16 percent and  among our Nation's minority youth it  stands at 40 percent. We cannot stand  idly by and let our Nation's most valu able  resources-our  youths-waste  away.  As  summer  approaches, Congress  should give special attention  to  the  plight  of  our  Nation's  inner-city  youths. We should keep the present  youth  employment mechanism  in  place for now, so that our Nation's dis advantaged youths may use their un limited energy developing resourceful  and constructive  job  skills  to help  themselves as well as their communi ties. If we fail to act on this measure,  we may  see  countless  idle  young  people on the streets of our cities in  to  this  should not allow  1982. We  happen.  I strongly urge my colleagues to sup port this measure.e  ",1981

The Clerk read as follows:  H.R. 1100  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  That this  Act may be cited as the ""Prisoner of War  Benefits and Health-Care Services Act of  1981"".

188,House,97,0.049,1319,8,Mr. LEATH of Texas.," I  gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to say at  this time that I want to commend the  gentleman from Mississippi, our distin guished chairman, ""General"" MONT GOMERY, and of course our ranking mi nority member,  the gentleman from  Arkansas <Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT)  for  continuing the great tradition of this  outstanding committee for having the  most nonpartisan committee  in  the  Congress, and commend  the gentle man from Pennsylvania <Mr. EDGAR)  for the fine job that he has done on  the bills that are before us today.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 2039. H.R. 2039 as reported is a  bill to amend chapter 37 of title 38,  United States Code, to authorize the  Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to  guarantee hoi:ne loans with provisions  for variable payment plans. The loans  would be limited to the acquisition of  one-family dwelling units, which  in clude  condominiums  and  mobile  homes. The maximum loan principal  <including all interest to be deferred  and added thereto) would be based on  the projected value of  the property  calculated by adding an amount up to  2.5 percent per year, but not to exceed  115 percent, to the reasonable value of  the property as determined by the Ad ministrator. The reported bill contains  exception from any State law prohibit ing interest on interest, or requiring   minimum amortization.  Mr. Speaker,  the objective of  the  loan guaranty program is to facilitate  and encourage the extension of credit  on favorable terms by private lenders,  to eligible veterans for the purchase,  construction, repair, alteration, or im provement of homes to be occupied by  veteran purchasers. With the current  rate of interest that must be paid on  VA home  loans,  it  is my hope and  belief that H.R. 2039 will provide some  relief for young veterans who would  otherwise  be  unable  to  purchase  homes.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of  H.R. 2039.  ",1981
189,House,97,0.167,1319,8,Mr. SAWYER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 2039, a bill to authorize the Vet erans' Administration  to  guarantee  home loans with provisions for vari able payment plans.  The Congress in 1944 made it possi ble for the young servicemen return ing from World War II to realize the  American dream of homeownership.  Amendments to the law from time to  time made  this benefit available  to  Korean conflict and Vietnam-era vet erans.  This basic benefit, Mr. Speaker, has  made  it  possible  for  thousands  of  young veterans  to enter  the home  buying market.  Today's spiraling mortgage interests  rates and the inflated price of hous ing, however, have virtually eliminated  the GI home  loan program and  its  availability  to young Vietnam veter~  ans.  If the Nation's veterans are to have  any hope of becoming homeowners as  intended by Congress, then it is neces sary  that we  embrace  alternative  methods of financing.  The bill before us authorizes  the  Veterans' Administration to guarantee  home loans that are financed in the  same manner as  the Department of  HUD's graduated payment mortgage.  This program as set forth in the bill  before us will allow a veteran to pur chase a house with a reasonable down payment and  lower  initial monthly  payments  in  the early years of his  loan.  The mortgage payments rise gradu ally for a certain number of years and  then level off and remain constant for  the balance of the mortgage. It will  enable the young veteran to tailor his  monthly payments to meet his increas ing income.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is necessary .if  today's young veteran is to be able to  buy a home under the GI bill. I urge  its approval.  0 1330  ",1981
190,,97,-0.171,1345,8,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to speak to H.R. 1990, a bill to revise  the present formula of equal propor tions and  implement  the Hamilton Vinton method. Although  there are  several methods of apportionment, we  favor  the Hamilton-Vinton  strongly  method.  I would like to bring to the attention  of  our House  colleagues  a  recent  study, entitled ""The Apportionment  Formula Question,"" written by David  Huckabee of  the Congressional Re search Service, Library of Congress.  This fine Huckabee study discusses  and analyzes the various reapportion ment methods. It points out the many  advantages  of  the Hamilton-Vinton  method and describes  the  fair and  equitable  approach  taken  by  this  method. Most importantly, Hamilton Vinton has no inherent built-in bias  toward small States while honoring  the ""quota"" system and the concept of  ""one man, one vote."" In addition,  it  fully analyzes the difficulties and defi ciencies of the existing formula-the  method of equal proportions.  I commend this excellent study to  the attention of our colleagues and re quest that the study be reprinted in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  THE APPORTIONMENT FORMULA QUESTION  In 1941, after 150 years of study and  debate, the Congress adopted the ""method  of equal proportions"" as the formula for ap portioning House seats. This method was  endorsed by a special study committee of  the National Academy of Sciences in 1929 as  ""preferred by the committee"" and is still in  use today.1 Now in 1981, the equal propor tions apportionment formula has been chal lenged because it allegedly has ""cheated the  larger States, given undue representation to  the smaller ones, and violated both the Su preme Court's one-man, one vote rule and  the intent of the Founding Fathers.'' 2  If congressional district boundaries could  cross State lines, there would be no appor tionment problems. All districts would be  approximately equal in population <519, 234  persons in 1980 based on a House of Repre sentatives size of 435). Since this solution is  not possible,  any apportionment method  will result in unequal district populations  among States. The 1981 apportionment pro duced by the method of equal proportions  results in a range of congressional district  sizes from Montana's two districts averaging  393,345 persons  to South Dakota's single  district of 690,178 persons.  The  apportis;>nment  formula  debate  in  modem  times  has  centered  around  six  methods:  equal  proportions, major  frac tions,  harmonic mean,  greatest  divisors,  smallest  divisors,  and  the  ""Hamilton Vinton"" method, sometimes referred to as  largest fractions. This report will briefly de scribe each method, emphasizing the ""goal""  of each formula rather than the mathemat ical mechanics which produce  the appor tionment. The Hamilton-Vinton method will  be described first because it is the method  that is intuitively understandable, and it is  based on the concept of a State's ""quota"" of  representatives.  1 U.S. Congress.

Off., 1970, p. 21.  2Balinskl, M. L. and H.P. Young. ""When House  Seats Shift, Fractions Count."" Washington Post,  Nov. 30, 1980, p. D5.  THE HAMILTON-VINTON METHOD  To reapportion the House using Hamilton Vinton, each State's population  is divided  by the ""ideal"" size congressional district <in  1981, 225,867,174/435=519,234). States with  fewer than 519,234 persons receive a seat be cause the Constitution requires each State  to have at least one House seat. The remain ing States in most cases have a claim to a  whole number and a fraction of a Repre sentative. Each State  receives  the whole  number of seats it is entitled to, and those  States with the largest fractions get seats  until the fixed House size <435) is reached.  If every State in 1981 was given a seat for a  fraction  larger than one half,  the House  would have 438 Members. In order to adjust  the House size downward, those States with  smallest fractions over one half would lose  seats until 435 seats were reached.  If this method had been used  in 1981,  California would have receive'd 46 instead of  45 seats, Indiana 11 instead of 10, Montana  1 instead of 2, and New Mexico 2 instead of  3. In fact, five States with smaller fractions  than California and Indiana received seats  in the 1981 reapportionment.  California with a ""quota"" of 45.584 seats  and  Indiana, with 10.754 were  ""rounded  down"" rather than up by the current appor tionment formula. The States with smaller  fractions, Colorado with 5.564, Kansas with  4.552, Nevada with 1.540, Montana with  1.516, and New Mexico with 2.504, were  rounded up.  According to recent research, the Hamil ton-Vinton method has  the property of  being neutral regarding favoring or disfa voring large or small States.' This method  which was used in various forms during the  period from 1850 to 1900 was discovered to  be subject to two ""paradoxes,"" the Alabama  paradox, and the population paradox.  The Alabama paradox was discovered in  1880 when Alabama lost a seat when the  House was increased in size from 299 to 300.   This paradox,  in which a State may  lose  representation for no other reason than the  House size is increased, may no longer be an  important factor if the House size remains  fixed at 435.  The second paradox, known as the popula tion paradox, has been variously described,  but in its modem form <with a fixed size  house> it works in this way: Two States may  gain population  from one census  to  the  next. State ""A"" which is gaining population  at a rate faster than State ""B"" may lose a  seat to State ""B.'' This paradox occurs very  rarely in apportionments.   If the Congress wishes to adopt an appor tionment system which comes as close as  possible to satisfying ""quota,"" and is math ematically neutral between large and small  States current research suggests that Ham ilton-Vinton  is  the  most  appropriate  method. Previous Congresses rejected this  method because of the ""paradoxes.''  The methods which are described below  are often referred to as the ""modem meth ods"" of apportionment which were devel oped  to a.void  above.  the ""paradoxes"" described  M. L. Balinski and H.P. Young. ""Apportionment  Schemes and the Quota Method."" American Math ematical Monthly, vol. 84, No. 6, June-July 1977, p.  450.   Schmeckebier, Laurence F. ""Congressional AP  portionment.""

191,,97,0.372,1358,8,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, Attor ney General William French Smith re cently  addressed members  of  the  American Law Institute on the subject  of busing, quota systems, and discrimi nation. I found his remarks to be re freshing and challenging and I com mend them to your attention.  At this point I wish to insert in the  RECORD  the speech of  the Attorney  General, May  22,  1981,  before  the  American Law Institute:  ADDRESS OF HON. WILLIAM FRENCH SMITH,  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES  As a longtime member of the ALI, I am especially pleased to be addressing you today.  Recognizing this organization's long-stand ing commitment  to  the  improvement of  American law, I have chosen to speak today  on a  subject of great, continuing signifi cance  to all Americans:  racial discrimina tion.  On this subject, the goals of government  must be clear. It is basic to the very idea of  America that discrimination on the basis of  race must be eliminated and the effects of  prior  discrimination must  be  effectively  remedied. In both respects, the history of  government action has been less than satis factory.  For most of our life as a Nation, govern ment has differentiated between individuals  on the basis of race. First, to further segre gation. Later, to remedy segregation and its  effects. In both instances, discrimination by  government on the basis of race has divided  our people and retarded the development of  a just society. The ideals of America require  that, one day, all government action must  be color-blind. When that day comes, the in juries to individuals would be redressed by  government on the basis of the actual depri vations suffered by the affected individuals.  Ultimately,  just society, government  must not require either racial balance or  racial separation-and government must not  guarantee  any  individual  a  result based  upon his or her race. Having  recognized  those goals, however, we must also recognize  that they have not always been well-served  by government throughout the past.  Less then fifty years ago the Department  of Justice moved into its present building on  Constitution Avenue. Over the entrance to  that building is engraved the inscription:  ""Justice in the Life and Conduct of the  State Is Possible Only As It First Resides in  the Hearts and Souls of the Citizens.""  When those words were first etched in stone  in 1934, racial justice clearly did not fill the  hearts and souls of all our citizens nor fully  in a  June 1, 1981  the  the  life and conduct of  characterize  State.  In the Nation's capital itself there were  separate  facilities  for blacks. As William  Manchester recounts in ""The Glory and the  Dream"":  ""Department stores, movies and govern ment cafeterias were closed to them. Black  workmen digging  the  foundations of  the  new Justice Department building ... either  brought their lunches or went hungry; even  if they wanted a glass of water they had to  walk two miles ... to find a restaurant that  would serve them.""  Throughout much of  the country, most  public schools were  legally segregated-as  were public accommodations, buses, and res taurants. Blacks were stigmatized by dis crimination  that most Americans  today  have not experienced and many can hardly  imagine.  The injustice was not of recent duration.  It had existed in our life and laws since the  country's beginnings. In 1776, agreement on  our Declaration of Independence was made  possible only by a compromise that omitted  black slaves from the principle that all men  are created equal. Eleven years  later the  Constitution ratified the inferior status ac corded black slaves. In 1820, Thomas Jeffer son was moved to write that the compro mise over slavery: "" ... like a firebell in the  night awakened and filled me with terror. I  considered it the knell of the Union.""  Indeed, it nearly was. Only a civil war and  nearly another half century produced the  Emancipation Proclamation. Yet even that  document  failed  to  guarantee  equality  before the law and could not erase the prej udice in the hearts and souls of many citi zens.  An old story recounts Abraham Lincoln's  signing that historic document. He took his  pen, slowly dipped it in the ink, moved his  hand to sign, held it for a moment, but then  put down  the pen. After a moment,  the  President again repeated the same sequence  and did not sign. He turned to Secretary  Seward and said:  ""I have been shaking hands since early  this morning, and my right arm is nearly  paralyzed. If my name ever goes into histo ry, it will be for this act, and my whole soul  is in it. If my hand trembles when I sign the  Proclamation, all who examine  the docu ment hereafter will say: 'He hesitated!'""  For nearly a century after the signing of  the Proclamation, the country still hesitat ed in its efforts to guarantee all citizens the  equality they deserved by right.  Only in 1954 did the country truly begin  to act. In Brown v. Board of Education, the  Supreme Court at last ruled that in the  sphere of public education racial discrimina tion by the state was unconstitutional. Al though some still hesitated, by late in the  1950s government earnestly began the long  overdue process of ensuring that American  law would henceforth and in every way be  truly color-blind. Congress passed the 1957,  1960, and ~964 Civil Rights Acts; the Voting  Rights Act; and the Fair Housing Act. The  Supreme Court continued  to expand  the  pursuit of equal  justice. Successive Presi dents and Attorneys General-irrespective  of party-acted  to  enforce  those  rights.  Nearly  two  centuries of hesitation were  punctuated by  three decades of  remedial  action.  After so many decades of inaction, the na tional government-and especially the Su preme Court-pursued both prospective and  retrospective remedies. Efforts were made  ",1981

Mr. Nyborg has  been nominated by President Reagan to  be our country's Ambassador to Finland.  I am very proud to have been involved in  proposing Keith Nyborg for this impor tant post because he possesses unique  qualifications.  Mr. Nyborg is a graduate of Ashton  High School and attended Ricks College.  He served 2 years in the U.S. Army as a  personnel administrative specialist in the  classification and assignment sectiop. at  Fort Riley, Kans. He first came to know  Finland as a missionary for the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in  Helsinki  from  to  later  served as interpreter and guide for the  U.S.  olympic  team  during  the  olympics in Helsinki. Mr. Nyborg is cur rently a  farmer and rancher in Idaho  having owned and operated the Finlan dia Ranch since 1957 where he raises  cattle and grows Potatoes,  seed peas,  hay and barley.  Mr. Nyborg is a distinguished civic and  community leader in Idaho. He current ly holds positions of leadership in numer ous agricultural associations as well as  being active in his church. He is a mem ber of the boards of directors of the Re gional Farmers Grain Cooperative and  Idaho Cooperative Council and is presi1959. He  1952  1952  dent of  the board of  the Yellowstone  Grain Growers, Inc. He is also president  of the Board of the Fremont Cooperative  Supply in Ashton and president of the  Boone Creek Canal Co. He is a past mem  ber of the Fremont-Madison Cattlemen's  Association and secretary of the Idaho  Chapter of the National Society of Range  Management.  Mrs. Nyborg, who I know will gracious ly support her husband in this post, is a  native of Finland. She is fluent in the  Finnish language as is Mr. Nyborg. Their  daughter Lisa has studied at a University  in Finland. The whole family, which also  includes two sons, Mike and Bruce, speak  Finnish  in  their  home  as  a  second  language.  Keith Nyborg has a sincere love and  respect for the Finnish people. Knowing  the language and the culture and the  continued affiliation he has had with Fin land over the past 30 years are assets  which will serve both the Nyborg family  and our country well. I am confident in  saying that Keith Nyborg, will also serve  in a capacity that will reflect well our  Nation's foreign policy and friendship  with the Finnish people. I truly believe  that President Reagan has made an out standing nomination and I look forward  to Mr. Nyborg's confirmation here in the  Senate.

196,Senate,97,-0.38,94,14,Mr. EAGLETON.," Mr. President, over  the past few weeks I have put a number  of statements in the REcoRD concerning  the tobacco program and the direction in  which it is headed. Concern has been  raised that the current program is im pacting the ability Qf our  to  compete on the world market and that  the program is facing a time when 1t is  likely to cost the taxpayers several hun dred million dollars.  It should be pointed out that there are  those who are interested enough in the  continuation of the program to seek an  intermediate position between a  elimination of the program and the sta tus quo. An example of this is an editorial  from the July 22, 1981, New.s and Ob server, from Raleigh, N.C. While I  do  not n~ agree with all aspects of  this editorial, I think it shows determina tion by some to objectively review this  total  program.  Mr. President, I ask consent that this  editorial,  ""Storm Over Tobacco,..  be  printed in the RECORD.  The editorial follows:  STOllK OVER TOBACCO  Strong opening day bidding for fiue-cured  tobacco on the Border Belt brought a ray of  good news tor the state's economy. But storm  clouds have gabb.ered. over the federal tobacco  program.  While farmers rejoice at the prospect of an  especially profitable season, they also ought  to reassess whether the federal program can  continue unaltered. It may well be necessary  to change the price support system to save it.  The federal tobacco program serves as a  social and cultural glue, as well as an eco nomic bond, in Eastern North Carolina. Elim ination of the program would hurt the state  in the short-term and cause enormous mod11lcation in the state's farm structure over  the long term.  A measure to phase out the program, pre pared  by Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum.  D.-Ohio, ought to be defeated. Secretary of  Agriculture John R. Block helped the cause  when he pledged to work against the legisla tion. But  the Reagan administration and  North carolinians in Congress should coop erate in an overhaul of the program.  Rep. Charles Rose may have provided a  vehicle for such a reassessment.

198,House,97,-0.499,120,14,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Speaker, the ques tion is whether the House is going to  be able to assert a little self-control, or  whether we  are going  to have  the  country believe that we did a  lot of  things that nobody here supports be cause we could not help  it. We are  talking not  about whether  or not  there ought to be a tax cut, and not  about whether or not there ought to  be what kind of tax cut, but whether a  series of provisions that are admitted  by almost all sides to have no merit  ought to be locked in.  The gentleman from Missouri said  that we needed a tight rule to prevent  the escalation of the bidding process.  The tight rule serves the function of  locking in the results of the bidding  process. The gentleman from Texas  said that the eyes of Texas were upon  us.  Mr. Speaker, I do not object to the  eyes of Texas being upon me; I object  to  the hands of Texas being  in my  pockets, because when we put into this  bill special provisions for the oil indus try that only about 15 Members of  this body are prepared to def end on  the merits, we make an error.  I believe that the chairman of the  Ways and Means Committee tried very  hard to avoid this. He did not initiate  this bidding process. He tried to get a  clean  bill. That  happened  on  the  Senate side, and then the President  decided that he would break from the  cleanliness standard.  I do not know  that anyone went down to the White  House and  forced  the President  to  foreswear  cleanliness.  I  suppose he  still has the other 11 Boy Scout vir tues, but he gave up cleanliness volun tarily.  The only question before us now in  this rule is, do we commit ourselves to  vote  on  these  provisions without  change. I talked earlier about the re verse Houdini, when politicians say to  the voters, -""Oh, I didn't want to do  this terrible thing but I couldn't help  it,"" having put themselves in that po sition.  Well, you are about to have to vote  on two bills, the Democratic and Re publican bills, which both do  things  for the oil industry which are unneces sary; both have about as much effect  on production as if we went down to  the harbor and gave the Moon a little  help with the tides. They do not need  that  tax  relief.  It is  simply extra  dough that we are pouring on them.  The question is, are we going to vote  for a  rule which prevents us  from  stopping this? I do not think that the  people on the other side on the whole  like the idea. We, however, are about  to force ourselves to do it.  I sympathize with and admire the  job that our leadership has done to  avoid this, but the final step is here. I  believe at  this date,  if we were  to  reject  the  rule  and  put  in  order  amendments to make these bills neu tral from  the standpoint of oil, we  would have no effect on the outcome  of which bill won. We would save bil lions  of  dollars  for  the American  people. Anybody who votes  to  lock  this in and give the oil companies un needed billions so that the bidding for  Conoco can go up and other things can  go up, please do not go and tell your  people you are sorry you cut social se curity, that you cut school lunches or  that you cut other things, not when  you have given away oil revenues that  exceed the amount of some of those  cuts.

199,House,97,-0.564,120,14,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker, it has been  said here by people on both sides that  this is the largest tax bill in the histo ry of this Nation, and yet here we are  with a rule which permits 2 hours of  general debate and 1 hour on each of  two amendments, a  substitute  from  Mr. UDALL and a substitute from the  Republican side. I gather that there is  such confidence in how quickly we can  dispose of this massive piece of legisla tion that there will be another bill be sides the tax bill scheduled to be con sidered today. This, in the face of the  fact that both the Democratic bill and  the Republican  substitute  are  dis graceful pieces of legislation. I happen  to think that the Democratic bill  is  slightly less disgraceful than the Re publican,  but  both  are  disgraceful  bills.  I had occasion to say when we were  discussing  the budget that it was a  ""drop dead America"" budget. This tax  bill drives the nail into the coffin of  America because when we have  the  kind of rate of increase in defense ex penditures,  three  times  the  rate of  Vietnam,  $1.635  trillion  over  the  course of the next 5 years, and instead  of increasing taxes to take care of that  kind of expenditure, we cut taxes, we  are asking for chaos in the American  economy. I am amazed at the Republi cans doing that, after the example of  Lyndon Johnson.    I happen to think that this rule is a  bad rule. I am going to vote against it.  I  agree with my Republican  col leagues, the minority on the Republi can side, who want to defeat the previ ous question.  I am going to support  them in that as well, but I hope that  they understand the inherent logic of  their position. It means that if they  vote  against  the previous  question,  that they are in fact committing them selves to a position that the oil give aways in both the Democratic and Re publican bills are unacceptable, and I  ",1981
200,House,97,-0.042,133,14,Mr. HANCE.," Mr. Chairman, I appre ciate the time. Rather than give a gen eral statement, I want to talk on two  specific issues right now. I have a gen eral statement which I would like to  save until later in the debate.  Those two issues are the deficit, and  my colleagues are hearing a lot about  that, and the other has to do with the  trigger. Many people say, ""What about  the Conable-Hance bill and the defi cits  that may be projected  in  the  future?"" I would point out we are deal ing with static figures. These are esti mates that the Treasury has to use for  the future. These are only projections.  If my colleagues  look back to the  Kennedy tax cut in 1962, the Treasury  predicted at that time, using static fig ures, a  loss of revenue of $89 billion  between 1963 and 1968. But what hap pened is  they  increased revenues by  $54 billion, so they were off by $144  billion. There was more money coming  in.  That  is  exactly what  is going  to  happen when we stimulate the econo my and things get rolling.  I think back to less than 3 years ago  on  the Steiger  amendment. People  said that it was going to lose money  and revenues are going to be down. It  is going to increase the deficit, they  said. The Treasury once again, using  static figures, which they have to use,  said that the loss of revenue would be  $1. 7 billion, but the gain in revenue in  the first year was $1.8 billion;  they  missed the projection by $3.5 billion.  I think that proves the fact that the  static figures for the future are just  not going to hold up. We are going to  see an increase in revenues and if we  are ever going to balance the budget  we have got to have a healthy econo my to do it.  The other thing I want to mention  just briefly has to do with the trigger.  The trigger is based on the administra tion's assumptions. But  for  that  to  work one has to have the administra tion's budget cut and tax cut. So it is a  trigger that will never be pulled.  ",1981
201,House,97,-0.267,133,14,Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota.," Mr.  Chairman, I would like to make a few  comments with  respect  to how we  ought to analyze these tax bills.  Let me make  a  couple of points  about middle-income people. Middle income people in this country in the  1970's have had six times the size of  the  tax  increases because of  infla tion-bracket creep-than have those  with $200,000 a year in income, and  yet some say we  should give  them  both 10 percent tax relief. I think that  is fundamentally unfair.  Let us look at small business. The  fact is small business produces 48 per cent of the private sector gross nation al  product  in America. They  also  ought to get 48 percent of the tax cut.  Ten-five-three directs 75  percent of  the tax cut in the business sector to  business firms of $200 million or more  in assets. I think that is wrong.  Business Week says  that  in 1960,  corporations  in this country paid 23  percent of the income tax load. Under  the President's tax proposal, by 1986,  they will pay 7 percent of the tax load.  I  think both bills are flawed. I am  concerned. We ought to be getting the  best of both rather than the worst of  each in tax reform, and I am not very  impressed with the tax reform efforts  that have been discussed in this House  in the past couple of months .  .  '  ",1981
202,House,97,0.194,146,14,Mr. DUNCAN.,"  Mr.  Chairman,  among its many valuable features, the  President's tax proposal includes sev eral strong savings incentives. First, it  includes a tax exclusion of $1,000 per  person for interest earned on certain  1-year certificates of deposit.  The certificates would be issued be tween October 1, 1981, and December  31,  1982. Mr. Chairman, at a  time  when our savings rate  is  the  lowest  since 1954, and the lowest of any in dustrialized nation,  this program  to  encourage savings is sorely needed.  However, in no case will any institu tion be required to lend more than 75  percent of its net increase in deposits.  This  recognizes  that  in many cases  persons will close  their passbook ac counts or regular certificate accounts  in order to open up a tax-exempt cer tificate. Thus the financial institutions  should  not  be  required  to  lend  amounts which do not reflect a real in crease in deposits.  After  the  tax-exempt  certificates  expire, the President's proposal estab lishes a new general interest exclusion  feature. Specifically,  individuals will  be able to exclude from taxation up to  15 percent of their first $3,000 of in terest  income. This means a  single  person would have a maximum exclu sion of $450;  and a married couple  would have a $900 exclusion.  It contains a safeguard to curb ex cessive  individual  borrowing.  The  amount of interest eligible for the 15  percent exclusion must be reduced by  most of the interest which a person  pays and deducts. The only exceptions  are home mortgage and business-relat ed interest. Thus, the new 15 percent  exclusion primarily will apply to net  interest income rather than gross in terest income.  Mr. Chairman, these are just two ex amples of the targeted savings provi sions in the President's bill. They are  the ""icing on the cake."" The combina tion of the across-the-board individual  tax cuts and the targeted savings pro visions will reinforce one another to  produce a strong incentive for saving.  Mr. Chairman,  the  savings  incen tives in the President's bill are superi or to the provisions in the committee's  bill. They provide still another reason  to support the substitute contained in  H.R. 4260.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",1981
203,House,97,-0.009,146,14,Mr. HUCKABY.," Mr. Chairman, it is  truly going to be a historic day here in  the House of Representatives. The di rection of the country, I believe, will  be changed today.  Much has been said earlier about  the bidding war that has been going  on  in  the  last  few months  for  the  block  of  conservative  Democratic  votes. But let us look at what has re sulted from that bidding war.  The  inheritance  laws  are  being  changed signficantly in this country.  Hundreds of thousands of small farm ers and small businessmen will be able  to preserve  their family enterprises.  Once again there will be savings incen tives existing for Americans.  Our depreciation  laws, our capital  gains  laws are being changed signfi cantly to enable American industry to  truly revitalize  itself, and both bills  also address the marriage penalty.  I would like to commend the chair.  man of the Committee on Ways and  Means as well as the ranking minority  member for the work that they have  done moving these bills very close to gether in most aspects.  However, there is one major signifi cant difference. A philosophy, a  true  philosophy, is all encompassing in the  Conable-Hance approach. What we are  doing as a result of this passage will  mean that this will be the last signifi cant tax bill to come before Congress  in the 20th century because with in dexing we are locking in the size of the  Federal Government, and future Con gresses will not vote  tax  increases  unless it is truly an emergency.  The size of the Federal Government  from 1984 forward will remain at 19  percent of our Nation's gross national  product instead of the 22 percent that  we are now approaching today.  ",1981
204,House,97,0.413,159,14,Mr. HILER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the Conable-Hance bill. As  President Reagan has stressed, Con able-Hance is the only fair tax bill be cause it cuts taxes for all taxpayers by  an equal percent. Conable-Hance  is  the only real tax cut bill because it  makes the tax reductions permanent.  The American people have demand ed relief from taxes that now take too  large  a  percentage of  the national  income. They made that clear at the  polls  last November,  and  they  are  making that clear with calls and let ters to our of fices. I received some 300  calls yesterday alone, and fewer than  30 were opposed to the President's tax  bill.  We must vote  the wishes of  the  people and enact the Conable-Hance 3year, 25-percent tax cut. For the first  3 years, this bill would give a real re duction  in  tax  rates. Following  the  third  year,  the Conable-Hance  bill  makes the reduction permanent by in dexing the brackets to the rate of in flation.  For the last 15 years, the Treasury  has  been  reaping  unlegislated  in creases in tax revenues when taxpay ers were boosted into higher brackets  as their incomes rose to match infla tion.  Indexing will  eliminate  these  automatic increases in tax rates, and  put the burden on the Congress to leg islate tax policy, as well as to make  the necessary spending reductions.  Indexing is needed because it helps  those  in  lower  income brackets  the  most. The lower brackets are narrow er, so  they increase more rapidly as  taxpayers work to keep up with infla tion. Indexing is the best way to help  those  in  lower  income  brackets  in  their fight against inflation and exces sive taxation.  Indexing is  the only way  to make  sure that the tax reductions of today  are still around  tomorrow. And  the  Conable-Hance bill is the only bill that  calls for indexing.  Conable-Hance is the only fair, per manent tax reduction proposal. I urge  adoption of the Conable-Hance bill.  ",1981
205,House,97,0.262,159,14,Mr. COLEMAN.," Mr.  Chairman,  never has it been more clear that the  power to tax is the power to destroy.  We have seen that in our economy  today. That is why we have to support  the Conable-Hance amendment.  Mr. Chairman, current tax policies  are  destroying  the  dreams  of  the  American worker, the productivity of  American business and industry, and  the leadership of America in the world  economy.  In the last 10 years, Federal taxes  have risen 177 percent. If continued  unchecked, taxes will have risen an as tronomical 390 percent by 1984. One  of  three of America's wage earners  have been pushed by inflation into the  25  percent or higher  tax  bracket.  American  taxpayers now work until  May 10 of each year-over 4 months to earn enough to pay their direct and  indirect taxes. The average American  worker now spends an average of 2  hours and 49 minutes each day work ing  to pay for  the Federal Govern ment. And working couples, under cur rent  tax policy, pay more  in  taxes  than if they remained single.  Americans  earn more  than  ever  before but their  incomes simply are  not keeping up. Because it costs more  to live, Americans are not saving. And  because of this the current level of  saving in our Nation, the lowest in two  decades, is the least among industrial  democracies of the world. Unless Con gress moves quickly to provide individ ual tax relief, America's standard of  ",1981

207,House,97,0.353,185,14,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman, the  bill before us is the largest tax reduc tion bill in history. During the next 5  years, the committee bill, as well as all  of the other proposals which will be  offered as substitutes, will return hun dreds of billions of dollars in tax reve nues back to the American people. Re turning money to the taxpayers is a  noble goal, and one which I enthusi astically support.  However, I cannot, and will not, sup port a measure which  returns hun dreds of billions of dollars to the tax payers in a haphazard, and sometimes  irresponsible, manner.  The Ways and Means Committee bill  is being presented as an alternative to  the President's original tax proposal and to the bipartisan substitute-when  in  fact  it  is not an alternative  tax  policy at all. The bill is more properly  described as a political document, and  a  classic example of political horse  trading,  logrolling, and half-effective  tax symbolism.  The Ways and Means Committee  took  the sound, comprehensive eco nomic policy  inherent  in  the Presi dent's 5-10-10/ACRS  tax  program,  and turned it into a highly ornament ed Christmas tree. The glitter and at tractive ornaments got the attention,  but very little consideration was given  to the basic economic foundation.  Bailing  out  certain  so-called  dis tressed industries would be far less ob jectionable if the rest of our industrial  base had already been made healthy  and  productive  through  economic  stimulus. Providing  increases  in  the  negative income tax we call the earned  income credit might be more accepta ble if it did not involve increasing the  taxes of the millions of already over burdened taxpayers who are forced to  subsidize this benefit. Unfortunately,  the majority members of  the Ways  and Means Committee must have lost  sight of the original goals behind this  tax bill, and instead reported a politi cal document which they hoped could  prevail. They were  forced  to bend  their bill toward the President's pro posal for the same reason. Nonetheless  their bill's ultimate value to the econo my is highly questionable.  Some of the provisions in the bill re flect the committee attitude of finding  an alternative proposal at any cost.  One of the other chief off enders  in  the bill is the committee's depreciation  proposal, which was hastily dreamed  up and tossed into the bill as a means  of finding an alternative to the ACRS  program that the President had pro posed. The ACRS <10-5-3) proposal  had been the subject of intense scruti ny over the past few years by some of  the  finest  economic  and  financial  minds  in  the country.  It had been  drafted and  redrafted, until a  final  proposal was developed which most  experts agreed would provide almost  all of the incentives necessary to re build our industrial base, and return  life and vigor to the economy.  Instead  of  taking  the  advice  of  almost all of the witnesses that testi fied before the committee in favor of  the ACRS  concept,  the Ways  and  Means bill relies on a new and untest ed expensing proposal. It is not a bad  idea, but this proposal  is so untried  that  its  provisions  were  changed  almost every time the committee sat  down to mark up the bill. Because it is  so untested, it is difficult to find any body in industry that can testify as to  how  it will affect various  industries  and regions. Sometimes I  think that  the President should have offered the  text of the committee bill as his origi nal proposal. That way, in its quest for  an alternative tax program, the Ways  and Means Committee might  then  have passed a bill like Conable-Hance  as  its own bill. The country would  then be able to look forward to the  next decade as an era of sound eco nomic and tax policy,  instead of ap proaching the coming years with trepi dation as to what lies ahead for the  health and stability of our entire econ omy.  Mr. Cha_irman, there is a good deal  more to distinguish the Presidentially  endorsed  bipartisan  Conable-Hance  amendment from the Ways and Means  Committee bill than a third year of in dividual  tax cuts,  the permanentiza tion of those cuts, or a skewing of the  cuts. But those are the major differ ences that have dominated all the dis cussions on this debate.  I believe the Conable-Hance alterna tive is superior specifically because it  preserves the third year of tax cuts  and  then perpetuates  them  through  indexing. It provides a  real  tax cut  over 3 years.  The  committee  bill,  because  of  bracket creep and social security, will  acutally cause taxpayers to pay more  taxes after 3 years  than  they pay  today. It is not a tax cut at all.  We have been told that the Conable Hance  amendment  favors  the  rich.  The Democratic Party line alleges the  committee bill  is better  for people  with $50,000 of income or less.  I will readily admit that the commit tee tax cuts are skewed. They are not  across-the-board cuts which  I  favor,  and most of America favors, but how  much do  they  favor middle-income  people?  Under the committee bill, a $15,000  wage earner with a family of four will  do better in the first year, 1982, by less  than $2 a month, the $20,000 earner  with the same family situation by less  than $3 a month. When income rises  over $35,000 for this kind of taxpayer,  the Conable-Hance amendment will be  more favorable even after 2 years. So  much  for  generosity. Our  thimbles  runneth over.  More important than the fact that  the income level skewing is minimal, is  the  fact  that everybody comes out  better under the Conable-Hance bill in  the third year. As the President has  said the committee bill is better only  for those who plan to live only 2 years.  So, if any Member of this body has  been planning to vote for the commit tee bill because it is so much better for  middle-income people, he or she can  now safely change  their plans. The  President's plan is better.  The few pennies a month that it de livers represent an insignificant differ ence from the straightforward and fair  across-the-board tax cuts of Conable Hance.  . However, if Members are curious as  to where the committee version puts  the money that it, admittedly, takes  away from higher income  taxpayers,  let them be aware that the Democrat  bill sweetens the earned income  tax  credit by nearly $2 billion over  the  first 3 years. The Members may recall  the earned income tax credit goes to  people who pay almost nothing  to  begin with, or who are not even tax payers at all. If we want to help people  who pay no taxes at the expense of  those who pay most of this country's  tax bills, we probably should support  the committee's tax bill.  Some Members may like the $3112 bil lion given to the largest companies in  America under the Bailey bailout. If  we vote for the committee bill, we can  deny our constituents a third year of  the tax cut and give  the money  in stead to such distressed companies as  General Motors, Ford,  International  Paper, United States Steel, Southern  Railroad, Standard of Ohio, and scads  of other  large profitable companies.  The Members' own taxpayer constitu ents will be interested to hear why we  reduced their tax cut to give  to the  largest and most powerful  corpora tions of this country.  And if some Members still like the  committee bill, I invite them to consid er how we are going to explain to our  constituents that we are only cutting  ",1981

211,House,97,0.523,328,14,Mr. CHENEY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  on behalf of  the Republican Policy  Committee in support of the biparti san substitute.  Mr. Chairman, for the past 3 months  this Congress has been enrolled in an  intensive course in economics. Three  months  ago  next  we~ek President  Reagan appeared before us, stood on  that rostrum, and outlined in detail  the problems we face.  Sadly, the American economy over  the past several years has degenerated  into a perfect laboratory example of  how bad things can become when an  entire country is mismanaged. For the  past 4 years, we watched while unem ployment  lines grew,  inflation  rates  soared,  interest costs came close  to  killing the American dream, and bad  money slowly drove out good.  It is  the average American worker  and taxpayer who has suffered.  President Reagan was speaking for  those average Americans when he out lined those continuing economic prob lems in April and called on us to deal  speedily with Government  spending  that has grown out of control,  tax  policies  that stifle  incentive on  the  part of both  labor and capital and  which work to block economic expan sion, Government overregulation, and  a monetary policy that fosters all of  our economic ills.  A majority of us passed our midterm  exams with  flying  colors,  once we  heard  from  the American  people.  Those workers and taxpayers agreed  with the President, and wanted Gov ernment spending cut.  We did that in imposing a budget  ceiling and then living up to it in the  reconciliation process. But that pass ing grade did not come without diffi culty, for even after the people had  spoken, there were some in the House  who still refused to listen to and learn  from the harsh lessons of the past.  For  the past  several months  the  House Committee on Ways and Means  has conducted an extensive seminar on  competing economic philosophies  in  the field of taxation, again weighing  the politics and policies of the past  which combined to create our current  economic crisis against the hopes and  dreams of American working men and  women.  Now,  in  that balance,  the House  Democratic  leadership  is attempting  to tip the scales in its own favor, for  the positions of the past and against  the economic recovery program of the  President and the American people.  Mr. Chairman,  today we  face our  final examination on these economic  programs.  Before the close of business today,  we will be tested. And before the end  of this Congress, final grades are going  to be handed to all of those by those  American workers and taxpayers most  affected by Government spending and  taxing programs.  Over the past several days, all of us  have heard the Members of the House  Democratic leadership trying out their  lines for  this final exam,  trying out  their answers to questions they know  they are going to be asked.  And sadly, Mr. Chairman, a number  of the Members of the House Demo cratic leadership seem to have fallen  prey to a failing that flunks many a  college freshman. They seem to think  that  if  they say something  is  true  often  enough,  and  loudly  enough,  their professors can be convinced that  the answer is true, even if it is not.  I have a warning for the Democratic  leadership, Mr. Chairman: In this case  those  professors  are  the American  people. They know the answers. And  the American people are awfully good  at sifting and winnowing  the wheat  from that chaff.  Here are some of the questions being  asked  in  that economics  exam  au thored by the American people:  First. Who does the Reagan biparti san tax bill favor?  The Democratic leadership blithely  claims that that is the ""$50,000 ques tion."" If you earn more than $50,000 a  year, they claim, the bill favors you. If  your earn less than $50,000 a year, the  bill hurts you, they contend.  Wrong. And  the American people  know it.  The Library of Congress, an impar tial source as we all know, has sent  Congress its own study which shows  that the bipartisan plan, calling for a  3-year  guaranteed  tax  cut,  has  a  $35,000 cutoff point. The Democratic  leadership  plan  guarantees  only  2  years of tax cuts. And that third year  does not go into effect, the Library of  Congress has warned us in the report  the House Democratic  leadership  is  trying to ignore, ""the Ways and Means  Committee  tax cut would  result  in  higher tax payments than the [bipar tisan] bill for all households above the  $10,000 income level,"" simply because  the total relief called for in the bipar tisan plan over 3 years is greater than  the Democratic leadership offers in its  inadequate 2-year package.  Second. Can the Democratic leader ship bill provide for a  third-year tax  cut?  Yes, claims the Democratic leader ship.  Wrong  again,  say  the American  people. The Democratic leadership bill  would allow a  third-year cut only if  certain economic conditions are met.  Yet the Democratic leadership plan,  by its very nature, will make it impos sible to trigger that third year. The  Democratic leadership knows that, but  continues its efforts to play a cynical  shell game with the American taxpay er.  The American people know that the  immediate high deficits called for in  the Democratic  leadership plan will  make it impossible to bring inflation  down  to a  level below 5. 7 percent a  year before that third year is reached.  The American people know that those  shortfalls will make it impossible  to  bring the deficit below $22.9 billion a  year in time to pull that trigger. The  American people know that making a  third-year tax cut dependent on inter est paid on 91-day Treasury notes will  put America's economic future in the  hands of a few big money financiers  who can manipulate those figures by  playing the markets.  The American people know what the  Democratic leadership is trying to do  to them, not for them.  Third. Will the bipartisan tax plan  cost taxpayers more than the Demo cratic leadership proposal?  Yes,  say  those Democratic  leaders  who have scoured the Halls of Con gress, looking for wavering votes that  could be  influenced by  special  tax  breaks for back-home interests.  Wrong, say the American people.  A  Joint Committee  on Taxation  study proves that the bipartisan bill  will  cost $4.5 billion  less  than  the  Democratic leadership plan from 1981  through 1983. The American people  know that the cost of the bipartisan  proposal has actually been reduced in  the process of compromise with  re sponsible Democrats that went to the  ",1981
212,House,97,0.541,341,14,Mr. FIELDS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in enthusiastic support of  the Con able-Hance amendment to the pending  Ways and Means Committee bill.  Mr.  Chairman, without  sounding  melodramatic, each of us should recog nize that later today we will cast one  of the most important votes in recent  history.  While the consequences of our ac tions  are  staggering,  the  choice  is  clear-the  time  is now  to pass  the  Reagan bipartisan tax bill.  On the one hand, we have a bill writ ten by the overly partisan Ways and  Means Committee, a bill which calls  for a 2-year, 15-percent reduction in  tax rates, tax rates which they, over  the years have caused to rise and take  a  larger portion of the paychecks of  every man and every woman working  today.  On the other hand, we have a bipar tisan tax proposal which not only re duces  taxes  25  percent  across-the board  for all Americans during  the  next 3 years, but permanently elimi nates the built-in tax increases caused  by inflation.  Before discussing why  I  feel  the  Reagan bipartisan  tax plan provides  real  tax relief, while  the Ways and  Means Committee bill calls for actual  tax increases in the years ahead, we  should recognize that the Ways and  Means Committee bill was drafted by  a group of men who are much better  at raising taxes than they are at re ducing them.  In fact, they are so good at increas ing taxes that they have done so at a  rate of 249 percent since 1971.  Since  that  time,  the Ways  and  Means Committee has given the Amer ican people  five other so-called  tax  cuts. Yet, over the same 10 years, total  taxes increased by more than $400 bil lion.  It is interesting to note that it took  this Nation 200 years for Washington  to extract $300 billion annually from  the private sector. Yet, from 1977 to  1981, the Ways and Means Committee  to more  that  than double  was able  figure.  Yet, these same revenue-raisers, who  only a short time ago said the Ameri can people were not entitled to a tax  cut, now are saying that they have the  right tax bill for the American people.  Mr. Chairman, the American people  have been down that briar path before  and they recognize that the Ways and  Means Committee's bill is just another  tax increase masquerading as a ""tax  cut.""  There  is a better path we should  travel, and I urge my colleagues  to  join with me in supporting the Presi dent's bipartisan tax plan.  While there has been much debate  about which of the proposals provides  real relief to the individual taxpayer,  the simple fact is that under the Presi dent's bill, all American households  will experience decreases in their tax  rates after 1981.  Conversely, by 1984, under the Ways  and Means tax bill, working people in  nearly every tax bracket will be paying  more taxes than they paid in 1980, and  will be faced with whopping tax in creases in the years to come.  Mr. Chairman,  the President's tax  proposal is imminently fair in that it  provides tax relief to those Americans  who pay the majority of  taxes. For  those Americans, who earn between  $10,000 and $60,000 and now pay 72  percent of  total  individual  taxes  in  America, the President's plan will pro vide  74  percent of  the benefits  to  them.  In addition, it will relieve taxpayers  of 98 percent of the tax increase ex pected over the next 4 years due to in flation  and will  eliminate  ""bracket  creep"" after 1985.  It is refreshing to have, at long last,  a President with the courage to end  this unlegislated,  unvo~ed, unsigned  and unending tax hike on the Ameri can people. Regrettably, however, the  Ways and Means Committee  lacked  that courage and their bill does not in clude a provision  to  index our  tax  code. This I believe is but another ex ample of their true intentions to con tinue to raise the level of taxes on all  working Americans.  In  1963  President Kennedy  said,  ""The final and best means of strength ening demand among consumers and  business  is  to reduce  the burden on  private income and the deterrents to  private initiative which are imposed by  our present tax system. This adminis tration pledged itself last summer to  an across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut  in  personal  and  corporate  income  taxes.""  With this in mind, President Kenne dy sent to the Congress, just as Presi dent Reagan is doing now, a tax bill to  significantly reduce marginal tax rates  for all Americans.  President Kennedy's proposal was  overwhelmingly approved by the Congress which  included  the  current  Speaker of the House and chairman of  the Ways and Means Committee. It  was hailed by the  then-chairman of  the Ways  and Means  Committee  Wilbur Mills as a proposal, ""to remove  the private sector of  the American  economy  from  its  high-tax  strait jacket. To breathe into our free enter prise system that vitality that we con cluded it requires if it is to do the job  required of it today.""  Yet, today, the same individuals who  voted in favor of the Kennedy across the-board  tax cuts are  saying  it  is  unwise,  potentially  inflationary, un workable and dangerous to give Ameri cans this type of tax relief. I say their  opposition is politically motivated and  not based on any sound economic prin ciples.  Mr. Chairman, in the 7 months that  I have been a Member of this distin guished body,  I have held 32  town  meetings in my district, I have made  52 speeches, I have attended 31 special  events, and I have met hundreds of  other individuals of every age, race, oc cupation, and income. Without excep tion, those with whom I have talked,  want to keep more of their paycheck  and-they want to have the freedom  to  save or spend  their hard-earned  money-the way they want-and not  as Washington dictates.  In my  congressional  district,  the  median  family  income  is  $11,800.  Under the Reagan bipartisan tax plan,  individuals earning  this  income will  get to keep $917 more of their dollars  conversely under the Ways and Means  bill, they will keep only $527 of their  dollars.  While this alone is significant, this is  not the whole story. For, as we all  know, the benefits of the Reagan bi partisan plan will  continue  in  the  years ahead, long after the Ways and  Means Committee bill not only has  run out of gas, but has guaranteed all  taxpayers huge tax increases.  Mr. Chairman, the President's bipar tisan tax bill will provide $205 million  in savings to my congressional district  and $1.4 billion in new income to the  city of Houston.  I firmly believe that similar tax ben efits are available to every community,  every town, every city, and every con gressional district in this Nation.  Mr. Chairman,  that is  the central  goal of the Reagan bipartisan tax pro posal which is,  in my  judgment, the  best opportunity we have to encourage  more  employment,  higher  real  in comes, fewer lives wasted on welfare  and a  rekindling of the work effort  and  entrepreneurial  spirit  in  our  Nation.  Instead of working  to pay  taxes, people will be working for them selves and their families once again,  and upward mobility will  return  to  American life.  ",1981

220,,97,0.342,679,14,Mr. DERWINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, on  July 20, the Subcommittee on Human  ' Rights  and  International Organiza tions and the Commission on Security  and Cooperation  in Europe held  a  joint hearing on Soviet human rights  violations in Afghanistan. Chaired by  my distinguished colleague, the Hon orable DANTE FASCELL, the panel heard  witnesses who  included a  schoolgirl  who led a demonstration of unarmed  students against the automatic weap ons of Soviet troops, and a leader of  freedom  fighters who described  the  lethal  effect of  the wide  array of  Soviet  weapons  used  against  the  poorly armed Afghan patriots.  Human Events, in its August 1, 1980,  issue, carried an excellent article on  the  Afghanistan  hearing,  titled  ""Expert Refutes ABC Afghan Weap ons Story."" The article mentioned the  active role of my distinguished fell ow  Member, the Honorable DoN RITTER,  in promoting the hearing. It also re futed  the contention by Carl Bern stein that the Afghan freedom fight ers are receiving substantial aid from  abroad in their heroic struggle against  terrible odds.  On July 16, I introduced a resolution  on the right of the Afghan people for  independence  and  autonomy.  I  am  seeking cosponsors for this resolution,  House Concurrent Resolution 157. In  the meanwhile, you will be interested  in the full text of the Human Events  article.  EXPERT REFUTES ABC AFGHAN WEAPONS  STORY  A leading expert on the situation in Af ghanistan has testified that he has found  ""no evidence"" to substantiate ABC reported  Carl Bernstein's claim that the Afghan free dom fighters are getting the kind of sophis ticated weapons they need to fight the Sovi ets.  Thomas E. Gouttierre, director of  the  Center for Afghanistan Studies at the Uni versity of Nebraska,  told a  congressional  subcommittee  hearing  on Soviet  human  rights  violations  in  Afghanistan  that  ""recent  assertions by Carl Bernstein on  ABC's '20-20' program and in The New Re public notwithstanding, little of the weap onry essential to confronting Soviet air su periority has reached"" the freedom fighters.  Gouttierre told the panel, chaired by Rep.  Dante Fascell <D.-Fla.), ""the contention is  that the Afghans are enjoying the kind of  weaponry that they need to combat Soviet  military  and  technological  superiority.  There is even a claim that some 60 Soviet  helicopter gunships have been destroyed. I  have  found no evidence whatsoever  that  would in any way substantiate this particu lar claim or any other claim that would indi cate that the amount of support the Af ghans are enjoying  is anywhere near the  levels that Mr. Bernstein has been talking  about.""  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Gouttierre,  a  leading authority on Af ghanistan, spent 10 years in the country as  a Peace Corps volunteer and as director of  the Fulbright Foundation. He left in 1974,  but returned twice in 1978. He is known to  have excellent contacts in the Afghan re sistance.  His July 22  testimony at a hearing held  jointly by the Human Rights subcommittee  of  the House Foreign Affairs Committee  and the Commission on Security and Coop eration  in Europe, which monitors Soviet  compliance with the Helsinki accords, sug gests that the Bernstein report on ABC and  in The New Republic is just factually incor rect. Fears that the Bernstein report could  be damaging to the Afghan freedom fight ers has already been expressed <see  last  week's Human Events).  In  an  interview with Human Events,  Gouttierre said that while Bernstein's claim  that five nations-the U.S., China, Egypt,  Saudi Arabia and Pakistan-are helping the  freedom fighters ""seems plausible,"" the sug gestion that the resistance  is getting  the  equipment it needs to fight the Soviets is  ""very, very misleading."" He  said such a  report creates ""a  tremendous mispercep tion.""  Gouttierre told the hearing that the free dom fighters are getting most of their weap ons by capturing them from the Soviets. He  added, however, that ""I think the freedom  fighters are getting a certain amount of  weaponry-Soviet weaponry-from the sup plies that the Egyptians and the Chinese  might have had.""  He also testified that ""I believe that the  Reagan Administration has made a deci sion-a moral if not physical commitment to provide some assistance to the freedom  fighters.  I don't know  to what extent  in  terms of numbers and kinds of weaponry.""  Although the resistance has scored some  major victories against the Soviets, he said,  ""it has by no means gained  the upper  hand."" He said the Soviets ""are expanding  their policy of dual genocide-corporal and  migratory.  ""Villages and valleys are denuded of their  populations through increased bombing and  intimidation. Chemical warfare,  including  the possible use of hydrogen cyanide, and  mines disguised as  toys,  are being used.  Areas of major cities have been destroyed in  heavy bombardment. Whole villages have  been reduced to rubble and their popula tions executed en masse for being suspected  of aiding or harboring freedom fighters.""  There are, he said,  two million Afghan  refugees in Pakistan and a half-million in  Iran. Another half-million Afghans have  been killed or wounded.  ""We're  talking  about anywhere from one-fifth to a seventh  of  the population of a country  that has  been  eliminated  from  that country,"" he  said.  More  information  contradicting  Bern stein's claim about what is happening in Af ghanistan came from someone who should  know-an Afghan  freedom  fighter. Malik  Muhammed Hussain Wardak, a tribal leader  in the war of resistance who traveled for  nearly three weeks in order to appear at the  hearing spoke of ""the tragic and cruel con ditions that confront us in Afghanistan.""  Speaking through Thomas Gouttierre, his  interpreter, Wardak said,  ""We  inside Af ghanistan obtain almost all of our weapons  from  captured Soviet  convoys,  defecting  Afghan troops, and purchases in the border  areas.""  ""The types of aerial weaponry utilized by  the Soviet forces are devastating to us,"" he  18597  said. ""There are six basic typesthat I have  seen ranging from reconnaissance planes, to  deep penetrating bombs with wide devasta tion capacity,  to fast white  jets dropping  fire bombs, to MI-24 helicopters launching  rockets, artillery fire, bombs, and rapid ma chine gun fire, to immobilizing gas bombs,  which also include residue explosive articles,  and camouflaged bombs in the forms of toys  and pens, capable of blowing off limbs.""  Wardak emphasized  that ""not only are  freedom fighters being killed, but so are our  women and children. No  life  remains  in  those  areas bombed by  the Soviet war ships.""  Even school girls are not spared, according  to  an  18-year-old woman  identified  as  ""Nahid,"" who  told  the hearing about an  anti-Soviet demonstration she led in April  1980 at her high school in Kabul, the cap ital city of Afghanistan. Seventy of her  friends were  killed. Another  300  were  wounded.  Nahid was expelled from school for her  activities and she eventually made her way  across the border into Pakistan, where she  stayed for two months before coming to the  U.S. In Pakistan, she said, ""I saw freedom  fighters there; they are in a bad situation  because they lack weapons,  they were sit ting  idle. Some of  the  freedom  fighters  fought  in  the mountains and had  to eat  grass because they had no food. The wound ed died because  they had no medicine to  stop their bleeding.""  '""The war continues and many are being  killed,"" she said, ""Therefore, we have asked  America to give us aid.""  Thomas Gouttierre urged Congress to act.  ""I would hope Congress would accept the  responsibility  to  encourage  assisting  the  Afghan freedom fighters with the weapons  necessary  to  resist  the Soviet occupation  and to combat the genocidal policies that  proceed from it.""  Leading efforts  in Congress to help the  freedom  fighters  is Representative Don  Ritter <R.-Pa.), who played a major role in  making last week's hearing possible. Repre sentative Ritter has visited refugee camps in  Pakistan to learn first hand about the prob lems faced by the Afghan people.  Representative Ritter told us that he is  developing an ""Action Group on Afghani stan,"" consisting of liberal and conservative  members in Congress, that will try to focus  attention on the problem and prod the Ad ministration into action. The congressman  said that a group headed by Lord Nicholas  Bethell, a member of the House of Lords in  London,  will  perform  similar work  in  Europe.  A key purpose of the groups, he told us, is  to create a climate in which free world gov ernments can aid the resistance with food,  medical supplies or weapons. But if media  coverage of last week's hearing is any indi cation, it will be extremely hard to establish  that kind of climate. It was ignored by the  three network news programs, the Washing ton Post and the New York Times.e  CALL TO CONSCIENCE  HON. NORMAN Y. MINETA  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 29, 1981  e ",1981
221,,97,-0.479,679,14,Mr. MINETA.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am proud to participate in the ""Call to  ",1981
222,Senate,97,0.213,796,14,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President,  two  recent occurrences drew my attention  once again to the Mutual and Balanced  Force Reduction <MBFR) Talks in Vi enna, Austria. The first was the publica tion of the most recent issue of Strategic  Survey by the International Institute for  Strategic Studies. The second is the con clusion of July 23 of the 24th round of  the MBFR talks, which began October  1973.  Although it has been easy to point to  the MBFR talks and characterize them  as unproductive and unworthy, I firml~  believe that MBFR has performed a val uable role in maintaining stability and  can continue to do so. Strategic Survey  (pages 110-111) astutely observed that even  1f movement  remains  sluggish  the  transformation of Vienna into a kind of de  facto  multilateral  standing  consulative  committee  to  exchange  information  and  query suspicious developments has some vir tue, notwithstanding the lack of progress in  the data discussion. MBFR might therefore  become at least a forum for providing reas surance about the force deployments of East  and West in Europe.  The conclusion of the 24th round of  the  talks underscores  the difficulty of  reaching an agreement, but, neverthe less, provides evidence that there is value  in continuing the talks, which will re sume in late September. MBFR is the  only alliance-to-alliance negotiation in  progress,  and,  for  that  reason alone,  serves  the United States well. We can  exchange information with the Eastern  Bloc on subjects such as new weapons or  troop deployments. The negotiation also  serves an equally valuable function  in  providing a forum for exchange of inf or mation and ideas of all kinds with our  allies. This opportunity to assure our al lies of our continued commitment  to  arms control and discuss their increas ing concerns about an arms race may it self well justify the talks, especially since  the  theater nuclear  forces TNF  and  SALT talks are still some time from be ginning. The MBFR  talks  then have  served as a safety valve for venting sus picions,  even  if  the  reductions  once  hoped for have not materialized.  It is my opinion that the talks must  continue even if they only serve this gen eral purpose. I think that this is especi ally true in that the Conference on Se curity and Cooperation ir. Europe has  not produced any forum during its meet ing in Madrid that could serve as a sub stitute for MBFR. I also believe that the  negotiations  in Vienna have provided  invaluable insights into Soviet thinking  and force structure, the sort of informa tion that is readily available in the West  but which the East carefully obscures.  There is still hope, in addition to these  general  advantages,  that  the MBFR  talks can achieve success in more specific  ways. I trust that the Reagan adminis tration will give full attention to these  possibilities. I personally continue to 'be lieve that the United States can with draw some of  its  forces  from Europe  without damaging our defense posture,  and that these withdrawals can serve as  bargaining chips. If what one hears of  repositioning our  forces  closer  to  the  East German border is a serious possibil ity, that, too, is grist for the negotiating  mill.  There are other possibilities for sub stantial breakthroughs as well-in the  area of associated measures, for example.  Two excellent studies of MBFR, which  have recently appeared, John G. Keliher,  The Negotiations on Mutual Balanced  Force Reductions and Jeffrey Record,  Force Reductions in Europe, discuss as sociated measures and other options in  detail.  As I have noted elsewhere, the Reagan  administration's potential  for making  far-reaching arms control agreements  is analagous to President Nixon's open ing of diplomatic relations with China.  A Republican could do what a  liberal  Democrat could not do, and so it may  be with President Reagan. Let us not  limit our hopes for a dramatic break through in arms control to strategic sys tems. The conventional forces  in cen tral Europe are  1a  fertile ground  for  dynamic reductions or corr.,parable arms  control advances and MBFR remains a  splendid springboard for such proposals.  If the Soviets turn a cold shoulder, then  so be it, and the onus rests upon them.  But let us leave no stone unturned in a  bold search for a just peace.   BIGGEST LITTLE STATE IN THE  UNION   ",1981
223,House,97,0.13,822,14,Mr. NELLIGAN.," Mr. Speaker, I have  written President Reagan asking him  to negotiate voluntary  limits on  im ported shoes from Taiwan and Korea  as a way of providing continuing relief  to the domestic shoe industry.  As you know, the President recently  rejected  the recommendation of  the  International Trade Commission  to  extend  the  international agreements  to limit imports.  My district in northeastern Pennsyl vania alone has 11 shoe firms which  employ more  than  2,000  workers.  These firms have been devastated by  foreign imports, which constitute 48.5  percent of shoes sold nationally.  So that the strides made in the last 4  years will not be eliminated and a suc cessful modernization program can be  completed, I am urging the President  to  negotiate  voluntary  limits with  Taiwan and Korea, just as voluntary  limits were negotiated with Japan for  the auto industry, where imports were  only 27 percent, not 48.5 percent.  In a perfect world, I always would  choose to be a free trader. But, in this  instance,  I  am  convinced  the best  route  is continued  import  relief  for  the domestic shoe industry-at least  until the industry has a chance to get  on its feet again.  TRIBUTE TO ROBERT MOSES, A  GREAT AMERICAN BUILDER  <Mr. McGRATH  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  Mr. McGRATH. Mr. Speaker, yes terday I received the sad news of the  passing  of Robert Moses,  a  great  American whose genius contributed to  a better way of life for millions of New  Yorkers and residents of other areas  throughout our Nation and the world.  The  accomplishments  of  Robert  Moses as a scholar, administrator, poli tician, and builder date back to the  first decade of  this century.  In the  grey days of  the Great Depression,  Robert Moses was recognized as a na tional leader in the administration of  public works projects in parks, road ways, and housing programs. Through  the  following  decades,  the projects  spurred by his vision and tremendous  administrative  ability provided New  York and neighboring States with an  unparalleled  transportation  system,  greater  electrical  power production,  and a  tremendous network of parks  and recreational facilities.  Engineers, executives, and students  from the 50 States and many nations  flocked to Moses to benefit from his  skills. He attracted many dedicated  and professional public  servants  to  government. Others who worked with  him went on to the private sector en riched with knowledge and ability.  On  July  29, New York  and our  Nation lost a  leader whose foresight  helped bring us into the 20th century.  The monuments to Robert Moses will  remain long into the future for visitors  and residents of New York to enjoy. I  call upon my colleagues today to join  me in a moment of prayer and reflec tion in memory of Robert Moses.

224,House,97,0.268,822,14,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Speaker,  in the  aftermath of yesterday's historic vote  on  reducing  the  tax burden on  the  American people, I believe we in this  Congress  should  be most  grateful.  First of all, we should be grateful to  the President, who has shown to the  American  people  that  Presidential  leadership is still possible. We need to  be grateful to the hardworking mem bers of the Ways and Means Commit tee,  and particularly  the chairman,  the gentleman from Illinois <Mr. Ros TENKOWSKI) and the ranking minority  member,  the  gentleman  from New  York <Mr. CONABLE).  I think we need to express gratitude  to  the  leaders of both parties,  the  Speaker of the House and the minori ty leader, for their creative leadership  and gentlemanly behavior in bringing  their troops into the battle.  D 1020  But Mr.  Speaker  I  think  one  Member deserves special  recognition  for intellectual, economic, and politi cal  leadership over a  5-year period  which brought tax debate to the point  at which it arrived in the House yes terday,  and  that  is  the gentleman  from New York <Mr. KEMP), the gen tleman from New York has  labored  over the years, at times when those  new ideas were very far from the Halls  of this Congress. For 5 years he has  been taking the message of increased  incentives as critical to jobs and eco nomic growth to the American people  in a most creative way.  Mr. Speaker, I think, perhaps more  than any one person, he deserves re sponsibility  for  the outcome yester day.

225,House,97,0.178,822,14,Mr. ROEMER.," Mr. Speaker, I had  occasion  this morning  to attend an other breakfast with some Members of  the House. We have at  least  three  breakfast invitations every morning. I  was glad I went this morning because  it was somewhat different. It was a  breakfast hosted by the some 480,000  members of  the Future Farmers of  America, and  I  saw a great deal of  hope for the country there.  I am a farmer myself; I grew up on  one and worked as a farmer all my life  until I retired and came to Congress.  The information, the enthusiasm, and  the commitment of this group to their  country that I observed this morning  was an important message to me.  There was a book written entitled  ""Out of Africa,"" and in that book the  woman author wrote that ""all farmers,  wherever they might live, share the  feeling of drought. After 30 days with out rain, the first drops of rain unite  farmers everywhere.""  Mr. Speaker,  the  feeling  I got at  that breakfast  this morning  is  that  America is in good hands.

227,House,97,-0.61,835,14,Mr. ROYBAL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman,  there  is no doubt  about the fact that there are good ar guments on both sides. In fact, we just  finished hearing those arguments. But  the truth of the matter is that in the  presentation  that was made at  the  time that the Schroeder amendment  was passed, that there were various ar guments given that also made a  tre mendous amount of sense.  First of all, we were told that this  would  only  affect  those  promoters  that went out promoting the sales of  bonds, those individuals who traveled  throughout the country meeting with  various executives, heads of companies  that could be induced into promoting  the sale of bonds with their personnel.  Then, we were also told that their  efficiency rate is quite low, that there  has been a drop in the sale of bonds of  appoximately 40 percent, therefore in dicating that the participation on the  part of the employee was no longer at  the same rate or the same level as in  the past.  Then, we were also  told  that  the  sales mechanism for  the sale of the  bond would not be touched with that  amendment, that they could continue  to sell bonds just the same as they are  doing at  the present  time without  having  the  promoters  going  out  throughout the country, meeting with  executives,  promoting  the  sale  of  bonds.  Then, we were also  told that-per haps it would be better if I read this:  ""We were told that bonds paid 5 per cent initially, 7.5 percent after 5 years,  and 9 percent after 8 years.""  This means that the individual,  in  order to get the 9 percent, would have  to leave his money in for 9 years. Now,  with the 60-day money market funds  now selling for 17%-percent interest,  the argument went on  that  it was  nearly impossible to sell these bonds.  Then, we were also told that it was a  downright fraud committed on the un suspecting citizens by their own Gov ernment.  Now, all of these are convincing ar guments. Now, we are also told, and we  already know, that the bill passed yes terday did in fact contain new incen tives for people putting money in sav ings and loans, and that they would do  quite well tax-exempt. This, of course,  would make  the  initiative on selling  bonds even more difficult.  D 1130  I think that the main argument that  we must consider at  this particular  time is the fact that the House has al ready worked its will. A vote was taken  on this issue the day before yesterday.  It seems to me that the best way to do  anything about the situation would be  perhaps to get a separate vote on the  same issue when we go into the House  instead of trying to reverse it at the  present time.

I have asked the  gentlewoman to withdraw the amend ment and she has done so. I think it is  inappropriate  to be discussing  these  things,  these  types of  amendments  and taking up the time of the House  when we have so many other things to  complete work on.  I opposed the last amendment too. I  think after yesterday's fierce battle  that went on for a few weeks, I think  both sides were too partisan. I  think  there was too much trading of differ ent issues for votes, that I think makes  the Congress  look bad  in a  certain  light.  I think there has been too much ar gument between the President and the  Congress in many ways. I came here  really believing  there would be  less  partisanship  and more working  to gether. I think that is what the Ameri can people want across the board, not  only  on  this  amendment,  but  on  amendments offered by the other side  also.  I hope we move away from that kind  of operation in this House because in  the end the thing that is the most im portant is not who wins the next elec tion in 1982, but how we govern up  until January 1, 1983.  I  think all of us as we go into the  recess sometime next week can ponder  that for a bit in August, and maybe in  September things will not be as parti san on either side.  Mr. C4MPBELL.

233,House,97,-0.044,861,14,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman,  I  join  the distin guished chairman of the subcommit tee  in opposing  this  amendment.  I  think he has stated the case well, that  this is a very different situation from  the other cases in which  this House  has adopted restrictions on the use of  Federal funds to procure abortions.  In  this case  the health  insurance  which an employee receives is part of  the employee's compensation. It is no  different from a pension, a salary, sick  leave or vacation pay. It is remunera tion to the Federal employee for the  work that she has done.  We  are  going many, many  steps  beyond what we have done  in other  forms  of  antiabortion  amendments  when we seek to deny the Federal em ployee  this form of coverage  in  the  health insurance that she gets as com pensation-and to which she contrib utes.  I think that is plainly wrong. Would  anyone here argue that a Federal em ployee  under  the present  law  and  under the present constitutional deter minations of the U.S. Supreme Court  to  cannot take  the dollars  that she re ceives from  the U.S. Government as  her pay and  in accordance with her  own decisions and those of her physi cian pay for an abortion? Of course no  one would argue that, and we all know  that under the Supreme Court deci sions relating to the abortion question,  it would be unconstitutional if we tried  to prevent that.  I  submit  that  it  is  just as wrong  when that compensation to that em ployee comes in the form of health in surance, as when it comes in the form  of cash,  to deny  that employee  the  compensation that she has earned. It  is simply making second-class citizens  out of Federal employees.  I do not  think  the Congress  of  the United  States wants to do that.  It seems clear to me that this is an  attempt to dictate to individuals what  they can or cannot do with their own  pay, based solely on  their status as  Federal employees.  I  therefore urge my colleagues  oppose this amendment.  ",1981
234,House,97,-0.516,861,14,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Chair man, I move to strike the last word. I  rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I  think it would be  unfortunate  if  this discussion of the  Ashbrook amendment was perceived  by anyone to be a debate on the issue  of whether abortion is or is not a mor ally or legally acceptable medical pro cedure.  As chairman of  the Committee on  the Post Office  and Civil  Service,  which has primary responsibility for  representing the House in matters af fecting the employment of all of the  Federal work force,  I  think it is my  duty  to call  to  the attention of  the  House an exchange which I had last  year with the Director of the Office of  Personnel Management and my prede cessor, Mr. Hanley. If one can avoid  for a moment the emotion which the  word ""abortion"" injects into any dis cussion, we are talking about well over  3 million employees and their families  and dependents.  The gentleman from New York sug gested  that  this  is  discrimination  against female employees.  Indeed,  it  goes much further than that, because  it selects out family members who are  in the child-bearing years.  In a practical sense, what we are  faced with  is  the  fact  that at  the  present time we have more than 100  negotiated  contracts  with  various  health  benefit  carriers which  are  available to the employees of the Fed eral Government.  If a Federal employee elects a health  program, the Federal Government will  pay 60 percent of the premium while  the employee pays the balance. The  same holds true for private employees.  For postal employees, we pay 75 per cent of the cost of the premium and  the balance is paid by the employee.  ",1981

On August 23, the city of New Ro chelle, N.Y., will dedicate phase I of  the five islands recreation complex-a  $3 million  facility,  virtually unique  along  the  entire  eastern  seaboard.  This complex would not have been  possible without the countless hours  of hard work by many, many, people,  most especially officials and staff of  the city of New Rochelle  together  with a group of concerned local citi zens.  Phase I of the project is the recon stitution of Oakwood Island in Long  Island Sound, the largest of the archi pelago in the Echo Bay Inlet of the  Sound.  The  Federal  Government  through the Land and Water Conser vation Fund contributed over $700,000  toward the development of this stage  of the five islands complex. I must add  July 30, 1981  fi that  the portion of  the Land and  Water Conservation Fund which  nanced the five  island project is now  facing extinction as a result of recent  budgetary goals put forth by the ad ministration. Phase II of the five  is lands complex, which involves the de velopment of four other islands as well  as further improvement of recreation  areas on Oakwood Island, will also be  financed in part by the Federal Gov ernment. Further, Federal funds were  used to save Oakwood Island from po tential  residential development,  thus  preserving this valuable open space for  public use.  The city of New Rochelle, N.Y., is to  be  commended  for  its  outstanding  work in the development of the five  island recreation complex. The park  was developed according to guidelines  which mandate the preservation and  enhancement of our marine ecology  and the complex is an outstanding ex ample of how a natural environment  can be responsibly transformed into a  people-serving  setting.  Through  a  number of successful  redevelopment  projects,  including  five  islands,  the  city has proved again and again  its  dedication  to  improving  its physical  and natural environment  in such a  way that best benefits its citizens. The  five  islands  recreation  complex has  had the support of two bipartisan city  councils and two local administrations  and all of these people must be praised  for their vision and their persistence  in supporting and pushing this project  toward its successful completion.  I bring the five islands recreational  complex  to the attention of my col leagues  as another example of  the  very positive contributions which Fed eral programs have made to the lives  of the American people-in this case  the local citizens of the city of New  Rochelle, N.Y.e  THE  UNDOCUMENTED  ALIEN  SITUATION ON THE MEXICAN  BORDER  HON.Ede la GARZA  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 30, 1981  e Mr. DE  LA GARZA.

Today, I would like to call your at tention to Mykola Rudenko, a Ukraini an writer who  is presently serving a  12-year term as a prisoner in a Soviet  ""corrective  labor colony."" There ap pears  to be no  justification for  the  arrest and subsequent conviction of  Mr. Rudenko. In November of 1976,  Mr. Rudenko was named chairman of  the newly formed Ukrainian Helsinki  Group, a group established to monitor  human  rights  conditions  in  the  Ukraine. Three short months later, on  February 5, 1977, Mr. Rudenko was ar rested and charged with ""anti-Soviet  agitation and propaganda."" He was  later convicted and sentenced to serve  7 years in Soviet labor camps followed  by 5 years of internal exile.  We,  as Members of Congress and  citizens of a free country, must speak  out and condemn these human rights  violations perpetrated by  the Soviet  Union. I call your attention to Mr. Ru denko not because his case is unique,  but because there are many ""Mykola  Rudenkos""  imprisoned  in  Soviet  prison  camps. These  are men  and  women who have attempted to insure  basic human rights  for  their fell ow  citizens, but instead find themselves in  Soviet prisons.  On July 23, 1981, it was brought to  my attention by two of my colleagues,  Congressman DouGHERTY  and Con gressman DONNELLY, whom  I  com mend  for  their work on Ukrainian  human  rights,  that Mr. Rudenko's  wife,  Raisa,  disappeared  from  her  home on April 14, 1981.

240,,97,-0.367,939,14,Mr. PATTERSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  wish to draw my colleagues' attention  to a splendid example of corporate re sponsibility, a unique newsletter called  The Islander published by the Alame da First National Bank of Alameda,  Calif., an island city on San Francisco  Bay.  Unlike most corporate newsletters to  customers, The  Islander often deals  with controversial social  issues  that  affect Alameda residents. In the arti cles, bank president Donald J. Gehb  explores the issues, speaks his mind  and seeks <and gets) opinions  from  readers.  It is unusual for private business ex ecutives  to  discuss  sensitive  public  topics so openly, and I wish to applaud  Mr. Gehb for doing so and share his  most  recent  article,  a  timely  one  indeed, with my colleagues.  [From The Islander, publication of Alameda  <Calif.) First National Bank, May 1981]  How FEDERAL BUDGET CUTS COULD HURT  ELDERLY  <By Donald J. Gehb, president, Alameda  First National Bank)  About 12,000  senior citizens-people 60  years of age or older-reside in the city of  Alameda. Virtually all of them worked hard  through life <some are still working) and  ended up with a fixed amount of income to  retire on.  Some are quite comfortable, living on pen sions,  investments  and  Social  Security.  Others aren't so fortunate. Their retirement  income  is sparse. They often go hungry.  They have trouble finding affordable hous ing. They have problems of health, trans portation, crime and loneliness.  These are the kinds of problems that most  younger people hardly think about as they  go about the daily tasks of life, but they are  very real and frightening to the elderly. The  anxiety level is rising with talk of budget  cuts in programs that help older people in  areas of nutrition, housing, homemaker as sistance, health care, legal assistance, trans portation and recreation.

241,House,97,0.496,978,14,Mr. ARCHER.," Mr. Speaker, I think  we need to look at why we are debat ing this issue at all today.  We are debating it because the social  security fund is going to be in deficit  and unable to pay all retirement bene fits at the end of next year if we do  not do something. It means we are  going to have to make some very diffi cult choices. They will not go away.  We can listen to all of the political  rhetoric  that we want;  the decision  still has to be made.  The question on the minimum bene fit is whether we continue to pay out  to people benefits beyond what they  have earned by  taxes paid  in when  they do not need that for the source  of  their sustenance, when  they per haps have millions of dollars of out side wealth, when they have large pen sion programs, either governmentally  or privately sponsored, and in doing  that jeopardize the basic benefits paid  to the elderly who do need social secu rity as a major or sole source of sup port.  That is the issue here.  This bill takes away from the Social  Security Subcommittee and the Ways  and Means Committee the opportuni ty to devise a reform program that will  implement a policy that will be con structive and beneficial to all in this  country who depend on social security.  And what will it do? It will send a  bill to the Senate that they will sit on  until they are ready to tack on their  social security proposals and then be  the moving force behind what is done  in  this vital area,  taking away  the  House's constitutional  jurisdiction to  originate all  tax bills. And make no  mistake about it, that is exactly what  we are doing today. We are handing a  vehicle to the Senate to rewrite the  social security bill. I do not think we  should do that.  Our chairman, who has done an out standing  job on  the Social Security  Subcommittee, my friend, the gentle man  from Texas,  JAKE  PICKLE,  has  committed that we will take into con sideration and pass out a  reform on  the minimum benefit structure. That  is the proper way to do it, not in this  hurried procedure before  the House  today.  ",1981

243,House,97,-0.306,1056,14,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  reluctant support of  the conference  report on H.R. 3982, the Omnibus Rec onciliation Act of 1981. Fortunately,  this conference report contains fiscal  year 1982 authorization for the high way and development programs of the  Appalachian  Regional  Commission.  While both programs are reduced in  size, they both nevertheless will con tinue.  Appalachia produces 54 percent of  all U.S.-mined coal, and over 90 per cent of all coal exports. While we rec ognize the importance of coal in our  domestic economy, coal exports have,  since  last  year,  enjoyed  enormous  growth. U.S. coal is attractive to for eign buyers, and Appalachian coal fills  that foreign need. The recent experi ence of coal-carrying vessels lined up  in eastern ports for weeks to receive a  shipment of U.S. coal attests to  the  sudden growth in foreign demand.  ARC programs help get that Appa lachia coal mined by providing infra structure in assisting in the transportation of coal, and municipal and com munity  aid provide  services  to  the  miners.  The Appalachian  highway  system  is currently 60 percent com plete, and 60 percent of that complet ed  system carries coal. Over 14,000  miles of all roadway in Appalachia is  used  to move coal by  truck. Miners  going  into  the  isolated Appalachian  coal fields need housing, water, sewer  systems,  roads, clinics,  training, and  other essentials ARC helps provide.  Communities which must prepare for  the influx of coal miners, and for the  adjustments when  the coal and  the  miners, are gone, need ARC financial  planning and technical assistance.  Coal has the potential to provide a  major part of the investments to ulti mately  replace  the Federal  dollars  now being used in the economic devel opment of Appalachia. Gov. John Y.  Brown, Jr., of Kentucky, in testifying  before  the House Public Works and  Transportation Committee earlier this  year, estimated that the resurgence of  coal could end the need for ARC area  development dollars in 3 to 5 years.  But the use of coal resources to sup port the development of a strong econ omy in Appalachia will not automati cally come about. The long string of  cyclic booms and busts, leaving behind  economic, environmental and human  devastation, attests to that. ARC can  be an invaluable instrument in seeing  to  it  that  the  same  thing doesn't  happen this time around.  H.R. 4144, energy and power appro priations for fiscal year 1982, which  passed  the House earlier  this week,  contains funds for ARC. The report to  accompany the bill calls for a report to  be prepared by the Commission and  submitted  to Congress by December  31, 1981, on a finishup program. The  chairman of that subcommittee,  the  gentleman from Alabama <Mr. BEVILL)  stated during consideration of H.R.  4144 that the potential for exporting  Appalachian coal in furthering Com mission economic development objec tives  be  covered  in  this  report.  I  concur completely and I support this  study effort.  ARC can help us solve our national  energy problems by contributing to in creased coal production and coal ex ports. And it can help solve the diffi cult economic development problems  of the region;  Mr. Speaker, although I am very dis turbed and do not support language in  this conference report which sets back  our national efforts to increase the use  of domestic coal-and I  refer specifi cally to repeal of the off-gas provisions  of the Powerplant Industrial Fuel Use  Act, it would be tragic, now that coal  and the region have come so far, not  to continue ARC long enough to finish  the job.  I commend and thank those confer e es, led by our distinguished chairman  of the House Public Works Commit3982  tee, Mr. HOWARD,  for the long hours  and successful efforts they conducted  in maintaining House language on this  issue and to all members of the confer ence  for  their  recognition of AR C's  valuable and effective work.

244,House,97,-0.339,1056,14,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition to the pending conference  report  on H.R.  the Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. My  opposition is somewhat lessened from  the original passage of Gramm-Latta  II on June 26. I believe that some of  the more onerous provisions of  this  legislation were effectively deleted in  Cont erence.  However, the net effect of this reso lution is that Federal spending will be  reduced by some $35 billion. It seems  as  though  that should be good  in  terms of fulfilling the so-called man date of the people to reduce Federal  spending. However, we have applied an  ax as compared to a scalpel-resulting  in dismembering instead of surgery for  many social and human service pro grams.  There is little doubt as to the fact  that the impact of these cuts will be  felt-the only question  is how soon.  When will the first senior citizen be  turned away  from a  senior center when will  the  first poor  family be  denied  eligibility  for  food  stamps when will  the  first  college  student  seeking to start or resume classes in  college be turned away from the finan cial aid office-how about  the  first   school child being told no more school  lunches. Once this begins to happen the impact will be felt.  Fortunately,  the conferees did not  accept such harsh provisions as cap ping Federal spending under medicaid  of cutting off Federal aid to cities with  rent control but other damages were  done with this legislation.  As a member of two miniconf erences  on the Education and Labor Commit tee I am proud to state that we provid ed real increases in dollars for major  service  programs  under  the Older  Americans Act.  The Committee on Education and  Labor, where I serve as the senior New  York member and a conferee on the  programs  under  our  jurisdiction,  agreed to major revisions in these pro grams. While I have fought this recon ciliation process every step of the way,  I must state that I feel that our work  in  this area was  the best we could  attain under  very  difficult  circum stances.  Briefly, in the area of student finan cial aid, we agree to a compromise that  would  routinely guarantee  loans  to  students with  family  incomes under  $30,000 per year with a needs test for  those above this income level. Incorpo rated in this compromise was my legis lation, House  Joint Resolution 259,  which express the sense of Congress  that changes be effective no earlier  ",1981
245,House,97,-0.321,1069,14,Mr. SYNAR.," Mr. Speaker, while  we have been primarily occupied  in  recent weeks with Government spend ing and Government  taxation, I am  certain that most, if not all, Members  of the body remain concerned over an other area of Government activity the area of Government regulation. I  believe we are all committed to regula tory  reform  in  those  areas where  reform is obviously appropriate. Such  reform is obviously appropriate when  the removal of burdensome regulation  .would promote competition without  adversely affecting the American con sumer.  For  these  reasons, Mr. Speaker,  I  take this opportunity to announce my  intention to introduce, in the not too  distant future, a bill aimed at achiev ing regulatory reform in the area of  petroleum  and  petroleum  product  pipeline rates. I hasten to add at this  point that I am talking only about pe troleum pipelines-pipelines which are  not  franchised by  the Government  and which are not, in any sense of the  term, a legally protected monopoly.  In my view, the Government has the  right, if not the obligation, to regulate  rates of an industry when the Govern ment extends to that industry a fran chise, a license, or any mechanism to  protect  it  from  competition. With  regard to petroleum pipelines, howev er, the Government affords no protec tion from competition. Competition in  the  industry  is  extensive;  shippers  have multiple options  to serve  their  transportation needs; and the consum ers are the beneficiaries of the compe tition provided by the private sector.  Nonetheless, Congress has,  largely  through oversight in my opinion, con tinued  the  rate  regulation of  these  pipelines. When we created the Feder al Energy Regulatory Commission, in  Public Law 95-91, we  transferred  to  the Department of Energy and  the  FERC the authority to regulate pipe lines,  including petroleum pipelines.  Unfortunately, the broad transfer au thority included the authority to set  and  prescribe  rates  for  petroleum  pipelines.  Back in 1906, when rate regulation  of  these  pipelines was  first  estab lished, there was some justification for  it, because shippers had relatively few  options available  to  them for  trans port of their petroleum commodities.  Today,  however,  shippers  enjoy  a  great variety of options, which include  intramodal,  intermodal, and shipper  exchanges. The recent history of the  industry  reveals  that  these options  have created competitive pressures re sulting  in  the establishment of fair  and equitable prices for shippers and  for the ultimate consumers.  Despite  this  healthy  competition  and the shipper I consumer protection  ",1981

I believe the factors we must consider  to determine a nominee's qualifications  are his or her professional skills. expeTi ence, objectivity, and personal integrity.  An individual's personal views on a po litical issue are relevant only insofar as  they affect those qualifications. To give  personal views any greater weight, or  to  require a particular point of view  would make nearly every intelligent out spoken individual unqualified from the  point of view of many of my colleagues,  who have a wide variety of strongly held  views  on  religious  and  philosophical  issues.  A number of individuals and groups  concerned with the rights of women in  this country voiced strong opposition to  the nomination of Rex Lee.  I believe  their concerns are extremelv important,  particularly when they address the ap pointment of an individual to the omce  of Solicitor General.  I gave a great deal of weight to their  concerns as well as the views Dean Lee  expressed  to Chairman THURMOND on  the issue of women's rights:  I give you my unqualified ai:surance that  I regard these matters, the rights of women  and minorities and the oreservaticn of nat ural  resources  and  the  envlronmeil!t  as  among the most important challenges that  our Nation  faces at  the present  time. If  confirme:l by the Senate I wm vigorously  support and defend  those  laws that strive  for improvement in these areas, as well as  the policies underlying  those  laws. More over,  in reaching my decisions concerning  positions to be taken in litigation before the  courts, I wm do so in light of the importance  of these matters, because in my view, they  represent important values.  The Judiciary Committee must always  encour.age open and through discussion  whenever there is opposition to a nomi nee--that discussion is particularly im portant when a nominee's position on  the rights of individuals is questioned.  I am certain that I will continue to be  called upon to consider a nominee with  whom I have philosophical or political  differences.  Dean Rex Lee has demonstrated the  professional skills and personal integrity  necessary to the Office of Solici.tor Gen eral.

I have supported other  nominees whose policies and views I have  opposed. But th!s nomination concerns  fundamental constitutional rights. The  Solicitor General is in a unique position  of responsibility for  insuring constitu tional guarantees.  Dean Lee has consistently stated his  strong opposition  to  the equal  rights  amendment. The purpose of  the equal  rights amendment, which I strongly sup port,  is  to acknowledge  that women's  rights 1are constitutional rights, and are  as sacred and as deserving of protection  from discrimination as those of men. I  cannot support a nominee for this special  position who is not committed to these  constitutional rights.  ",1981
250,Senate,97,-0.212,1160,14,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I wish  to make a few brief comments concern ing the nomination of Dean Rex Lee to  be  the next Solicitor General of  the  United States.  I recognize that this nomination has  met with a good deal of opposition from  organizations representing the rights of  women  around  the  country.  These  groups have serious concerns and their  interest  in  this nomination  is  clearly  warranted as the authority and respon sibility of the Office of Solicitor General  is substantial.  The members of this committee have  an obligation to address the issues raised  by  the  individuals  and organizations  that have opposed  this nomination Jn  our deliberations on Mr. Lee's appoint ment.  My concern when considering judicial  appointments is primarily with the in tegrity and ability of  the nominee.  I  expect to have philosophical differences  with many nominees to judicial office in  the future.  These differences are  inevitable and  I am sure that debates such as this will  occur in this forum again.  However, when considering an ap pointment, I do insist that I be able to  satisfy myself  that  the nominee's un derstanding of his role in the  judicial  system is sound and that his ability to  serve the Government in this role is un questioned.  As a result of my questioning both in  the confirmation hearings and in a pri vate meeting with Dean Lee, I am con vinced  that Dea.n Lee's sole duty and  allegiance as Solicitor General would be  to the U.S. Government. I am confident  that his religious and personal views on  any matter, including the eoual rights  amendment, would have no bearing on  the legal posWons that he represents.  An exchange that took place between  Dean Lee and myself during  the con firmation hearings clearly  states  this  position.  Senator BAucus.

261,House,97,0.425,149,19,Mr. LOEFFLER.," Mr.  Chairman,  during recent years I have personally  witnessed  the  destruction  of  thou sands of acres of oak trees in the hill  country area of Texas. These oak trees  are extremely valuable for their criti cal  ecological  contribution  toward  maintaining a proper balance of do mestic  livestock and wildlife popula tions in the area. The disease causing  this destruction-live oak decline-is  resulting in heavy losses  throughout  Texas  and may  eventually  impact  more than 3 million acres of trees in  nine States from Texas  to Virginia,  and  is associated with oak wilt-the  most destructive disease of oaks in the  upper Mississippi Valley.  Research  into  this disease by  the  Forest Service in cooperation with the  Texas Agricultural Extension Service  has identified possible means to con trol the spread of oak wilt. Yet, de spite the best efforts of these groups,  limited resources exist with which to  combat the spread of the disease on a  large scale basis.  In an effort to focus the resources of  the Department of Agriculture on this  critical problem,  I have offered  the  amendment now pending before  the  House. However, I am informed that  the Department does have existing au thority to deal with this problem, and,  within existing resources,  is proceed ing  to determine  the extent of  the  problem in an effort to provide the as sistance necessary to halt the spread  of oak wilt.  I would like to clarify this authority  with  the distinguished chairman of  the Agriculture Committee,  and at  this  time  I  yield  to  the gentleman  from Texas for that purpose.  Mr. DE LA GARZA. I appreciate the  gentleman's concerns and join him in  his efforts to bring attention to this  serious problem. I have received assur ances from the Department of Agriculture that the Department does have  the authority  to deal with oak wilt  and is currently evaluating the prob lem in order to determine what assist ance can be provided to those areas  critically  impacted  by  the  disease.  Under section 5 of  the Cooperative  Forestry Assistance Act of 1978, and  other USDA authorities,  the Forest  Service  is  initiating  technical assist ance,  in cooperation with the Texas  Forest Service,  to evaluate the prob lem and recommend appropriate solu tions.  I have a  letter  to  this effect  from the Deputy Secretary of Agricul ture and I include it in the RECORD at  this point:  DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,  Washington, D.C., October 6, 1981.  Hon. E (KIKA) DE LA GARZA,  Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,  House of Representatives,  Washington, D. C.  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: We would  like  to  comment on the amendment to H.R. 3603  offered by Mr. Loeffler which appears on  page H6725 of the September 30 CONGRES SIONAL  RECORD.  This  amendment, which  would appear in the bill as section 1012 of  Title X, would direct the Secretary of Agri culture to study oak wilt and oak decline  diseases and evaluate methods of control.  The results of the study would be transmit ted to Congress by March 1, 1982. It is our  understanding that this amendment is di rected toward the oak wilt problem affect ing live oak trees in south Texas.  It is our position that this amendment is  not necessary because the Secretary already  has authority to deal with the live oak wilt  problem under Sec. 5 of the Cooperative  Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 <92 Stat.  368) and other USDA authorities. Under  this authority, the Forest Service is initiat ing technical assistance in cooperation with  the Texas Forest Service  to evaluate the  problem and potential control  techniques.  However,  this type of technical assistance  would not represent a comprehensive study  as appears  to be required by  the amend ment. Such a study could not be accom plished during fiscal year 1982 because of  budget constraints. Furthermore, even  if  the resources were available, such a study  could not possibly be completed by March 1,  1982, for biological and other reasons.  The Department will consider the results  of the Forest Service evaluation, to be car ried out under existing authorities, to deter mine what further action, if any, would be  appropriate to deal with  the live oak wilt  problem. As you know, any financial assist ance by USDA would have to reflect overall  budget priorities and the need to hold down  the level of the Federal budget.  The Office of Management and Budget  advises  that there  is no objection  to the  presentation of this report from the stand point of the Administration's program.  Sincerely,  RICHARD E. LYNG,  Deputy Secretary.  Mr. DE LA GARZA. This activity by  USDA tracks the intent of the gentle man's amendment.  The gentleman has my assurances  that I will work with him to assure a  prompt and thorough review of this  problem in order to provide needed as sistance at the earliest possible time.  ",1981

263,,97,0.268,201,19,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Speaker, today I  would like to recognize an important  event which  recently  took place  in  Pennsylvania, and pay tribute to the  outstanding  individual  honored  by  that event.  September 29,  1981, was declared  Larry Holmes Day  in Pennsylvania,  and the highlight of the day was ac tivities I was happy to be a part of  which took place in the heavyweight  champ's hometown of Easton, Pa.  It was a bright, sunny day as we  gathered  in Center Square. Spirits  were high in anticipation of the Gov ernor's and Larry's arrival. It was a  very special day for the city of Easton.  On hand to honor Larry were Gov.  Dick Thornburgh, and his wife Ginny,  Easton Mayor Philip Mitman, State  representatives Ed Sieminski and Len  Gruppo, representatives of the Easton  Area Chamber of Commerce, and over  2,000 of Larry's friends and fans of  Easton. Later on, sportscaster Howard  Cosen  joined  in  paying  tribute  to  Larry. Larry's mother Flossie and his  wife Diane were also present. While  Larry is known nationally for his abili ties in the ring, an important theme of  Larry Holmes Day was the many and  varied contributions he made  to our  community.  Gov. Dick Thornburgh described the  champ as a ""man who has kept his  roots in Pennsylvania and who honors  those  roots. He  has kept  his  feet  firmly  planted  in  the  community  24815  where he grew up.""  Indeed  that  is  true. While another champion might  have moved  to a  larger city seeking  more publicity, Larry and his family  have remained in Easton where he has  become a community  leader.  In his  own words,  I don't want to be a star. I want to help  people help people.  Remembering the help and guidance  he received as a youngster in Easton,  Larry  is a  leading supporter of  the  Boys Club of Easton, St. Anthony's  Youth Center, the local NAACP, and  other charities. His contributions have  included a new boxing gym and other  sports equipment, as well as his time  working with Easton's youth.  Recently, Larry has become a leader  in bringing new business  to Easton,  and has opened his own restaurant,  nightclub, and sportswear store. He is  also finishing plans for a sports com plex where a variety of recreational  activities will be available. The Easton  Assassin in the ring is Easton's leading  citizen outside of it.  In short, Larry Holmes is more than  the best in his profession, although he  certainly  is  that. Larry Holmes  is a  man who cares deeply about his com munity and  its  residents,  and  tries  every way he can  to contribute  to  their quality of life. His quiet words of  wisdom  gained  through  experience always coming from  the heart-pack  even more punch than the ferocious  left hook.  I  am  proud  to  represent Larry  Holmes in the U.S. Congress and I am  doubly proud to call him my friend.  And I am proud to join the citizens in  Pennsylvania and especially  the city  of Easton in saying, ""Thanks Champs,  you're the greatest.""

271,House,97,-0.258,318,19,Mr. ALBOSTA.," Mr. Chairman, the  farm  bill  that we  are  considering  today is nowhere near as strong as it  should be. Loan  rates are  too  low,  dairy price supports are too low, and  there is not even a sugar loan program  in the bill. For the past 3 weeks, those  of us from agriculture districts and ag riculture backgrounds have  tried  to  explain to other Members the impor tance of having a strong farm bill that  will help farmers receive a fair return  for their commodities.  American agriculture is one of the  most  productive  industries  in  the  world. We are able to feed this entire  country and export grain  to many  parts of the world. American agricul ture  is  so  efficient because of  the  family farm. The 1981 farm bill will  not help the family farmer unless loan  rates are  increased, dairy price sup ports are adjusted upward, and a sugar  program is included.  I believe  these  types of programs  must be in any final 1981 farm bill the  Congress approves.  If they are not,  American agriculture will not be as  strong and as productive as it can be in  a world of hungry people who desper ately need our food. Fifty years ago,  this country and particularly the farm  economy was  in  the middle of  the  worst economic crisis ever known, the  Great Depression of the 1930's. Farms  were  foreclosed  on,  people  went  hungry, and the country suffered.  I hope we have learned enough over  the years to avoid making the same  mistakes  that caused the Great De pression and particularly I hope that  we will pass a new farm bill that will  not  further hurt American agricul ture. We  have  the opportunity  to  enact good agriculture policy for farm ers,  consumers,  and  the country.  I  urge my colleagues to consider this as  we move toward passage of the 1981  farm bill.  At the same time, I would also hope  that my collegues would realize that  farmers must pay whatever the going  price  is  for equipment,  seed, herbi cides, and feed, while they have abso lutely nothing to say about the market  price. For these reasons it is necessary  for Congress to have some say in how  low farm prices are allowed by having  a decent loan rate.  Mr. Chairman, I would like unani mous consent to enter into the RECORD  a statement by Dale Fast in the Stur gis Journal on Saturday, July 11, 1981,  that best sums up the farm situation.  The statement follows:  FARMER Now HAS A PRAYER  Communications between the farmer and  his city friends is a constant challenge.  The grass on the other side of the fence  always looks greener. But when we get over  there we find it's just as hard to mow. Our  city friends don't understand the farmers  plight and the farmer sometimes doesn't un derstand that his city cousin has problems,  too.  The farmer is a patient man-patient, de termined, and proud. He has to be patient.  He'll lose a crop and come right back next  spring with a grin and an 80-hour week. He  battles the weather and machinery break down  to get the crop planted. He spends  hundreds of dollars per acre for seed, fertil izer, and pesticides, knowing full well that  frost or drought may get it, and if not, the  bugs will-and if there is any left, a hail  storm will probably finish it off. So he has  to be a patient and determined person to be  a farmer.  But there are some things he just doesn't  understand.  I've seen wall plaques for the housewife,  golfer and even one for a sunday afternoon  driver. Perhaps we need a prayer for the  farmer to help him understand. It might go  something like this:  ""Help me  to understand, Lord, why a  person will pay $1.50 for a four ounce drink  in a bar and say ""Gimme another one"", but  you charge him $1.85 for a whole gallon of  milk and he'll say ""boy, that's expensive"".  ""Help me to understand why a Japanese  autoworker will pay $17.00 for a lb. of steak  in a grocery store and a U.S. auto worker,  who draws wages of $8.00 per hour more  than the Japanese worker, will look at steak  in the meat counter at $3.25 per pounds and  he'll shake his head and say, ""Food costs  are just too high.""  And help me  to understand, Lord, why  when I borrow $5,000 to paint my barn and  put a new roof on my house, the tax asses sor raises my  taxes even  though  I don't  have any more equity in the place.  And maybe, Lord, you can help me to un derstand why  some  people  shake  their  heads when a farmer pays for power steer ing and air conditioning on his  tractor,  which he uses 12 to 14 hours a day in a hot  dusty field, when they buy the same thing  on an automobile to drive down a smooth  blacktop road for less than an hour a day.  And, Lord, help me to understand why the  weeds always grow the fastest in my com  field at a time when my city cousin says the  fish are biting the best, and invites me to go  along fishing on his weekends off, or after  he gets out of work at 3:30 p.m.  And could you help me understand how  the raccoons know exactly when to raid my  sweet com patch the night before I think  it's ready for the freezer?  And please help me to understand why  the output per worker in our factories has  gone down to a point that unit labor costs  have doubled in the last five years, while ef ficiency of  the American  farmer has  in",1981

High Commissioner for  Refugees,  the Honorable Poul Hart ling, former Prime Minister of Den mark.  The Office which he heads has been  charged by the United Nations, over  the past three decades, with providing  international protection for  refugees  and for assisting their repatriation or  resettlement. While  seeking  initially  to provide immediate, emergency care  for  refugees,  the  agency  has  also  sought to find more permanent solu tions. Over the past several years, we  have seen heavy refugee flows in the  Indochina region, into Pakistan from  Afghanistan,  in Africa,  and, within  this hemisphere, in Central America.  The United States has always shared  the humanitarian objectives and con cerns of the UNHCR and is pleased to  be in partnership with it in seeking to  provide emergency relief to the boat  people of Indochina, the destitute ref ugees  in  the Horn of Africa,  the  Afghan refugees fleeing from Soviet  aggression into Pakistan, and refugees  in many other parts of the world.  In March of this year, a committee  staff study mission to refugee areas re ported back that the increasingly fre quent  refugee  exoduses  since  1977,  amounting to three or four new exo duses a year in some cases, have trans formed the UNHCR from a small-scale  to a monumental enterprise. Because  of the tremendous volume of refugees,  the capacity of the UNHCR to address  the humanitarian problems of these  vulnerable people has been taxed to  its limits. As problems have arisen in  connection with these large and un predictable refugee flows, UNHCR has  attempted to find new ways of coordi nating prompt and adequate interna tional responses to immediate refugee  needs.  The UNHCR has also contributed  significantly  to  the development of  international refugee law by assisting  governments with the preparation of a  variety of  international  legal  instru ments dealing with  the status and  treatment of refugees. It has promot ed amnesty policies to assure the safe  repatriation  of  certain  refugees  to  their home countries, particularly in  Africa. In Asia the UNHCR has also  encouraged governments to grant ref ugees asylum, prevent piracy, rape and  murder on the high seas and promote  family reunification.  The United States has generally con tributed over one-fourth of UNHCR's  annual budget,  far more  than any  other single U.N. donor contributes.  This  important contribution by  the  United States to the ongoing, vital hu manitarian function which this inter national agency serves is a sound in vestment in the welfare of all mankind  and in a future of peace and freedom  from suffering and persecution.  Mr. speaker,  I want  to  join  the  many  tributes being raised  today  to  the UNHCR and to urge the Members  of this body to add substance to those  tributes by continuing to offer strong  support to the programs that Office  implements in the pursuit of its impor tant mission of compassion.  Thank you.e  e ",1981

275,,97,-0.596,565,19,Mr. LELAND.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am introducing a resolution to desig nate  the week beginning March 15,  1982,  as  ""National Student Safety  Week."" This resolution seeks to recog nize the important contributions made  by student safety programs which in volve youth  in safety activities de signed to prevent the needless loss of  lives  and  injuries  to  our Nation's  youth.   Needless  injuries have occurred  to  thousands  of  school  students  and  young adults as the evidence continues  to show. In my State, each year ap proximately 150 Texas public school  students die as a  result of accidents  alone. Another 84,000 are injured in  accidents. During 1979,  the National  Safety Council released alarming na tional statistics: 14 million or 9.8 per cent  of  all  accidents  involved  the  young, inexperienced driver under the  age of 20. Of those 14 million, 10,700  or 16.4 . percent were fatal. Accidents  involving schoolbuses, pedestrians, and  bicyclists were  devastating  as well.  Schoolbus  transportation  accidents  killed 180 persons in 1979, including 95  pupils, 5 bus drivers and 800 other per sons. Injuries in schoolbus related ac cidents totaled about 7 ,500 of which  4,410 were students. Since 1935,  the  number  of  pedacycle-motor  vehicle  deaths has more  than doubled. The  number of pedacycles in use has in creased 28-fold so that the death rate  per 100,000 pedacycles  in use  is 12  times the rate of 1935. In 1979, 36 out  of every 100,000 persons between the  ages of 15-24 were involved in fatal ac cidents and accounted for 22,000 inju ries. If only caution had been used, I  am sure that a proportional percent age of these accidents could have been  decreased.  The energy and leadership potential  of young people can be channeled to  help reduce the number of accidental  deaths and injuries to themselves and  their  classmates.  The  number  of  safety projects and activities being car ried out in schools and communities  across  this country and perhaps  in  your congressional district, is proof of  students' desire to contribute to their  own safety and the safety of others.  The youth safety programs will en courage participation by and provide  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  opportunity for elementary and high  school youth  to become  involved  in  and to accept responsibility for pro moting safe living for all. The national  student safety program has 202 school  members representing 28 States and  more than 300 delegates attended its  22d annual convention last year. It is  my  hope  that  this  resolution will  prompt the addition of more States  and  schools  initiating  this program  which engages its members in activi ties which promote safe living for all.  The world is not perfect and young  people know  it. They  are  alert  to  social  shortcomings  and  anxious  to  have a hand in correcting them. They  want a part in the action. They have a  strong desire to use their energies and  resourcefulness on current problems to do something that counts. Working  for the safety and well-being of others  and  themselves  is an  ideal proving  ground.  The national  student  safety pro gram,  sponsored  by  the American  Driver and Traffic Safety Education  Association, has indicated that their  most important goal for the year is to  have  a  ""National  Student  Safety  Week""  proclaimed  in  the United  States. I ask that you  join with me  and cosponsor the resolution to help  the members  of  this  organization  achieve  their worthwhile goal, while  encouraging youth to become involved  in promoting safety  in our Nation's  schools and communities.

276,,97,0.3,578,19,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Speaker, I support  the bill introduced by my Florida col league, Representative ANDY  As elected Representatives from  the  State in the Union hardest hit by ille gal  narcotic  activity, which  affects  every Floridian, we are working  toIRELAND.  ",1981
277,,97,0.353,591,19,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am  introducing,  for discussion pur poses, H.R. 4820, a bill that incorpo rates certain changes recommended by  the  administration with  respect  to  rates of overtime pay for  inspectors  and other U.S. Customs Service per sonnel and the reimbursement of over time expenses by commercial users.  I commend  the administration for  its efforts to begin the restructure of  the overtime system for the Customs  Service  in order to eliminate abuses  and to conform the current system to  normal Government practice. The ad ministration's proposal also provides  for reimbursement of overtime costs  by commercial users who require cus tom's services during holidays, Sun days, or overtime periods. This reim bursement would not apply, as is the  case under current  law,  to overtime  services provided at land border cross ings.  Basically, the bill would reduce from  double  time  to  time-and-a-half  the  basic rate of compensation for over time with a minimum 2-hour callout  rather  than a  block payment of 4  hours for each 2-hour period or frac tion thereof lasting at least 1 hour. On  Sundays the rate also would be time and-a-half unless Sunday was part of a  regular work shift in which case a 25percent premium would apply instead.  Double time would be paid for holi days. No person could have total over time earnings in excess of the maxi mum GS-15 salary, rather than the  current maximum hourly rate of GS10, step 1.  The extensive use of overtime by the  U.S. Customs Service has been a sub ject of concern to the Congress for a  number  of  years.  The Ways  and  Means Committee  continuously  re views overtime expenditures and reim bursement, and has encouraged Cus toms to further reduce overtime and  provide more efficient delivery of serv ices. In addition, for the past 3 years,  Congress has imposed a cap on yearly  overtime payments for individual cus toms officers; the cap for fiscal year  1982 will be $25,000.  However, in my view, overtime costs  remain  excessive  and  a  continuing  high level of overtime hours contrib utes to abnormal working conditions  where customs officers have little time  for. personal lives and where their sala ries can far exceed the GS level for  which they are hired. In addition, ex cessive overtime has in the past led to  outright abuse resulting, through less than-responsible scheduling, in maxi mum overtime payments for minimum  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  hours worked. Other abuses  include  overcharges  to users who otherwise  would divide the cost of overtime serv ices.  I believe Customs Service personnel  ought to be paid overtime premiums  for  extra,  disruptive  assignments.  Until we have complete hearings, I do  not know exactly what is appropriate,  but  it  is obvious  that  the current  system needs overhaul.  The unique mandate of the Customs  Service requires a greater use of over time  than most other Government  agencies.  Inspectional  services  and  other clearance procedures are con trolled to some degree by carrier re quests and by transportation timeta bles set independently of the Customs  Service. However, a number of steps  can be taken to reduce the amount of  overtime such as improved scheduling,  the use of part-time employees, and  the elimination of abuses  in the as signment and authorization of over time.  The bill I am introducing today will,  I hope, serve as a discussion draft of  the needed legislated changes on over time rates and reimbursement require ments that should go hand in hand  with continued management efforts to  improve the overtime structure. I hope  the administration, the Congress, and  the Customs Service can work togeth er to obtain a legislative package that  will assure  the most efficient oper ation of this important agency.e  REAGAN SHOULD ACT ON  ULSTER  HON.

278,,97,-0.142,617,19,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President,  recent  news  reports have suggested  that  the  latest economic reports from the auto mobile industry will show a continuing  decline in our Nation's economic health.  Unfortunately, these reports are proving  to be worse than we had anticipated.  I have been notified today that Gen eral Motors, early next month, will in definitely suspend its second shift at its  Oklahoma City plant. No time has been  designated for when this shift might be  restored. This suspension will affect ap proximately 2,500 people. This layoff is  in the mos,t modern of General Motors  plants which has been producing its best  selling models.  . The layoff at the General Motors plant  m Oklahoma City is just another indica tion of the urgent need to bring down  interest rates to reasonable levels. While  high  interest rates alone are not  the  complete cause of problems in the auto  industry, they are a significant part of  the problem.  I met this morning along with a group  of members of the Senate Finance Com mittee with  Federal Reserve  Board  Chainnan Paul Volcker and expressed  my feelings to him that he, the Presi dent, and the Secretary of the Treasury  should  immediately go to work  to de velop a policy to bring down the rates.  This  situation  demonstrates  that  no  States or area of the country is immune  from the effects of a failure to deal with  high interest rates. I hope this layoff will  be only temporary and will continue to  do all that I can to improve the economic  environment.  Mr. President, we are faced every day  with increasing reports of recession and  continued high interest rates. We have  waited too long to take remedial action.  Something must be done immediately to  prevent irreparable harm to our econ omy. Coordinated action to bring mone tary and fiscal policy into harmony is  urgently needed. I will continue to ad dress this issue on a daily basis because  ~t is imperative that these ruinous high  mterest rates remain the focus of our  attention in bringing our economy back  under control.

A letter dated October 5, 1981, from  the dean of University of Pittsburgh  School of Law so well states what we are  attempting here that I ask to have it  printed in the RECORD.  The letter follows:  UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH,  October 5, 1981.  Hon. ARLEN SPECTER,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR SENATOR SPECTER:  I have your letter  of September 25, 1981 and the attached copy  of S. 1631 which I read with great interest.

280,Senate,97,0.52,708,19,Mr. NICKLES.," Senator, I appreciate  the comment. If I might ask you an addi tional question: If we develop this one fifth of the total grant project, and given  all the plant expenses, given the land,  given all  the fixed expenses, yet  they  determine through the production ca~a­ bilities of this plant that it still costs given the plant is free, zero cost of the  plant,  that the additional cost of one  barrel of refined solvent comes out to  be $76, do you think that any company think this would doom the additional  four units.  I do not see how it would be economi cally feasible, marketable, in any way,  shape, or form, and I think it would just  end the project right there at $76, given  a zero cost for the plant and equipment,  given no replacement cost, no deprecia tion or anything, not figuring any of  those costs  in,  just the marginal pro duction cost of an additional barrel of  fuel  if it comes out tQ. $76 per barrel,  and I seriously doubt that the market place or the Federal Government would  want to duplicate that type of disaster.

281,Senate,97,0.433,721,19,Mr. HAYAKAWA.," Madam President,  since 1897, the Parent-Teachers Associa tion, the PTA, has initiated programs to  improve  the education and home  life  of elementary and secondary students  and their families. The passage of House  Joint Resolution 318  in  the House of  Representatives and Senate Joint Reso lution  105  in  the Senate  established  October 1981 as ""National PTA Member ship Month,"" to commend the PTA for  its consistent advocacy of the interests  of children and youth.  The key  to  the success of  the PT A  is cooperation. Together parents, teach ers,  industry, and community  leaders  are meeting students' needs by providing  a wide range of services for children,  families, and schools.  One of the National PTA's most im portant tasks is that of parent-educator.  Seminars, publications, and other  re sources have been developed in parent ing, health, and alcohol education. On  the State  level,  the California State  PTA publishes movie  reviews  in their  official publication,  the Bulletin. Films  are PT A rated for violence. sex, pro fane or obscene language, cruelty to ani mals, drugs, and nudity. The California  State PT A has also worked with  the  March of Dimes in sponsoring a series  of seminars  to assist parents in com municating with their children. All of  these activities can help parents with  the important task of rearing their chil dren.  The PT A has been resourceful in its  use of outside funds to develop useful  programs for parents and children. Un derwritten  through a  cooperative ar",1981
282,,97,-0.173,747,19,Mr. FUQUA.," Mr. Speaker, last week  I brought to my colleagues attention  the first in a series of articles on the  quality  of American  education  in  mathematics and sciences, written by  Dr. Jessica Tuchman Mathews of the  Washington Post.  As noted by Dr. Mathews:  The United States cannot compete in the  world economy without a technically skilled  work force, nor will any amount of money  spent on weapons buy security without men  and women capable of using them effective ly.  I  think  the points made by Dr.  Mathews are particularly  important  given the hard budgetary choices we  will be making  in  the next several  weeks.  I strongly recommend the full text  for my colleagues to consider on this  important issue:  DECLINE IN EDUCATION: (II) THE CAUSES  No one knows exactly what has caused the  striking decline in the quality of American  education. especially in science and mathe matics. That a deterioration has been under  way-perhaps for as long as two decades-is  clear. That it has coincided with the oppo site  trend aboard  is  also beyond doubt.  While American educators focus on the fail ure to learn ""basic skills,"" the Soviet Union,  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Japan and many other countries are making  great advances both in the proportion of  students who  complete  secondary  school  and in the breadth, depth and rigor of what  they are taught.  One factor  in the United States dismal  performance  is unquestionably  too much  television. Seventy-five percent of last year's  high  school  graduating  class  reported  spending less than five hours per week on  homework. Twenty-six percent of them re ported four hours or more per day watching  television. In a 1973 survey of science educa tion in 19 European and Third World coun tries, the only measure on which American  students scored above  the mean was  in  hours spent watching television. The result  is a pervasive  intellectual passivity and a  large number of students who never learn to  read well enough to acquire the taste for it.  Another cause is the decline in the qual ity, and even availability, of teachers, espe cially in science and mathematics. Twenty five years ago teaching was the only socially  acceptable career for many bright, motivat ed women; today they have other options.  Men and women with science training can  earn far more than a teacher's pay working  as computer programmers. Chronic vacan cies for mathematics teachers-as high as 25  percent in some school districts-are filled  by those without training in mathematics.  There are 10,000 physics teachers in the na tion's 16,000 school districts. Lack of public  concern for the quality of education, lack of  respect for teaching as a profession, lack of  support systems to keep teachers up to date  in their fields and appallingly low pay are  all having the predictable result. Morale in  the schools is spiraling downward, and col lege graduates going into teaching consist ently come from the bottom of their classes.  Numerous studies have postulated other  causes: too much violence and too little dis cipline in the schools, too much latitude in  course selection, too much encouragement  and opportunity for students to do things  other than study, too much stress on basic  skills that makes this minimal achievement  the goal rather than the foundation for fur ther learning, and so on.  But to a certain extent these phenomena  must be symptoms rather than causes, for  what happens in the schools is a reflection  of the values and expectations of society at  large. Alexander Astin, professor of educa tion at UCLA, writes: ""The schools are just  less demanding then they use  to be and  Cstudentsl are lazy up and down the ability  spectrum."" What we seem to have suffered,  in short, is a loss of appetite for the hard  work of learning and $11 appreciation for  the results.  This is not the first time American educa tion has fallen behind. What is scary is that  this time we as a nation don't seem to care or care enough. When the launch of Sput nik in 1957 brought recognition that U.S.  science education badly needed  improve ment, we responded with new courses, text books,  teacher  training  and  curricula.  Though  there were  some problems,  the  effort did produce more an better-educated  science and mathematics graduates. This  time there has been no single jolting event,  but evidence of a far worse slump is every where. And  this year the federal budget  cuts wiped out the agency responsible for  the post-Sputnik science program-the only  single focus for such an effort in the nation.  We  ignore what  is  happening  in  the  schools at our peril. The United States  cannot compete in the world economy with out a technically skilled work force, nor will  25361  any amount of money spent on weapons buy  security without men and women capable of  using them effectively. Far more important,  we cannot hope to sustain a democracy, the  most demanding form of government, with out citizens capable of understanding the  choices that have to be made.  Making up the lost ground, especially in  science and mathematics, is going to require  plenty of money, but without a well-educat ed populace what other investment is worth  making? Most of all it will require a change  in attitude-higher expectations of work  and achievement. Years ago poor children  on New York's Lower East Side were sent  off to the first day of school with a gift of  honey and nuts to symbolize the sweetness  of  learning. That attitude, and a  school  system that made knowledge available to ev eryone who wanted it, were what made this  country great. It's not gone, it just needs to  be recaptured.

283,,97,-0.318,747,19,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to take this opportunity to con gratulate two of my constituents who  are receiving awards from the Camden  County Old Timers Softball Associa tion.  John P. Greeley,  long  active  in  union,  civic,  sports,  and  charitable  causes, will  receive  the association's  1981 Humanitarian Award for his con tinuing efforts on behalf of his fellow  man.  John has been a frontrunner in com munity affairs for many years. He has  been a member of the Teamsters Local  676  for 38 years, John started as a  driver and eventually worked his way  up through the ranks and became a  shop steward in 1956. He was later ap pointed organizer and in 1960 elected  president. John  is presently serving  his eighth consecutive  term. Under  John's leadership, the local's member slliP has doubled.  Because of his dedication and sensi tivity to their needs, John has become  a  champion  among  senior  citizens.

284,House,97,-0.472,760,19,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker,  in 1980  many of the one-time ""Youth for Roo sevelt""  became  senior  citizens  for  Ronald Reagan because they believed  his promise not to cut social security.  But for all his harkening back to the  words of F. D. R., Ronald Reagan is  betraying precisely these people. His  proposals to cut social security mark  the first attempt ever made to break  the sacred compact between the Gov ernment and the people that has char acterized  social  security  since  its  founding in 1935. For 46 years, work ers have faithfully paid into the social  security system because they believed  in the Government's commitment to  the program.  Time and again, throughout the his tory of the social security system, radi cal Republicans have tried to block bi partisan efforts to improve social secu rity. But  in 1980,  then conservative  Republican candidate Reagan prom ised he would be different.  People knew he had attacked social  security in 1976, but in 1980 people be lieved  his  promise  that  he  had  changed.  But,  sadly  enough,  as  soon  as  Ronald Reagan had gotten the votes  of senior citizens and was safely in the  White House, he began his assault on  the elderly's most important program.  The President's favored terms, ""safety  net"" and ""truly needy"" cannot mask  his  true motive  of  balancing  the  budget on the back of social security  recipients.  Herbert Hoover, Alf Landon, Bob  Taft, and BARRY GOLDWATER had the  courage of their convictions and work ing people knew where they stood.  Franklin Roosevelt would turn over  in his grave  if he were  to hear the  words he spoke being used to justify  social security cuts.  Well, sadly, some of the ""Youth for  Roosevelt"" may have misplaced their  confidence in Ronald Reagan in 1980,  but few are so gullible as to ever again  trust President Reagan and the Re publican Party on social security.  WE ARE PAYING MORE THAN  WE BARGAINED FOR  <Mr. McCURDY  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  Mr. McCURDY. Mr. Speaker, Con gress and American  taxpayers have  been paying far more than the origi nal, estimated price for new defense  weapons. Some examples are the 200percent cost growth for the M-1 tank  and the 300-plus-percent cost growth  for the Black Hawk helicopter.  Cost figures submitted last week by  the Congressional Budget Office are  even more startling and should alert  this Congress to a problem that can no  longer go unchecked.  In testimony before the Armed Serv ices Committee's Special Panel on De fense Procurement, which I chair, the  CBO  said  they  found  a  unit  cost  growth of over $4.3 billion in 37 de fense programs that were included in  the 1982 fiscal budget submitted last  March. That  is  unanticipated  cost  growth. In just 1 year, we are talking  about a 24-percent cost increase after  adjusting for inflation.  We on the Special Defense Procure ment Panel will complete 4 months of  hearings Wednesday with the testimo ny of Deputy Secretary of Defense  Frank Carlucci. He will be asked to tell  us what the administration  is doing  about these cost growth problems. I  invite  all  interested Members  to  attend.  ADMINISTRATION OPPOSED TO  ENERGY AFFILIATE AT WORLD  BANK  <Mr. BEDELL asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1981
285,House,97,-0.24,760,19,Mr. BEDELL.," Mr. Speaker, last week  DICK OTTINGER and I cochaired a joint  hearing on  the U.S. posture  toward  helping developing nations meet their  energy needs.  The Reagan administration stands  alone in the world in its opposition to  establishing an energy affiliate at the  World Bank. One of the explanations  offered by our Government is that we  are opposing the creation of any new  international  structures. They  also  cite the possible cost to the U.S. Treas ury as a reason for resisting the pro posal.  Fortunately, Robert McNamara, the  former President of the World Bank,  was present to set the record straight  last week. He stated that creation of  the energy affiliate at the World Bank  would not involve the creation of any  new organization or bureaucracy.  He stated further that the proposed  energy affiliate would not necessarily  require any additional U.S. contribu tion to the World Bank.  A witness  from  the State Depart ment responded that the Reagan ad ministration would oppose the energy  affiliate even if its creation does not  require a new bureaucracy and does  not require any additional U.S. fund ing of the World Bank.  Thus,  the administration has been  telling the public that it opposes that  idea because, they say, it would create  a new international bureaucracy and  would  cost us money. Yet,  in  last  week's hearing  it became clear that  these points may not be true and that  they are not the real basis for our po sition anyway.  Mr. Speaker, it is bad enough that  this  administration  has  chosen  to  pursue a solitary course in world af fairs that is so clearly contrary to our  national interests. But to attempt to  deceive the American public as to the  facts of the matter  just compounds  the error.

287,Senate,97,-0.329,838,19,Mr. MELCHER.," Madam President,  this amendment would permit the Flat head Irrigation District in Montana to  use a portion of net power revenues for  maintenance and operation of the proj ect's dam.  At  the present  time,  the district  is  limited by law to using only up to $75,000  for this purpose. The dam is getting old  and it needs repair. Clearly, $75,000  is  not sumcient for this purpose.  The Department of the Interior favors  this amendment, and has made  this  known to the distinguished chairman of  the subcommittee.  Though  limitation was  realistic when it was enacted in 1948, it.  is now totally inadequate to fund im provements and extensions necessary to  keep up with increased demand.  The accumulated power revenues are  not budget items, and they are funds  credited to the project. Therefore, this  amendment has no budget implications.  The amendment is germane to  this  bill  because  it deals  only with  the  amount of funds that are available to  the project. The language closely par allels instructJons already in the bill for  expenditure of funds such as those in  the administrative prov;s1ons relating to  the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  The  limitation on  the use of  these  funds has been a growing problem for  a number of years, and it is essential  that repairs and modifications be made  to ~he dam before there is a tragedy of  maJor proportions.  I urge  the adoption of  ment.  ",1981

Juan Ramirez  is an orphan, one of  seven children born to an impoverished  family in Ecuador in 1958. The benefici ary contracted polio at the age of 3, and  has undergone surgery a number of times  in various hospitals in his native land,  fallowed by intense physical rehabilita tion here in this country, where he has  been a  resident student of  the Anne  Carlsen  School  for  the  Physically  Handicapped at Jamestown, N. Dak.  He has made good improvement, and  is now able to walk with the aid of a  brace and crutches, and has progressed  well in the school, both in mental and  physical activities.  Mr. President,  during  the  summer  months when not in school, Juan lives  with his foster parents, Mr. and Mrs.  Vic Karges of Hazen, N. Dak. It is these  people who have provided  this young  man with a haven in this country, while  he pursued his education and rehabilita tion.  This bill grants Juan permanent resi dence in the United States. I urge its ap proval by my colleagues in the firm belief  that Juan Ramirez will become a proauc tive and loyal citizen of his new country,  where he has found  the care and love  that he never could have known any where else.

292,,97,-0.478,1046,19,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker, all too  often  in  recent months, we,  as  a  nation, have been subjected to reports  on the American economy that paint a  dreary picture  in drab colors. While  we  acknowledge  the economic chalEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  lenges that confront us daily, however,  let us never forget the blessings that  are ours as a people.  For it is by counting our economic  blessings, concentrating on our suc cesses, and honoring the positive busi ness forces in our country today that  we shall conquer the imminent specter  of hunger, idleness, and want.  Today  I bring  to our attention a  positive  force within  the American  economy that deserves our honor and  praise for the success it has generated  in serving consumers both here and  abroad. This positive economic force  accounts  for one-third of all  retail  sales in the United States today. It di rectly employs more than 4.6 million  people. Not an industry itself, it is a  way of doing business in more than 40  industries.  Mr. Speaker, the time has come to  honor franchising.  Franchising, with its integrated net works of small businesses across the  country and around  the world, has  helped many an American to get into  business and stay in business. The U.S.  Department of Commerce reports an  estimated  388,000  establishments  owned and operated by  franchisees.  Each year since 1971, the Department  of Commerce has reported that more  than 95 percent of franchisee-owned  outlets have remained in business.  The  International Franchise Asso ciation, a nonprofit trade association  of franchise companies, now in its 23d  year, recently surveyed its 350 mem bers and found that fewer than 1 per cent of the franchised outlets of re spondent companies had closed as a  result of business failure.  Franchising is helping minorities get  into business. In 1979, minority-owned  business format franchised outlets in creased 5 percent. The comprehensive  training provided by many franchisors  has aided many minorities who have  been deprived of the kind of experi ence needed to run a small business.  Women  have  similarly  advanced  their skills and horizons through fran chising. Franchise  training programs  have allowed women to surmount soci etal handicaps and take an active role  in corporate America,  running  their  own businesses. Through franchising,  women are proving their value even in  fields that had heretofore been closed  to them, ranging from accounting to  sanitation  to  the auto aftermarket.  Beyond  direct  franchise  ownership  and management,  franchising  has  freed women to work in another way.  By providing many of  the products  and services traditionally required of  women in the family setting, franchis ing has enabled millions of American  women to work outside the home and  still care for their families.  Franchising is nothing less than an  American institution. And as we look  to future  trade relations with other  countries, we can see  in franchising  October 27, 1981  the high value of American know-how.  Expansion  of American  franchising  overseas  is growing. Statistics  show  that the growth rate of foreign units  has now exceeded that of domestic ex pansion. IFA member companies un derscored  the  trend  in  international  franchising, with 42 percent reporting  last year that they already franchise  internationally and an additional 21  percent reporting that they intend to  do so in the near future. Thus, they  assist in the balance of trade.  The success of  franchising should  not surprise any of us, even in these  economically troubled times. Franchis ing's contribution has been one of con sistent quality and service offered by  individuals strong enough to work and  free enough to dream.  It is time, then, that we honor the  many who worked and dreamed  to  make a positive contribution  to our  Nation and the world  through fran chising.  Mr. Speaker, to that end, I propose,  along with my good friend and distin guished colleague, Mr. BROYHILL, that  we pass a House resolution designating  May 4, 1982, as ""International Fran chise Day"" to honor this great Ameri can institution.  The text of the resolution follows:  HOUSE RESOLUTION To DESIGNATE MAY 4,  1982, AS ""INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE DAY""  Whereas, the franchise method of marketing has proven eminently successful in the  aiding of small business men and women,  the stimulating of economies, and the bet terment  of  consumers  the world  over  through quality product and service distri bution; and  Whereas, franchising  today accounts for  nearly one-third of  all U.S.  retail  sales,  spans more  than forty  industries, and di rectly employs some 4.6 million people; and  Whereas, franchised businesses currently  enjoy a success rate better than 95 percent;  and  Whereas, our nation's women and minori ties are especially aided  in starting  their  own businesses  through  the  training and  management programs inherent in business  format franchising; and  Whereas,  franchising  represents one of  our nation's finest  institutions, born and  nourished in American free enterprise and  thriving through its call to serve customers  equitably; and  Whereas,  franchising has enabled hun dreds of thousands of Americans to fulfill  their dreams of owning their own businesses  and will continue to provide economic op portunity to people of all classes and back grounds; and  Whereas, franchising permits the new and  small businessman to compete on the same  level as the large chains which are increas ingly dominating our economic  landscape;  and  Whereas, franchises have led the battle  for uniform disclosure laws to assure that  prospective franchise buyers are fully aware  of their rights and obligations before invest ing in a franchise; and  Whereas, franchising continues to expand  internationally,  effectively  serving  ever  greater numbers of people the world over:  Now, therefore, be it  ",1981

294,House,97,-0.171,1059,19,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr.  Chairman,  House Rule 47  limits outside earned  income for House Members to 15 per cent of their congressional salary, and  limits  the amount  from  any  single  honorarium to $1,000 per speech, ap pearance, or article.  The rule was added in 1977, along  with  several other  ethical  reforms,  when we  significantly  tightened up  the generally ineffective codes of con duct  and  financial  disclosure  rules  adopted in 1968. The tightening up of  congressional ethics fallowed a storm  of public outcry in 1976 over congres sional misconduct and scandals, such  as the South Korean influence buying  and the Wayne Hays affair. The re forms were the product of extensive  work by  the Obey Commission and  three House committees, and the out side earned income limitation was ac cepted by an overwhelming vote of 344  to 79. House Resolution 251 would sig nificantly liberalize House Rule 47 by  raising through 1983 the limit on out side earnings from 15 to 40 percent of  the congressional salary. I oppose this  change.  1. STRICT LIMITATIONS WERE ADOPTED FOR  THREE MAIN REASONS  Mr. Chairman, we adopted the out side  earned  income  limitation  for  three very good reasons:  First,  it minimizes  the possibilities  for conflicts of interest. Certainly the  integrity of the legislative process  is  called into question when, for exam ple,  a  committee  chairman  accepts  thousands of dollars from groups with  special  interest  in  legislation before  his  committee, or when a Member  makes his services available for large  legal of professional fees.  Second,  it avoids  time being taken  away from congressional work. Being a  Representative should be a  full-time  job. But that certainly was called into  question when Members  spent  sub stantial  time  earning  several  times  their congressional salary  in outside  work, as happened before House Rule  47 went into effect.  Third,  it avoids  the appearance of  cashing in on the congressional posi tion. Receiving thousands of dollars in  overpaid honoraria, in consulting fees  for  little work done,  in salaries  for  adding one's name to a  law firm-all  strike the American citizen as someone  trying to exploit his current status for  financial gain.  On the basis of these arguments, we  adopted  the outside  earned  income  limitations  by  a more  than  4-to-1  margin. These  reasons  also, by  the  way, explain why we did not apply the  rule also to unearned income. Two of  these problems generally do not arise  in typical cases of investment income:  When a Member  is simply  receiving  money from previous investments no  exploitation of congressional stature is  involved, nor is significant time taken  away from congressional duties. So we  applied the rule only to earned income  where there is much more possibility  for abuse.  2. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE IS NOT ENOUGH  We passed these rules to specifically  limit certain outside earnings because  we felt that mere public disclosure of  the actions would not suffice. It will  not do to tell a voter that if he thinks  that a Congressman is engaged in im proper outside earning activities, he  should vote him out of office. In 434  of 435 possible cases, the voter simply  cannot do that.  Each American is affected by the ac tions of all Members of Congress, yet  he can vote disapproval of only his  own Representative's actions.  is  little consolation to him to have only  public disclosure that, for example, an  influential  committee chairman has  accepted $25,000  in honoraria  from  groups with special interest in legisla tion before his committee.  We need  to assure each American  that there are at least some minimal  sorts of safeguards on the books trying  to insure that each committee chair man,  each  influential party  leader,  each Member of Congress making im portant  decisions  that  affect  him  dearly, is not engaged in such abuses.  It  3. BASIC REASONS FOR LIMITATIONS HAVE NOT  CHANGED  Mr. Chairman, no one would main tain that this one rule is the corner stone of all congressional ethics, the  panacea for all congressional miscon duct and impropriety.  However,  it  is  a  significant  and  meaningful  provision.  As  Speaker  O'NEILL said during  the 1977  floor  debate,  this  limitation  is ""the heart  and soul of the entire package."" More over, the outside earnings limitations  have been thought important enough  ",1981

The U.S.  Jaycees, headquartered  in  Tulsa, Okla., will be celebrating 62 years  of service to communities acro3s Amer ica in January.  The Jaycee movement began  in St.  Louis, Mo., on October 13,  1915,  and  quickly spread to a national OTganiza tion, formally created by 29 chapters at  the first convention in St. Louis on Jan uary 21, 1920.  Through the years, the Jaycees have  been involved in a variety of projects.  In the early days, Jaycees were at the  forefront in such diverse areas as avia tion-Charles Lindbergh was  the most  prominent Jaycee in that field-develop ment of U.S. air mail service, and crea tion of the National Wildlife Federation.  Just prior to U.S. involvement in World  War II, the organization voted at its na tional convention to support formation  of  the Selective Service System. Con gressional debate had been stalemated  on the issue until the Jaycees-all be tween the ages of 21 and 36 and very  draft prone-voted their support f OT the  draft. Some 85 percent of the member ship served in the war.  The organization has been involved always  on  a  nonpartisan basis-with  other Government issues and programs  over the years. The Jaycees campaigned  in support of political freedom for civil  servants, were  instrumental  in forma tion of the ACTION Agency and lobbied  in favor of statehood for Alaska. More  recently, the Jaycees have concentrated  their Government efforts on matters of  the economy, having called repeatedly  for a balanced Federal budget. In 1981,  the Jaycees enacted  their ""Enough Is  Enough"" campaign in support of the ad ministration's recommended cuts in Fed eral spending-again on a nonpartisan  basis.  Some of the Jaycees' major projects in  recent years have included public educa tion on alcohol and other drugs, energy  awareness,  CPR  training,  shooting  safety and muscular dystrophy f undrais ing.  The Jaycees have been active in the  corrections field by maintaining over 400  prison chapters with a membership of  nearly 17,000. The program is now in its  19th year, and cooperates with a  job  placement  service  for  newly  released  inmates.  Jaycees  now  number  some  300,000  members  in approximately 7 ,500  local  chapters in communities across America.  As a  service organization,  the Jaycees  have done much to enhance the com munities in which they serve, by follow ing closely  the creed  that ""Service  to  Humanity is the Best Work of Life.""  By supporting this joint resolution, we  will be honoring an organization  that  has given much toward the health and  vitality of our communities. This will be  a small expression of America's gratitude  for  the many significant contributions  of the U.S. Jaycees.  I urge my colleagues  to  join me  c:>3ponsoring  this joint resolution.

307,Senate,97,0.603,1150,19,Mr. EAST.," Mr, President, much debate  has occurred  recently on  the  tobacco  price support loan program. Some at tack the acreage allotments and pound age quotas, while others speak of  the  so-called ""tobacco subsidy."" The smok ing and health issue is also inappropri ately linked with the tobacco program.  But no one has disputed tobacco's im portance  to our economy, especially in  the areas of exports and taxes.  Research has played a vital role  in  making and keeping  tobacco  the eco nomic factor it is. Many of the practices  and much of the knowledge utilized to day on a regular and routine basis came  about because of tobacco research.  Dr. James F. Chaplin, director of the  Tobacco Research Laboratory at Oxford,  N.C., has written an excellent article on  tobacco  research  and  its  accomplish ments.  I  think  this article effectively  points out  the need  for continued re search in tobacco.  I  submit Dr. Chaplin's article  printed in the RECORD.  The article follows:  to be  A BRIEF HISTORY OF TOBACCO RESEARCH  IN  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND  SOME  SELECTED ACCOMPLISHMENTS-19601980  Tobacco has been an important economic  fJ.ctor during the first  two centuries of the  development of the United States. In 1980,  the farm value of tobacco was about $3 bil lion, and it currently ranks fifth among farm  er.ops in cash receipts in the United States.  Approximately 500,000  farm families derive  income from tobacco production. The United  States is the world's leading tobacco exporter  and the third larges:  importer. Tn 1978, ex ports  of  tobacco  and  tobacco  products  reached an all-time high of $2.12 billion.  Imports totaled $428 million, leaving a record  trade balance of $1.69 billion-about 10 per cent of  the U.S. net export  trade balance.  Tobacco products generate over $20 billion  in s:i.les and $6.4 billion in taxes at Federal,  State, and local  levels. In addition, tobacco  menufacturing creates jobs for 76,400 work ers and  income  for 2,900 wholesalers and  lA: million retail outlets.  The Department's tobacco research is con ducted  in close cooperation with  research  programs carried out by  the States, other  Federal agencies, and  industry  in  the  to bacco-producing areas of the United States.  The caliber of this research is well recognized  by  scientists  in  other  tobacco-producing  countries around the world.  While no cost benefit analysis for tobacco  research is available, highly favorable results  easily can be shown. For example, resistance  to only one disease, black shank, necessary  to produce fiue-cured  tobacco in  the areas  where this very valuable crop ls grown, would  much more  than  offset  annual  research  cxpendi tures.  The objective of the Department's tobacco  research program prior to the mid-1960's was  to aid the grower in economical tobacco cul ture by development of new or  improved  cultural practices and varieties to aid in con sistently producing, at minimal cost, high  yields of good quality tobacco.  During recent years, emphasis has been  given to research to modify the raw product  so  as  to  improve quality and  reduce any  constituents  that can be  identified as po tentially harmful to the consumer.  I. BREEDING  AND  VARIETAL DEVELOPMENT  The  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA) has a  long history of accomplish ments in to bacco breeding and varietal de velopment. It maintains the only world col le:ition of  tohacco germplasm  represeniting  most of the cultivated types and all of the  wild  tobacco species. This major source of  germplasm  is continually  reproduced,  im proved, and supplied to all tobacco breeders,  both public and private. Many of the break throughs  in  research on aill  tobacco  types  have come from this collection.  These include resistance to such destruc tive diseases and pe.sts as Granville (bacteri",1981

311,Senate,97,-0.095,1254,19,Mr. ZORINSKY.," Mr. President,  the  Constitut~on of the United States gives  the President preeminent responsibility  in the area of foreign policy. The basic  reason for this is one of pragmatism-it  makes no sense to substitute 535 different  vo!ces in the Congress for the one voice  of the President.  Today, as the Senate considers. the sale  of AWACS  to Saudi Arabia, sadly the  choice is not between 535 difierent vo~ces  or one. Tbe choice is yes or no. And that  choice belongs in the Congress. The same  Constitution which gives the President o.f  the United States a preeminent role in  foreign policy also gives the Congre_ss of  the United States considerable powers in  foreign policy. It is part of what is known  as the system of checks and balances de signed by the framers 01' the U.S. Con stitution to preserve democracv in ouv  Nation. It is also part of what is known  as the rules of the g91lne.  The President knows these rules, and  the Saudis know them too. The rules are  not new. Major arms sales may be vetoed  by the Congress of the United States, and  this fact has been well known by all  parties. to this dispute years in a:dtvance  of this particular proposal.  Some years ago, Mr. President. I was  faced with one of the most diffie.ult decil sions ol my term here in the U.S. Senate.  President Carter, a member of my; party.  had sent the Panama Canal treaties to  the Sena:te for ratification and had asked  far my support. My Nebraska constit uents were almost evenly div:ided! on the  question.  I resolved the dilemma by focusing on  my responsibility as a U.S. Senator to  reach a determination on what action  best served the national security interest  of the United States. Under our Constitu tion, that responsibility is no less incum bent upon a Senator than it is upon a  President. Despite  the President's per sonal plea for my support, I voted against  that treaty because I believe it inade quately served the national security in terest of this Nation.  Mr. President, I have been here long  enough to see Senators come to Wash ington, and in discovering the national  interest,  lose sight of their States' in terest. I have also seen Presidents come  to Washington, and in discovering the  international interest, lose sight of the  national interest. There are no ftrm lines  lines of demarcation in this area, nor any  simple resolutions of the inherent con flicts among such interests.  So it is troubling to me today that so  mg,ny arguments for or against this sale  have been lost amid the repetition of a  single and simplistic dogma: Support the  President. As U.S. Senators we are com mitted to supporting the institutions of  American democracy, among those the  Presidency-but not necessarily a par ticular President on a particular deci sion. Another of those institutions js the  U.S. Congress, and support for this in stitution requires that we not abdicate  our  individual  responsibilities  to any  President.  With that as background I met this  morning with President Reagan to dis cuss the AW ACS sale. I listened carefully  to his views, and told him frankly about  my concerns. It was a good meeting, and  I promised  to do some soul searching  this afternoon, giving every possible con sideration to President Reagan's argu ments. And that is what I have done.  During that process, I  found myself  pondering the warning of T. S. Eliot that  ""the  last  temptation  is  the greatest  treason:  to do  the right deed for  the  wrong reason."" Mr. President, I have de cided that the right deed for the Con gress is to approve the sale of AW ACS  to Saudi Arabia.  I have not made this decision solely in  order to support the President, nor have  I made it because several business inter ests have let me know of their belief that  my reelection may depend on it. Finally,  Mr. President, I did not decide to support  this sale because I believe the sale, alone  in isolation, serves the national security  interests of the United States. I reached  this decision for  the reason, the right  reason,  that  a  rejection  of  this  admittedly bad proposal would cause  evell greater damage to those interests.  Unlike  the Panama Canal  treaties,  from which there could be no turning  baek, this arms proposal will not take  effect for several years-years in which  the Congress can move to stop this sale  if the administration's assurances of in creasing Saudi cooperation are not reai ized.  Mr. President, I regret that the admin istration has forced the Senate to vote  on a proposal unlikely to produce any  real winners. RegretfuUy,  t.he admintstration declined the advice of a majority  of the Senate that it not send up this  proposal. Faced with  this unpalatable  choice, and remembering the observation  of Winston Churchill that ""Eating WC'lrds  has never given me indigestion,"" I will  reluctantly oppose the resolution of dis approval.   ",1981
312,Senate,97,0.185,1254,19,Mrs. HAWKINS.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of the resolution of disap proval for the sale of AW ACS, F-15 en hancement equipment and other mili tary equipment hardware to Saudi Ara bia. In arriving at this decision I have  used only one criteria; Is the sale of this  equipment a prudent thing to do? I have  concluded it is not.  The United States should not sell its  most sophisticated military equipment to  Saudi Arabia because it is a politically  unstable nation that has thwarted our  vital foreign policy interests many times  while helping us only rarely. The Nation  will run grave risks if the Senate cho0ses  otherwise. Saudi Arabian instability car rie::;  the risk that a new radical leader ship will seize control of  the country,  one that we would not want to sell weap ons of any kind to, especially high per formance aircraft. And their record of  opposing our  foreign  policy  interests  carries the risk that the past will be re peated in the future; new weapons are  likely to be used in ways that block U.S.  interests.  Furthermore,  because  the  equipment  is  sophisticated,  there  is  added danger  that we are selling  the  weapons that will one day defeat us.  I will document these points now  order.  Saudi Arabia is a country with tremen dous internal problems. First, the Saudis  lack a  large or skilled domestic work  force and are forced to import laborers.  Indeed, over 40 percent of the workers  in Saudi Arabia are  foreigners. These  people have no  loyalty  to  the Saudi  monarchy, and because of  their poor  working conditions they have engaged in  demonstrations,  some might be better  termed revolts.  In  addition,  rapid  modernization  funded  through petrodollars  threatens  traditional Moslem  society  in  Saudi  Arabia,  the gulf between the rich and  the i::oor  is widening, and there is re ligious strife between  the Shiite Mos lems whose beliefs are similar to those  of  the Ayatollah Khomeini  and  the  Sunni Moslems. Also, during the take over of the Sacred Mosque in 1979, oil  workers in the Al Qatif Province demon strated  in  support of Khomeini  and  against the Saudi regime.  Combine  this background with  the  palace  intrigues  of  the  4,000  Saudi  Princes, the ineffectiveness of the Saudi  internal security forces, and discontent  in the Saudi Army, and we must con clude that Saudi Arabia is an unstable  country.  Mr. President, I have here a  list of  failed coup attempts, unsuccessful revo lutions, and other signs  that point  to  underlying discontent in Saudi society,  and I ask that this list be printed in the  RECORD  fallowing my statement.  <See exhibit U  Mr. President, havin~ established that  in  ",1981

315,,97,-0.295,1293,19,Mr. GUARINI.," Mr. Speaker, I am  most troubled by the Reagan adminis tration's attitude toward our veterans  and veterans' health care. The prom ises of the campaign have faded and  only  deep  budget  cutting  attempts  remain.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  As our veterans population grows  older, we will  be putting a  severe  strain on our existing VA health facili ties. These facilities have repeatedly  shown  their worth  to  this country  both in terms of commitment to our  veterans and in terms of cost effective ness. A study completed by  the VA  last summer shows that care provided  in VA facilities is about 20 percent less  expensive than care provided in com parable private health facilities. Also,  VA costs for an average hospital stay  are over $500 per visit lower than in a  community hospital.  Against this legacy of cost effective ness we have the reality of a shrinking  VA health care system. On a national  level the administration's attitude to  the VA health care system is exempli fied by its opposition to our attempts  in the House of Representatives to re quire the VA to maintain 100,000 beds  in VA hospitals and nursing homes.  The administration wants to maintain  only 80,000. This is in light of tpe fact  that the number of beds has decreased  by 20,000 over the past 10 years while  the number of veterans has almost  doubled.  In my own State of New Jersey the  administration dealt a death blow to  the proposed Camden VA Hospital at  the same time it canceled a new facili ty  in Baltimore. Now  I  learn Mr.  Speaker  that  the VA  is  seeking  to  close the operating room at the Lyons  VA Hospital in northern New Jersey.  I oppose this national reduction in  hospital beds, I oppose the further re duction of VA health care facilities in  New Jersey, and I vehemently oppose  President Reagan's attempt to further  reduce the VA budget. I am proud of  the House version of H.R. 3499 and I  want  to commend Chairman MONT GOMERY of the Veterans' Affairs Com mittee for reporting a bill that accord ed veterans their rightful measure of  value to our society.e  BROOKS HAYS  HON.

316,,97,-0.088,1293,19,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to  join  in  tribute  and  fond  memory of my good friend and trusted  colleague, Brooks Hays. He  is  no  longer with us, but this country is a  far better place because he lived.    I served with Brooks Hays  in the  Congress for over a. decade, and always  he was  a  beacon  of  courage  and  strength to all who knew him. Long  before  the notion of  racial equality  came of age, Brooks Hays stood up for  what he knew in his heart was right.  The courage of his convictions ulti mately cost him his seat in the Con gress, but it will win him a place in  history as a true profile in courage.  25907  It was Brooks Hays who,  in  the  stormy  days  of  1957,  negotiated  a  meeting between President Eisenhow er and Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus in  a courageous attempt to avert a racial  clash over the integration of the Little  Rock schools. He rose over the hatred  of his times to assert that obedience to  the law, whether popular or unpopu lar, is the critical ingredient of a free  society. He worked tirelessly to stabi lize the Little Rock situation to bring  about a recall of Federal troops and to  break resistance to court-ordered inte gration.  Brooks Hays was not only an outspo ken champion of peace among men,  but among the nations of the Earth.  In April 1945, he described the United  Nations as our best hope for a world at  peace, and a short time later was him self appointed as a delegate  to that  body.  Even after he left Congress in 1959,  he continued to serve his country well.  After serving as Assistant Secretary of  State under President Kennedy, he  taught at both Rutgers  and Wake  Forest. In 1970, he was elected chair man of the Former Members of Con gress. Among his outstanding accom plishments were his presidency of the  Southern Baptist Convention.  Brooks Hays died recently at the age  of 83. Yet his love of humanity, of his  country, and of his God, will be an ex ample to all those who serve in this  body for generations to come.e  FOOD STAMPS FOR AMERICAN  BUSINESS?  HON. JOHN J.

This proposal first received at tention in the 95th Congress. At that  time the House Budget Committee, of  which I am a member, recommended  that the Congressional Budget Act of  197 4 be amended to require the Con gressional Budget Office  to prepare  State and local government cost esti mates for all bills and resolutions re ported by congressional committees. I  wish to commend my two colleagues  from New York, Mr. ZEFERETTI and  Mr. LUNDINE, for their perseverance in  pursuit of passage of this legislation,  and also to the members of the Rules  Committee on both sides of the aisle  who have reported out H.R. 1465.

325,House,97,0.326,158,23,Mr. CARNEY.," Mr. Speaker,  if the  gentleman will yield, 2 years ago, this  House passed Public Law 96-41 which  admitted five vessels to the coastwise  privilege in an endeavor to revitalize  the U.S.-flag operated  cruise  trade.  This was done by waiving certain stat utory  restrictions  in  the Merchant  Marine Act of 1920 and clarifying sec tion 506 of the Merchant Marine Act  of 1936. Today we propose to admit  one more-the SS Oceanic Constitu tion-a ship which has been sitting in  the Far East under Panamanian flag  since it was sold at bankruptcy by the  American Export Lines in 1974.  Of those earlier ships, only the Inde pendence, sister ship of the Constitu tion, has actually returned to service.  It has been operating at a profit for  some. months now. This ship requires a  crew of 350 men-and already provides  jobs ashore and afloat for some 800  Americans. The Constitution will pro vide another 700 to 750 jobs.  The benefits to our Nation are not  limited to the jobs for our mariners.  Each ship will carry 800 passengers on  weekly cruises, to all of the five Hawaiian  islands. Those 80,000 passen gers each year include many European  and Japanese visitors whose expendi tures on the cruise and in the ports  will improve the U.S. balance of trade.  But, most  importantly, at a  time  when we are reappraising our military  responsibilities throughout the world  along with resources we have available  to meet them, the almost instant avail ability of  these  ships  to  transport  troops and technicians should not be  overlooked. In most areas of concern  to us and to our allies, airlift can do  only part of the job. Indeed, there are  some volatile places of concern to us in  the world where our  largest  cargo  plane cannot land on the available air strips. We must take practical steps to  have  the means  to  deliver  troops  where  they are needed. The Navy  would like to have eight or nine ships  the size of the Constitution available.  At no cost to the taxpayer, simply  by granting coastwise privilege  to a  U.S.-built ship that was sold foreign and being  thereby banished  forever  under the 1920 law-the Congress can  provide a significant  increase  in the  well-being of  this Nation.

I  would like to compliment and thank  Chairman JoNES  for his prompt and  efficient consideration of this legisla tion.  This bill will allow the vessel Ocenic  Constitution to engage in interisland  passenger  trade  in Hawaii. A  sister  ship, the Oceanic Independence, is al Independence, which  ready operating an interisland cruise  service in Hawaiian waters. This ven ture has been a  tremendous success  and has been a boon to the Hawaiian  economy. Local residents and tourists  alike have been enjoying  the  inter island cruises offered by the Oceanic  have  added  a  new dimension  to our  tourism and  transportation resources. An addition  to  this passenger fleet will serve  to  further expand our passenger  trade  and strengthen the maritime industry  in Hawaii. The simple waivers provid ed in H.R. 3782 are an effective and in expensive means of assisting an entire  industry as well as our island economy  in general. I am pleased to support his  bill and I urge my colleagues to join  with me in passing this legislation.

329,House,97,-0.496,171,23,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Chairman,  first  I would  like  to point out that  there  is  an error  in  the dissenting  views on page 35 of  the committee  report. It should read ""1987 dollars""  instead  of  ""1978  dollars.""  the  author of the dissenting views, I fig ured that I had better correct that.  0 1445  I  rise in opposition to House Joint  Resolution 341 which waives the statu tory provisions of the Alaska Natural  Gas Tranportation Act.  I  think  probably  everything  has  been said before. But let me just point  out a couple of things about this bill.  There is absolutely nothing in these  waivers that assures that 1 cubic foot  of natural gas will ever move through  that pipeline or that the necessary fi nancing will ever be obtained. We have  no assurance from the sponsors that  they are going to be able to raise this  money, even if these waivers are ap proved. So we ought to put on them  now the conditions that will meet the  objections that have been raised, the  principal ones being, of course, that  the consumers are going to pay an as tronomical opening cost for gas, and  they have to pay it even if no gas is de livered under the conditions of these  waivers.  The waiver package has been pre pared by pipeline sponsors and pro posed by  the administration on  the  claim that it is the only way to assure  private financing to complete the pipe line. Private financing was one of the  conditions to the project imposed by  President Carter's decision in 1977 to  permitting, and granting rights-of-way  and other authorizations for  its con struction and completion.  Two other conditions  to  the proj ect-that the gas conditioning plant  not be a part of the project and that  producers may not hold an  equity  share in the project-will go by the  board  if we  approve  this  package.  There is no assurance from the pro ducers or sponsors of the pipeline that  the condition of private financing will  not be  the next  requirement  to be  waived. There  is no guarantee  that  even with the approval of this waiver  package that the necessary financing  will be provided, or that the project  will be completed as scheduled with out any additional costs  to the con sumers or the taxpayers.  As one of the few members of the  Interior Committee who sat through  virtually every presentation by wit nesses  in  the hearings held on  this  waiver package, I was shocked at the  escalation of costs experienced in the  project since Congress authorized the  route in 1977. The original projection  of costs at $13 billion has now escalat ed  to $59 billion,  including debt  fi nancing. This increase far exceeds the  rate of inflation, yet project sponsors  were at a loss to explain the source of  the unforeseen and unplanned for cost  increases that were not accounted for  in  the  sponsors' original  cost  esti mates. Had we known in 1977 what we  know now about the costs of this proj ect-which  is  the most  expensive  energy  development  project  of  its  kind-I doubt  very much  that we  would have approved the pipeline as  the preferred way  to  transport  the  energy represented by our Alaskan gas  reserves to the lower 48.  In these circumstances the Congress  should be reevaluating the project and  determining whether there are other  feasible and more economical methods  of bringing Alaska natural gas to the  lower 48.  Instead, we  find ourselves  ",1981

332,,97,-0.502,210,23,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, for a  number of years Congress has consid ered legislation to facilitate the build ing of coal slurry pipelines  through  the extraordinary provision of Federal  eminent domain authority. Today the  Interior Committee, on which I serve,  voted 21-20 in favor of reporting the  bill H.R. 4230, the Coal Pipeline Act of  1981. I did not support this measure,  and I would  like  to  inform my col leagues of some of the reasons for my  position in opposition to this legisla tion.  Tens of thousands of pages of testi mony have been dedicated to this sub ject, yet the Congress has yet to enact  a  single proposal bringing any pro posed slurry line closer to reality. This  legislation has been fraught with con troversial and emotional  issues rang ing  from  scarce Western water  re sources, States  rights,  our Nation's  need for energy independence, and its  impact on a marginal railroad indus try.  I believe, however, that perhaps the  most  critical  issue  has  been  over looked-the impact of this legislation  on the millions of energy consumers  who  could  ultimately  receive  their  electricity via a slurry line.  Both proponents and opponents of  this bill share a similar objective:  to  provide our Nation with  the  lowest  cost fuel possible and to lessen our de pendence on  foreign  sources-a de pendence that continues to  threaten  every aspect of our economy.  However, the bill as presently draft ed, is nothing more than a consumer  boondoggle.  If we adopt  this proposal, we are  doing nothing less than providing our  explicit consent to potential runaway  costs of millions of dollars which will  undoubtedly be passed on to consum ers. We are also tacitly approving the  establishment of total vertical monop olies, to be controlled largely by the  oil industry, which has a direct finan cial interest in our country's coal re sources and coal companies.  It is a  little known fact that those  who propose to build slurry lines are  relying  almost  solely  on what  are  known as ""take or pay"" contracts with  utilities who would receive the slurried  coal. Taken to its extreme, the signing  of these contracts locks utilities into  specified payments over a number of  years-whether or not the pipeline is  finished or whether  the utility  re ceives any of the coal for which they  contracted.  For the purpose of explanation, let  us assume that New England Electric  has signed a  take or pay contract to  receive 5 million tons of coal per year  for 20 years at an initial price of $20  per ton. Obviously, the contract would  include an escalation clause  for  the  price of coal. On the basis of receiving  this and other contracts,  the slurry  company would  try  to obtain suffi cient financing to construct the line.  Again,  let us assume  that one of a  number  of  problems  occur  either  during construction or operation of  the  line-tremendous unforseen cost  overruns,  technical  and  engineering  problems,  environmental  constraints  upon mining the coal to be transport ed, the inability of the slurry company  to obtain all necessary permits, or a  water shortage causes  the supplying  State to cut off the necessary water to  slurry the coal-these are just a few.  ,Unfortunately, New England Elec tric might never  receive any of  the  coal contracted for, or may only re ceive a limited amount of coal due to  pipeline breaks or a  lack of water to  slurry the coal.  Even more unfortunately, this utili ty would still have  to pay  the  full  price of the contract while searching  for alternate coal supplies. Under this  particular scenario, New England Elec tric would be locked into payments of  at least $20 million per year, on top of  whatever they had to pay  to secure  another  energy  source  to  produce  power.  Who bears the brunt of this prob lem? Out of whose pocket do  you  think the $20 million will come? Not  the coal mine owners-not the pipeline  developers-and for the most part not  the utility.  These costs will be paid for by the  individual consumers. In point of fact,  they may well end up paying for elec tricity they will never use.  This leads me to another problem  with the legislation. There is nothing  in this bill to prevent slurry pipeline  developers and the utilities they con tract with from billing utility custom ers for the pipeline during its design  and construction-before any fuel  is  delivered. I have never supported this  kind of advanced billing-or construc tion works in progress as was approved  by the Interior Committee during con sideration of the waivers for the pro posed Alaskan natural gas pipeline.  Slurry lines are basically an unprov en technology fraught with numerous  environmental  and  technical  prob lems. I have a very serious fear that  the  individual  residential  customer,  whose utility bills have skyrocketed  these past  few  years, will  suddenly  bear an additional cost for fuel they  are not receiving-and may never re ceive if the pipeline is not completed.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to raise an other equally  serious problem with  this legislation, one that also portends  disaster for  the Nation's millions of  electric consumersthe  lack of any  provision  to  limit  the ownership of  pipelines by those companies who own  and mine  the coal and  the utilities  who would receive the slurried fuel.  In  1979,  then Assistant Attorney  General for Anti-Trust Enforcement,  John Shenefield, testified before the  House on similar legislation, that the  lack of such a provision was a serious  deficiency in the legislation pending at  that time. He testified that any person  having an ownership  interest  in  the  coal to be mined and transported or  similar interest on the receiving end,  who also had more than a 5-percent  interest in the pipeline could raise the  question of control. More importantly,  he stated that if such a person had  more than a 15-percent interest in the  pipeline,  the Department of Justice  would view this as de facto control and  in probable violation of antitrust laws.  Without  strict  language  regarding  energy industry ownership or invest ment  in such coal pipelines, we are  doing nothing  less  than placing  the  American consumer at the mercy of a  vertical monopoly, with the prospect  of paying  inflated and unreasonable  prices  for  energy which at  today's  price from conventional sources is al ready eating away at the consumer's  pocketbook.  Mr. Speaker, I am well a ware of the  fact that backers of coal slurry pipe lines have argued that slurry lines will  provide  cheaper  coal  transportation  than  conventional means  and  thus  benefit consumers.  I would like to point out, however,  that even the President's Council of  Economic Advisers does not buy this  argument. They recently stated in the  Cabinet Council on Natural Resources  and Environment memorandum to the  President,  regarding  this  legislation,  that:  ... transportation rates will not directly  affect coal prices to users. They argue that  coal will sell at the highest price possible,  subject to competition from other fuels in  the enduse markets.

I,  too, would  like  to commend Con gressman SKELTON  for his efforts  in  helping to solve the refugee problem  that faces our Nation.  MISSOURI CONGRESSMAN  IKE SKELTON HAS  THE RIGHT IDEA ABOUT THE REFUGEE PROB LEM IN THE UNITED STATES  Missouri Congressman  Ike Skelton has  brought to KCMO Radio's attention that  U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig has  not replied to an offer made by the govern ment of Belize in January that it would wel come 1,000  refugees from Haiti and 1,000  from Vietnam to their country as long as  they are willing to farm. Belize is a small  country  squished  in between Guatemala  and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Belize won  its  independence  from Britain on March  11th of this year. The country has three  million acres of idle land and a population  of only 145,000. The government of Belize is  looking for farmers and pioneers to till the  good, but untended land. Congressman Skel ton says, ""The United States has a serious  refugee problem. We can't afford to sit on  creative solutions. Good faith efforts, such  as that offered by Belize, should be encour aged and recognized by  the state depart ment."" KCMO Radio agrees. Refugees from  Haiti have been streaming into the U.S. at a  rate exceeding 1,000 per month and it is es timated that nearly 50,000 Haitians are now  here  illegally. And  this past September  alone, about 20,000 refugees from Southeast  Asia entered  the United States. Skelton's  letter  to Haig dated October 20th  is co signed by Congressman Wendell Bailey of  Missouri, Larry Winn, Jr. of Kansas and  eleven otqer U.S. Congressmen.

334,,97,0.269,223,23,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Speaker, Police  Chief Gerald Smith is retiring after 26  years of service to Roxbury Township.  His friends and fellow policemen at  Roxbury  Police  Department  have  asked that I say a few words to honor  Chief Smith for his service to the com munity and for his dedication to duty.  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to  have the opportunity to recognize this  devoted and public-spirited civil serv ant.  After completing his  tour of duty  with the Armed Guard during World  War II, Chief Smith returned to finish  school and to marry his lovely wife,  the former Rosalie Fetcho. Together,  they moved  from  Pennsylvania  to  their present home in Roxbury Town ship, N.J., in 1951.  In 1955, Chief Smith joined the Rox bury Township  Police Department,  and after completing the training pro gram, he was instated as a patrolman  on September 15, 1955. During his dis tinguished  career with  the  police  force, Gerald Smith was  promoted  through the ranks of sergeant, lieuten ant, captain, and finally  to chief of  police on January 1, 1978. Chief Smith  is both respected and admired by his  fellow officers. And, from all reports,  Chief Smith was an effective and inci sive administrator of the force.  Chief Smith is one of nine members  of the Juvenile Conference Commit tee, a  community  institution  for 20  years, which hears first offense cases  of  juveniles. The committee has the  authority  to  take minor disciplinary  action against most offenders as a de terrent to further violations of law.  As a member of the Roxbury Rotary  Club and  the  recipient of  the 1977  Roxbury Township Man of the Year  Award, Chief Smith has contributed a  great deal to the benefit of the com munity. It is with much pride that we  commend Chief Smith upon his retire ment  from  the Roxbury Township  Police Department and we wish him  well in the years ahead.e  LOSS OF CROPLAND TO  AGRICULTURE  HON.

335,,97,-0.038,236,23,Mr. HUBBARD.," Mr. Speaker,  the  recent passage of the emergency con tinuing  appropriations measure  to  fund Federal agencies through Decem ber 15 proved to be a  trying process  for both the legislative and executive  branches of the Federal Government.  Jack Paxton, editor of the Paducah  Sun,  the  largest newspaper  in my  western Kentucky district, had some  observations about the continuing res olution process in a recent column. I  believe his remarks should be shared  with my colleagues and I wish to do so  at this time. The column follows:  [From the Paducah Sun]  TEMPORARY STOP TO STOPGAPPING  <By Jack Paxton)  For  those who  think President Reagan  was engaging in theatrics, playing political  chicken or any of the other unsubstantive  things some congressmen charged him with  when he shut down the government yester day, one thing is worth pointing out: For all  of  fiscal  1981, which  ended nearly  two  months ago,  there were no appropriations  bills, i.e., no real budgets, for federal health,  education, welfare or labor operations. It  was all stopgap stuff. Temporary ""continu ing resolutions"" which wound up lasting all  year.  Now Congress  is  in the second year of  such jerry rigging and that is what Reagan  finally decided to call a halt to yesterday.  He only wanted, he  said,  something 50  states seem able to come up with every year,  a budget.  Congress had voted yet another continu ing resolution containing higher spending  than Reagan had called for. It wasn't, it's  true, for an entire year. It would only have  continued until July 15th. But wait. That's  only 21J2 months shy of the end of a whole  other fiscal year.  December 8, 1981  It was a plan to continue higher spending  in certain areas while Congress could take  its time in working out the ""permanent"" so lution, meantime enabling it to head on out  for Thanksgiving break. But the temporary  solution was itself pretty permanent.  True, in this particular case ""only"" a few  billion dollars were involved. But over the  long term of many short-term resolutions,  the job the president's been calling for just  hasn't been done. The job of facing the fact  we've been fiscally irresponsible and calling  a halt. Setting a goal and moving toward it.  Planning then acting.  The Congress has been fumbling and stop gapping a long time now. So the president  helped it step away from one more tempo rary,  higher-spending  resolution. Though  he did compromise by splitting the differ ence, twice.  This thing of the government not having  money to operate after Congress missed one  more deadline has always been something of  a joke, a phony crisis.  Reagan changed that. He made the Con gressmen face the music. He shut down the  government.  It enraged Tip O'Neill and some others.  They couldn't believe  it. They called him  names. They called him  theatrical. They  called him ""great actor.""  But they gave him, temporarily, what he  wanted-or at least one-fourth of it, after  his own double compromise.  But it was, still, temporary and December  15th could see another countdown to an other showdown before another holiday.  One might  think Congress would enter  that  session with  a  different  attitude,  having come out of this one looking pretty  silly.  What made  it  look so? One man who  backed words with action. The shock of  those Congressmen could be an indication  of how rare that's become in Washington.   OIL PIPELINE REGULATORY  REFORM  HON.

343,House,97,-0.374,392,23,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to begin first of all, by paying tribute  to my chairman of the committee, Mr.  ZABLOCKI  of Wisconsin;  the  ranking  minority member, Mr. BROOMFIELD, a  colleague of mine from Michigan, and  also to my ranking minority member  of my Subcommittee on Africa, BILL  GooDLING of Pennsylvania.  The legislation that has emerged is  genuinely a bipartisan measure. It was  achieved by bipartisan  compromise,  and its success is a tribute to the lead ership that has been exerted on both  sides of the aisle.  I read with interest a few days ago in  the Washinton Post a comment by our  distinguished  colleague  from  New  York, Mr. KEMP,  indicating  that he  was planning this year to vote for the  foreign  assistance bill,  and  that  it  would be the first or second time in  his congressional career that he will  have done so. Mr. KEMP indicated that  he had concluded that this bill, while  named foreign assistance, is more ap propriately described as a bill related  to national security. I want to applaud  Mr. KEMP for those remarks, because  indeed this legislation is a matter of  national security.  It is not only this year that the for eign assistance bill has direct implica tions for our national security;  that  was true last year and the year before  that. And it is not only because this  legislation authorizes military assist ance for countries that are friendly to  the United States that this bill has na tional security implications; it is also  because of  the  economic  assistance  that is authorized, and the fact that  this economic assistance is of equally  critical significance to the political sta bility of Third World countries and to  American national security interests in  those  countries,  and weeks  of  the  threat posed by Libya in the African  Continent. That is a very real threat.  Libya has been harassing its neighbors  for many years. It has attempted to  foment coups and unrest within  its  neighboring countries. It represents in  its conduct of  foreign policy every thing that is antithetical to the United  States.  I understand and hope  that  there will be an effort made on the  House floor during the course of the  deliberations on this legislation to pro pose  the consideration of economic  sanctions  that would be directed at  Libya. I  think those sanctions would  indeed be an appropriate initiative by  this Government.  But the most important thing to un derstand is that the Libyan threat in  Africa  is  not  primarily  a military  threat. That  threat arises  far more  fundamentally from the economic re sources Libya has. It derives from its  oil and the capacity to use the earn ings from oil to undermine and desta bilize neighboring regimes.  I believe  there is a growing understanding both  in this country and abroad that the  national security problems confronted  by countries throughout Africa, Latin  America, and Asia are fundamentally  not problems arising from threats of  external aggression, but rather threats  arising  from  internal economic and  social difficulties  that are  faced by  these countries. These are the prob lems which we are trying to help solve  the the economic assistance provisions  of this bill: and the greater our suc cess, the more stable these countries  are likely to be, and the less vulnera ble to outside interference by aggres sors or troublemakers.  Sudan is probably the classic exam ple of that. This foreign assistance leg islation contains within  it very sub stantial military  assistance  for  the  Sudan, in recognition of the military  activities in which Libya has been en gaged. But Sudan's fundamental prob lems are domestic, and they are eco nomic. This is a country that has pres ently a budget deficit of $1 billion and  a balance-of -payments deficit almost  as large. It now spends 60  to 70 per cent of its foreign exchange revenues  to meet  its debt payments,  leaving  little money for the task of economic  and social development. Indeed, Sudan  has the highest debt service ratio in  the entire world, and all the military  assistance to that country is irrelevant  to  the  fundamental  issue  in  the  Sudan, which  is  finding solutions to  the critical economic problems  that  face  the population and threaten to  destabilize that government.  We need, as a country and as a gov ernment,  to begin  to  recognize  that  national security of countries in the  Third World is far more threatened by  the economic and  social difficulties  these countries confront than it is by  the prospect of external aggression.  There  is  one other proposition  I  would like to address very briefly. We  are frequently asked how can we possi bly justify foreign assistance particu larly at a time of domestic crisis in the  United States. The straight answer is  that America's foreign assistance pro gram directly  serves America's eco nomic and political interests. It is not  widely recognized,  for example,  that  over 75  cents of every  foreign  aid  dollar is spent in the United States. It  does not go overseas; it is spent in the  United States. It is spent in the pur chase of farm products from American  farmers. It is spent in the purchase of  farm machinery from American busi ness concerns. It is spent in providing  payments  to American  institutions  and technicians. In short, most of the  American dollars  involved  in foreign  assistance  find  their way  back  to  American citizens.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore.

Right now, on the other side of the  world,  an American  fighting man,  caged like an animal, begins or ends  his  day wondering why  his  fellow  countrymen have  forsaken him. As  this holiday season approaches, I  im plore each and every one of you to re flect on this heart-rending plea, and  extend your prayers  to  these brave  men who are spending yet another  holiday season in some barbaric prison  camp in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.  The letter follows:  A PRISON CAMP,  Southeast Asia, December 1981.  DEAR FELLOW AMERICANS: Another year  has past and I am still being held against  my will by my communist captors. This will  be the eighth Christmas for some of us and  up to seventeen for the rest.  I can close my eyes and picture the prep arations that have been done for the Holi day Season. Gifts have been carefully se lected and gaily wrapped; the tree has been  trimmed with  lights,  tinsel, colored orna ments, with a shining star on top; the stock ings have been hung on the mantel and a  fire  is  softly dancing  in  the fireplace. A  huge turkey with all its trimmings has been  purchased, pumpkin pies and goodies galore  have been baked, and nuts and fruit are in  bowls  around  the  rooms.  Families  and  friends are wishing each other a joyous holi day while church bells ring out the music of  Christmas.  When I open my eyes, I  face the reality  that I am still a forgotten Prisoner-of-War.  No tree with all its glitter-only a cold cell,  so dark and damp; no turkey with all its  trimmings-just a small bowl of rice with  seaweed broth and a bit of weak  tea; no  dancing fire-only a threadbare blanket to  wrap my shivering body in. I silently sing  songs of Christmas to myself and pray to  God to help me endure the loneliness that  engulfs me.  If only  I could  receive a picture  from  home. My children are no longer the tod dlers I last saw. They have grown so much I  can not picture what they must look like  now. My lovely wife-how I long to hold her  close and tell here that I  love her. And my  dear parents-the  two wonderful  people  that taught me love, respect, and faith. How  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  my dear family must suffer, not knowing if  I am really dead as  the Government de clared, or if I am still alive and rotting away  in this forgotten land. Oh, please God, take  care of them for me and let them know in  some way that I am still alive and love them  very much.  Fellow Americans,  I  fought  for you, so  please fight for my release from this cell, so  I may return to the Country and family I  love so much. As you send out your Christ mas cards this year, send one to the Presi dent and all elected Officials, urging them  to take immediate action to bring us home.  Our condition is deteriorating rapidly. Will  we ever spend another Christmas with our  loved ones? Our fate is in your hands!  STILL KEEPING THE FAITH,  A prisoner-of-War.e  INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF  DISABLED PERSONS  HON. LARRY WINN, JR.  OF KANSAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  op Wednesday, December 9, 1981   ",1981
361,,97,0.247,522,23,Mr. WINN.," Mr. Speaker, 1981, as  you know, was designated as the Inter national Year of Disabled Persons.  This has generated a tremendous out pouring of concern and interest on the  part of disabled and nondisabled citi zens this year. Not only have attitudes  changed, but people working together  have made progress toward the follow ing long-term goals:  First. Expanded educational oppor tunity;  Second. Improved access to housing,  buildings, and transportation;  Third. Expanded  employment  portunity;  Fourth. Expanded participation  in  recreational, social, and cultural activi ties;  Fifth. Expanded and strengthened  rehabilitation programs and facilities;  Sixth. Purposeful application of bio medical research aimed at conquering  major disabling conditions;  Seventh. Reduction in the incidence  of disability by expanded accident and  disease prevention;  Eighth.  Expanded  application  of  technology to minimize the effects of  disability; and  Ninth. Expanded  international ex change of information and experience  to benefit all disabled persons.  Recently, I was pleased to introduce  legislation which designates 1982 as  the National Year of Disabled Per sons. This would contribute to the mo mentum that has been building during  the year. It is important, I believe, to  assure the continuity of a movement  which owes  its strength  to self-help  and private sector initiatives. It is par ticularly  important  to  take note of  this in light of increasing budgetary  restraints when  people  are  being  called upon to do more for themselves.  Interest  and  commitment  remain  high among the many groups involved  in the promotion of the International  December 9, 1981  Year of Disabled Persons throughout  the United States. While  the IYDP  will end officially on December 31, all  indications point  to a desire on the  part of these individuals to maintain  and enhance the theme of partnership  and community-based, grassroots ef forts that have dominated 1981 in im proving the lives of 35 million Ameri cans with disabilities.  Mr. Speaker,  I am also pleased to  share the following speech given by  Alan Reich, adviser to the U.S. delega tion to the United Nations and presi dent of the U.S. Council for the Inter national Year of Disabled Persons,  before the General Assembly of the  United  Nations  recently.  I  have  worked very closely with Alan over the  past year, and would like to commend  him for his leadership and steadfast  attentiveness to the needs of disabled  persons all over the world:  PREPARED STATEMENT BY ALAN A. REICH, AD VISER  TO  THE U.S. DELEGATION  TO  THE  UNITED NATIONS AND PRESIDENT OF THE U.S  COUNCIL FOR THE  INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF  DISABLED PERSONS, IN THE GENERAL ASSEM BLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS, DECEMBER 7,  1981  Mr. President, the United Nations, by pro claiming 1981 the International Year of Dis abled Persons, has aroused the hopes and  aspirations of fully a billion people compris ing  the world's ""disability  family."" This  family is made up of one-half billion per sons who are disabled  themselves plus at  least an equal number of family members  who also live with the limitations and chal lenges of our disabilities. Thanks  to  the  vision and  leadership of  the member na tions, the Secretary General and the secre tariat, and the agencies of the United Na tions system, the disability family now can  look more optimistically to the future. the  response to the challenge of the IYDP has  been gratifying. But having accepted  the  challenge, and  the responsibility, we now  must intensify our efforts, for the serious  problems of disability do not end with the  IYDP.  By promoting  its  five-point  IYDP pro gram,  the United Nations has stimulated  commitment and purposeful action by gov ernments, U.N. agencies, non-governmental  organizations  and  concerned  individuals  throughout  the world. While  their  re sponses  have  varied,  reflecting  differing  social structures, stages of development, and  levels  of  resources,  several  significant  common  themes have emerged. They  in clude an outpouring of compassion, a recog nition that disabled persons are an impor tant resource, and the active involvement of  disabled persons themselves.  Mr. President, I am pleased to have the  opportunity  to  comment on  the United  States  and worldwide  responses  to  the  IYDP challenge and on the implications for  the future. In the United States the IYDP  initiative has  led  to significant programs  and results. As President Reagan stated in  his IYDP proclamation on February 6, 1981,  ""all of us stand to gain when those who are  disabled share in America's opportunities.""  At the Government level, 42 agencies have  undertaken. IYDP activities aimed at bring ing Americans with disabilities more fully  into the mainstream. Their efforts have in cluded reviewing hiring practices, streamlin",1981
362,Senate,97,-0.328,639,23,Mr. DODD.," I would like to engage in  a short colloquy with the distinguished  chairman of the Labor-HHS Appropria tions  Subcommittee.  The  Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation Act created cer tain block grants out Of programs that  were previously categorical. We did not,  however, go as far as the administration  initially proposed. One area that we did  not place in a block grant was that the  social services block grant did not in elude  the  following  seven  programs:  child  welfare  services,  foster  care,  adoption assistance. child welfare train ing, child abuse,  runaway youth, de velopmental disabilities.  All these programs are within the Of flee of Human Development Services at  the Department of Health and Human  Services. Yet, the regular appropriations  bill passed by the other body set a low  funding  level  for  this omce, based on  the  assumption  that  these  programs  would go  into the social services block  grant. For some  reason,  the bill was  never amended to reflect congressional  action on  the  reconciliation bill. The  Senate Appropriations Committee has  made the correction and recommended  $67.1 million for salaries and expenses in  OHDS. Is this corredt?  ",1981

We  finished the job on decontrolling oil, a  big boon to the companies. They are  now drilling on the New York Stock  Exchange floor, as our distinguished  chairman, the gentleman from Michi gan <Mr. DrNGELL), often reminds us,  for oil. We have given more massive  tax breaks to the industry in the tax  bill which was supposed to be some thing to get the economy going again.  We have opened up wilderness areas.  What about alternatives to oil? We  have cut conservation as a body now.  Some of us have not voted for it, but  slashed  conservation,  solar,  wind  power, weatherization of  the  inner  city.  How about regulations that are de signed to help with alternatives to oil?  Applicance  efficiency  standards,  on  the way  out. Thermostat  settings,  gone. How about real national security  protection? The  rationing bill  that  took 5 years has now been taken down  off the shelf and ripped up,  thrown  away. We do not even need that. The  emergency allocation bill, despite the  good efforts of the chairman of the  subcommittee,  is now weakened, be cause we did not have the votes to do  something stronger. And we are rush ing toward deregulation of gas. This is  just a little stop along the way to do  yet another thing without thinking it  through.  I think we should address this prob lem in the proper fashion, in the com mittee, as the gentleman from Illinois  <Mr.  CoRCORAN)  and  the gentleman  from Massachusetts <Mr. MARKEY) and  others have suggested, and if we put a  waiver package  together, do  it with  the full participation of  the elected  representatives of the people.

366,House,97,0.375,678,23,Mr. COATS.," Mr. Speaker, contradic tions seem to abound here today as to  just what  this waiver package does  and does not do. We have heard from  several, ""Why don't the producers par ticipate in this? Why don't they get in volved? Why don't they. put up some  of their money?"" Well, that is exactly  one of the components of what we are  trying to do with this waiver package.  The previous law said they could not  be  involved,  they could not put up  their money. We are simply saying let  us pass the waiver package so they will  participate in this process. They are  ",1981
367,House,97,-0.218,704,23,Mr. PICKLE.," First I want to say this  is a  terrible policy, to give OMB the  right to determine whether an agency  such as the Social Security Adminis tration can get any money or not. But  aside from that, what I am concerned  about  is, under the language of the  gentleman's bill, we may not be able to  get it. The Social Security Administra tion,  if it is cut from administration  fees, cannot operate a program. We  have an extremely serious crisis now  in the computer program and on dis ability.  ",1981

369,House,97,0.3,782,23,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker, it is one  thing to stand in the well of the House  and boo President Reagan's attempt to  get  the economy back on  the right  track. It is another thing to stand up  here as the previous speaker has done  and not  have  a  single  alternative.  What is the gentleman from Texas' al ternative to cutting spending, reducing  the runaway borrowing of the Federal  Government, lowering the tax burden  on the private sector of this Nation  and the American people, and reduc ing the regulatory burden. It must be  to raise spending, increase the borrow ing requirements, increase taxes, and  perhaps even expand the regulatory  burden on enterprise and enterprising  Americans.  I  think that is a bankrupt alterna tive. I do not think that the American  people think it is much of an alterna tive.  I do not believe  the American  people are going to trust the leader ship of this country to a party or to an  individual who simply stands on the  sidelines booing Ronald Reagan  for  what he is trying to do: Restore this  country's economy and get America  back on the road to what I believe is  absolutely essential-and which, as I  to my  mentioned earlier in my colloquy with  my friend from Texas,  is something  that all of us ought  to agree  to on  both sides of the aisle-that is, high  levels of economic growth,  full  em ployment, and price stability. I submit  to this House that this is something  which has not been achieved in this  country in a  long time, certainly not  under President Carter and indeed not  since President John Kennedy, in the  early sixties.

I am  proud to note that during the last 8  years, Congress has initiated much of  the  U.S.  human  rights  policies  through the passage of legislation and  the involvement of Members in human  rights issues and cases. I know that I  will continue to use all the resources  of my office in an effort to ease the  plight of those being denied their in alienable rights throughout the world.  I would like to take this opportunity  to include in the RECORD the following  statement provided to me by Freedom  House-a nonpartisan, nongovernmen tal organization of concerned citizens  working against repression worldwide.  I believe that this short statement on  Poland clearly expresses the need for  a  continuing U.S.  commitment  to  strong human rights policies.  ",1981

394,Senate,97,-0.322,1094,23,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, yester day Members of the House of Represent atives and the Senate met in conference  to consider S. 1086, the Older Americans  Act Amendments of 1981. This act pro vides for a 3-year reauthorization of pro grams for the elderly as first created by  the Older Americans Act of 1965.  In the little more than 15 years that  this act has been  law, we have seen  sweeping changes and expansion of the  services provided in response to dramatic  shifts in the needs of our elderly and to  changes in our national policy on aging.  In the last decade or so, when I first  became involved in programs for the el derly, we had only begun to understand  the challenge that was soon to face our  Nation-that of the graying of our popu lation. We began  to realize  that, as a  greater and greater proportion of our  Nation approached retirement age, our  institutions would be challenged far be yond  any  imaginable  expectations.  Throughout that time, we worked to de velop the services and the aging organi zation so that this challenge can be met,  and so that the increased services could  be more efficiently and most effectively  delivered.  I am gratified by the progress we have  made in most recent years. Some of the  most  important  accomplishments we  have  achieved  relative  to  the Older  Americans Act  include  the establish ment of a national nutrition program for  older. Americans which is now operating  in every State, providing daily meals and  socialization for hundreds of thousands  of citizens per day throughout the Na tion; a vast home-delivered meals pro gram which services some of the most  needy among our elderly:  the disabled  and homebound, and which, I am cer tain, has been most instrumental m keep ing some of our more frail senior citizens  out of nursing homes; a nationwide om budsman program designed  to specifi cally aid those elderly confined to long term care facilities; and a nationwide  community service employment service  providing community employment posi tions for a vast number of low-income  persons who are 55 and over, havtng poor  employment prospects, yet who are inter ested in getting into the workforce.  Most recently, we have sought to flne  tune these exceptional programs, provid ing  for greater flexibility  so  that  the  elderly  can be  even more  effectively  served. Mr. President, I believe these ac complishments attest  to  the Congress  interest in our Nation's elderly, and I  want to take this opportunity today to  commend the distinguished members of  the Aging, Family, and Human ServicP-s  Subcommittee of  the Senate's Human  Resources Committee for the long hours  they have spent in reviewing the Older  Americans Act programs in an effort to  arrive at this excellent piece of legisla::.  tion.e  ,  ",1981
395,,97,-0.299,1185,23,Mr. MINISH.," Mr.  Speaker, my  friend and constituent, the Honorable  Brendan Byrne, will soon complete his  8 years as Governor of New Jersey. I  have enjoyed the opportunity of work ing closely with Governor Byrne and  the rest of our congressional delega tion to promote the interests of the  Garden State, so I have had a unique  perspective  on  his work  and  his  achievements in the public interest.  Rather than commenting directly on  Brendan Byrne's tenure in Trenton, I  will submit the editorial of the New  York Times  for December 6, which  offers a balanced assessment of  the  Governor's long service. When  time  has allowed us an opportunity to make  dispassionate evaluations of the Byrne  administration, I believe that many of  the particular points made  in  the  Times will be appreciated, and  that  the final assessment of the Governor's  personal qualities will be confirmed.  The editorial follows:  [From the New York Times, Dec. 6, 19811  GOVERNOR BYRNE'S RECORD  As Governor Byrne prepares  to depart  Trenton, his popularity is at rock bottom.  People in New Jersey grumble about style  and personality; many still smart over Mr.  Byrne's tough decision to institute a state  income tax. He supported casino gambling  in Atlantic City, which may plague the state  forever. Nevertheless, Brendan Byrne leaves  office with an otherwise outstanding record.  Governor Byrne can be blamed for not  dealing .with overcrowded prisons. In recent  months he has hurt his  reputation  by  taking too many trips, to the Soviet Union  and elsewhere. There is offensive vanity in  having his name put on the new Meadow lands arena in five-foot letters.  And for bad policy, nothing tops Atlantic  City's casino gambling. The  elderly  and  poor were displaced for the casinos-and are  still waiting  for  the housing  they were  promised. Crime and corruption are grow ing, and so is the power of the casino indus30999  try. It has so many connections with the  powerful law and accounting firms  in the  state as to create doubt whether effective  regulation will be possible in future years.  But  that was not  the biggest problem  Brendan Byrne faced when he took office in  1974. The state was under court order to  equalize local expenditures. That meant a  nasty fight with  the Legislature over the  income tax. Governors Hughes and Cahill  had tried and failed. Mr. Byrne got it done.  The  income  tax has  stabilized property  taxes and increased education aid.  During Governor Byrne's tenure, the state  has introduced spending limits on state and  local governments, guaranteed bond sales  for  local . governments and undertaken a  number of impressive financial management  reforms.  There is more. Mr. Byrne got the Mead owlands sports complex built, developed a  plan to protect the pinelands, created a Cab inet-level public advocate, reorganized the  state bus system, revised the state's criminal  code and established one of  the nation's  first plans to help pay for the elderly's med ical prescriptions and energy bills.  He has admirably resisted demands to re instate the death penalty and supported aid  for abortions. Some of his appointments  have been outstanding. Only  two women  had ever served in the Cabinet before; five  women have served in his. And throughout,  his administration has been free of scandal.  Brendan Byrne has not always brought  high style to Trenton, but he has brought  more  important qualities:  skill,  foresight  and integrity.e  SOCIAL SECURITY IS DOING ITS  JOB  HON.

397,,97,-0.186,1211,23,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker,  the  House  recently passed an  important  piece of  legislation,  the Immigration  and Naturalization Service Efficiency  bill, H.R. 4327.  I am proud  to have authored  this  legislation  along with my  six  col leagues on the Immigration, Refugees,  and International Law Subcommittee.  This bill will save the American tax payer an average of $2 million per  year over the next 5 years. It will also  streamline and modernize some of the  operations of  the  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service,  one  of  the  most burdened and long ignored agen cies.  The Washington Post recently pre pared an excellent editorial outlining  the value of the INS efficiency bill. I  ask unanimous consent that a copy of  that Washington Post editorial be in serted in the RECORD at this point:  [The Washington Post, Dec. 2, 1981]  IMMIGRATION: WHAT To Do Now  Soon after the Christmas recess, Congress  will have to grapple seriously with the prob lem of immigration reform. It will be taking  on such thorny subjects as 1) an overall lim itation on  the number of  immigrants, 2)  what to do about undocumented workers al ready living in the United States, and 3 > the  difficult moral and economic questions re garding various nations' responsibilities for  the world's  refugees. The administration  has sent Congress  its own comprehensive  package of reforms, and the Commission on  Immigration and Refugee Policy. created by  Congress in 1979, has also proposed substan tial amendment to the Immigration and Na tionality Act. Naturally, there is no unanim ity concerning what to do. Experts and gov ernment officials do agree, however, on the  issues that need to be addressed, and there  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  appears. for the moment anyhow,  to be a  general air of good will and determination  to approach the complicated subject as a co herent whole.  Because the job is so important and diffi cult  in human, not  just national policy,  terms. a comprehensive revision of the act  will  require  certainly months or maybe  years of work. So it is encouraging that Con gress has excerpted  from  this morass of  emotionally charged choices a few less con troversial  amendments  and proceeded  to  deal with them in a separate bill that could  be passed fairly quickly.  This  proposal  <H.R.  4327), which  got  through  the House  recently and  is now  ready for action by the full Senate, address es some quirks and anachronisms in the law  that have long been in need of cleaning up.  It would, for instance, eliminate the Draco nian provision in the act that permanently  bars from this country any person convicted  of a single offense  involving possession of  marijuana. The bill would not grant admis sion to drug traffickers or even to multiple  offenders. It would simply allow the attor ney general to grant a waiver allowing ad mission to persons once convicted of posses sion of a small amount of marijuana for per sonal use-and only if these petitioners were  immediate relatives of American citizens or  permanent residents. Such a measure could  eliminate the welter of private bills intro duced each year to reunite families in cases  where the prospective immigrant has been  found guilty of what would be considered a  minor offense in this country.  The bill would also raise the legal age for  adoption of  aliens by American  citizens  from 14 to 16-another change that has in  the past been accomplished by the tedious  passage of private  legislation-and would  eliminate an injustice visited upon a small  group of alien doctors, fully qualified and  living and practicing in the United States.  These doctors would have been required to  leave the country for failure to take a quali fying  test by January 1978, even  though  that test was not available to be taken until  September 1977. Doctors now entering the  United States must take and pass the test,  but those already practicing on Jan. 9, 1978,  would be allowed to stay.  The final reason this bill should appeal to  all members of Congress  is  that it would  save the taxpayers money. Eliminating the  requirement  that all aliens  register every  year and substituting a simple notification  procedure for change of address, for exam ple, would, according to the Congressional  Budget Office, result in savings of $800,000  a year. Other provisions eliminating paper work at the INS are expected to produce  total budget savings of $2.5 million a year.e  DEMAGOGUERY  ON  PIPELINE  WAIVERS  CLOUDS  NEED  TO  END ENERGY VULNERABILITY  HON.

398,,97,-0.473,1237,23,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I am  today introducing H.R. 5199, the Med icaid Work Incentive Amendments of  1981.  I  am pleased  to be  joined  in  sponsoring this  legislation by Chair man  FORD,  Chairman RANGEL, Mr.  BAILEY, and Mr. ANTHONY Of the Com mittee on Ways and Means.  This legislation will give States the  flexibility to continue medicaid cover age for working poor families who lost  this coverage because of changes  in  the aid  to  families with dependent  children program <AFDC) enacted in  the fiscal 1982 Budget Reconciliation  Act. Our bill is an effort to eliminate  some severe work disincentives result ing from  these changes and also  to  repair an intolerable gap in the social  safety net  the administration prom ised to maintain.  This legislation is the direct result of  hearings which we conducted on No vember 9, 1981, in Memphis, Tenn. At  those hearings, which were held joint ly by  three House  subcommittees Subcommittee on Health and Environ ment of  the Energy and Commerce  Committee, Subcommittee on Public  Assistance and Unemployment Com pensation of  the Ways  and Means  Committee,  and  Subcommittee  on  Oversight also of the Ways and Means  Committee-we heard testimony from  State officials, health and social serv ices providers and recipients on the efEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  fects of the recently enacted budget  cuts on health and welfare programs  in Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississip pi. The hearings were held jointly be cause of the interrelationship of these  programs and the concern we shared  that  the policy changes and budget  cuts  contained  in  the  fiscal  1982  budget reconciliation bill were result ing  in hardships never  intended by  either the President or the Congress.  Our  concerns were well  founded.  Testimony  at  the  hearing  showed  that, as a  result of changes  in  the  AFDC  program, mothers who  are  working  and were  receiving  some  amount of AFDC assistance plus med icaid are now faced with a choice of  either stopping work or losing medic aid coverage for their children. This is  a cruel choice and one that hits direct ly at those recipients who are making  the  greatest  effort  to  work  and  become self -supporting.  The AFDC program provides cash  grants  to States  for needy children  and  their caretakers. States control  the  income  limits for eligibility and  the maximum level of benefits provid ed, which range from a high of $506  per month for a  family of three in  California to a low of $96 in Mississip pi. Families who are eligible for AFDC  payments  are  automatically  eligible  for medicaid.  In order to encourage AFDC recipi ents to seek employment, Congress re quired the States to disregard a cer tain portion of an applicant's earnings  when determining eligibility for AFDC  payments. This included work-related  expenses such as  transportation and  child care expenses. In addition, once  a  family was  receiving AFDC pay ments, $30 plus one-third of the re maining income of the family would  be  disregarded  in  determining  the  amount of AFDC benefits.  The President's budget package dra matically altered these earnings disre gards. For example, the work expense  was capped at $75 a month, regardless  of the real cost of holding a job. The  $30 plus one-third disregard will now  apply only to the first 4 months of  AFDC  assistance. The new  require ment that States assume that those  who  are  eligible  for  the  Earned  Income Tax Credit <EITC) receive it  on an advance monthly basis could dis qualify for AFDC and medicaid some  working  individuals who are not re ceiving or even aware that they could  receive EITC on a monthly basis.  In addition,  the budget cuts elimi nated AFDC assistance to any family  whose income exceeds 150 percent of  the State's standard  of  need,  the  amount a State has determined to be  essential for basic consumption items  such as food, clothing, shelter, house hold supplies, and personal care items.  The  result: A working mother with  two children in the State of Arkansas  can have gross earnings of no more  31051  than $351 a month before she loses all  AFDC assistance and medicaid bene fits. That equals 26 hours a week at  the minimum wage.  If the mother  works more than this she loses AFDC  and medicaid benefits. However, if she  stops working, she would be eligible  for $161 a month in AFDC, tax free,  plus medicaid  coverage, which pro vides the health insurance protection  that is absolutely essential to a family  with young children.  The  cumulative  effect  of  these  changes is to substantially reduce the  amount of earnings a family can have  before losing all AFDC assistance and  medicaid coverage.  The loss of medicaid benefits, which  provides coverage of physician services  and hospital bills, is of great concern  to  those working families who have  now become ineligible for AFDC. Em ployer paid health plans are simply  not provided in the kind of low paying  jobs  available  to  these  individuals.  And,  individually purchased private  health insurance coverage is prohibi tively expensive. Their choice  is  to  continue to try and be self-supporting  with no health insurance protection,  hoping that no one in the family be comes  ill,  or  to  stop working,  and  abandon their goal of self -sufficiency,  in order to qualify again for medicaid.  This  is  the choice being  faced by  thousands of families today because of  recently enacted changes  in AFDC.  For example,  in Memphis we heard  from Linda  James of Chattanooga,  Tenn., who  has  a  daughter with  asthma. Mrs. James works 20 hours a  week and is paid $3.35 an hour. Be cause of changes enacted in the fiscal  1982 Budget Reconciliation Act, she is  no longer eligible for AFDC benefits  or medicaid coverage for her daughter.  Her take home pay is about $70 every  2 weeks. Health insurance is not avail able to her through her employment,  and private hospitalization insurance  for her family would cost $36 a week,  which she simply cannot afford.  Her daughter had to be hospitalized  a  few months  ago  because of her  asthma. Mrs. James pointed out that  if this happens again in the coming  months, as it very likely could given  her daughter's health problems, with out medicaid there is simply no way  she could pay the hospital and physi cian bills.  She now faces a devastating dilem ma: Whether to stop working in order  to  regain  eligibility  for AFDC  and  medicaid, or to keep working and run  the risk of medical bills she cannot  pay for and being unable to obtain the  medical  attention her daughter  re quires. This is a classic example of the  interrelationship  of Federal  health  and welfare programs and the risk of  making  program  changes  without  careful examination of their effects.  \ \  {  \  \ I  ",1981
