1,Senate,94,-0.443,27,2,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I send  to the desk an amendment to H.R. 1767,  the forthcoming Debt Ceiling Act. The  purpose of the amendment is to provide  an immediate $15 billion antirecession  tax cut for individuals.  It is my hope that Congress will send  the Debt Ceilin& Act  to the President  with three key positions:   First, the temporary increase in the  debt ceiling, which has been requested  by the administration before February  18.  Second, the deferral of the President's  energy tariff increase and of any price  increase for old oil. This is the deferral  which Senator JACKSON and I proposed  last week and which has now already  been coupled to the Debt Ceiling Act by  the action of the House Ways and Means  Committee last Friday on H.R. 1767.  Third, a tax cut large enough to begin  immediately to pull the collapsing econ omy out of its present tailspin of mush rooming unemployment and worsening  recession.  In my view, deferral of the oil price  increases and enactment of  the anti recession  tax cut ought  to be  the  top  priorities of Congress in the immediate  future.  The administration's plan is seriously  flawed, because its energy program will  interfere with the antirecession program.  We have an energy crisis, but the solu tion is not to plunge the economy deeper  into recession while trying to deal with  energy.  The  President's  peremptory  unil&.teral action in raising the price of  oil will do just that. He has taken a step  that will begin immedi~tely to drain up wards of $30 to $51 billion a year from  the economy, at~ time when no rebate  plan is in place to recycle these billions  of dollars back to consumers, and when  the  administration's proposed  rebate  plan itself is defective on its face in terms  of both timing and amount.  As a result the President's unilateral  action on energy endangers what must be  our No. 1 priority, America's quick eco nomic recovery.  As the event of thE-past week have re vealed, Congress is already well qn its  way to reversing the President's unwise  and mistaken action on the energy prices.  But correcting the President's action  on energy is only half the job. We also  owe it to the American people to act at  the earliest possible opportunity on what  is widely agreed to be the most wgently  needed economic step-a substantial tax  cut to stop the recession and bring the  economy back to health.  The Debt Ceiling Act  is the obvious  vehicle for the immediate tax cut. The  mechanism I propose is a simple, one shot $15 billion stimulus, based on a $70  cash rebate for each personal exemption  currently  claimed  on  an  individual's  tax return. The rebate would be given  against 1974 tax liability, so that it will  be available immediately to every citizen.  For a married couple, the tax saving  would be $140. For a family of four, the  saving would be $280. Also, under the tax  rules that now apply to personal exemp tions, the elderly and the blind would be  eligible  for a  double  sa ing, $140  in stead of $70 per person.  To insure that the rebate is concen trated in the lowand middle-income  groups, where  it  is needed most,  the  amendment also contains a  provision  phasing out the tax relief for taxpayers  with incomes over $25,000, with &.  full  phaseout when the $40,000 income level  is reached.  Most important, the rebate would be  ""refundable""-that is, it would be avail able to all individuals, whether or not  they have a 1974 tax liability. The major  advantage of the refundable step is that  it provides substantial relief to millions  of working poor and others in the lowest  income  groups,  those who  could not  otherwise participate in the benefit of  the tax cut, but who are the hardest hit  by inflation and recession.  To obtain the rebate, an  individual  would simply file a  tax retmn with the  Int~rnal Revenue Service and claim his  rebate. The  Internal Revenue Service  would be directed to mail out the rebates  immediately, without waiting for other  aspects  of  the  tax  returns  be  processed.  This tax relief proposal has the fow  obvious virtues of speed, simplicity, fair ness, and effectiveness. Unlike the Presi  dent's program, the vast majority of the  tax relief would go to low-and middle income groups. The stimulus to the econ omy could begin to work at once, because  the full rebate would be sent out im mediately, without being dissipated over  installments several months apart. The  stimulus  is needed now. It makes no  sense to wait until May, or to defer half  of it to September, as the President has  proposed, when action can come now.  And,  the $15  billion  tax cut  large  to  is  enough to give the economy the immedi ate boost it so badly needs today, without  precluding the possibility of additional  relief as the year goes on.  Equally important, the size of the re bate for most individuals would encour age  purchases  of  the  so-called  ""big  ticket""  items, which  are  so  urgently  needed to pull the economy out of the  current recession. And, since the relief  would be a one-shot tax reduction, the  stimulus will be achieved without a per manent tax reduction or long-term reve nue loss.  The tax cut I propose to add to the  Debt Ceiling Act is close . in amolL'lt to  the tax cut for individuals proposed by  President Ford-$15 billion versus $12  billion-although it differs substantially  in the two critical aspects of timing and  fairness.  Thus,  the antirecession  tax  relief  I  favor would achieve the important goal  of immediate tax relief for millions of  citizens ha1d pressed by the twin ourdens  of in:fia tion and recession.  It may well be  that Congress will  choose to adopt a different form of tax  cut  than  the one  I have proposed. A  1, rge number of proposals have been  suggested in recent days as alternatives  to the President's tax cut package. The  test, however, is whether we can develop  a package capable of enactment now,  v!ithout bogging down in debate over de tails that would cost us valuable time in  the fight against recession. The key point  is that antirecession tax relief should be  part of  the Debt Ceiling Act sent by  Congress to the President.  Nor must we allow the current passion ate debate over energy to obscure what  ought  to be  everybody's number one  priority-ending the recession and bring ing the economy back to health. Both  President Ford and Congress agree that  an immediate tax cut is desirable.  Surely,  the President's objection  to  Congress' request for a brief deferral of  his energy price increase program will  not prevent him from signing a Debt  Ceiling Act containing the tax cut that  both he and Congress want and  that  ought to be our first economic priority.

4,Senate,94,-0.483,40,2,Mr. METCALF.," Mr. President, I am in troducing today for myself and Senator  JACKSON  the  Federal  Coal  Leasing  Amendments Act of 1975 <S. 391). This  bill is almost identical to S. 3528, 93d  Congress, which the Senate passed by  unanimous vote on July 8, 1974.  s. 3528 was  the result of extensive  hearings on Federal coal leasing policy  conducted by the Subcommittee on Min erals, Materials, and Fuels and hearings  on coal policy issues and Federal mineral  leasing and disposal policies conducted  during the last 2 years by the National  Fuels and Energy Policy Study. It draws  heavily on the proposals made by  the  administration for changes in the Fed eral mineral development laws. The In terior Committee's report on S. 3528  states:  The Committee  is  convinced  that  the  changes in the basic coal leasing law, which  would be made by S. 3528, should precede  any large-scale Federal coal leasing program.  Otherwise, billions of tons of coal may be  placed into private hands under the provi sions of a. law which the Committee, the Ad ministration, citizens of the area involved,  the General Accounting Office, a.nd other in dependent analysts all agree is outmoded a.nd  not in the public interest.  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned  about  the possibility  that  the current  energy situation will lead to premature  decisions to proceed with large-scale coal  leasing when the impacts of such action  are not fully understood. The issuance  of such  leases could,  for all practical  purposes, commit the land, water, and air  resources of the area to development of  surface mines, electric generating plants,  coal gRsification and liquefaction plant~,  water impoundments and new communi ties without adequate consideration of  other alternatives and environmental,  social, and economic impacts, and with out adequate opportunity for advance  planning by the communities i?-Volve~.  The coal and electric power mdustnes  are placing increasing pressure on the  administration to end the current mora torium and to lease large quantities of  Federal coal. However, there must be a  better understanding of the problems as sociated w'ith surface coal mining in the  arid semiarid regions of the West before  turning more Federal coal over to private  industry.  I support development of domestic en ergy resources in a realistic and respon sible manner. Thus, I am convinced that  the  current  coal  leasing moratorium  should continue until: First, a Federal  surface coal mining  law has been en acted;  second, the Federal leasing law  has been changed; and third, compre hensive  land use plans  for  the areas  which will be impacted by coal develop ment have been prepared. This mora torium permits coal leasing where neces sary to continue an existing mining oper ation or to provide adequate short-term  coal reserves.  s. 391 would make six basic changes  in the provisions of the Mineral Leasing  Act of 1920 relating to development of  Federal coal  resources. These changes  ",1975
5,Senate,94,-0.1,53,2,Mr. BROOKE.," Mr. President, New  England has perhaps as dense a con centration of historic places and build ings as any region in this country. Those  of us who live in this region like to feel  that this simply reflects  the enormous  contribution made by New Englanders to  the contours of American history.  One New Englander of whom we are  particularly proud is Frederick Law Olm-  sted. Without question Mr. Olmsted  is  America's premier landscape architect.  His life spans the latter half of the 19th  century and his work can be found in  nearly every State in this Union. Indeed,  his vision and sense of  landscape has  even shaped the very building in which  we work,  for he designed  the Capitol  grounds and the Capitol's lovely terrace.  Time does not permit a  full  listing  of Mr. Olmsted's impressive accomplish ments, but I ask my colleag1,1es  to con sider the following sampling which indi cates just how varied and vast is his in ftuence  throughout our Nation. He de signed the park systems in Boston, New  York, Buffalo, Milwaukee,  and Roch ester; he was the architect of individual  parks in Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta, Louis ville, and Charlestown; he was in part  responsible for the formation of Yosemite  National Park and for saving Niagara  Falls; he designed the beautiful Biltmore  estate in North Carolina and he was re sponsible  for  several university  land scapes such as Stanford University  in  California.  Luckily for Americans, most of Mr.  Olmsted's work has been painstakingly  assembled in  the Library of Congress.  But a significant portion of his work still  remains in Brookline, Mass., where he  lived and worked for the last 20 years of  his life and where his firm-Olmsted As sociates,  Inc.-continues  to  operate.  Ther~ are literally thousands of plans,  draWings, and photographs in his home  and offices which document not only the  brilliant work of Mr. Olmsted and his as sociates but also the history of landscape  architecture in its formative stages.  Unfortunately,  Olmsted  Associates,  Inc., can no longer assume the financial  burden of this large, historic estate. And  unless some alternative is forthcoming to  keep the building and its valuable con tents together, the firm has made it clear  that they will have to take the extreme  step of selling the contents to individual  buyers,  thereby dispersing forever  this  compact  record of our most  famous  landscape architect.  That is why the bill I am introducing  today with my colleagues is so critically  important. It would authorize the Fed eral Government to purchase Mr. Olm sted's house -and office and designate  them a national historic site. I can think  of nothing more fitting and timely than  for  this Congress  to act in a positive  fashion on this proposal. All of Frederick  ",1975
6,Senate,94,-0.344,66,2,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join as a cosponsor of the Chil dren and Youth Camp Safety Act. This  bill is identical to S. 3639 which was re ported to  the Senate fioor  in the 93d  Congress, but which was not acted on by  the Senate.  Since 1967 numerous bills have been  introduced in both the House and the  Senate providing for a Federal role in  developing and enforcing uniform chil dren and youth camp safety standards.  To date no  legislation  to achieve  this  goal has been enacted. The bill I join in  introducing today is similar to a provision  passed by the Senate as part of the Edu cation Amendments of 1972. At that time  similar legislation had been reported by  the House committee, burt was amended  on the fioor to provide that the Depart ment of Health, Education, and Welfare  conduct a study of children and youth  camp safety. It was this decision which  prevailed in conference on the 1972 Edu cation Amendments. The study subse quently conducted was the basis of S.  3639 and this identical bill. I believe that  the time has come for us to pass this  legislation.  There are approximately 10,000 camps  in the United States. Each year an esti mated 10 million able-bodied children  and youth attend these camps. Yet, only  six States have laws and regulations that  are judged adequate by the Department  of Health, Education, and Welfare  cover all aspects of camp safety, coupled  with requirements for annual inspection  of these sites, 24 States have no  laws  whatso,ever. This situation cannot be  allowed to continue.  Mr. President, I am pleased to report  that my own State of New Jersey  is  among the six which do have adequate  standards. On January 9, 1974, the new  Jersey Youth Camp Safety Act was  signed into law. As Mr. Oscar Sussman,  to  director of  the New Jersey Consumer  Health Services, stated in testimony be fore the Subcommittee on Children and  Youth concerning this bill:  It is a needed piece of legislation . . . the  State of New Jersey is prepared to comply  by existing state law with most of the terms  of this legislation.  Mr. Sussman goes on to say that with out comparability across States,  those  States which have implemented strong  laws suffer, and the camps within those  States are placed in a noncompetitive  status because of the extra costs involved  in assuring decent health and safety  standards.  The Children and Youth Camp Safety  Act provides the mechanism to develop  mmunum  guidelines  and  standards  which States can adopt or use to develop  their own standards. This will, I believe,  institute a process of education through  which the States themselves could either  institute new or improve existing pro grams. The bill provides that the Secre tary of Health, Education, and Welfare  establish an Advisory Council on Chil dren and Youth Camp Safety to consult  on policy matters. The Council shall have  17 members, including the Secretaries of  HEW, Agriculture and Interior-or their  representatives,  :five  representatives of  organized camping, two representatives  of other groups with e~pertise in camp  safety, five representatives of consumers  of camping services, and two State offi cials. The Senate will have the power to  advise and consent on the appointments.  In addition, the Secretary can draw on  existing expertise in the area of camp  safety from a wide variety of sources,  particularly from those States which al ready have adequate legislation, in order  to develop  the standards  that States  adopt or use as guidelines  to develop  their own programs.  An area which I feel deserves special  attention, and in which Federal regula tions could provide a model for States, is  the need to improve the standards that  would benefit this Nation's handicapped  children and youth. There are an esti mated 11 million such persons who have  not been able to take full and equal ad vantage of a fully integrated camp ex perience. This bill directs the Secretary  to address the needs of these young peo ple and to develop standards, with the  assistance of  individuals expert in the  area on the Advisory Council, which will  assist in insuring that handicapped chil dren can attend any camp.  Some may feel that because we  lack  adequate  statistical  data  about  the  existing conditions in all of our camps  we should not pass this legislation. Some  will argue that the pending legislation  was  formulated without sufficient evi dence that a major portion of our exist ing camp sites are unsafe, and thus we  should not act out of  ignorance. But,  we are not acting out of ignorance. While  our knowledge of present conditions is  by no means complete, we do know that   there have been injuries and deaths at  our camps, and that there are no uni form  standards which might prevent  these  tragedies. This is surely a mini mally sufficient condition to justify the  ",1975
7,Senate,94,-0.387,79,2,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, on  January 28, 1969-just 6 years ago to morrow-the 5th of 63 planned wells on  Union Oil Co.'s platform A in the Santa  Barbara Channel belched forth a geyser  of oil and catapulted a quiet recreational  and educational community into the eye  of the public storm that still rages over  the future of offshore oil development.  Within 2 days of the sea floor rupture,  it was estimated that as much as 2.1 mil lion gallons of crude oil had been spilled.  The slick then covered 32 square miles.  By the third day, it covered 115 square  miles. By  the eighth day, 660  square  miles of the channel and 100 miles of  shoreline were contaminated. The spill,  which  began  in  January,  continued  through the spring and summer. Before  it finally aba-ted, estimates of the lost oil  went as high as 1_60,000 barrels. But  whatever the actual amount really was,  it was more than we could afford envi ronmentally and economically. And the  looming question is: When will it hap pen again?  On the eve of this tragic anniversary,  I  am pleased to join with  the distin guished chairman of the national ocean  policy study, Senator ERNEST F. HoL LINGS, and others in sponsoring major  legislation to amend  the Outer Conti nental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 and to  improve upon OCS  legislation which  passed the Senate but not the House in  the 93d Congress.  This legislation is the culmination of  the national debate which began on the  oily bea-ches of Santa Barbara 6 years  ago. Its early ena-ctment must be a ma jor goa-l of the 94th Congress. For we can  wait no  longer. Plans  to double  the  amount of acreage now  leased on the  Outer Continental Shelf  are  in  full  swing, and unless  the Congress  takes  immediate and affirmative action on this  bill, 10 million acres of now undeveloped  areas of the OCS will be leased in 1975.  ~f this tota-l, 16%, or 1.6 million acres,  IS scheduled for sale off the coast of pop It is now  ulated southern California.  abundantly clear that our present sys tem for developmentof the Outer Con tinental Shelf is grossly inadequate. It  does not guarantee  the public-which  owns these valuable resources-either a  fair return or the full and timely devel opment of the oil a.nd gas. And it hands  over to the oil companies the right to  make critical energy and environment  decisions without adequate  if any pub lic input. The time for change is at 'hand.  This new legislation embodies the rec ommendations of  the national ocean  policy study of  the Senate Commerce  Committee. First, it would place a morato  torium on conventional leasing in new  areas of  the Outer Continental Shelf.  This would mean that the lease sales  now  scheduled  for  1975  and beyond  would be canceled upon enactment of  the legislation. This moratorium on con ventional  leasing would not, however,  necessarily cause a delay in the discovery  of and subsequent development-if de sired-of new offshore oil and gas de posits. For, instead of turning over re sponsibility for exploration  the oil  companies, this bill would authorize and  direct the Secretary of  the Interior through the U.S. Geological Survey-to  conduct seismic, geomagnetic, gravita tional, geophysical, geochemical, and ex ploratory deep drilling activities in areas  of  the Outer Continental Shelf where  oil and gas development have not pre viously occurred.  In short, the conventional leasing ar rangement whereby  the oil companies  are sold rights to explore for and, in the  event of a discovery, to develop the oil  and gas resources of the OCS would be  replaced by a new system which sepa rates the exploration function from the  development function.  The Federal Government would as sume  the exploration  function. Areas  where oil and gas are found, and where  development  is  deemed  appropriate,  would then be leased to oil companies for  development.  This marks a critical departure from  our current leasing policy. It would not  only improve the public data base about  these federally owned reserves, it would  also mean that the decisions which have  the greatest impact on the marine and  coastal environments and on future en ergy supply would be made in the public  sector, with opportunity for full partici pation by affected coastal States.  The initial outlay of funds for feder ally sponsored exploration would be sub stantial. The bill calls for an authoriza tion of $200 million for fiscal years 1976  and 1977. But the potential for better re turns would be enhanced by the simple  fact that the Federal Government-the  lessor-would know the true value of the  lease instead of depending on the pur chase of some oil company information,  which is itself expensive. It was recently  discovered,  for  example,  that  some  $200,000 of funds earmarked for environ mental  baseline  studies  in  southern  California's offshore areas were actually  used by the Bureau of Land Manage ment to purchase geophysical data for  use in evaluating lease tracts. Incredi bly,  this data had already been pur chased by the USGS but was being held  confidential, even from its sister agency,  theBLM.  The advantage of  this new scheme  is that it would leave the important de cisions about energy in the public do~  main, not in the hands of  the energy  companies.  All data acquired by exploration with  public funds would be made public and  available to all bidders for development  leases on an equal basis. In addition, the  bill would provide for the enhancement  of the coastal States' role in the decisions  affecting the OCS near their shorelines.  This would occur through a mandatory  ",1975
8,Senate,94,-0.408,105,2,Mr. BAYH.," !VIr. President, in the near  future the President will submit a budget  for defense spending in fiscal year 1976.  From recent indications and news stories  it appears that while the President will  seek to hold the line on spending for so cial programs, he will request a tremen dous  increase in defense expenditures.  Evidently, procurement of new weapons  will not be prohibited by the President's  pledge to oppose new spending prograrr-s.  According to current iffiormation, we  should expect a  request for $93 billion  in total outlays for defense and for $105  billion in new defense obligational au thority. The $93 billion in total outlays  would be even higher were it not for the  President's intention to hold Federal pay  raises and military pension increases to  5 percent. For fiscal year 1975, the figures  for  total outlays and new obligational  authority were $83 and $89 billion re spectively. The prospective budget re quest marks an  incredible  increase of  12 percent and 18 percent. More  im portantly, these totals are well above the  numbers that had been given to budget  planners in the Pentagon by the Office  of Management and Budget, and, there fore,  represent a  clear decision  to use  the defense budget as an antirecession  weapon.  Mr. President, it was only a year ago  when the Secretary of Defense admitted  to Congress that the defense budget for  fiscal year 1975 was padded ll:;-approxi mately $1.5 billion in order to stimulate  the economy. Many of us stood up then  and decried such an inefficient and mis guided use of fiscal policy, and, fortun nately, we were able to cut over $4.5 bil lion from  the administration's defense  budget.  I had hoped that after last year's ex perience we would not have  to debate  the role of defense spending in the econ omy again. My !lopes were buttressed by  the fact that we had a new President  who I thought would look with more sen sitivity to the real neec1.s of ~he people  of this Nation. Unfortunately, Mr. Presi dent, I was overoptimistic. \Vhile we do  have a new captain, the Ford adminis tration is composed largely of the same  old Nixon team, and, sadly, that team is  insisting on playing  the  same Nixon  games.  And the defense spending game is even  more dangerous  this year than it was  last. The reality of recession, which many  of us predicted for montr_.:;, has now fully  impacted upon the Nation. There is con sensus among people of all political per suasions that the Government must move  to stimulate the economy, and there will  be  a  great  temptation  to use defense  spending to accomplish such stimulation.  Members of Congress will hear less and  less about the merits of various defense  programs, but  rather how many  jobs  ",1975

15,Senate,94,0.391,157,2,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, today  is  the second anniversary of the Paris  cease-fire agreement in S.outh Vietnam.  With tragic irony, the North Vietnamese  have just recently, through force of arms,  captured a province capital in clear vio lation of that agreement.  The Government of North Vietnam  has  unquestionably  abandoned  the  agreements of Paris  in  January and  March of 1973 and, instead, blatantly re sorted to its old tactics of military force.  As a result, South Vietnam and Cambo dia have come under heavy attack in the  past few weeks and the future of those  nations' freedom is in grave danger.  Mr.  President,  I  recently  returned  from a  fact-finding  tour of Southeast  Asia and there is no doubt of the peril  faced by the people of those beleaguered  nations. Direct military attacks have  been  launched  in  considerable  force  both countries.  However, the plight faced by the South  Vietnamese and Cambodians has been  brought about partly by the refusal of  the United States  to provide adequate  supplies, as promised. For example, at  the time of the Paris peace agreement in  January 1973,  this Government prom ised  to keep South Vietnam supplied  with ammunition and equipment on a  one-for-one basis. That is, we would re place all supplies and military hardware  as it was used or became unusable.  That was the substance of ''Vietnam ization"" and we have failed to adequate ly help those who are willing to fight  their own battle. The self defense of  South Vietnam and Cambodia has been  severely hampered by rationed ammuni tion and shortages of many supplies. In  the meantime, nearly a quarter-million  heavily  armed North Vietnamese  are  camped on their soil. Additionally, they  have flagrantly violated the Paris agree ment  by  continuing  to  build  their  arsenal  of  sophisticated weaponry  in  generous quantities from the Soviet Un ion and Red China.  In 1974, Congress cut severely the ad ministration request for military aid to  South Vietnam. That small nation is now  suffering the consequences of the cuts  made by Congress last year. When we  withdrew American troops from South  Vietnam, terminating our combat com mitment which was begun a decade earl ier by President Kennedy, we agreed to  supply the people of that nation for their  own defense.  Throughout that decade, during which  the United States of America suffered  50,000  killed  and  300,000 wounded in  combat casualties in South Vietnam, we  also invested more than $100 billion of  our national treasure. We must not make  a mockery of those years of sacrifice by  refusing now to spend the limited amount  necessary to equip these nations willing  to stand up tc Communist attacks.  There is no doubt of the need for more  aid than we approved last year. I have  seen with my own eyes the dilemma and  danger which  face  these people. The  North Vietnamese  are  encouraged  in  their attacks by declining U.S. aid and  apparent weakening  in  congressional  support.  Some say if we reduce or end U.S. aid,  the killing will stop. My reply  is  that  reduced aid will increase the killing, and  those being killed will be  and citizens of South Vietnam who are  attempting to defend their own territory.  Last year we did decrease our aid. By  doing so, we merely encouraged Hanoi  to escalate the violence and the killing.  My trip showed that this is not a civil  war. The Vietcong are no longer a sig nificant factor. It is Hanoi that is fightthe soldier~  ing this war, and supplying it by new  roads, trails, and pipelines, all of which  were constructed in violation of the Paris  agreement.  The attacks by Hanoi  raise  serious  questions about detente. If the Soviets  and Red Chinese want friendly relations  with the United States, why are they in creasing their aid to Hanoi and enabling  the North Vietnamese to continue their  aggression.  The violations of the Paris agreement  are clear and many. On the second anni versary of this agreement we should tell  the American people  the facts on  this  matter. The official documentation of  North Vietnamese violations is extensive.  For example, the U.S. State Department  lists the following:  Build up of the North Vietnamese main force army in the South through the illegal  infiltration of over 160,000 troops;  Tripled the strength of their armor in the  South by sending in over 400 new vehicles,  as well as greatly increased their artillery and  anti-aircraft weaponry;  Improved  their military  logistics  system  running  through Laos, Cambodia and  the  Demilitarized Zone as well as within South  Vietnam,  and  expanded  their  armament  stockpiles;  Refused to deploy the teams which under  the Agreement were to oversee the ceasefire;  Refused to pay their prescribed share of  the expenses of the International Commis sion of Control and Supervision;  Failed to honor their commitment to coon erate in resolving the status of American aD.~  other  personnel missing  in  action,  even  breaking off all discussions on this matter  by refusing  for  the past seven months  to  meet with U.S. and Republic of Vietnam rep resentatives in the Four-Party Joint Military  Team;  Broken off all negotiations with  the Re public of Vietnam  including  the political  negotiations  in Paris and  the  :rwo Party  Joint Military Commission ta~ks in Saigon,  answering the Republic of Vietnam's repeated  calls  for unconditional  resumption of  the  negotiations with demands for the overthrow  of  the government as a pre-condition  for  any renewed talks; and  Gradually  increased  their military pres sure, over-running several areas,  including  11 district  towns, which were clearly and  unequivocally held by the Republic of Viet nam at  the  time of  the cease-fire. Their  latest and most  serious escalation of  the  fighting began  in early December with of fensives in the southern half of South Viet nam which have brought the level of casual tle""S and destruction back up to what it was  before the Agreement. These attacks-which  included for the first time since the massive  North Vietnamese 1972 offensive  the over running of a province capital  (Song Be  in  Phuoc Long Province) -appear to reflect a  decision by Hanoi to seek once again to im pose a military solution in Vietnam. Coming  just before  the second anniversary of  the  Agreement, this dramatically belies Hanoi's  claims that it is the United States and the  Republic of Vietnam who are violating the  Agreement and standing in the way of peace.  Mr. President, the United States is a  nation of honor and should abide by its  commitment to supply the South Viet namese the necessary  tools of defense.  Similarly, we should provide the Cam bodians the means to prevent the fall of  that nation to their Communist aggressors. If we in America stand by and let  these two friendly nations fall, then the  masters of Hanoi will  absorb  all of  Southeast Asia. That is certainly not in  our national interest.  ",1975
16,,94,-0.364,170,2,Mr. RYAN.," Mr. Speaker,  for  some  years now the entire matter relating to  the state's involvement in matters re garding the question of life and the tak ing of life have been a source of con tinuous controversy  for  the American  people and for most lawmaking bodies  within the United States. The subject is  broad in its spectrum and involves the  question  of  capital  punishment,  the  question of euthanasia as it relates to  people with terminal illness, and the en tire matter of state approval of abor tions for pregnant women.  Last year I  indicated that I was very  much opposed  to  the Hogan constitu tional  amendment which would have  nullified the recent Supreme Court de cision on abortion. However,  I pointed  out that I was not in favor of an unlim ited access  to abortion for any woman  upon her own demand. The reason for  this is because I believe that life occurs  at conception and abortion, therefore, is  the taking of life.  This decision does not mean that I do  not believe that the state may prescribe  conditions under which a woman may  receive an abortion legally. In fact, I be lieve  very  strongly  that  each State  should involve itself in such a matter.  I have also counseled those who were  against abortion and against the pres ent Supreme Court decision to take the  more logical co-urse through the courts,  because of  the massive  inconsistency  within the Supreme Court decision.  The weakness  in  that decision,  of  course, has to do with the present futile  attempt by both doctors and lawyers to  decide when ""life"" begins in the womb,  if they say it does not begin at concep tion. Does life begin at 20 weeks? Or 24  weeks? Or 16 weeks? More importantly,  who will determine at what hour of what  day the time elapses when a woman's  pregnancy goes from a nonvital condi tion to a vital condition? Such a deci sion is obviously most important.  Does the doctor today give a pregnant  woman a minor medical treatment whose  only result is loss of the fetus, when the  same  treatment on  the  following day  to  for murder and in his confinement  prison for years?  in that doctor's conviction  may result  The following recent case in Boston is  one which I commend to the attention  of all those interested in this question.  I have predicted for some years now that  case would reach the Supreme Court  in which  the Supreme Court Justices  would have to attempt to play doctor  and to write some legal definition if they  a  are to follow the logic of their previous  abortion decision.  I hope that a case such as this will  cause the Supreme Court to reconsider  the futility of its present position and  begin to recognize that the question is  much more complicated and yet much  more simple.  Life occurs at conception. However,  the State can and does insist upon the  right to take life under certain condi tions. There is no reason why abortion  could  not  be  included  among  those  conditions:  ABORTION ON TRIAL  Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin grew up in a black  neighborhood in Washington, D.C., graduated  from Meharry Medical College in Nashville,  and became chief resident in obstetrics and  gynecology at Boston City Hospital. He was  an outspoken advocate of liberalized abortion  laws and,  in company with another phy sician, was responsible for all the abortions  performed at  the hospital-most of  them  involving women from Boston's impoverished  Roxbury and South End. Last week, in a case  laden with political overtones and difficult  medical questions, Edelin was on trial for  manslaughter in connection with an abor tion he had performed.  Since  Edelin's  indictment  last  spring  (Newsweek,  June 24,  1974),  the case has  gained national attention from both sides of  the abortion issue. For one thing, it involves  some crucial questions left unanswered by  the U.S. Supreme Court's historic 1973 ruling  overturning restrictive state abortion  laws.  Among them: When does a fetus become a  person? Is a fetus entitled to the full protec tion of the law? And what are a doctor's re sponsibilities  toward saving the  life of an  aborted fetus?  The case involves an abortion Edelin per formed Oct. 3, 1973, on a 17-year-old black  girl who is estimated to have been anywhere  from 20 to 28 weeks pregnant. As is common  in ""late"" abortions, Edelin first tried to in duce abortion by injecting a  salt solution  into the uterus to destroy the fetus, but this  technique failed. He then performed a hys terotomy.  This  is  a  surgical  procedure  similar to a Caesarean-section delivery; first  a  small  incision  is made  in  the mother's  abdomen and uterus, then the placenta is  separated from the uterine lining and the  fetus is removed.  UPSHOT  The matter might have  ended  in  the  delivery  room had not  investigators  from  the Boston district attorney's office  acci dentally discovered  the  fetus Edelin had  removed. As it turned out, the investigators  were in the hospital in the first place at the  behest of anti-abortionists who had asked  for an inquiry into a fetal-research project.  The upshot of the investigators work was that  four BCH doctors working on  the  fetal research project were indicted under a 19th century grave-robbery statute (they are still  awaiting trial), and Edelin was charged with  manslaughter for having allegedly killed a  ""well-nourished black male fetus.""  According to the opening statement by as sistant district attorney Newman A. Flana gan, the fetus in question was J4 to 28 weeks  old, weighed 1 Y:z pounds-and could have sur vived outside the mother's womb. Flanagan  charged that Edelin ""watched the clock"" for  at least three to five minutes before removing the fetus,  thus depriving it of oxygen  and causing its death. Edelin's attorney, Wil liam P. Romans Jr., contended that the fetus  was younger than 24 weeks and,  therefore,  not viable outside the mother's body. (In its  1973 decision, the Supreme Court noted that  most experts place viability at 28 weeks, but  added that a fetus may survive delivery at  24 weeks.) The fetus Edelin delivered, He mans insisted, was never a legal human being,  ",1975

18,Senate,94,0.492,209,2,Mr. CURTIS.," Mr. President, I rise at  this time to urge that the Senate act  expeditiously and  forthrightly  to seat  Louis Wyman as a Senator from  the  State of New Hampshire; and that we  then get on with the important business  at hand in dealing with the problems of  the Nation.  Today we find ourselves in the position  of acting as an election commission in  the matter of the New Hampshire Senate  election-a position, I am sure was not  the  intention of our forefathers.  I do  not think we need dwell too long on this  matter, since our course is clear. We have  only to recognize the legal, valid certif icate of election of the State of New  Cxx:.I--95-Part 2  Hampshire. That certificate is issued to  Louis Wyman.  The extensive debate on both sides of  this issue is unnecessary, and continued  lengthy pursuit of this matter for res olution by  the U.S. Senate  is unwise.  There should be no issue at all. We have  a valid certificate of election from the  sovereign State of New Hampshire. The  election in New Hampshire was conduct ed along with others across the Nation  last November. It was a close election,  and the challenge and recount process  has been exhausted. Louis Wyman has  been certified the winner for the Senate  seat  to succeed our  former  esteemed  friend and colleague Norris Cotton.  We should not be debating this issue,  because  there  is no valid  issue. Some  members have seen fit to bring it up at  the request of Mr. John Durkin, who lost  the New Hampshire election. Their basis  for bringing it up here comes from an  invalid and  rescinded  certification of  election which was originally erroneous ly issued to Mr. Durkin by the State of  New Hampshire. This certificate was is sued before the full procedures of con test and recount had been completed by  the State.  Having completed the .contest process  of  the election  through  its ballot law  commission, the State of New Hampshire  rescinded the certificate  issued  to Mr.  Durkin and issued a certificate of elec tion to Louis Wyman. The Senate has  refused to honor the request of the State  of New Hampshire to return and invali date the certificate issued to Mr. Durkin.  Although hope was held out that Mr.  Durkin would receive friendly considera tion in the Senate, he did pursue :urther  the final certification of the State of New  Hampshire. He filed suit in Federal court  to challenge the findings of the ballot  law commission which resulted in rescis sion of his certificate. But that court  unanimously upheld the ballot law com mission in its conduct of  the election  contest and recount which resulted in  the certification of Louis Wyman as the  election winner.  It is important to note that Mr. Durkin  had the opportunity to appeal this Fed eral court decision, but having failed to  do so, he har exhausted all legal proce dures and by this abandonment acknowl eges the decision of the court and out come of the New Hampshire election as  certified by the State's ballot law com mission.  Mr. President, the matter of the New  Hampshire election has been before the  Senate since we began the 94th Congress.  The Senate has found no fraud or wrong doing, and thus having .l'ulfilled its au thority and obligation in determining the  qualifications of an election, the Senate  should now properly seat the certified  election winner, Mr. Wyman.  Our constitutional system provides the  rights of the States to choose their own  elected  representatives. Once  the due  process of such election is .completed, the  States should be entitled to the repre sentation produced by  their  election  processes. If, in the absence of fraud or  wrongdoing, the U.S. Senate refuses to  recognize the certification of election of  a State, we wlll be establishing a horren dous precedent that will rock the very  foundations of our freedom and repre sentative government.  Our elections are determined on the  basis of the candidate who receives the  most votes whether by two, or two thou sand or two million. Once all avenues of  challenge and contest are exhausted in  the case of close elections,  the States  certify election winners on the basis of  most votes received. We provide for re course  to the courts to determine  the  validity of any contests, and to the Sen ate to determine the presence of fraud  or wrongdoing. Once all procedures of  recourse are pursued and vote counts up held or finalized, and absence of fraud or  wrongdoing is discounted, the only re maining step we have is for  the final  seating of the certified election winner.  For the U.S. Senate to act in any other  way would be to establish precedent that  would deny  this very process and  the  right of the people to choose their own  l'epresentatives. Such action would un dermine our process and would place in  the hands of persons not residents of a  State the power to decide its representa tives. This clearly was not the intent of  our forefathers.  I again urge that we can now act to  seat the certified election winner of the  State of New Hampshire, Mr. Louis  Wyman.  ",1975

Nevertheless, that is what has  happened in the case of 1,200 demon strators who were booked by police in  Washington during  the May Day in vasion of the Capital in 1971. It is to be  hoped that a higher court will overturn  this absurd decision.  When  the  demonstrators  came  to  Washington vowing  to shut down  the  Capital City and the Government of the  United States, th~y cam~ here deter mined to violate the right of every citi zen in the Nation. It was their purpose  to obstruct the work of policemen and  firemen, halt social security payments.  old age assistance, service to constitu ents by Members of Congress, and to stop  the enforcing of rules, regulations and  laws by Federal agencies.  They staged riots, disturbances, traf fie blockades, and altogether were in vi olation of literally dozens of laws. They  were arrested by law enforcement offi cials to keep bad matters from becom ing worse. When the jails were filled to  overfiowing,  some of  them had  to be  taken to RFK Stadium for safekeeping.  All of them were fed and given proper  care to the extent possible under trying  circwnstances. When they wer~ released  after  a  relatively brief  incarceration,  some having paid minimum fines and  others si~Jlply sent on their way, they  brought lftlit clainting that those who set  out to shut down a government, without  . regard to the consequences to the Na tion. were illegally arrested while en . gaged in this effort.  It is this case which resulted in a rul ing by a lower court granting a total of  $12 million on the premise that their civil  rights were violated.  Mr. Speaker,  the members of  this  group were not d~prived of their rights.  Instead. the rights of every other Amer ican were violated on that day. Isn't it  time for the rights of the public to be  protected for a  change? Hopefully the  appeal now pending will right the wrong  that has been done our system of justice.

24,,94,0.601,365,2,Mr. ROUSSELOT.," Mr. Speaker, it is  extremely important to each Member of  Congress that he be able to maintain a  continuous exchange of information with  his constituents. I am sure that you and  our fellow colleagues are well aware that  one of the most efficient ways to accom plish this is through newsletters and pe riodic questionnaires. It is essential that  constituents be kept well informed of leg islative activities and that the views and  votes of  their Representative be made  known. Newsletters must be printed at  the Member's personal expense inasmuch  as  there  is no congressional allowance  to cover  these costs. I make  this as a  point and not as a suggestion that there  should be such a congressional allowance.  The constituents in my congressional  district, formerly California's 24th and  now the 26th District, have been willing  to support the cost of my constituent information mailings through contribu tions to a trust fund maintained for this  sole purpose. This account has been op erating as the ""Twenty-Fourth Century  Club,"" and is established as a trust with  a  treasurer and an assistant  treasurer  acting as trustees. None of these funds  are disbursed to me directly and no dis bursements are made  to cover any of  my personal expenses. All funds are ap plied only to provide public information  to benefit all of the constituents in my  congressional district. This fund does not  have a political purpose, and contribu tions which are solicited and received  are kept in an account separate from any  campaign activity.  Mr. Speaker, the contributors to this  trust are not a  limited or exclusive  grouP--many of the contributions to sup port this information program are under  $10. The purposes of my newsletter pro gram are public information. I want to  declare the existence of this fund and  state that the books for this account and  a list of all contributors and/or partici pants will be fully disclosed upon request.  I want this information to be made pub lic and I am placing it in the CoNGRES SIONAL RECORD for that purpose at this  time. The following is a letter sent by the  chairman of  the Twenty-Fourth Cen tury Club to the entire membership with  a complete statement of receipts and ex penditures. The information follows:  TWENTY-FOURTH CENTURY CLUB,  Arcadia, Calif., January 27, 1975.  To THE MEMBERS,  Twenty-Fourth Century Club:  This organization was founded in 1973 for  the purpose of funding Congressman Rous selot's Voter Information Program, of which  his Washington Report is the principal incre ment. This will be  the final report under  the name of  the Twenty-Fourth Century  Club, since Congressman Rousselot now rep resents the newly created 26th Congressional  District of California.  The Twenty-Fourth Century Club has op erated as a public trust for the benefit of all  of the voters in the old 24th Congressional  District of California. Mr. Joseph M. Crosby,  Treasurer, and Mr. Clark J. E. Hunt, Assist ant Treasurer, have been the principal trust ees of Club funds. Mr. Crosby is president of  California Liquid Fertilizer Company and  Mr. Hunt is a California certified public ac countant (retired).  Enclosed you will find a  financial report  for the calendar year 1974, showing receipts  and disbursements as well as the funds on  hand at the beginning and end of the year.  As can be seen from the statement of re ceipts,  ""membership dues"" have been  the  backbone of this program.  We are grateful  to all contributors who  have participated in the two-year operation  of the-Twenty-Fourth Century Club. In 1975  this ""Trust""  is being renamed  the ""Voter  Information Program-26th District,"" which  more clearly denotes its objectives.  Very truly yours,  DONALD E. BUTLER, Chairman.  Enclosure.

Stern, one of my constituents,  is a moving demonstration of the fact  that we know all too little about brain  damage even though it is the third larg est cause of death in the country today.  It is truly inspiring to discover persons  who do not rely upon Federal or founda tion funds  for research but search in  the private sector for contributions.    The statement on the Stern Founda tion follows:  SHARON R. STERN MEMORIAL FOUNDATION, INC.  The Sharon R. Stern Memorial Foundation,  Inc., P.O. Box 1064, West Acton, Massachu setts 01720, has been organized in memory of  a young girl whose appreciation and love of  life needs to assume new means of expres sion.  On October 4, 1974, eight weeks after her  wedding day, Sharon's car was struck head on in an automobile accident. Thirteen days  later, never regaining consciousness, Sharon  succumbed  to brain damage she  incurred  during the accident.  Brain damage  is  the  third  largest killer  in our country today. Equally frightening is  the fact that the majority of people suffer ing from amictions and disease to the central  nervous system do not die, but linger on in  pain, year after year, living a comparatively  non-productive, frustrating life. The current  average cost per patient  lifetime  to  these  victims is a staggering $900,000.00. In addi tion,  the crippling effects of the potential  loss of productivity on our country's econ omy is staggering.  The Sharon R. Stern Memorial Founda tion,  Inc., has been organized  to expedite  the conquering of amictions,  trauma, and  disease  to the central nervous system. The  Foundation will act as a vehicle  to solicit  funds from all sectors and administer those  funds directly into neurological research.  The Foundation hopes to provide an aqdi tional source of funding for research projects  dealing with the central nervous system, not  to compete for federal appropriations with  the Institute of Neurological Diseases and  Stroke.  Educating the public in areas of neurol ogy, the personal impacts of breakthroughs  in these areas and the impact of their per sonal involvement is also of primary impor tance. A further objective is assistance in the  coordination  of  ongoing  neurological  re search as well as of new programs.  The Foundation hopes to serve the investi gating scientists by acting as a resource, an  index to which they may refer thus enabling  them to avoid duplication of efforts, but al lowing them the luxury of being able to com bine theoretical and practical application of  talent and intellect.  No  other organization  in  this  country  focuses  so strongly on  these objectives.  I  compliment  the mer~t and  fortitude put  forth  by  the Sharon R. Stern Memorial  Foundation,  Inc.  I  further hope  that  the  Foundaton be given all the recognition and  cooperation it deserves and requires, by both  private citizens and governmental agencies,  to realize its objectives in serving mankind.

To  illustrate the need  for such a  I would  resolution,  like  to  introduce into the RECORD today an ar ticle by Anthony Lewis, which appeared  in the New York Times for January 16:  [From the New York Times, Jan. 16, 1975]  MADNESS IN GREAT ONES  (By Anthony Lewis)  BosTON,  January 15.-There has hardlY  been a time when problems so numerous and  ",1975

29,House,94,-0.514,404,2,Mr. KASTENMEIER.," Mr. Speaker, in  the past decade we have seen this Na tion's Chief Exee.utives,  its Attorneys  Genera.!,  its successive Chief  Justices,  the Director of  its Federal Bureau of  Prisons, and every group which has ex plored the situation, call for a change in  America's prison  system and  its pro grams for rehabilitating criminal offend ers. In recent years we have also read  studies prepared by the Federal Bureau  of Investigation, the Law Enforcement  Assistance Administration, and count less  government  and  private  groups  which confirm that the number 1 con tributor to crime in this Nation is  the  discharged recidivist who resumes a life  of  crime. We have  also  seen  studies  which establish that the most critical  time in determining whether or not a  person  released from prison will  turn  again to a  life of crime is in the first  weeks and months following his release  from custody.  No one can deny that the Congress has  a grave responsibility in the area of the  control of crime in this Nation. The Judi ciary Subcommittee  on Courts, Civil  Liberties, and the Administration of Jus tice has tried to meet this responsibility  in recent years by examining in depth  every single aspect of our Nation's cor rections system. Confident that we can  cut c1ime in this country if we reduce  the ;>resent rate of recidivism, the sub committee will continue  to explore  in  depth the way we treat criminal offend ers sentenced to our Nation's peniten tiaries, and the condition in which we  release offenders to make their way in  the community.  I am today introducing with many of  my  fellow Members of Congress,  five  measures whose enactment I believe will  constitute a major step in reducing the  rate of recidivism of criminal offenders  in this country. This legislative package  is designed to insure that offenders in carcerated in our jails and prisons will  be  afforded  the  constitutional  lights  which they are guaranteed, so that their  institutional  treatment  will  prevent,  rather than foster, bitterness and hos tility  toward  the society which keeps  them confined. The second purpose of  this legislation is to assure that upon re lease from confinement, exoffenders will  receive the assistance necessary to en able them to live a life free from crime  and become reintegrated into  the Na tion's society as productive citizens.  At a very minimum we must accom plish these goals. We cannot forget that  95 percent of the people now in our pris ons will someday reenter society ""out side the walls"". To ignore the need for  reform of our present system of dealing  with criminal offenders is to insure con tinued escalation of crime rates in the  future.  The bills I am introducing today are  the following:  PAROLE REORGANIZATION ACT  This legislation was introduced in the  92d and the 93d Congresses. The time for  its passage is now at hand. It provides for  establishment of an  independent and  regula ted U.S. Parole Commission and  for the detailed infusion of due process  into the Federal parole system. Our sub committee has held extensive hearings  on this  legislation and it has been the  subject of much discussion by members  of the committee, the U.S. Board of Pa role, and the Department of Justice.  OFFENDER  REHABILITATION  FUND  This bill creates a fund for loans and  small gratuities to Federal prisoners upon  their release from custody. The bill is the  result of an extensive study by the Gen eral Accounting Office of the present and  past use of loans and gratuities to prison ers in the Federal Bureau of Prisons. It  is an effort to assist the former inmate  during  the critical weeks  immediately  following release from custody and to per mit him to join the mainstream of our  society in a productive way and not re turn to crime.  FEDERAL  CORRECTIONAL OMBUDSMAN ACT  This bill was originally introduced by  Mr. METCALFE to establish a U.S. con-ec tional ombudsman. It provides for an in dependent third party to investigate the  complaints of the staffs and inmates of  our Federal prisons, and provides for in spection and subpena powers.  INMATE RELIEF ACT OF  1975  This bill provides for civil action  in  the protection of constitutional rights of  those individuals confined in State in stitutions. It is intended to reflect cur rent case law and to provide legal stand ing for those inmates who believe they  have been mistreated or dealt with un fairly while confined.  VOTING RIGHTS  FOR  EX-OFFENDERS  This bill provides for the right to vote  in Federal elections to criminal offenders  upon their release from correctional in stitutions. It was passed by the full Ju diciary Committee late in the 93d Con gress, and it is my belief that this legisla tion will receive prompt attention in the  present Congress.  No one should be deceived by the legis lation I am introducing today. Even its  immediate passage would not solve the  twin problems of how to reduce crime in  our society, and how to deal decently with  individuals sentenced to confinement in  our Nation's ,prisons. It is, however, an  important first step. For this reason, the  subcommittee intends to schedule early  hearings on this legislation and to press  vigorously for action by the Congress on  these extremely important issues.  EXPLANATION OF THE BILL  TO  AMEND  THE RAILROAD UNEM PLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT  ",1975
30,House,94,-0.345,404,2,Mr. STAGGERS.," Mr. Speaker,  the  Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act  has not been kept abreast of changing  economic conditions and of changes that  have occurred from time to time in the  Railroad Retirement Act, particularly,  the enactment of the Railroad Retire ment Act of 1974. The result is that the  act still carries a maximum limitation  of $400 per month on the creditable and  taxable  compensation  and  carries  a  benefit table ranging from $8  to $12.70  per day. The law also requires that there  be earnings of at least $1,000 in the base  year in order to qualify and minimum  employment in at least 7 months the first  time the employee qualifies.  My bill would modernize  the act in  each of these respects. Sections 1 and 4  of the bill eliminate the $400 per month  ceiling on creditable and taxable com pensation and, instead, would now apply  only  the ceiling corresponding  to  the  one applicable to the wage base under  the Social Security Act. This is substan tially what we did with railroad retire ment in the enactment of the amend ments last year.  Section 2 of the bill revises the benefit  table to a range of earnings from $500  per base year to $5,000 and over, with  benefits ranging from $10 to $33 per day.  One must understand that the law pro vides,  in addition to a benefit table, a  provision that benefits shall be not less  than 60 percent of the last daily rate  of compensation in the base year, so that  actually the table provides maxima on  top of that.  Another problem lies in the fact that  the  railroad  industry  seniority  is  especially well  developed  and unem ployment  tends  be  concentrated  among the shortservice employees. The  minimum employment period of employ ment in 7 months particularly imposes  a hardship in times like the present when  there is widespread unemployment and,  in the railroad industry, it is concen ..  to  in  ",1975

34,,94,0.1,495,2,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker, for thou sands of years the people inhabiting this  Earth have depended on the oceans for  protein. From 1950 to 1970, the amount  of fish harvested from our seas increased  steadily each year. In an effort to reap  the seemingly  inexhaustible supply of  fish from the oceans, many nations built  large  fleets of fishing vessels, equipped  with the most sophisticated gear that sci entists and engineers could develop.  Their efforts were successful  in  the  ehort term: Huge quantities of fish were  r?ught and people around the globe in creased their consumption of this pro t.ejn-rich commodity. According to Lester  R. Brown, a food supply expert, the aver age level of consumption for fish is now  approximately 40 pounds per person an nually-well above the world beef output.  Despite our dependence on the oceans  however, we continually ignore the fact  that we are rapidly destroying them with  excessive pollution and over-exploitation.  Thor Heyerdahl, on his voyage on the  Ra II, traveled through huge ocean areas  containing sludge and garbage-the hu man and industrial refuse which is a less heralded product of our modern cultures.  <Yves) Jacques Cousteau, the renowned  ocean explorer, foreseeing the eventual  effects which the polluted sea will have  on our planet, is now in the process of  organizing a society whose chief purpose  will be to draw attention to the serious ness and extent of ocean pollution. In deed, Mr. Cousteau has pledged  ""the  years remaining him"" to the cause of  alerting people to the eventual death of  our oceans if we do not change our ways.  Mr. Speaker,  the oceans are now  in  crisis. Not only must we take immediate  action to stop the sullying of our oceans  with human and industrial wastes, but we  also must make every effort to preserve  the fisheries  resources which keep our  oceans alive, and to protect millions of  people from malnutrition and starvation.  1970  1950 and  Last year, Lester Brown succinctly de scribed the current fisheries situation:  Between  the world  fish  catch increased steadily and reached a new  record virtually every year, rising from 21  million tons to 70 million tons. During this  period, it increased by the average of nearly  five per cent yearly, thus greatly out-strip ping population growth and greatly boosting  per capita supplies of marine protein. In  1970 the trend was abruptly and unexpected ly reversed. Since then it has fallen for three  consecutive years. clouding the prospects for  continuing expansion of the catch. Many of  the marine biologists  feel  that  the global  catch of  table-grade  species may be  ap proaching the maximum sustainable limits.  As members of an elected body anxious  to serve the best interests of the people  we represent, and cognizant of the pro tein needs of all  the world's  peoples,  we must be concerned with the decima tion of our fisheries  resources. At  the  same  time  that we seek  to accelerate  and improve our methods of preventing  ocean pollution, it is imperative that we  conserve the fish we have left, by bring ing the quantity of the total world catch  down to the level of self-regeneration.

35,,94,-0.422,508,2,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker, today is the  122th anniversary of  the birth of  the  great Cuban patriot, poet, and apostle of  freedom, Jose Marti.  Born  on  January  28,  1853,  Jose  Marti in 1898 turned the course of Carib bean history by proclaiming the ideolog ical basis of a free Cuba. His inspiration  led to ~uba's independence from Spain  and his inspiring words still right out the  call of freedom for a Cuba newly enslaved  to communism.  In commemorating the birth of Jose  Marti, I wish to introduce once again my  joint resolution commending the Cuban  ""Declaration of Freedom,"" adopted Jan uary 23, 1966, by 15,000 Cubans in exile  at a meeting in Key West, Fla. This reso lution appropriately was drafted at the  San Carlos Club from which Marti pro claimed his words of freedom.  The enlightened ideas for which Marti  gave his life have been, and continue to  be, summarily rejected by the Castro re gime. There has been no real change in  the repressive character of that brutal  Communist regime, no change in the fos tering of subversive activities in the hem isphere, and no change in the military  alliance with the Soviet Union which has  brought Soviet power into the Caribbean  with bases and troops on the island of  Cuba.  What Marti said of Cuba in 1898  equally true today:  is  Melodies are heard; choruses resound, but  it is clear that this is not the symphony of  peace.  There can be no true peace in Cuba or  security for our hemisphere until  the  spirit of Marti and of  the Key West  ""Declaration of Freedom"" are once again  the guiding light of liberty for the Cuban  people.  I  include the  text of my resolution,  House  Joint Resolution  152,  in  the  RECORD at this point:  H.J. RES. 234  Whereas on January 23, 1966, a ""Declara tion of Freedom"" was adopted by one thou sand five hundred Cubans in exile meeting  in Key West, Florida; and  Whereas  this declaration was written at  the San Carlos Club from which the great  Cuban patriot, Jose Marti in 1898, turned the  course of history by proclaiming the ideologi cal basis of a free Cuba; and  Whereas Cuba once again has fallen vic tim to a totalitarian regime as embodied by  Castro communism; and  Whereas  the  ""Declaration of Freedom""  reads as follows:  ""In the city of Key West, Monroe County,  State of Florida, United States of America,  we,  the Cuban exiles in the United States,  in the name of God Almighty, and speaking  both for ourselves and the oppressed peo ple in Cuba, the martyr island, do say:  ""That on January 1, 1959, the slavery yoke  that came from Europe and was extinguished  in Cuba at the end of the nineteenth cen tury, was 1esumed.  ""That those responsible for this high trea son to our fatherland and to our people are  just a score of traitors who, usurpating the  government of the country have been acting  as mercenary agents for the Sino-Soviet im perialism, and have surrendered to that im perialism our freedom and our dignity, also  betraying the American hemisphere.  ""That as a consequence of this high trea son, those who are usurpating the power in  Cuba (as they were never elected by the peo ple) , are  imp<>Eing  a  regime of bloodshed,  terror and hate without any respect or con sideration to the dignity of the human being  of the most elementary human rights.  ""That  in  their hunger  for power,  these  traitors, following the pattern of totalitarian  regimes are trying, within Cuba, to separate  the family, which is the cornerstone of actual  society, and at the same time, are poisoning  the minds of the Cuban children and youth,  in their hope of extending the lentgh of time  for this abominable system.  ""That the rule of the law has been wiped  out in Cuba, and it has been replaced by  the evil will of this score of traitors, who are  acting under orders from their masters, the  Sino-Soviet imperialists.  ""In view o! the aforegoing, we declare:  ""First. That the actual Cuban regime  guilty of high treason to our fatherland and  to the ideals of the freedom revolution which  was started on October 10, 1868.  ""Second. That the score of  traitors who  have committed treason against our father hood, in case they survive the downfall of  their  regime, will have  to  respond,  even  with their lives before the ordinary courts  of justice of Cuba.  ""Third. That as the noble Cuban people  will not ever surrender, because that nation  was not born  to be slave, we,  the Cuban  people, hereby make the present declaration  o!freedom.  ""We hereby swear before God Almighty to  fight constantly, until death comes  to us,  to free Cuba from communism.  ""The fundamentals of this resolution for  freedom are:  is  ""First. God Almighty, above all things, in  whom we believe as the essence of life.  ""Second. The fatherland, with all of its  laws,  traditions, custoxns, and history as a  spiritual value, only surpassed by the con cept of God.  ""Third. The family, as the cornerstone of  the human society.  ""Fourth. Human rights, for each and every  citizen, regardless of race or creed.  ""Fifth. The law as the foundation for the  proper development of the human society.  ""Sixth. Democratic government, with  its  three  independent  branches:  Legislative,  executive, and judicial.  ""Seventh.  Representative  democracy,  through  the exercise of universal suffrage,  periodically, free, and secretive, as  the ex pression of popular sovereignty.  ""Eighth. Freedom of worship, freedom of  teaching, freedom of the press and free enter prise.  ""Ninth. Private property and own €:l""ship as the basic expressiOn of liberty.  ""Tenth. The improvement of living condi tions for both rural and city working masses,  with the just and necessary measuras, keep ing mind  the  legitimate  interests of both  labor and capital.  ""Eleventh. The derogation and eradication  of anything which ts opposed to the political  and religious fundamentals aforementioned,  and specifically, the abolition of communism  and  any  other  form  of  totalitarian  manifestation.  ""Signed and sealed in Key West, F~a., on  the 23d day of January, 1966.""  Now, therefore, be it  ,  Resolved by the House of Rep1esentatives  (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense  of  the House of Representatives  that  this  inspiring declaration should be patriotically  considered by all Cubans in exile and by all  who wish  to end the tyranny of 0astroism  and communism in Cuba and that the ""Dec laration of Freedom"" should serve to unite  those pledged to restoring Cuban liberty and  independence, and that it should be the ob jective of the United States to commend and  encourage  recognition and respect  for  the  declaration.

I am concerned because despite all of  the medical and psychological knowledge  we have gained in recent years in our  investigations into the adverse effects of  noise pollution, we must still spend time  evaluating requests on an aircraft which  even its most optimistic backers admit  will make at least as much noise-and  probably a  good deal more-than the  presently unacceptable levels of standard  jet passenger aircraft.

Too many  of our leaders are ""playing to the gal lery"" with  self-serving  rhetoric while  avoiding the hard choices on meaning ful programs.  Inflation has seriously eroded the pur chasing power of the American public,  a  recession  is  eliminating  jobs  and  threatening business and industry and  our  dependence  on high priced  and  unreliable foreign oil adds to both prob our national  security  the bargain.  lems and presents a potential threat to  in  Never has our Nation been threatened  with such a complex and interrelated set  of problems, and anyone who says there  is an easy or painless solution is either  naive or not very honest.  . Yet when  President  Ford  offered  a  program  which  comprehensively  attacked the whole spectrum of prob lems, admittedly at some cost and in convenience,  there was a  rush to dis avow  the program, delay any action  and lessen the chances for a real solu tion. Instead of the reaction we should  have seen, an eagerness to get to work  on  improving the program or provide  meaningful substitutes, we have seen an  abdication of  leadership  responsibility  in favor of political safety.  More than a year has passed since the  Arab oil boycott and Congress still has  no comprehensive energy plan and shows  no signs of being able to arrive at one:  yet they reject the only comprehensive  plan available out of hand, not even  taking the time to fully explore and com prehend what is in the plan. More in accurate  and misleading  statements  have been uttered and written about the  administration program than about any  subject in my memory.  Any energy program which we under take must accomplish several objectives.  First, it must reduce our consumption  of foreign oil imports. Second, it must  generate revenues and incentives for the  development of domestic energy sources  of all kinds. Third, it should equalize the  energy burden geographically,  so  the  Northeast and New England in particular  are  not  at  an  energy  disadvantage.  Fourth,  it should disrupt our normal  commerce and industry as little as pos sible so as not to worsen our economic  state. And last, but certainly not least,  it should be as fair and socially respon sible to all levels of society as it is pos ..  sible to make it.  This  is certainly a  difficult mix  to  achieve, but all energy proposals must be  examined in relation to these objectives.  The proposal to simply reduce imports  by the desired goal of 1 million ban-els  per day would meet the first goal, but  provides little economic incentive and no  additional revenue for domestic develop ment. It would initially fall most harshly  on New England, just as the Arab oil  boycott did, and would have a seriously  depressing effect on business, industry,  and jobs.  The gasoline  tax of anyWhere from  10 to 40 cents per gallon which has been  proposed also has serious shortcomings.  It undoubtedly would reduce the. use of  gasoline to some extent, but the finan cial burden would fall most heavily on  the middle class. It provides no incentive  in itself for conservation in other prom ising areas and provides no equalization  of total energy burden across the coun try and little encouragement for energy  source development.  Gasoline rationing, the currently most  popular  alternative, has major disad vantages which if not recognized now  will become all too evident shortly after  any such program was enacted. Ration ing does have a superficial fairness, but  that fairness would quickly evaporate in  bureaucratic  a morass  of  exceptions,  to  snarls,  black-market  operations,  and  economic disruption. It provides little or  no incentive for solving the root energy  problem, provides no revenues, no geo graphical equalization of burden and  would be extremely costly to administer  and police.  The  administration's comprehensive  energy and economic program, while far  from perfect and still incomplete in its  details, is the only plan before us which  recognizes all three requirements and at tempts to deal with them. It provides a  total framework, structured to achieve a  long-term solution to the root causes of  our energy problems in tandem with an  attack on our economic ills.  It also very clearly provides both im mediate and long-term benefits for the  Northeast, the traditional energy step child of the United States. It is indeed  curious that some leaders most critical  of the administration program appar ently did not bother to look at it closely  enough to even be aware of this ""New  England bJeak,"" in the President's ini tial state of  the Union message, and  hailed it as a  ""step forward"" 2 weeks  after  it was proposed as part of  the  original program.  Reduced  its  simplest  terms,  the  President proposes to reduce petroleum  consumption by raising the price through  a combination of taxation and allowing  the domestic crude oil price to rise  to  equal foreign oil. The money raised by  the Government  through the  tax pro gram will be used for income tax reduc tions and Federal grants for low-income  persons to compensate them for higher  prices. The additional revenue to the oil  companies from the higher prices will be  put back into development of additional  domestic sources. Imposition of stiff ex cess and windfall profits  taxes would  pressure the firms  to actually use this  money for  that purpose or  to  lose  it.  Other economic measures in the program  would equalize the cost of energy across  the country,  including presently subsi dized  sources  like natural gas, which  have contributed to putting New Eng land at an energy disadvantage.  Undeniably, energy prices would  in crease under this program. There is no  way we can break the Arab oil depend ency tie without some cost to us. We are  going  to have to pay for our self-suf ficiency. But if we do it now with a com prehensive and well  thought-out pro gram, we can do it at the least cost to  New England and avert long term dis aster.  Actually, New England will be faced  with a smaller increase in energy costs  than much of the country, as revealed  in the chart below. It must be kept in  mind that New England winters will al ways impose an energy burden not car ried by the South and Pacific coast areas.

Targets  Included Civic,  Religious Groups.""  You are probably asking what does all  this mean. It means that the Inspectonal  Services Division of the Baltimore City  Police Department carried out domestic  espionage against more than 125  .civic  and religious groups. Through in:flltra tion of groups and an elaborate appara tus, hundreds of dossiers were compiled  on citizens and groups not engaged in  any criminal activity. It means that paid  and unpaid police informers were used  to supply the information that went into  the dossiers. It means that black elected  officials and black leaders were singled  out as special targets of gestapo tactics.  It means that copies -of local police spy  reports were sent to, among others, Army  Intelligence and the FBI.  The grand jury of the city of Baltimore  is now investigating these matters as is  also the Constitutional and Public Law  Committee of the Maryland General As sembly.  I have  formally  requested  the U.S.  Senate Select Committee To Study Gov ernmental Intelligence Gathering Activi ties to investigate the Baltimore City Po lice Department. My  formal  request  pointed out that the police commissioner  of Baltimore has admitted that surveil lance  reports  on Baltimore  political  figures are often forwarded to the Fed eral Bureau of Investigation.  In addition, I have requested the De partment of  Justice  to act under 18  U.S.C. 241 and 242 against the Baltimore  City Police Department. Section  241  makes illegal any conspiracy to ""injure,  oppress, threaten or intimidate any citi zen in the free exercise or enjoyment of  any right or privilege secured to them  by the Constitution of the United States  or because of his having so exercised the  same."" Section 242 prohibits essentially  the same acts, if they are undertaken  ""under color of law,"" which clearly en compasses any such activity by a police  department.  We who serve the public have a duty  and a responsibility to protect the civil  rights and civil .liberties of  those we  represent. In addition, we have a duty  and responsibility to educate the public  as to the dreadful danger to our form of  government which  occurs when  civil  liberties are eroded or trammeled by any  agency of Government. The actions  have taken against the Baltimore City  Police Department serve to meet both  sets of duties and responsibilities.  I  TO  INCREASE ALLOWABLE EARN INGS UNDER RETffiEMENT TEST  PROVISIONS OF SOCIAL SECURITY  ACT  (Mr. HANLEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and  to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1975
40,House,94,-0.306,638,2,Mr. HANLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  pleased to announce that I am introduc ing a measure which would increase the  amount of allowable earnings under the  retirement test provisions of the Soclal  Security Act from the present $2,520 to  $8,000.  During the 93d Congress, I sponsored  a simUar measure. At that time the in come  limitation was  $2,400,  and  I  strongly felt that this :figure was unreal istic in light of the increased cost of liv .in.g. In 1973, !nfiation mounted to more  than 10 percent. The inflation rate in  1974, was 13.7 percent, and there is no  relief in sight for 1975. While an auto matic  cost-of-living  adjustment  has  raised the retirement test to $2,520 for  1975, this represents an increase of only  5 percent which is hardly in line with the  rate of inflation.  While inflation has adversely affected  the economy as a whole, it has taken  its highest toll among our Nation's el derly. The cost of food, heating fuel, shel ter, utilities, medical care, and other  goods and services which are essential for  senior citizens has  risen at an even  higher pace than the rate of overall in flation. The number of elderly individ uals with incomes below the poverty line  has increased dramatically. But for the  $2,520  income  limitation, many senior  citizens would gladly supplement their  meager  retirement  incomes  through  part-time employment.  The inequity of the retirement test is  even more evident when one considers  that only earned income is counted. In  other words, a retired individual could  conceivably have an income of $1 million  from investments, savings, royalties, and  so forth, and still receive maximum social  security benefits. However, a retired per son who is not fortunate enough to have  an  ""unearned  income,""  substantial  enough to supplement his social security,  cannot earn over $2,520 without having  his social security benefits reduced.  Furthermore,  the enactment of  this  legislation would have a healthy effect  upon the economy. While it will not solve  all our economic  ills, it would provide  a large segment of the population, who  need it the most, with a more flexible in come. In turn, senior citizens would be  able to purchase goods and services pres ently unavailable to them, which would  stimulate the economy.  It is evident that an updating of the  antiquated retirement test is long over due. I call upon the House Ways and  Means Committee to take up prompt con sideration of the legislation which I have  introduced.  TO ELEVATE NATIONAL INSI'I£U'I'E  FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND  HEALTH IN HEW  <Mr. OBEY asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute, to revise and extend his remarks  and include extraneous matter.)  ",1975
41,House,94,-0.45,638,2,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  introducing a blll to elevate the National  Institute for Occupational Safety and  Health within the bureaucratic structure  of the Department of Health, Education,  and Welfare. Currently, this important  agency which is responsible for protect ing workers from thousands of dangerous  chemicals such as vinyl choride and in organic arsenic is buried within the Cen ter for Disease Control at the same level  in the government organization struc ture as the Bureau for Tropical Diseases  and Bureau for Small Pox Eradication.  In simple terms, it has been so low on  the bureaucratic totem pole that routine  administrative problems have often be come greater roadblocks to productive  research than the problem of adequate  funding.  Within the last 12 months Americans  have  been  told  that  the  substance  used to make a major portion of the  plastic in their homes, vinyl chloride,  may be causing cancer of the liver, lung,  brain, and spleen, deterioration of the  bones of the :fingers, enlargement of the  liver and spleen, birth defects, and cir rhosis of the liver. They have been told  that inorganic arsenic which is used in  the manufacture of the dyes and pesti cides used both on the farm and in the  back yard is linked to a very high rate of  lung cancer among workers who are ex posed to it, and no one yet knows its af fect on the general public. They have  been told that the gases used as anes thetics in hospitals appear to be causing  still births among operating personnel,  that the chlorine used in some municipal  water systems is combining with certain  pollutants to form cancer-causing chem icals  in our drinking water and only  last week we learned that chloroprene,  another chemical used in the manufac ture of certain types of plastic, is now  believed to be a possible cause of skin  and liver cancer among workers involved  in its manufacture.  And what has been the reaction of the  Federal Government to these terrifying  revelations? NIOSH, the one agency with  primary responsibility to explore these  chemical  hazards  the workplace  where  their consequences usually first  become  apparent, has  shrunk  rather  than expanded to respond to this prob lem. Today, NIOSH has only 582 em ployees, 12 percent below  its  level of  January 1973, and about half the size  that the former Secretary of HEW, Elliot  Richardson, envisioned as appropriate  for the agency.  Despite the fact that the Congress has  appropriated sufficient funds to increase  the size of the agency, bureaucratic re strictions have resulted  in 164 of  the  in  ",1975
42,House,94,-0.464,651,2,Mr. KOCH.," Mr. Speaker, the nursing  home scandal is now the subject of a  number of separate  investigations  in cluding  that of  the Subcommittee on  Long-Term Care of  the Senate Select  Committee on  the Aging,  chaired by  FRANK Moss, a New York State More land Commission  chaired  by Morris  Abram and a grand jUl'Y investigation  headed by Special Prosecutor Joe Hynes.  The  corruption,  incompetence  and  failures of the nursing home program  now being publicly exposed in the State  of New York,  I  am  convinced  exist  throughout the country. There is a third  aspect which deserves equal if not more  attention and that is alternatives to the  existing nursing home program. Today  I am introducing legislation which deals  with that subject.  There always will be a  large number  of our elderly population who will need  the  full-time  services of  competently  run nursing homes. However, there is a  significantly large number of persons in  nursing homes or who will enter nursing  homes not because they need all of the  full-time  medical  services  provided  therein but because the reasonable al ternative of home health care  is not  available to them. The average yearly  cost for care  in a  skilled proprietary  nursing home facility in New York City  is $14,589. Presently the Library of Con gress is developing a national average  estimate of the cost of providing health  care at home. Preliminary estimates I  have  received  range  from  $3,000  to  $9,000.  I have been advised that a report pre pared  for  the Department of Health,  Education, and Welfare  and  for  the  Social Security Administration  shows  that  there  are  now  approximately  1,070,000 persons, elderly and disabled,  in skilled and intermediate care nursing  homes. It indicates that between 14 and  25 percent of those persons are being  unnecessarily maintained in an institu tional environment because there are no  alternatives available.  My legislation is intended to cover the  following areas:  Section 1 would allow unlimited home  health visits, if necessary to maintain an  individual outside of a hospital, nursing  home, or other institutional facility, unhis  der part B of medicare's supplementary  medical  insurance. Under  the current  program, a patient is limited to 100 visits.  Under the legislation, a patient would  qualify for these services on the basis of  specific criteria-eating, mobility, and so  forth-in order to avoid abuses of claims  for need. The Secretary of HEW would  be  required to promulgate regulations,  based on the functional criteria listed in  the bill, to determine patients' eligibility  for the provisions of the act. In addi tion, the payment given cannot exceed  payments which would be provided if the  individual were  receiving  institutional  care.  A medicare doctor's recommendation  of need would immediately be effective,  but  affirmative  recommendation  would be reviewed within 30 days by a  three-doctor panel, which may cancel  the assistance. In addition, if the panel  finds  that the initial doctor was mal feasant in purposely recommending that  a patient required assistance when he  did not, the panel has the power to strip  the doctor of his right to serve medi care--or medicaid, if in violation of sub sequent sections of the bill relating to  medicaid-patients in the future. The  doctor retains his right of judicial appeal  of the decision.  Section 1 would also expand home  health services under medicare by adding  a full range of services-not just doctor  and nurse visits, but ""homemaker"" serv ices-assistance  in  household  tasks,  shopping, walking, and such other serv ices as  the Secretary of HEW deems  necessary to maintain an individual out side an institution.  Section 2 would  increase  the home  health services of part A of medicare's  supplementary medical  insurance,  the  provisions covering post-hospital care,  from 100 to 200 visits, as would be ac complished in a pending Muskie-Churcb  bill in the Senate. In addition, correlative  services would be provided identical to  those in section 1.  Section 3  requires States to  include  home health services, including the full  range of medical and correlative services  as defined in section 1, in order to qualify  for Federal medicaid funds. The func tional criteria and verification mech anism of section 1 apply here also.  Section 4 would permit State medicaid  programs to cover payment of rent for  elderly or disabled persons who would  otherwise  require nursing home care.  The amount of payment will be the frac tion of the total household represented  by the elderly or disabled persons in volved and is subject to a ceiling con forming with current standards for fed erally assisted housing.  Section 5 would charge each child over  18 years old of a recipient of the bill's as sistance 5 percent of the child's taxable  income for the period his parent receives  aid. For example, if a married child with  two dependent children makes $15,000  per year and takes standard deductions,  he would pay $500 per year, while the  Federal payment might be as high as  $10,000  to $15,000.  Section 6 removes the $10,000,000 limi tation in funding authorized under the  1974 HUD Act for demonstration projects for congregate housing for the el derly, the handicapped, and other groups.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that if we were  to provide such services, two things would  be accomplished: First, the elderly would  be assisted in living longer and more pro ductive lives in their own homes where so  many want to be and the cost to the tax payer would be considerably less.  Mr. Speaker, you will be interested in  knowing that one of the points of conten tion among the experts is whether chil dren of an indigent parent-and the cost  of nursing home care or home health care  is such as to make everyone using those  services ultimately indigent-should bear  some part of the cost involved. On the  occasions when I have asked the ques tion of persons working in the field, the  vote has been split approximately equally  pro and con. I personally believe that  there should be a financial requirement,  modest and limited to some figure not to  exceed 5 percent of an individual's tax able income. The bill that I am introduc ing has such a provision and I know it  will be a  source of controversy. But I  think there is an obligation on the part  of children to support their parents and  not leave it totally to the Government to  do so. At the same time I would not want  the children to bear a cost which would  be oppressive and embitter their personal  relationships. As an example, under my  bill, a family of four with an income of  $15,000 using  the standard deduction  would pay no more than $500. Finally,  there will be some who will attack my  bill as one which would provide maid  service to everyone covered by it. What  they forget  is that the Government is  now providing registered nurse service  for those in homes far more costly than  the cost of providing housekeeping serv ices for those not able to care for them selves. Obviously there will have to be  strict controls monitoring physicians who  certify what services are  required for  their patients and my bill provides the  mechanisms for such monitoring and for  penalizing physicians and removing them  as ineligible to treat medicare/medicaid  patients in cases where they have abused  the system.  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I would  like to emphasize that the legislation I  am introducing today is a draft bill for  discussion purposes. I have circulated the  bill for comments to 150 organizations  concerned with the elderly and the dis abled. Furthermore, I will be holding a  meeting with representatives of many of  these organizations  in Washington on  February 5. On January 24  had a  preliminary meeting with individuals in  New York City working with the elderly.  I know that this bill will have to be  amended and improved. I urge anyone  with expertise in this matter to provide  me with their comments. It is my inten tion, at a later time, to introduce a more  perfected bill for cosponsorship.

CREATION OF A SELECT COMMIT TEE ON ENERGY  (Mr. RHODES asked and was given  permission  to extend his  remarks at  this potnt in the REcoRD and to include  extraneous matter.>  ",1975
44,House,94,0.225,664,2,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Speaker, I have to1S also dependent on the Federal Reserve  correcting  its  ill-advised  tight-mone1  policies.  This bill is designed to meet an urgent  need and to achieve quick enactment.  Broader  issues  concerning  national  energy policy and tax reform must be  dealt with in subsequent legislation.  Later in this Congress, we will con sider an excess profits  tax on the oil  companies who are  responsible  for a  large part of our increased cost of liv ing. We will also want to strengthen the  minimum  tax on millionaires so  that  they pay their fair share of taxes.  This bill will eliminate  immediately  three unwarranted  loopholes currently  enjoyed by the oil corporations-the per centage depletion allowance, the foreign  tax credit, and the option to deduct in tangible drilling costs. My  reason for  hitting these obvious windfall tax prefer ences now is that I want to send them a  message-in the board rooms and in the  Cabinet Room. This Congress and this  Congressman know  that  the  average  working family does not mind making  sacrifices for the good of the country.  But the big oil companies are going to  have to make some sacrifices, too.  Mr. Speaker, the following is a sec tion-by-section analysis of  the Emer gency Tax Adjustment Act of 1975.  INCREASES IN PERCENTAGE STANDARD DEDUCTION  The standard deduction is raised from  the present 15 percent of adjusted gross  income-with a maximum of $2,000-to  17 percent of adjusted gross income with a maximum of $2,500. This will re sult in a reduction in taxes of $1.2 bil lion  and would benefit middleand  lower-income Americans.  INCREASE IN LOW-INCOME ALLOWANCE AND  PERSONAL EXEMPTION  The per capita income tax exemptions  are raised from $750 to $900. The mini mum standard deduction-known as the  low-income allowance-is  raised  from  to $1,800. These  $1,300  two provisions  would cut taxes by $6.3 and $1.5 blllion,  respectively.  TAX CREDrr FOR LOW-~TJl lYIIDDLE-INCOME  WORKERS  A refundable tax credit is established  for workers equal to 2 percent of the  amount of wages up to a maximum of  $14,000. This will help to balance there gressiveness of the payroll tax and pro vide a temporary tax cut of $13.7 billion  during 1975.  OPTION TO TREAT INTANGmLE DRILLING AND DE   VELOPMENT COSTS AS DEDUCTmLE EXPENSES  So-called ""intangible"" drilling costs  are the fuel costs, labor costs, equipment  rentals and repairs which frequently ac count for 75 percent of the expense of  bringing in a new oil or gas well abroad.  Under current law, these charges are im mediately deducted.  Under the Emergency Tax Adjustment  Act, this massive subsidy to the oil in dustry is terminated.  FOREIGN TAX CREDrr  Under this provision, the foreign tax  credit will be eliminated for oll and gas  corporations. The royalties and per-bar rel charges imposed by OPEC will no  longer be ""credited.. against U.S.  inday introduced a resolution to create a  Select Committee on Energy.  I  am  pleased that the ranking members from  the Committees on Interior, Interstate  and Foreign Commerce, Government Op erations and Science and Technology, as  well as other members of the leadership  and colleagues, have joined with me in  cosponsoring this legislation.  It is imperative that Congress squarely  face the energy problem and deal with  the many and varied components of this  complex issue as a whole. In order to do  this I believe that we need a select com mittee made up of Members  familiar  with the different aspects of energy-re lated legislation. It simply will not suf fice  for Congress to carve up compre hensive  energy  legislation  into  small  packages for consideration by separate  committees of the House.  We must look at the overall aspects of  the energy problem and consider the im pact of various proposals on a broad  scale. To do this we need a Select Com mittee on Energy.  I am hopeful that the Rules Commit tee will  see  fit  to give  this proposal  prompt and favorable consideration. I  also urge the Democratic leadership to  support this positive step toward coping  with our energy problem by permitting  the House to deal effectively with energy  legislation in a comprehensive manner.

45,House,94,-0.324,664,2,Mr. HARRIS.," Mr. Speaker, I have in troduced today a bill creating an imme diate tax cut to stimulate the economy  in the amount of $22.7 billion, combined  with a quick elimination of three blatant  tax preferences presently enjoyed by the  big oil companies and costing the Gov ernment $5 billion per year. Thus, the  revenue reduction is limited to $17.7 bil lion. This stimulation to the economy is  necessary to bring us out of the reces sion and put Americans back to work. I  feel this figure is in line with the recom mendations of both the President and  the Democratic leadership. At the same  time the method is a step toward better  tax equity for lowand middle-income  taxpayers.  Under my bill, over 80 percent of the  benefits would accrue to those earning  less than $20,000 per year. In addition to  having a stimulative impact on the econ omy, this tax cut would compensate for  the 22-percent rise in consumer prices  since 1972.

48,House,94,-0.513,703,2,Mrs. MINK.," Mr. Speaker, today I have  introduced legislation, H.R. 2521, to in crease the annuities payable under the  rethed servicemen's family protection  plan and to continue paying such annui ties to widows and widowers who remarry  at age 60 or thereafter.  This legislation is designed to correct  an inequity brought about by the recent  adoption of legislation to provide a new  survivor's benefit plan for the spouses of  service members. This act  included a  cost-of-living esc8,lator for pension. Thus  service members who are recent retirees  have had an opportunity to provide for  dependent spouses through a survivor's  annuity plan whose benefits would be ad justed automatically to reflect increases  in the cost of living.  Unfortunately, past  rethees did not  have the opportunity to choose such cov erage and their surviving spouses must  now attempt  to make ends meet on  monthly checks issued at a fixed level.  There is no cost-of-living provision.  I recognize that the old plan was self financed, while the new one is about 60  percent self-financed. At the same time,  the tremendous inflation of the past few  years has cut deeply into the standard  of  living of annuitants under  the old  plan. I believe we should come to their  assistance by providing them with cost  of living increases as well.  The legislation I have introduced would  accomplish this objective. In addition, it  also equalizes provisions of the old plan  with respect to retention of benefits on  remarriage, as compared with the new  plan. The new plan permits survivors to  retain their benefits if they remarry past  the age of 60. Those receiving annuities  under the old plan, however, cannot do  this. Instead, each year they must answer  probing questions by the Government as  to their marital status to prove they are  still entitled to their annuity. Civil serv ice annuitants may remarry past the age  of 60 with no loss of income, and I  feel  those covered under the old military sur vivors plan should do so as well. My bill  also provides this equity.  I hope my bill receives speedy consid eration by Congress.

49,,94,-0.658,716,2,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, it is im perative that the Congress act immedi ately to prohibit President Ford's arbi trary administrative decision to increase  the cost of food stamps. At issue is the  basic principle that the combined burden  of inflation and unemployment must not  be made to rest on those who can least  afford to bear it.  Unless the Congress acts, on March 1,  all recipients will be compelled to pay  fully 30 percent of their monthly income  for food stamps. While double-digit in fiation continues to rage, almost 95 per cent of all food stamp recipients will  find it even more difficult to survive if  President Ford's new regulations are al  lowed to take effect. For many families almost 1.5 million according to one esti mate-the proposed price increases will  make it just as expensive to buy food  with food stamps as with cash.  According  the most  recent esti mates of the Department of Agriculture,  more than 240,000 people are receiving  food stamps in Wayne County alone. Of  these recipients, 90 percent are depend ent on public assistance programs and,  therefore, are the hardest hit by rising  prices. More  than 70  percent of  the  Wayne County  recipients  are  black,  among whom the unemployment rate is  approximately 25 percent and increas ing daily.  In Detroit, as in every other part of  the country, food stamps often mean the  difference between starvation and sur vival.  It would be unconscionable  to  deprive those who already endure a per manent depression in order to save what  amounts to less than 1 percent of the  money spent for military pmposes last  year. If President Ford's purpose is  to  attention to the Pentagon rather than  The poor should be  the  last  to be  penalized  for  inflation. They  do not  spend extravagantly on luxuries;  they  spend whatever they can scrape together  for necessities. They do not demand wage  increases; they are unemployed and only  cut Federal spending, he should turn his  the poor.  ("" ... an example of a current poverty  program  that should be eliminated  is  the  Job Corps. This is one program that has been  a failure. It sounds good, but it costs $10,000  a year to train a man for a job that may not  even exist. That's  the government way of  doing  it!'-RICHARD M. NIXON, April 1968.)  In  rea.ching  its  lOth  anniversary  this  month, the Job Corps deserves congr81tula tions on several counts. The most basic of  these is for its mere survival. From the begin ning,  it was among  the most sharply at tacked of the poverty progrruns. Its purpose  was to train young men and women-16 to  21-in skills  that would qualify them for  jobs. But it was immediately clear that much  more than this was involved. The early Job  Corps centers,  in the description of OEO's  first director, Sargent Shriver, were ""filled  with kids this country has literally dumped.""  Eighty per cent had not seen a doctor or  dentist  in 10 years, 24 per cent had eye  trouble, more than 60 per celllt came from  broken homes,  the average  schooling was  nine years but reading proficiency was on  the fifth grade level, and a third of the en rollees had behavioral problems. The Job  Corps was much more th-an an employment  program; it was deallng in human renewal.  The program's critics, offended that tax  money was being spent on dropouts, toughs  and  supposedly hopeless  cases,  seized on  isolated incidents-a fist fight between two  recruits became  ""racial  turmoil""-to dis credit Job Corps. Few were more determined  to do it in than Richard Nixon. The comment  above was one of many about Job Corps in  his 1968 campaign, but he had his  facts  wrong: the costs were much lower, the jobs  did exist, and corporations and unions were  partners with the government. For all his  misguided  determination, Richard Nixon  never killed the program. The idea behind  it was too sound-as many allies in the Sen ate and House understood-and  the need  among the young unemployed was too great.  the program has become an ac Today,  cepted part of  the Ford  administration's  manpower efforts. Sixty-one centers are op erating for 14,000 men and 5,000 women. In  10 years, nearly half a million trainees have  been enrolled;  the cost per enrollee in FY  1974 was  $3,098. Unfortunately,  evidence  suggests that the Job Corps ls still under  some of  the pressures  it has endured all  along. Funding in the last fiscal year was  $176 million, down  from $185 million  ln  1973 and $212 milllon in 1972. According to  one Labor Department official, at one time  ",1975
50,Senate,94,-0.397,807,2,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President,  I  wish to draw to the attention of my col leagues the main points brought out on  January  23,  the opening day of the  Joint  Economic  Committee's  annual  hearings on the economy. The three ex tremely qualified and insightful econo  mists who appeared--Gardiner Ackley,  Paul McCracken, and Charles Schultze testified  on  the President's  tax  and  energy proposals and possible alterna tives.  I  found  the session  to be most  informative and useful and I am certain  that others will find the following ideas  equally helpful, as we all attempt  to  come  to grips with  the economic and  energy problems that plague our Nation.  In general, Paul McCracken supported  the President's package but said that the  program could be tilted even more to ward middle and lower income groups.  His own preference would have been for  a permanent tax reduction rather than  a one-shot rebate. He also recommended  that  the  rate of monetary expansion  should be sharply and promptly increased  in order to accommodate an expansion  in gross national product. Dr. Ackl~y  and Dr. Schultze also advocated a vigor ous monetary policy in order to finance  the deficit, hold down interest rates, and  expand credit.  Dr. Ackley commented extensively on  the need to correct a number of popu lar, but mistaken, beliefs about economic  policy. For example, he observed  tnat,  relative to the size of the economy, Fed eral spending has not increased over the  past 2 decades. As a percentage of gross  national product, Federal spenaing was  21.1 percent in 1953, and 20.4 percent  in 1973. With the exception of Japan,  Dr. Ackley noted,  the United States is  the only  free market economy where  Government spending as a percentage of  gross national product has not risen ap preciably in the last 25 years. In ad dition, the size of the Federal deficit has  been  too high only once  in  the  last  quarter century, according  to Ackley.  Far from being ""horrified"" at the pres ent deficit, as  is Secretary Simon, he  thinks it is too small.  In support of these views, Dr. Schultze  stated that the deficit of $44 billion ex pected in fiscal year 1976 is not the re sult of  a  large burst of Government  spending, but instead fiows directly from  the recession. It is the shortfall in na tional output and income which turns a  full employment surplus of $25 to 30 bil lion into such a  large deficit. Schultze  also pointed to the gap between actual  and full employment gross national prod",1975
51,House,94,-0.398,859,2,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker, recent  action by the Federal courts are causing  untold hardship on the operations of the  city of Chicago.  As the situation now stands, Chicago  could lose $76 million in revenue sharing  funds if the police department does not  comply with Federal antidiscrimination  laws. While the matter of compliance is  a highly debatable question, the unfor tunate part is that the entire city of Chi cago must suffer because of a  ruling  of the court.  Briefly, this is how the situation stands.  A U.S. district cowt judge has refused  to sign an injunction to countermand the  court order of a Federal judge in Wash ington which halted the Federal revenue  sharing funds for  the first quarter of  1975.  Some $19 million  is  first quarter payment.  Without that money there is a strong  possibility that the city would have to  lay off  large numbers of workers and  freeze salaries. The city may also have  to  rescind  all cost-of-living wage  in creases for city employees and abandon  new social programs.  In short, the entire city of Chicago will  be affected by this decision. The people  of Chicago are being held hostage and it  is indeed unfortunate that they are the  innocent victims of the situation. The en closed newspaper clippings quite graphi cally depict how severe the problem has  become and hopefully a solution can be  worked out so that the problem is not  prolonged.  involved in the  JUDGE DENIES CITY'S APPEAL FOR U.S. FuNDS  A U.S. District Court judge declined Thurs day to order the payment to Chicago of $19  million  in  federal  revenue  sharing  funds  withheld  in  the police discrimination dis pute.  The city immediately filed an emergency  appeal with the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of  Appeals here. That court also was asked to  review the U.S. Treasury's administrative de cision to withhold the money.  Judge Prentice H. Marshall r~fused to sign  an injunction to countermand the Dec. 18  order of a federal judge in Washington, D.C.,  that halted the funds for the first quarter of  1975.  The city stands to lose $76 million in reve nue sharing funds for the entire year if the  Police Department does not comply with fed er' (cid:1)  anti-discrimination laws. City attorneys  had asked Marshall to nullify the Washing ton judge's order.  ""No  injunction of mine could set  that  (Washington) adjudication aside,"" Marshall  said in his hourlong ruling from the bench.  Meanwhile, political observers were divided  in their assessment of the money cutback's  impact.  Spokesmen for Mayor Daley's administra tion stood by  their warning of  layoffs for  city workers and salary freezes. The layoffs  could begin within  two weeks,  the spokes men said.  Ald. Leon M. Despres (5th), an anti-Daley  liberal and mayoral candidate who was in the  courtroom for Marshall's ruling, called on the  city to cut ""wasteful patronage,'' rather than  essential services,  from  the proposed 1975  budget of $1.097 billion.  Roman C. Pucinskl  pro-Daley  (41st),  a  City Council member who was a congress man when revenue sharing first was enacted,  proposed another alternative.  Pucinski suggested that if the city were  to see the funds in agencies other than the  Police Department, the federal government  would have no basis  for witnholding  the  money.  In his ruling, Marshall called ""most ser ious""  the city's failure  to become a party  in the Washington suit against the treasury  secretary, overseer of  the  revenue sharing  program.  Marshall said the city was seeking ""a sub stitute for other remedies"" that propose to  be  available. These  include appealing  the  Washington  order of U.S. District Court  Judge John Lewis Smith Jr. Observers said  it would be conceivable that once the city  was a party to the suit in Washington, it  could be transferred to Marshall for further  action.  After the Marshall decision was announced,  William Quinlan, acting corporation coun sel, said the city still was considering inter vening in the Washington action.  Richard J. Phelan, a special assistant cor poration counsel, told Marshall, ""I am disap pointed in the lack of courage on the part of  this court  to remedy a  serious situation""  through an injunction.  Asst. U.S. Atty. Dana D. Rovner, who op posed  the injunction, said, ""commend the  court for its courage in showing that the law  remains law.""  Renault Robinson, executive director of  the Afro-American Patrolmen's League,  a  plaintiff in both suits, said:  ""It is a shame we had to take an extreme  means to make the city comply with the civil  rights laws of the nation.  ""All the city has to do to stop this court  battle over the inevitable is to get on with  some positive programs  to  end discrimi nation.""  Marshall ruled on Nov. 7 that the Chicago  Police Department had been using discrim inatory hiring and promotional tests andre quirements  against  blacks,  Latinos  and  women, and ordered them stopped.  Judge Smith used Marshall's ruling as the  basis for his order blocking the Treasury De partment  from  disbursing  the  payments  scheduled in January for the city's first in stallment of 1975 revenue sharing funds.  The city contends it.. is short 850 patrolmen  As one remedy, Daley has announced that 500  patrolmen will be paid straight time only  while working a sixth day every week.  To ease the shortage, Marshall allowed an  emergency plan to hire 600 policemen begin ning in January. Both the mayor's relief and  Marshall's interim plan are endangered by  the cutoff of revenue sharing  funds,  said  Clark Burrus, city controller.  Also  in  the courtroom  for  the decision  Thursday was David Fogel, executive direc tor of the Illinois Law Enforcement Commis sion, which is withholding about $4 million  in federal funds pending the city's commit ment  to an affi.rmative-action program  in  hiring, promotion and internal procedures.  Should the city forfeit the nearly $80 mil lion, Mayor Daley will be in a difficult politi cal position, observers said.  A key Daley campaign  issue  is  that the  city's portion of the property tax has declined  for three consecutive years and would do so  again under the 1975 budget. An increase of  61.5 cents in the present property tax rate of  $8.39 per $100 of assessed valuation would be  needed to raise $80 mill1on.  A revenue increase of some sort would be  likely, observers said, because layoffs of city  workers or pay cuts would be unthinkable 1n  an election year. Many thousands of city em",1975
52,,94,-0.24,885,2,Mr. BEDELL.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  today  introducing a  bill which would  authorize, the Secretary of Transporta tion to release restrictions on the use of  certain property conveyed to the city of  Algona, Iowa, for airport purposes.  identical bill was  introduced  in  both the Senate and the House during  the 93d Congress. It was passed by the  Senate, but unfortunately it died in the  House Interstate and Foreign Commerce  Committee.  The need for this legislation has its  roots in the immediate post World War  ll period. On March 20, 1947, the War  Assets Administration transferred 221.3  acres of surplus Government property  to the city of Algona for use as a public  airport. At the time of the transfer, the  Government was compelled by law  to  include a  reverter clause in its agree ment with the city of Algona. This pro vision required that any of the land not  used for airport purposes automatically  revert to the U.S. Government.  Now, Algona city officials, the cham ber of commerce, and the Algona Indus trial Development Corp. would  like  use this acreage for industrial purposes.  to  However, they are prohibited from doing  this by the terms of the original agree ment. The legislation I am introducing  today would correct this situation by au thorizing the Secretary of TransportaEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tion to grant a release from the reverter  clause.  It is important to note that this bill  requires that a determination be made  that the land in question is no longer  needed for airport use before the trans fer can be actually effectuated. This pro vision would preclude any possibility of  violation of  the intent of the original  agreement.  Furthermore,  there  is precedent for  this type of legislation. In fact, in my  own State, similar legislation was en acted in 1966 in connection with airport  property in Clarinda, Iowa-Public Law  89-649.  And finally, the legislation will involve  no Federal-expenditures.  I realize that in and of itself this bill  does not constitute a pressing national  issue. I do, however, see it as symbolic  of a much greater, longer range issue.  Enactment of this legislation will en able a  rural community to use vacant  land to promote economic development  and job opportunities. In my view, this  is a very worthwhile and necessary goal.  And it addresses a problem which the  Federal Government has too long neg lected.  In the past half century, this country  has witnessed a steady migration of its  populace to the cities. This development  has contributed greatly to many of the  critical problems which currently plague  our metropolitan areas. And it has lead  the Government  to devote more and  more of its attention and resources to  combating these very seriouS and com plex urban problems.  But, what is often forgotten,  is  the  fact that it has also served to rob the  countryside of much of its people and its  promise. As long as this trend continues,  the problems of our cities will continue  to mount, and rural America will remain  an underutilized resource.  I  feel very strongly that we must do  all we can to reverse  this  trend. The  Government must lead the way by en couraging greater participation in the  growth and development of rural Amer i~a. In a small yet significant way the  enactment of this bill will-contribute to  that end.  ANNIVERSARY OF DR. ALBERT  SCHWEITZER BffiTH  HON. SILVIO 0. CONTE  OF ~SSAClrUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  2167  to  We would all do well, as we mark this  occasion  recall  the work  of Dr.  Schweitzer and his philosophy of ""Rev erence for Life.""  An organist, a philosopher and theolo gian, at the age of 30 he gave that all up  to study medicine. In 1913, he received  his medical degree and departed his  native Austria for Lambarene, Gabon,  Africa, where he founded his  famous  hospital.  There he labored for half a century,  revered by the people he treated, those  who worked with him and his millions of  admirers throughout the world. There,  too, he developed his philosophy of ""Rev erence  for Life""-an all-encomvassing  ethic. Writing just days before his death,  Dr. Schweitzer explained:  Reverence for life afiords me my funda mental principle of morality, namely, that  good consists in maintaining, assisting and  enhancing life, and that to destroy, to harm  or to hinder life is evil. Affirmation of the  world-that is, affirmation of the will-to-live  which  appears  in  phenomenal  form  all  around me-is only possible for me-that I  give myself out for other life.  .    It is this philosophy that the Friend ship House is dedicated to disseminating.  The occasion of Dr. Schweitzer's 100th  birthday is being celebrated in appro priate fashion throughout the world. A  short time ago, a portrait of ""Le Grand  Docteur,"" as he was affectionately known,  commissioned  for  this centennial and  executed by the incomparable Norman  Rockwell, was unveiled at the Friend ship House. At that time, Lee Ellerbrock,  who now administers Dr. Schweitzer's  outpost in Lambarene, spoke. In his re marks he described the Friendship House  as a ""universal asset"" in the community  of Great Barrington. That is so true. To day, as the representative of that com munity, I  take this opportunity to urge  the renewal of interest in Dr. Schweit zer's work and words and I  take the  liberty of inviting my colleagues to the  Berkshires to visit Friendship House, al ways an educational experience, but with  heightened significance this year.

55,House,94,-0.597,924,2,Ms. ABZUG.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in  support of H.R. 1589 because it is impor tant that this Congress reiterate its com mitment to assure hungry people in this  country the means with which to pur chase a nutritionally adequate diet. Four  years ago, this body amended the Food  Stamp Act in order to expand and im prove the food stamp program. Perhaps  the most  important Food Stamp Act  amendment passed at that time was the  requirement  that  low-income  house holds be provided the opportunity to pur chase  a  nutritionally  adequate  diet.  Paralleling that requirement, and equal ly  important, was  the  amending  of  section 7 (b) of the act: Instead of re quiring needy households  to pay  the  equivalent of their normal expenditure  for food for their food stamp allotments,  section 7<b> was amended to provide that  needy households pay only the equiva lent of a reasonable investment for their  food stamp allotments, which will allow  a household to purchase its complete nu tritional needs  through  the assistance  provided by the food stamp program. The  maximum charge, of course, could not be  more than 30 percent; 7(b) still contains  this requirement.  Prior to the amending of section 7(b),  many food stamp households did not par ticipate in the food stamp program due  to the high purchase price for stamps.  The 1971 amendment, gearing the pur chase price to a reasonable investment,  was intended to solve that problem. The  Agriculture Department has decided to  ignore the legislative intent behind the  7(b) amendment and has promulgated  regulations that will require most food  stamp households to pay 30 percent of  their net income for their food stamps, as  of March 1, 1975. Such regulations thus  violate the plain requirement of section  7(b).  The administration's plan to raise the  cost of food stamps for the poor, elderly,  blind, and disabled would defy reason  even in better times, but in the cw-rent  economic situation such a proposal both  boggles the mind and affronts the sense  of decency of the Americaa people.  In my home State of New York, there  are approximately 800,000 participants  in the food stamp program. The Depart ment of Agriculture's ''Food Profiles"" in dicate that about 95 percent of these  recipients will be charged substantially  more under the new regulations. The av erage increase in the price of food stamps  for low-income New Yorkers will be $100  per household annually. It will take its  severest toll on those in one-and two person households, most of whom are  elderly and already suffering from the  soaring costs of housing, health care,  and other necessities. According to esti mates by the Community Nutrition In stitute, most single low-income persons  in the food stamp program would face  increases of 35 to 100 percent in the cost  of their food stamps, and for some, the  increase would be as much as 800 per cent.  In New York, most households par ticipating in the food stamp program  are now paying between 20 and 28 per cent of their income for food stamps.  With the regulations raising the cost to  30 percent of household income, the poor  of New York would be burdened with an  additional $40 million in food costs to  those who are least able  to cope with  the current inflation.  Moreover, many persons now receiving  food stamps will be effectively eliminated  from the program. The modification in  the regulations  to require a minimum  benefit of $1  is not only unlawful; it is  a sham and a disgrace. What it means  is that single persons with monthly in conies of $154  to $194,  although not  technically eliminated from food stamp  eligibility, will be required  to pay $45  for $46 in food stamps. It is audacious  for the Department of Agriculture to sug gest that this $1 is in any sense a bene fit, particularly in view of the difficul ties  involved in obtaining food stamps  because of the many administrative fail ures of the program.  We are  in a  severe  recession; poor  families are suffering greatest from our  rampant inflation;  the number of un employed grows daily. We should be ex panding the food stamp program, not re stricting it. Even now the program is not  reaching many people who need  the  benefits it was intended to provide. But  instead of mitigating  the problems of  our poor and. low-income citizens,  the  adniinistration is seeking to exacerbate  them.  Over 4,300 comments were submitted  in response to these regulations, in al most unanimous opposition to the pro posed price increases. But the adminis tration has ignored our comments, and  while asking us to give General Thieu  $300 million to prop up his dictatorship  in South Vietnam. is proposing to take  $325 million from the poor and the el derly in a 4-month period. This cannot  be tolerated.  The response to the administration's  proposal from my constituents has been  one Of shock and outrage. Both here in  Washington and in my New York dis trict offices, I have received innumera ble  letters,  telephone calls, and visits  from citizens expressing disbelief and  anger that, at a time when food prices  are continuing to escalate, when there  are also greatly increased costs for such  essentials as housing, clothing, and med ical care, when the unemployment problem is growing  increasingly severe, the  administration would  seek  to oppress  even further those least able to bear the  burdens of recession and inflation.  The poor and the elderly are asking  what justification there can be for mak ing it more difficult for them to provide  is  themselves and their families with ade quate nutrition. I  think the answer  clear that there is no justification. If we  examine what little action the adminis tration has proposed to deal with the  current economic crisis, we can see that  not only is there no coherent policy, but  there is also absolute insensitivity to the  effects of the economic situation on our  poorest citizens. At the same time the  administration  is asking the poor and  the elderly to pay more for food stamps,  the President is proposing a  tax rebate  for our more unfortunate citizens. The  President's proposed tax on oil imports  will send home heating bills skyrocketing  and increase prices of numerous other  commodities,  including  fertilizers  and  agricultural products. The administra tion proposes  that the poor, who can  least sustain such an economic crunch,  will have several hundred dollars a year  taken away from them. Yet others will  have  those same amounts returned to  them, in the form of tax rebates, to bol ster our recessionary economy. Where is  the  rationale or equity  in  these pro posals?  The purpose of H.R. 1589, the bill be fore us,  is  to prohibit  the Agriculture  Department  from  implementing  these  unlawful regulations. This bill will freeze  food stamp purchase prices for this year  at the rates that become effective on Jan uary 1, 1975, that is to say, that purchase  prices cannot be any higher than those in  effect on January 1. Of course, this will  not prohibit the Secretary of Agricul ture from raising coupon allotments and  eligibility limits during this year. In fact,  the Secretary is required to raise those  standards on July 1 of this year to re :tiect the . increased costs of food. How ever, under this bill, it is clear that food  stamp purchase prices cannot be set at  30 percent of net income. The law is al ready clear on this point. This bill  is  necessary, however, to prevent Agricul ture from ignoring the statutory man date of 7(b) of the Food Stamp Act.  Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the chairman  for yielding.  ",1975
56,House,94,0.333,937,2,Mr. ROBINSON of Virginia.," Mr.  Speaker, as one who has been much  concerned by the dramatic  increase in  the cost of the food stamp program in re cent years, I regret the terms of the bill  before us. The formula scheduled to go  into effect on March 1, 1975-unless the  Congress acts to override the order of  the secretary of Agriculture issued pur suant to statutory authority-does ap pear to bear down unduly on the truly  needy, particularly the elderly. To bar  the proposed adjustment in food stamp  costs until the end of this calendar year  through a bill called up hastily under  procedure barring amendment, without  committee  hearings  directed  toward  waste in this huge program, is not re sponsible legislating.  I will vote for this bill only because I  do not want to see elderly recipients of  food stamps, and other deserving poor  who have no means of supplementing  their meager incomes to counteract per sisting inflation, suddenly subjected, on  March 1, to higher charges for their food  stamp allotments.  A bill providing for a 90-day delay in  the upward revision of food stamp costs  would have been preferable, and would  have given the responsible committees  of this House time to identify means of  revising  the  fonnula  to cut program  costs without adding at this time to the  financial burdens of elderly couples and  aged citizens living alone.  As a member of the Committee on Ap propriations, I will continue my efforts  to find means of getting the undeserving  off the food stamp eligibility lists, and  reducing the unacceptable cost levels of  this program.  ",1975
57,House,94,-0.379,937,2,Mr. MATSUNAGA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of H.R. 1589, a bill which  would prohibit the Secretary ofAgricul ture from raising food stamp costs be yond their January 1, 1975 cost.  As we are all aware, this legislation is  necessary to prevent a price increase on  food stamps scheduled to take effect on  March 1.  Under existing USDA regulations, the  cost of food stamps ranges from 5 per cent of a recipient's income to 30 percent,  based on a sliding scale. The USDA esti mates that the average recipient today  pays only 23 percent of his income for  food stamps. Under the new regulations,  food stamp costs will rise to a mandatory  30 percent. Thus, the average food stamp  purchaser will have his food stamp cost  increased by 30 perce'nt unless the bill  before the House today is enacted.  In Hawaii, about 70,000 persons use  food stamps every month. Statistics for  September 1975 indicate that these per sons paid a  total of $1.3 million for $3  million worth of food stamps. That would  breakdown to each recipient paying an  average of $55  for food stamps worth  $124. If the administration's regulations  are allowed to go through, the average  Hawaii recipient will pay $16 more per  month for his food stamps.  A $16  increase  in food stamp costs  would be serious enough given the low  income of all food stamp recipients, but  this outrageous  increase hits hardest  upon our senior citizens and poorest resi dents who already have been assaulted  by the full impact of inflation. Under the  administration's new regulations,  those  with the lowest income are hit with the  highest percentage increase in monthly  food stamp expenditures. As the income  of the recipient rises the proposed per cent that his food stamp expenditures  will rise is lowered. This sort of discrimi nation, which hits hardest those who can  least afford it, derogates the very nature  of the food stamp program.  The intent of Congress in setting up  the food stamp program is clearly ex pressed in 7 U.S.C. 2011:  Congress hereby finds that the limited food  purchasing power of low income households  contributes  to  hunger  and malnutrition  among members of such households ... to  alleviate such hunger and malnutrition a  food  stamp program  is herein authorized  which will premit low-income households to  purchase  a  nutritionally  adequate  diet  through normal channels of trade.  It is indeed difficult to see how raising  the price of food stamps contributes to  this goal. Rather alleviate hunger and  malnutrition  among  the  low-income  community,  the  administration's new  regulations will add to the problem.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1589, if passed, will  give Congress adequate time in which  to study fullY the food stamp program  and assess the total impact of a change  in the regulations upon the low-income  and elderly of ow Nation. I  therefore  strongly urge my coneagues to join its  proponents in passing this measure by  an overwhelming majority.  ",1975
58,House,94,0.078,937,2,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. Speaker, as a  co sponsor of similar legislation, I  rise in  support of H.R. 1589, the Department of  Agriculture's plan to increase the cost  of food stamps to recipients from an av erage 23 percent of their budget to 30  percent. At a  time when unemployment  has risen to 7.1 percent and inflation is  running above 12 percent annually, food  stamps actually stand between survival  ",1975
59,House,94,-0.564,963,2,Mr. METCALFE.," Mr. Speaker, one of  the major problems  facing minority  buDding contractors is the inability to  receive expert management advice. These  contractors are espeeially confused bY  the complexity of the tax laws. In order  to provide minority contractors with help  concerning their tax problems, the Chi  cago district of  the Internal Revenue  Service--mS-has devised and imple mented a  tax counseling program.

IRS To Am BLACK CONTRACTO:KS  he  roomful of 125  (By Robert McClory)  If you want to see a black or Latino con tractor sweat,  just ten hltn there s  a man  from the Internal Revenue Service outside  who would like a word with him.  :Many minority  contractors  (and  some  white white ones too) live in da.ily fear of an  IRS audit.  'lbe nature of  their business  causes monumental tax headaches and Jam ups. And the landscape is littered with the  ca.rca.sses of once  thriVing, small construc tion outfits that were eventually closed doWD  by too IRS.  Paul King, executive director ot the United  Builders Assn.  (UBA), estimates  that  the  IRS has placed liens on 50 percent of the as sociation's member companies dur~ the  past year. The llen is often the :tlrst step to ward ba.nkruptcy.  Recently, however,  the grim picture has  brightened, thanks to a still sha.ky detente  worked out between the IRS and minority  contractors. The Henry Kissinger o! this ar rangement is Xing, 34. wlLo operates his own  painting contracting 1ir01 on the South side  as well as heading the 115-member UBA. He  approached tax officials last April and said  something had to be done. To his surprise,  found  sym.pa.thetlc  ears  in Charles  Ma.rlanl,  IRS clistrict director, and Robert  Weiber, chief of the collection and taxpayer  service.  Together they worked out a Minority Con tra.ctors Tax Assistance Clinic, which was  held July 23, at the University of nunois  Circle Campus. IRS and a  nerv{)us contractors discussed their problems  in detail. Each side found out the other was  not totally unreasonable.  Fro01 that SUIIII.IDit there has developed a  six-man. IRS task force, which has agreed to  counsel 01embers of King's association on a  ~eguiar basis ... It's a beginning,"" said King.  The  contractors  are  developing  guarded  hopes and a little trust in the government.""  Previously, he noted, black owners with tax  troubles (just about all of them) were sca.red.  ""out of  their minds~ by the IRS and Ita  m1nd-boggtu1g regulations. 01ten they didn't  seek help or ask for accomodatlons until it  was too late. One of the major problems 1s  that small contractors a.re forced to use col taxes to meet current wages  lected payroll  beca.use agencies like the Chicago Board of  Educa.tion and large general contractors are  slow in paying for work long completed.  King cited one company that was more  than $50,000 behind in turning over with holding taxes. Another had just had its door  padlocked by IRS officials for Similar reasons.  After consultation a.nd discussion both con tractors arrived at an understanding with  IRS and are in the process of slowly balling  themselves out. Without the service, King  said neither company could ha.ve long sur vived.  He estima.ted that better than 80 percent  of  the UBA member compa.nies stand  to  profit from  the new friendly  relationship.  ""It's important to eliminate the tax prob  lems of minority contractors."" he said, ""so  IRS can turn its attention to the big delin quent  taxpayers, who deprive  -the govern ment of millions of dollars each years.

67,,94,0.336,989,2,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker, alco hol dependence has been recently cited  by the National Commission on Mari huana and Drug Abuse as the most seri ous drug problem in our country today.  In view of this findi.ng, I  feel that it is  time for the Congress to take some posi tive action  to stop  the spread of  this  illness.  Congress needs to immediately reverse  its policy of giving Federal subsidies to  encourage this serious drug problem. Our  current tax system allows for business  tax deductions  for  the. advertising of  liquor. I have today introduced legisla tion to prohibit these tax deductions. It  certainly seems ridiculous to me that we  should allow a  sizeable tax incentive to  an industry which spends $247 million  annually  in portraying alcohol as  the  stepping stone to  the ""good life."" In a  natiop where _the es.t~mated yearly eco nomic cost is nearly $25 billion, we need  fewer people as  a  part of  this ""good  life.""

68,,94,-0.441,1028,2,Mr. MIKVA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in opposition to President Ford's recent  proposal to limit social security benefit  increases  to 5 percent and, second,  to  recommend to the House several reforms  in the social security system which re quire immediate action.  As to the Ford plan for a 5-percent  ceiling, it is unconscionable to limit so cial security cost-of.:.livuig increases to  less than half the rate of national infla tion. As it is, minimum  levels of pay ments for :Ohe aged, blind, and disabled  are too low  to pay for  increased rent,  food, and other prices at current rates.  Holding cost-of-living  increases below  the increased cost of goods and services  ~both unfair and wrong.  February 4, 1975  is  Mr. Speaker,  so  that  the President  knows  that the Congress will not ask  the Nation's elderly, widowed, and dis abled to bear the brunt of inflation and  resulting high prices, I. have sponsored  a  concurrent  resolution opposing  the  President's proposed ceiling on social  security benefit increases.  This  concurrent  resolution  declares  that the cost-of-living escalator provi sion was intended to protect beneficiaries  from  the uncertainties of  inflationary  periods. Further, the resolution declares,  it is the sense of the Congress that no  5-percent ceiling be enacted.  Mr. Speaker, we must not, however,  be satisfied with blocking the President's  ill-advised 5 percent .proposal. We must  immediately begin to overhaul the tax  structure which finances the social secu rity system, to improve certain benefits,  and to make other needed reforms.  As a  recently elected member of the  Social Security Subcommittee of  the  Ways and Means Committee, I am hope ful that a major reform of the system  will soon be undertaken by the subcom mittee. The United States  the only  country in the world ths.-t uses the re gressive payroll tax to finance social se curity. This dependence on the payroll  tax must be drastically reduced.  I  propose  that general  revenues be  made  available  to  reduce  the unfair  impact of  the payroll  tax  and  that  recommendations  for  increasing  the  amount of earnings subject to the tax for instance, from $14,100 to $20,000 or  $25,000-be rejected.  I  intend to press  these recommendations before the Social  Security Subcommittee.  In addition, Mr. Speaker, I propose the  following:  first, an immediate increase  in the amount of money senior citizens  can earn without losing social security  benefits from $2~500 to at least $3~000 to  $4,000 per year; second, a  raise of the  minimum level for payments to the aged,  blind, and disabled from $130 to $140 per  month for individuals and from $195 to  $210 for couples; and third, the elimina tion of the rules that reduce the benefits  of married couples, which discourages  senior citizens from marrying.  Mr.  Speaker, we  cannot  allow  the  burdens of  inflation-which drive up  food, fuel, transportation, housing, and  other costs-to be borne by those lea-st  able to afford them. I urge prompt legis lative action along. the lines I have sug gested.  INTRODUCTION OF THE POSTAGE FREE ABSENTEE VOTING ACT OF  1975  HON. WILLIAM D.

69,House,94,-0.388,1041,2,Mr. SISK.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield 30  minutes to the gentleman from illinois  <Mr. ANDERSON), pending which I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 143  provides for an open rule with 2 hours  of general debate on H.R. 2634, a b111  to  increase  the  temporary public debt  limitation. All points of order against  the bill are waived.  For the benefit of my colleague who  raised the question earlier about waiver  of points of order, actually the action  of the Committee on Rules in this case  was  to  literally, for all purposes, dis charge  the Committee on Ways and  Means from further consideration of this  matter and to bring a bill directly to the  fioor. Of course, there was no report on  the bill. The Ramseyer rule was not com plied with. As a  result, it is necessary  that we have a waiver of points of order  in order to expeditiously consider this  particular bill which was only introduced  yesterday afternoon.  The bill extends the temporary limit  on the debt ceiling to June 30, 1975. I  want to make it clear that this does not  deal with fiscal year 1976, but deals only  with the period up to and until June 30  of 1975. It also increases the temporary  lim.itation  to $531 billion. Present law  provides for a  temporary debt limit of  $95 billion, and this would increase it by  $36 billion, so far as the temporary pe riod  is concerned, bringing  the  total,  then, to $531 billion, which would be $131  billion as the temporary limit, and $400  billion,  of  course,  the permanent  ceiling.  Mr. Speaker,  the Secretary of  the  Treasury estimates that the current ceil ing of $495 billion will be reached on  February 18.  Passage of H.R. 2634 is then needed  in order to meet this deadline, and there fore is imperative.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the  resolution in order to permit the Com mittee on Ways and Means  to debate  the issue.  ANDERSON  of  Dlinois. Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  rule which would make 1n order House  consideration of H.R. 2634, a bill to intro duce and extend the temporary ceiling  on the public debt.  I must admit  to some ambivalence  about  the action  taken by our Rules  Committee yesterday because it was a  rather unusual,  though not  tmprece dented maneuver. The chairman of the  Ways and Means Committee had re quest-ed a closed rule on the combination  Mr.  is  CXXI--147-Part 2  tariff-prevention/debt-ceiling  bill  re ported from his committee. The Ways  and Means Committee had voted 15 to  14, I believe, to tack the unrelated debt  ~ue onto  the btu suspendEng for 90  days the President's authority to adjust  petroleum tari1Is or quotas.  The consensus which developed in the  Rules Committee was that it was irre sponsible  to  tie  these  two unrelated  issues together, and the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. GREEN), a member of  the Ways and Means Committee, sug gested that we could divide the proposi tion by reporting two rules on two sepa rate bills.  My own  inclination, given previous  criticism in this body of such arbitrary  actions by the Rules Committee, was to  simply adopt one open rule on the entire  matter and permit the full House to work  its will on the merits of each of the prop ositions. My substitute rule was defeated,  and the committee subsequently adopted  the  two-bill,  two-rule approach, even  though a separate debt ceiling bill had  not yet been introduced.  So, this is the :source of my ambiva lence on the action taken by our commit tee. On the one hand, I don't like to re sort to such questionable tactics in the  Rules Committee; yet, on the other hand,  I think the Ru1es Committee took the re sponsible course which should have been  taken by the Ways and Means Commit tee in the first place. We just cannot  countenance allowing such an important  item as a debt ceillng increase to be held  hostage  for partisan blackmail. Such  blatant confrontation politics make Rus sian roulette seem like pop-gun plinking  by comparison.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the rule  of reason and responsibility eventually  did prevail on the other side of the aisle  and that the House will now be permitted  to consider each of these important items  separately and on their individual merits.  Turning to the rule before us, it grants  2 hours of general debate with  opportunity for amendment. Points of  order have been waived, as in the past  on such legislation, because this does in volve appropriating on an authorization.  I think most Members are aware of the  urgent need for this extension and in crease in the temporary debt ceiling. The  permanent debt ceiling is $400 billion.  The present temporary ceiling of $495  does not expire until March 31, 1975. And  yet the Treasury Department estimates  that the present temporary ceiling will  be reached by the 18th of this month 1f  present outlay and receipt patterns con tinue. The bill which this rule makes in  order would  thus raise  the  temporary  ceiling to $531 billion through the end of  this fiscal year. Additional House action  wou1d be necessary at that time on the  administration  request  to  raise  the  temporary ceiling to $604 billion through  fiscal1976.  It is therefore imperative, before this  House breaks for the Lincoln recess. to  act on this vital legislation.

71,House,94,0.015,1054,2,Mr. WAGGONNER.," Mr. Chairman, it  is unreasonable  to expect, you of  the  Northeast,  that just those people who  use  gasoline  should bear  all  of  the  burden. If we are going to conserve crude  oil we have to conserve crude oil in every  aspect of it, and that affects everything  that comes from a barrel of crude oil.  The other thing is excise taxes. He pro poses a levy on domestic oil. They have  not been put in place yet. I hope they  are not required to be put into force. I  hope we can come UP--and believe we  can-with an answer before then under  the able leadership of the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. ULLMAN).  Mr. Chairman, the President's proposal  is intended to do-whether it will or not,  I do not know-these things: First, to  conserve crude oil by increasing prices to  reduce demand, and this does work be cause we are not using any more product  today than we did in Octpber 1973. It is  intended to put some pressure on the  OPEC nations to lower prices. because if  we can conserve and there is a reduced  demand, then those people are going to  have about 9 million barrels a day of ex cess production. I think they are going to  look for something to do with that excess  production.  It is intended to reduce, if we conserve,  the outfiow of dollars, which we must do  something about. It is intended to provide  a maximum supply of petroleum and  petroleum products under the maximum  conditions of  the operation of a  free  market, a  free economy. Some say  it  will not. What do you suggest?  Mr. Chairman, the pt.irpose of the pro posal to cut taxes is to help these people  who are unduly burdened, where every body is going to be burdened to a point,  to allow them to pay for the cost-of-living  increases of this program. The pressure  is on the Congress. I believe that we can  meet the responsibility, because we have  come a long, long way. But we have got  a problem now. I believe we are gojng to  put our shoulders to the wheel in the  Committee on Ways and Means, and in  other committees here, and we are going  to come up with a proposal we can pre ~ent to the President; and if we can prove  to him that what we propose is better  than what he proposes, .I believe that he  would accept it.  However, if I sat where the President  sits, I would not take the cr.iticism fr~rn  our international .trade partners and our  allles there and from the people of this  country for doing nothing. I would keep  the pressure there until somebody showed  me they had something better in a de tailed and specific way. If he had not  made a proposal of some sort some of  you who oppose him today would be crit icizing him for doing nothing.  We in the Committee on Ways and  Means are going  to work  toward that  goal. I, as an individual, am going to op pose the bill today. believing that we can  maybe  later  compromise  this matter  somewhat and have everybody be a bit  happier. But we are not going to do it  without cost to everybody in this coun try. Where will you and where will the  country be if we do not reduce demand,  we do nothing, and have to cope with an other embargo which will be twice as dev astating? Most o fyou oppose the Presi dent's proposal but none of you have a  specific proposal.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen tleman has expired.  ",1975
72,House,94,0.389,1054,2,Mr. SCHNEEBELI.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield such time as he may consume to  the  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr.  YOUNG) ,  ",1975
73,House,94,0.325,1054,2,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Chair man, I  rise in support of H.R. 1767, a  bill deferring for 90 days the President's  authority to impose a tariff on foreign oil  imports.  President Ford has demonstrated out standing leadership by presenting to the  Congress a coherent and comprehensive  program for stemming inflation andreducing our energy costs. I agree with his  goals and wish to work for the achieve ment of Operation Independence through  energy conservation. I know the Presi dent is sincere in his desire to reduce our  dependence on foreign on, and I have  discussed this problem with him at great  length during several meetings. Thus,  I am reluctant to disagree with one part  of his specific plan for implementing the  energy conservation goal. that is, the im position of a $1 to $3 tariff on imported  oil.  But it is clear that the imposition of  this additional tax does not provide any  guarantee that oil consumption will be  reduced. What the tax does guarantee  are high prices-for gasoline,  for oil  products,  for  synthetics derived  from  petroleum, and for electricity.  The President  is seeking  to  reduce  domestic consumption by 1 million bar rels of oil per day. Clearly, such a reduc tion will create shortages which we must  learn to live with. I feel that the Presi dent can accomplish the same goal-the  1-million-barrel-per-day  reduction-by  simply placing a  limit on oil  imports,  without taxation or price increases. We  will have shortages in either case, but  under the President's current plan, we  will have additional increases in costs.  A limit on oil imports, without any built in tax increase, is an important alterna tive which I feel that President and the  Congress should consider during the 90day deferral period established by H.R.  1767. Therefore, I will vote for H.R. 1767  and stand ready to work with my col leagues ~~~ President Ford to develop  programs which will reduce oil consump tion without raising prices.  ",1975
74,House,94,0.133,1067,2,Mr. SARASIN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to this bill and in support -of  the President's PrD6""ram.  It has been mentioned on this floor  that we are at war. I  think that if we  continue to delay and procrastinate, we  are very quickly going to lose that war.  We have a very badic question before  us; that is: Is the goal set out for us to  become  .energy  invulnerable  by  1985  worthy of being 11eached? If we answer  that question no we might as well forget  this program or any other program; but  I happen to think the goal is worthy of  being reached.  How do we get to be energy invulner able without .saying that we are going  to deliberately deny ourselves oil that is  there, that we are going to slow our im ports before our dependence becomes  even greater than it is; before we send  billions of dollars overseas and out of our  economy?  I am sure it has been mentioned over  and .over  that imported oil cost us $3  billion in 1970, $24 billion in 1974, and  will reach $32 billion in 1977, unless we  tum this around. How do we do this?  What system do we use?  I like the President's program because  it has a symmetry to it. It has a balance  to it, and if the numbers are wrong, if  we decide  that the energy cost to the  individual is,  in fact, greater than the  estimates, then ret us adjust it on the  other side of the ledger and make the  necessary tax adjustments and tax re bates required to make up for that loss  to the individual, but let us not destroy a  program t.hat has this kind of balance.  There are other alternatives suggested,  .such  as  allocation, which  are  self imposed embargoes. Those of us in New  England remember well what the em bargo ,did to us in 1973. Rationing, which  is the worst of our choices, is being sug gested. Rationing can reach the goal of  conservation. but does nothing for the  economy or for development of alterna tive sources and creates a system which  is designed to be beaten, which obviously  will self-destruct before it has a chance  to accomplish the desired purpose, and  which will become the most despised sys tem of governmental interference .ever  put forward. I am categorically opposed  to this option.  A tax at the gasoline pump might dis courage consumption but also fails  meet the goal of alternative source de velopment and will impose a  tax of at  least .$0.40 to effect the desired conserva   tion.  Or, do we let price become the incen tive for conservation? Do we allow people  to make their own decisions? Do we allow  them  to set  their own priorities,  .and  do we cover them for the increased cost  of energy? I  think the President~s pro gram does eover the cost, and reach the  other goals -as well. That is why this pro gram Js a good vehicle to use.  to  We are saying, if we do not adopt  this; we are saying, 1f we go along with  the delays: uMr. President, we have not  anything.

It is very easy to line up people ou  this :floor to say, ""Yes, I am against the  Ptesident's program,""  but  ask  them  what their program is and see how many  people are left standing in that collec tion Qf those who are against the Presi dent's program.  This body is very, very quick to give  away the goodies. There is no question  income tax rebates and tax adjustments  will pass this House but where do we see  this Congress making the hard decisions?  We do not see any alternative program,  an alternative program which has the  same kind of balance. One which ad dresses itself to eventual freedom from  unsafe oil imports; one which directs it self to domestic energy development; one  which allows the automatic market func tions to bear most of the load; one which  is as fair and equitable to our society as  possible.  Such a program is not before us, so  we should be directing our efforts to im Pl'OVe and fine tune the President's pro gram. It is the only game in town.  ",1975

76,House,94,-0.218,1067,2,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Chairman, did you  know that the Governor of Texas, Hon.  Ralph Briscoe, has stated that the Pres ident's proposed program would gener ate harsh consequences that he 1inds  unacceptable because of their negative  impact on Texas?  The Governor's office maintains a com puter simulation 1 of the Texa-s economy  and it tells us that the immediate effect  of the President's increasing import fees  on crude oil and petroleum products will  result  decline  in employment  in  Texas of 9,000  jobs. The loss in total  personal income in Texas is estimated at  $102.9 million. State and local govern ment taxes are estimated to lose -$17.4  million  if  the  tax  rates  remain un changed. Fuel .and feedstock costs would  result in increase of $142 million to the  petrochemical industry in Texas. Gaso line prices are estimated to increase at  least 4 cents per gallon. Natural gas util ity prices are estimated to rise 54 percent,  while electric utilities will rise as follows:  in a  lin percent]  Commercial ------------------------Industrial --------------------------21. 4  Residential -------------------------10. 6  Refined petroleum products ___________ 18. 6  12.2  These price increases will be felt by  all industries in the Texas economy. For  example, $13-per-ton increase in the cost  of natural gas used in the manufacture  of 1 ton of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer  by Texas farmers. This can be expected  not only to raise the farmers costs but  to raise the prices that the consumer has  to pay for agricultural products.  This program, of course, hurts all the  States. We are all in this together. We  all need to work to get energy prices to  a level that we can afford. Raising them  by imposing a severe tax on them, will  not help but hurt the consumer.  Another  interesting  assessment was  made by Governor Briscoe's simulated  model of the Texas economy that has a  point that affects all  the other States  too. A national equilibrium analysis on  the market versus  regulated crude oil  and natural gas .showed  that without  price  regulations or price controls on  crude oil, natural gas, or coal, the 1974  price of  these fuels would have been:  Crude oil, $8.70 per barrel .at wellhead;  natural gas, $0.66 per  thousand cubic  feet at wellhead; and coal. $6.20 per ton  at mine.  At these prices for oil gas and coal .the  industry would  have  discovered  'new  reserves and  increased production fa cilities within the State so that declining  1 Holloway, M. L., H. W.

77,House,94,-0.299,1080,2,Mr. MINISH.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 1767, a bill  to  delay for 90 days the President's author ity to increase tariffs on imported oil.  I want to commend the chairman and  members of the Ways and Means Com mittee for their hard work and expediti ous action in bringing this measure to  the floor at such an early date. In my  opinion, prompt and overwhelming pas sage of H.R. 1767 is vital if we are to  avoid a  severe Tekindling, in the form  of higher home heating oil and gasoline  prices, of our dangerously high level of  inflation.  On January 23, President Ford by Ex ecutive order, increased oil import fees  under authoTity granted him by  the  Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The fee in crease began at $1 a barrel for imported  crude on February 1, is scheduled to rise  to $2 on March 1, and to $3 by April 1.  A Library of Congress study estimates  that all the administration*s energy pro posals could cost consumers an additional  $50 billion this year, and the tax on im ported crude on alone could cost $12.6  blllion. The study concluded  that  the  ripple effect of  the higher petroleum  prices might cause inflation to continue  at a 12-percent rate for all of 1975. This  is completely unacceptable to me as I am  sure it is to the vast majority of Ameri cans.  It is significant to note that the Pres ident issued the oil  import fee procla mation without the benefit of a public  hearing on the effects of su~ a tax and  without public or congresswnal  review  of  the decision.  the criteria used  in  reaching the decision, or the possible al ternative methods of energy conserva tion.  While we all agree that the goal oi  energy conservation is laudable, adding  more to the price of necessities like home  heating oil at this time will only con tribute to the inflationary spiral, increase  th~ recession, and not guarantee any  fue1 savings.  Price increases for home heating oil  and gasoline will make  life much  less  tolerable for the millions of citizens who  cannot do without these products. They  will have no alternative but to pay the  higher prices.  All A.mericans share  the President's  goals of implementing a national fuel  conservation program and reaching na tional self-sufficiency in this area. How ever, I urge my colleagues  to  join me  today in sending a clear message to the  White House that these goals cannot be  reached  through higher energy prices.  ",1975
78,House,94,0.233,1093,2,Mr. GRADISON.," Mr. Chairman, as  Federal deficits have grown in the last  few years,  the Government has been  forced to borrow more heavily to pay its  bills. The inflationary spending of the  93d Congress drove us into increasing  debt. Therefore, the 94th Congress must  increase  the debt limit just to borrow  money  to pay our bills and keep  the  Government operating. We are being  forced to pay for the big spending rec ord of the 93d Congress. As a matter of  fiscal  responsibility, we must  increase  the debt limit.  During the past year I expressed my  opposition  to many of  the programs  which are responsible for  the need  to  increase the ceiling. In the coming year,  I  will monitor  very  closely  Federal  spending, vote to stop unnecessary pro grams, and keep new spending to a min imum.  If new big spending bills are passed  this year over my objection and a pro posal is made to increase the debt limit  next year, I will express my firm opposition to these new outlays by voting not  to increase the ceiling.

81,House,94,0.601,1106,2,Mr. ROUSSELOT.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank my colleague from New York for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, the proposals which we  are presenting today to restore stability  to our economy and telief  from inflation  and recession are the only workable and  lasting solutions.  Our proposals include:  A balanced budget-reducing Federal  expenditures to balance with anticipated  revenues.  Tax cuts that wlll be made possible by  the reduction in Federal spending.  Repeal of regulatory laws which allow  Federal intervention in the private sec tor  discouraging  competition,  raising  prices, and otherwise promoting  infla tion.  These solutions would allow the free  market to function to deliver goods and  products at competitive prices to all con sumers-returning  the basic decision making power to the people. While some  of the Members in this House are advo cating stronger Federal regulation, our  proposal is to get the Federal Govern ment out of the business of controlling  consumer supply and demand. We com pletely reject the regulatory climate of  wage and price controls, controlling in terest rates, and allocating credit which  rob each American of freedom of choice  and prevent  the  return  to a  healthy  economy.  Our Nation is currently experiencing  double digit inflation and recession which  is primarily the result of  the Federal  Government's interference and regula tion of the economy, and to believe that  further control  is  the answer  is pure  folly.  Our current economic problems are  rooted in the actions of the Federal Gov ernment, and it is illogical to allow fur ther intervention in the private sector  to correct a situation which has primarily  been caused by governmental regulation.  If Members of this body are truly inter ested in reversing the inflationary trend  that has now led to recession, they should  be more concerned with fiscal discipline  of the spending of  tax dollars rather  than imposing controls on the private  sector. The ideas of regulating wages and  prices, interest rates, and consumer credit  are completely unworkable and inequi table.  WAGE AND PRICE CONTROLS  During my service in Congress, I have  discussed the results and consequences of  controls in great detail in statements on  the floor of this House, and in views in cluded in House Banking Committee re ports on this issue. Cong~ess finally got  the message when it rejected any exten sion of  the control authority beyond  April 30, 1974.  Economic  controls cause distortions  and shortages. During our recent expe rience with controls-1971-74--shortages  emerged in all industries, and in early  1974, Congress received extensive infor mation from private industry representa tives on the extent and consequences of  the commodity shortages. Following are  some examples of the seriousness of this  situation brought a~out by this interfer ence in the economy:  First. In a statement to the Senate  Banking Committee on January 30, 1974,  o. Pendleton Thomas, chairman of the  board and chief executive officer of the  B. F. Goodrich Co. stated:  In  those  sectors where prices are con trolled, serious shortages and black markets  are occurring. Each day we are faced with a  lengthening list of actual or potential short ages of critical raw materials including tal low,  rubber solvents, zinc oxide,  titanium  dioxide,  carbon black, process  oils,  epoxy  resins,  antioxidants,  polyester  and  nylon  fibers, and synthetic rubber. In some cases,  the severity of these shortages has been com pounded by suppliers being forced out of  business. In recent weeks, for example, one  supplier of bead wire, which is used in tire  construction, was forced  to close  its West  Coast plant because of the inability to gain  approval to raise prices sufficiently to assure  an adequate return on investment. Another  diversified supplier recently eliminated bead  wire from its product lines.  Controls on  domestic  prices  have  also  stimulated exports of certain raw materials,  many of which are already in short supply in  this country, especially chemical feedstocks.  During the first ten months of 1973, the com bined exports of toluene and butadiene used  in synthetic rubber production were 270 per cent higher than during the same period of  1972.  When conventional economic  forces  are  permitted  to  function,  imports  into  this  country are a significant factor in the supply  of critical m~terials. During  recent world  shortages our price controls have prevented  the inflow of materials-instead, as I have  just  indicated, exports of  some materials  have been accelerated, seeking  the higher  world market prices, thus compounding our  problem.  Second. In a. March 8, 1974, statement  to the House Banking Committee, John  C. Datt, director of congressional rela tions  for  the American Farm Bureau  Federation, discussed the effects of con trols on food production:  Due to controls, prices of fertilizers in this  country became so out of line with world  prices that a sizeable portion of our domestic  production moved into foreign markets to the  detriment of U.S. food production. This was  recognized belatedly by the Cost of Living  Council in November, and fertilizer controls  were removed; however, there is reason to be lieve decontrol may have come too late to  maximize U.S. farm production in 1974.  Price controls have played a  role in the  energy crisis. Uncertainty created by eco noinic controls is one of several factors tha~  have brought new refinery construction to a  halt. Indications are that this same uncer tainty has contributed to a decline in oil  and gas exploration in this country.  Agriculture  is now facing a  shortage of  baling wire. Much of our baling wire is im ported. Domestic prices frozen at levels un related to world prices have contributed to  an extreme shortage of wire in this country  since American  farmers and  ranchers are  prohibited from bidding for supplies in the  world market.  The unwise,  though relatively brief, at tempt to control beef prices in 1973 brought  chaos in the industry-and shortages at the  meat counter. It was costly to farmers and  to consumers. In fact, the reductions in beef  supplies which have resulted in price distor tions in recent months are more a result of  the abortive controls imposed last year than  any other single factor 0 Furthermore, these  controls contributed nothing to the stab111za tion of the economy.  Third. The Associated Builders and  Contractors, Inc., discussed construction  industry shortages in its statement to the  House Banking Committee  in March  1974:  The basic question is one of supply and  demand. Experience has shown that controls  create  shortages and whenever  there  are  shortages there is upward pressure on prices.  Why do  controls produce  shortages? The  plain fact is that if a price ceiling makes  it unprofitable to produce an article those  in the business of producing it find it sensi ble either to cut its production or to stop  producing it entirely.  o On the list of recent critical shortages  according to the experience of a firm facing  the shortage problem, are lumber, steel and  steel  pro~ucts, paper products, hardware,  copper wrre  and  copper  cabling,  trucks,  aluminum bar and tube, electrical compo nents, and paint. These are just some of the  items which are basic to construction found  to be in critically short supply by firms which  use them.    Wage and price controls are actually  harmful to the economy. The stimula tion of competition in the free market  is the only route to a healthy economy.  In a competitive market, prices respond  quickly  to changes  in supply and de mand, and prices are the barometer of  the economy. The price mechanism  is  the best possible allocator of our  re sources as well as our goods and products.  Tampering with  this delicate balance  only leads to disruptions, distortions, and  shortages-conditions which prevent eco nomic growth.  INTEREST RATE CONTROL  It has been suggested that the Federal  Government  should  regulate  interest  rates. However, this type of action would  do nothing to correct the causes of ris ing interest rates.  Deficit spending puts pressure on the  Federal Reserve to finance  the deficits  by  increasing the supply of money  in  the economy. This is a particularly rele vant point when considering that the  President's budget submitted to Congress  this week calls for an almost $55 billion  deficit  in Federal  funds during  fiscal  year 1976. This excessive increase in the  money supply creates a chain reaction it increases prices which in turn push  interest rates upwa.rd over the long run  as lenders raise rates to compensate for  the inflationary impact generated by the  growth in the money supply. Excessive  growth in the money supply at rates esti mated to range between 10 and 12 per cent occurred in the first years of the  1970's. However, a restrictive growth in  the money supply-like what we are now  experiencing at a rate estimated at 3.2  percent-forces the private sector to ab sorb the Government's deficit, and also  pushes up interest rates.  Clearly interest rates can be brought  down  by  congressional  fiscal  reform  bringing Federal spending into balance  with anticipated revenues, and it is on  this point which Congress should con centrate its efforts. This would allow the  increase in the money supply to be tied  to real growth such as growth in na tional productivity.

82,House,94,0.241,1119,2,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. Speaker,  in par ticipating in this discussion of the eco nomic problems confronting our Nation,  I would be remiss if I did not devote my  remarks  to what I  consider  the most  significant economic problem confront ing the people of my State of South Da kota. That problem is inflation and the  hardship it is causing for an area which  has its primary dependence on an agri culture base. Certainly the recession  is  not easy for anyone.  I would submit, however, one of the  major reasons we are in a  recession is  the fact that we have been on such an  inflation binge for so  long that some thing had to give.  And give it did when the people quit  buying  automobiles  and other  goods  which they felt were too high priced.  The combination of  inflation-reces sion  is a  relatively new experience for  America.  Productivity serves as an  important  measuring stick in the measuring of in flation.  We find that the industries of Amer ica rate of productivity has fallen be hind,  this has contributed  immeasur ably to inflation.  The one industry that stands out for  their outstanding record of high pro ductivity is agriculture.  If our industry as a whole had the  record for productivity that we find in  agriculture, we would not be in the dis astrous inflationary period this country  finds itself in today.  The American farmer, however, has  been taking it on the chin for a good  long  time. Through most of  the past  quarter of a century he has found him self going through the economic wringer  that we call the ""cost-price squeeze.""  During that 25-year period,  the in come  the farmer  received was at less  than what we call full parity. In other  words, he was not enjoying the benefits  of the prosperity in which most of the  ",1975

84,House,94,-0.4,1145,2,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Speaker, in recent  weeks, U.S. relations with Latin America  have greatly deteriorated as a result of  what I believe has been a serious over reaction to an amendment to the Trade  Act approved by Congress in December. I  do not believe that it was the intention  of this House to in any way harm our  hemisphere  neighbors  and  that we.  therefore, must act quickly  to clarify  the situation either by advising the ex ecutive branch of our actual wishes or  by passing clarifying legislation.  There follows a letter which I have sent  to the able chairman of the Committee  on Ways and Means asking that he act  to halt the serious deterioration in our  Latin American  relations  in whatever  fashion he deems suitable.  FEBRUARY 4, 1975.  Ron. AL ULLMAN,  Chairman, Ways and Means Committee U.S.  House of Representatives, Washington,  the OPEC  D.C.  DEAR MR. CHAmMAN: As I am sure you are  aware the inclusion of the so-called OPEC  amendment  (sec. 502(b) (2))  in the Trade  Act has created serious problems !or United  States relations with virtually all the nations  o! Latin America.  After studying the actual wording of this  amendment it seems to me that it was ac tually intended to be prospective in nature,  that  it was  intended  to put  nations  on  notice  regarding  the  conse quences of their future actions rather than  to be used as a punishment !or past actions.  I would greatly appreciate your clarifying  the intent of the Ways and Means Commit tee and the House conferees with respect to  this amendment. I! the amendment was in tended as punishment for past actions I re spectfully request that your Committee, on  an urgent basis, consider clarifying legisla tion to make certain that countries such as  Venezuela and Ecuador, which did not en gage in a boycott of the United Sta.tes, are  excluded from any punitive effects. Not only  would such a  clarifying amendment more  justly apply retaliatory actions, but it would  greatly strengthen efforts to strengthen our  ties  to  traditional and dependable Hemi sphere petroleum suppliers while  lessening  reliance on certain Middle Eastern states  which are the source of our difficulties.  Sincerely,  DANTE B. FASCELL,  Chairman~ International Political  and Military A.fJairs.  TOWARD AN AMERICAN FOREIGN  POLICY  <Mr.  SYMINGTON  asked and was  given permission to extend his remarks at  this point in the RECORD and to include  extraneous matter.)  ",1975
85,House,94,-0.331,1145,2,Mr. SYMINGTON.," Mr. Speaker, in his  farewell address George Washington cau tioned his countrymen to beware of for eign entanglements. The Father of his  country had been a loyal British subject,  having fought on the Indian frontier with  General Braddock. His Americanization,  like that of his associates, occurred by  degrees as his mind and spirit became  alienated by perceived  injury and at tracted by a corollary sense of patriotism  to the emerging colonial cause. Were he  to be allowed te> visit with us today he  would be hard put to fathom our network  of alliances, trading an-angements, mili tary aid programs, and the Intricacies of  detente. Observing our grants, sales, and  loans to nearly every participant in the  Middle East struggle, he might conclude  our foreign policy bordered on the occult.  If he were to offer advice after being af forded such an overview, it seems to me it  would be simply to bear in mind Amer ica's national interest In the formulation  of foreign policy, so that it might be an  American foreign policy with no prefixes  denoting an  infusion of extranational  bias or sentiment. He would have agreed  with Senator L-odge, Sr. who early in this  century spoke of the need to cease being  Anglo -Americans, German -Americans,  Italian-Americans and Irish-Americans  and  become  just Americans. This  is  harder than one might think. The melt ing pot melts slowly and Congress quite  accurately reflects  the condition of its  content.  Not that some of our greatest errors  have not been all-American errors, that  is, Vietnam. Few chords of specific kin ship called us to that undertaking, but  rather a subtle distortion of the peace keeping role we assumed in this century,  coupled with the determination to block  Communist aggression as that term  is  understood, an undertaking given gallant  expression in President Kennedy's inau gural pledge, ""to bear any burden, pay  any price"" to that end. In this bicenten nial year, nostalgic as we are for  the  broad sweeping answers of the past, we  cannot have them. We will have to draw  on today's wisdom. The quality of Amer ica's insight does not drop  like gentle  rain from heaven. It is strained to remove  elements disagreeable to citizen lobbies of  every description. Presidents can work  these lobbies and be worked by them, as  can Congress.  I remember President Johnson's W8,rn ing to Israel's President Shazar. Sitting  in  the  rose  garden  in August  Johnson was bemoaning certain rabbini cal opposition to our Vietnam involve ment:  1966,  I! we can't defend that Asian country o!  20 million, how should we be counted on to  fight for a  little Middle East country of 2  million?  President Shazar was being asked to  use his influence to quiet some of John son's rabbinical critics. By then, however,  the criticism was too widespread to be  muted by whispers from abroad. Still, the  assumption was made and not rejected  that this was a proper relationship  to  exploit.  Reflecting overwhelming but  imper fectly informed public sentiment, domi nant voices In the House and Senate re cently prevailed on the administration  to insist on a more liberal Jewish emi gration policy on the part of the Soviet  Union as a condition for increased trade.  I supported the effort as the only one  offered  to express our proper concern  for another people. But I would have  thought a more attainable and more  valuable quid pro quo would have been  a firm guarantee of Soviet cooperation in  securing a stable peace for Israel and her  neighbors. That would have been in the  best interest of Israel, the United States  and, in fact, a whole world clinging precariously to the hem of peace. For the  Soviets that would ba ve been an external  not an intemal initiative, thus properly  ",1975

I received a letter from Vice Ad miral Johri G. Finneran, USN, the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Man power and Reserve A1fairs-military per sonnel policy-commenting in general on  the Department's position, and I would  ask unanimous consent that the text ot  this letter be printed in the RECORD at this  point in my remarks.  ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,  Washington, D.C., October 3, 1974.  Hon. J. GLENN BEALL, Jr.,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR SENATOR BEALL: This is in response  to your referral o! September 18, 1974, con cernin~ a letter from Mr. Louis L. Goldstein,  Comptroller of the Treasury for the State of  Maryland, in which he seeks your support for  legislation to authorize the withholding of  state income tax from the pay of military  personnel.  The Department of Defense is not in a posi tion to readily comment on whether such a  proposal would be supported or opposed by  the Administration. Were such a proposal in troduced, it would receive every consideration  by the DoD, just as with any other legislative  proposal on which we are requested to com ment.  This Department accepts, as a responsibil ity, an obligtaion to generally make our mili tary members aware of possible state tax lia bilities. In March of this year, a renewed and  more vigorous information effort was under taken in this regard. Among other initiatives,  this effort will ensure that the subject of  state taxation will be fully covered on an  annually recurring basis.  As an observation, it should be pointed out  that  the withholding of state  income  tax  from military  pay would  not  likely  be  achieved with the relative ease envisioned by  your constituent. The number of military  personnel, the transitory nature of military  duty assignments, the differences in state tax  laws and the lack of total computerization  of military pay would complicate administra tion of such withholding and could result 1n  a considerable cost to the Services.  I trust this information will be of assist ance to you in preparing a response to Mr.  Goldstein.  Sincerely,  JOHN G. FINNERAN,  Vice Admiral, USN, Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense.  ",1975
87,Senate,94,0.257,1171,2,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, I  in troduce today a measure wl:ich would  set aside a  tract of approximately 480  acres of Federal land, now administered  by the Bureau of Land Management, to  be held in trust for the pueblo of Laguna,  N.Mex.

90,Senate,94,-0.396,1210,2,Mr. MOSS.," Mr. President, each year  the various committees of  the Senate  prepare analysis of  their forthcoming  activities and submit these to the Sen ate Committee on Rules and Adminis tration in support of their requests for  supplemental funds. In addition to the  detailed program which will be provided  to the Rules Committee by the Senate  Commerce Committee, I have prepared  a  conceptual analysis of  the program  which we will undertake in the Consum er Subcommittee, which I would like to  share with my colleagues.  The modern consumer movement took  root in the mid-1960's, an atnuent era,  and its overriding concerns were equity  in  the marketplace and  quality  and  safety of consumer goods and services.  Today, in the mid-1970's, the movement  reaches maturity in an era marked by  a time of corrosive inflation and unnerv ing recession. Yet its underlying objec tives remain as sound and as responsive  to the needs of our citizens as ever; per haps more so. For the counterpart of  . fairness and equity in the marketplace is  economic efficiency generated by  true  consumer  sovereignty  in securing  the  optimum purchasing power for the con sumer's dollar. More  than  ever  the  American  consumer must be  assured  that the purchasing power of his de flated dollar is not eroded by anticom petitive practices or structures, decep tive or predatory marketing techniques,  shoddy product and service quality or  inadequate or misleading production in formation.  At  the same time,  the advocates of  consumer reform must approach Govern ment  intervention in the marketplace  to  with an enhanced sensitivity to the need  for limiting fruitless burdens on already  hard-pressed industrial and commercial  organizations. We have always believed  that the Government's role in channel ing market forces for the benefit of con sumers is not only consistent with, but es sential to, a healthy economic structure.  Properly conceived consumer laws and  regulations are both proconsumer and  probusiness. At the same time, we re main unconvinced that the preservation  of  ine:mcient  businesses  and market  structures  unresponsive  consumer  needs are in the long term interests of  either  consumers or  a  vigorous  and  healthy economic system.  In setting our priorities for the 94th  Congress, we have sought  those goals  which give high promise of relief from  inflation. Thus, we have examined those  market forces which have driven up the  price of food by more than 30 percent  since January 1973 and have mapped  programs for stimulating and strength ening the FTC's activities in pursuing  anticompetitive structures and practices  in food-related industries. We will again  pursue our determination to rid the au tomobile insurance system of inefficien cies derived from the fault system which  returns consumers  less  than $0.50  for  every $1 of automobile  insurance pre mium they are forced to spend.  Having imposed standards on consu mer product warranties and guarantees  for the protection of consumers through  the Magnuson-Moss Act <Public Law  93-637), we will seek means of aiding  States in policing the quality and pricing  of repair services.  Finally, we will explore alternate cost saving mechanisms for the delivery of  consumer goods and services such as  strengthened  consumer  cooperatives.  Each of these consumer initiatives has  as its basis the belief that the strength ening of the market structure and com petition can only bring about a healthier  marketplace  and  greater  consumer  value.  The Motor Vehicle Information and  Cost Savings Act enacted in 1972 was  designed  to  channel  the  competitive  energies  of  the  automobile  industry  toward the economical design of auto mobiles which would be less of a drain  on the consumer's pocketbook through out  the  life cycle of  the automobile,  thereby reduce operating maintenance,  repair,  and property  insurance  costs.  This act will be closely reassessed .  One  theme of  the consumer move ment, reaching back to the anguish of  the Great Depression, has been the pur suit of strengthened systems for provid ing price and quality information to con sumers which can form  the basis  for  prudent purchasing decisions. Point of .  purchase disclosure of automobile and  appliance energy consumption costs and  product life cycle data; the developmen~  of meaningful product test information;  the requirement that the advertiser sub stantiate his product claims;  require ments for the disclosure of comparative  price  information  to  the consumer of  health services--each of  these efforts  will better enable the consumer to seek  value at an optimum price. We pledge  ourselves to do what can responsibly be  done to speed the flow of such critical  information  to consumers  in a  form  which can best be utilized.  IMPROVING CONSUMER REDRESS  The consumer who has purchased a  product which fails to work or has serv ice inefficiently performed is as victim ized in his pocketbook as the consumer  who is overcharged by monopoly pricing.  We must make certain that the aggrieved  consumer has access  to low-cost, con venient complaint settlement machinery  and that the careless or conscienceless  purveyor of goods and services is brought  to account. We will seek to improve the  quality of consumer redress through leg islation to strengthen small claims courts  and  informal dispute mechanisms  to  strengthen the enforcement tools of the  Federal Trade Commission and Depart ment of Justice against prevalent con sumer frauds and to provide access to  the courts where appropriate by groups  of consumers generically victimized, uti lizing the cost-spreading e:mciencies of  consumer class actions.  CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY  Our concern with strengthening the  purchasing power of the consumer in the  marketplace need not diminish our per sisting concern with the healthfulness  and safety of  the products marketed.  Strengthened governmental procedures  to enhance protection against food con tamination, auto and product safety, re-  duction of risks of hazards from new  technologies, and of new chemical sub stances need not entail greater design  costs. Rather, they are designed to en hance systems of engineering safety into.  the conception and design of products.  We are not sympathetic to industries  which meet general standards for safe  performance of products with needlessly  costly and unimaginative design fixes,  then turn to the Government to fix the  blame for their own lack of design in genuity.  Our concern over the health impact  of .the marketing system is not limited to  obvious physical dangers from hazardous  toys or poorly designed automobiles. We  are concerned, too, with the feared psy chological health consequences of mar keting techniques which may stimulate  such self-destructive behavior as nutri tional inadequacies or drug abuse. Nei ther the shrinking dollar nor economic  uncertainty should deflect us from per sisting in these goals.  IRS INFORMATION DISCLOSURE  PRACTICES  .  ",1975

It is outrageous that India is taking  such action against the state of Israel  whose government has taken no hostile  position toward India and has engaged  in no hostile action toward its govern~ ~ rl J "": n ) r1:  \  \. I.  Februa'ry 5, 1975  ment. On the contrary, countless num bers of Indian people are starving be cause of the high oil prices established  by Arab countries. But instead of con~  demning Arab policies, India grovels be fore Arab demands and refuses to allow  Israeli table tennis players to participate  in an international sports event.  The hypocrisy of the Indian Govern ment should disturb all people of good  will,  regardless  of  political  outlook.  India, after all, has invited the PLO to  participate in these games. Even more  disturbing  is  the fact that this exclu sion of Israel from international sports  is becoming part of an insidious pat tern.  It was evident at the V7orld University  Games in Moscow where anti-Semitism  was openly displayed toward the Israeli basketball team. From there it spread to  the Asian games with certain countries  refusing to compete against Israeli ath:..  letes, and then, a few weeks ago, with  the ouster from the Asian Soccer Feder ation of IsraeL The championship Rus  sian Army club withdrew from the Euro pean Club championships because they  would have to play an Israel! team on a  home-and-home basis.

95,House,94,0.169,15,6,Mr. RUPPE.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 25 and I wish to compliment all  those on  the committee and  the sub committee who worked so hard to bring  this legislation to the floor  today, it is  essentially good legislation and on bal ance, I strongly support it.  the  I might say at the present time  bill the House has before it was essen tially the conference report of the 93d  Congress. There have been some changes  to  over last year's version but the bill re mains essentially a  strong compromise  that will alter mining practices in the  Eastern mountains where decades of  abuse have left hundreds of thousands  of  acres useless  and will protect  the  West, but it will not stop the spread of  responsible coal mining in either of these  two settings.  There are some who would wish to stop  strip mining altogether but the fact is  that this country cannot atiord to take  that course of action. I would not go so  far as to say it would be a question of  suicide in terms of pressure on our energy  resources, but certainly it would be de bilitating  to say the leru;t to take that  course of action. Others would have us  do little to alter the current practices of  mining on mountain sides and even less  to assure that surface mining will not  harm our Western States. Most of us  have seen either personally or by way of  photographs the devastation which has  been  left by  irresponsible and uncon trolled strip mining. If nothing else it  was  these sights that provided the im petus for legislation such as H.R. 25. We  simply cannot allow  these practices  continue.  In my judgment H.R. 25 strikes a bal ance. It allows strip mining but only if  the land will have been reclaimed and  the eyesores of  the past are not per petuated or repeated and only if we can  insure that the mined land can continue  to serve man in a useful and beneficial  way.  We have tried to protect our precious  environment but in a way which will not  hinder either  the  immediate  require ments for energy needs or the require ments in the not too distant future.  Granted, we are consistently and con stantly seeking new forms of energy. In  my opinion, one of the most important  pieces of legislation which the Congress  passed during the past session was the  Energy Research and Development Act,  the very title of which implies that we  recognize that we must search for alter native sources of energy. We cannot as sume the scientists will be able to invent  or perfect new energy techniques tomor row or even in the next decade but we  must adequately meet our requirements.  Therefore we must assume we will need  the coal we have in the East and in the  West as well.  I would like now to address two points  of contention. One is raised by those who  would have us not regulate the practice  or at the most on a minimum basis.  Some have said that it is impossible to  reclaim land after it is stripped. Oh, they  say you can throw some  topsoil on it,  plant some grass, but it is never going to  resemble the same configuration or serve  a useful purpose. From my view, that is  simply not a true statement. During some  of my field trips to Ohio and Pennsyl vania  the Interior Committee saw re claimed lands-lands that had contour,  that were green,  that looked  like  they  belonged.  I personally  remember  talking  to a  farmer,  believe it was  in Ohio, who  stated his  farm was more productive  I  after reclamation and after mining than  prior to strip mining. For example, he  indicated  the water draining was  far  superior. We must also remember that  reclamation  techniques are constantly  being improved, so if what we have now  can do the job. reclamation will be even  better in a few years. I personally reject  arguments to the contrary as pure scare  tactics.  I also reject as scare tactics that en actment of this legislation will result in  substantial losses in terms of coal mined.  At this point, I will insert in the RECORD  a short chart I have prepared illustrat ing the effects of the Ohio and Pennsyl vania laws regulating strip mining:  COAL PRODUCTION  State and year  Ohio:  1971_------------------1972 ) __________________ _  1973.------------------1974.------------------Penni~~l~~i~ ~ _____ ---_______ _  1972 '------------------1973.------------------1974.------------------Number of  operators  Surface coal  production  (in million  tons)  267  271  207  377  584  677  830  846  38.5  34.6  29.6  30.6  28.5  26.5  30.2  42.0  J The law took effect in April1972. 1972 figures affected by a  1-month strike in January.  2 The law took effect in January 1972. 1972 figures affected by  a 1-month-long strike in January.  These figures show that, indeed, there  is an initial lapse in production. How ever,  it  should  be  pointed out  that  neither of these States' statutes provided  for an interim period, as does H.R. 25,  with  relatively  relaxed  environmental  standards and administrative procedures,  so  that the full  implementation could  be eased into. These figures do indicate  that production began to rise again after  the first year. If the 1972 figures seem  too low, perhaps it should be emphasized  that in that year there was a month long strike in the coal industry.  The figures also show an increase in  the number of coal operators. In Penn sylvania,  the year  before  enactment.  there were 583 operators. However,  in  1973,  the year after enactment,  there  were 830 operators, or almost a 50 per cent increase. My interpretation of these  figures is that coal surface mining laws  would  not  significantly hurt produc tion-that once the industry knows the  regulations and starts  to work  in ac cordance with  them,  production will  definitely and absolutely  rise. By  the  very fact that there has been a substan tial increase in the number of operators,  goes to show that the industry can live  with  the regulations and still make a  profit.  I can assure this House that these new  operators did not go  into the business  because they had nothing better to do.  I am sure the profit motive was very  much in their minds.  Also,  in terms of coal production,  would think that the present uncertainty  I  of the situation must have some effects  on present operations or  those which  are scheduled to begin in the immedi",1975
96,House,94,-0.147,28,6,Mr. FLOWERS.," Mr. Chairman, I am  going to support this bill, but I do so with  strong  reservations on possible conse quences. I believe the language in H.R.  25  pertaining  to  the  requirements  for  steep slopes is a good example of disre gard for the plight of the small opera tor and his employees as well as for the  ability of state regulatory agencies to ex ercise good judgment.  In 1973, 289.5 million tons of surface  mined coal was produced in the United  States. Of that total, 140 million tons48.4 percent-came from the Appalachia  states. Of the Appalachian production,  93.5 million  tons-66.8 percent-came  from mines with a slope angle of 15 de grees or more, and 69.3 million tons--49.5  percent-of Appalachian  surface pro duction came from mines of 20 degrees  or more. For  the Appalachian  region,  the larger total, 93.5 million tons  is in  jeopardy because of the provisions in sec tion 515 (d) (1).  It may be that the full 93 million tons  will not be lost, but certainly a substan tial portion could and will be lost. The  proponents of the bill will tell you oper ators will merely move to areas where  mining can be practiced, and I will tell  you that even if that is true, the first coal  produced will take 3 to 5 years. In these  times of ievere energy problems, the po tential lost tonnage is sufficient reason  enough to consider the effects of this bill,  ",1975

101,,94,-0.305,80,6,Mr. ZEFERETTI.," Mr. Speaker, even in  the best of economic times, the average  small business has a difficult time. In the  15th Congressional District,  there are  still many such small enterprises, often  run by families, who have few resources  backing them up in case of emergencies  or setbacks of one kind or another. Huge  enterprises, backed by chain manage ment and profits, can sustain virtually  any damage and stay in business. Small,  independent operators, such as still pro liferate in Bro'oklyn, live in dread of the  unexpected.  One of the most devastating blows to  any small business is property condem nation as a result of Federal action or  programs. In thousands of now familiar  instances, a Federal program or even  just a federally assisted undertaking will  suddenly loom 'over an established neigh borhood. Suddenly, Government officials  appear in the area, visit the small busi nessmen and women in the immediate  and what they say spells  the  doom of their long-established way of  life. Many of these neighborhoods have  been viable entities for generations, sur viving and enj'Oying the strength  lent  them by small enterprise. To the neigh borhood, a major project is at least a  shock. To the ""Ma and Pa"" store, it can  be a commercial death sentence.  How do you close down decades of liv ing and doing business with hundreds of  people Y'OU have come to know and re spect? What do you tell them? Where  will you go? How will you move? Will  the business survive the move, even if  you manage  to make  it successfully?  What happens to the people who depend  on these stores for essential goods, serv ices, and even S'ociallife? Too often these  human elements in the equation do not  enter into the calculations of the local  and Federal planners. Too often, businesses have been snuffed out for good,  even in the name of progress and despite  the best of intentions. And only in recent  years have these pe'ople and their unique  problems commanded any significant at tention. However, now their voices are at  last being heard, and some impact is be ing made on Federal plans.  One way to guarantee their survival is  to write into Federal law some protective  to  elements and guarantees for their viabil ity. One bill to do this has been intro duced, and I have joined in sponsorship  and support of its provisions. It will pro vide financial assistance to small busi nesses displaced by Federal and federally  assisted programs. As a Member of the  House Committee on Small Business, I  am delighted to say that the legislation  has been  referred  that committee  and early hearings and action may be  possible.  The bill authorizes  the payment of  grants or loans of up to $4,000 to enable  displaced small businesses  to  lease or  rent a suitable space for business for a  period not to exceed 4 years, or payments  of up to $4,000 with equal matching of  amounts over $2,000  to make a down  payment of some kind on purchase of  another suitable place of business. These  amendments to the Uniform Relocation  Assistance and Real Property Acquisition  Policies Act of 1970  extends  to small  businesses benefits now available under  that act to residential tenants displaced  by Federal or federally assisted projects.  This  legislation  follows  the  recom mendations of an  Inter-Agency Task  Force for Relocation Business Assistance  appointed last year by Abe Beame, mayor  of New York City, which has devoted sig nificant efforts to this problem. Various  New York City,  State,  and Federal  agency  representatives  served on  that  task force.  Such an undertaking makes unique  sense. Every time a major project wipes  out small businesses which cannot start  up again, our tax base is eroded and our  tax revenues accordingly drop still lower.  In New York City,  this  is a very ad vanced and serious problem.  The special hardships besetting indi viduals and businesses forced to relocate  due to condemnation of their property as  the result of Federal action have been  recognized only partially under existing  law. We are now in a period of quasi depression. Hundreds of  thousands of  people are losing their jobs every week.  It is senseless to allow Federal programs,  which can only grow in size and effect, to  continue to contribute to job destruction,  tax base erosion, and revenue lowering.  H.R. 2961  is an intelligent, reasonable  approach to aiding small businesses  to  help  themselves. The relatively modest  amounts of aid allowed under the bill  can make the difference for many be tween a  successful relocation and an other small business out of business; for  good.  LINCOLN QUOTATIONS?  HON. G. WILLIAM WHITEHURST  OF VIRGINIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, March 14, 1975  ",1975
102,,94,0.233,80,6,Mr. WHITEHURST.," Mr. Speaker, on  February 25, I  inserted in the RECORD  what I believed to be a series of quota tions from Lincoln that were authentic.  These were sent to me by a constituent  who provided them from the Emancipa tor, published by the Lincoln National  Life Insurance Co. This week I received  a letter from Dr. Arthur Schlesinger, who  advised me that the quotations are prop erly attributed to a Pennsylvania clergy man named William J. H. Boetcker, who  wrote them in 1916, over half a century  after Lincoln's death. Dr. Schlesinger  has cited other sources to reinforce his  case, and  in order  to set  the  record  straight, I ask that this be printed in the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD.  Certainly  the  words  actually uttered or written by  Abraham Lincoln are sufficiently memo rable without  quotations  from  other  sources, no matter what their intent.  H.R. 4481 WILL WORSEN INFLATION  HON. WILLIAM M. KETCHUM  OF CALIFORr-TIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, March 14, 1975  ",1975
103,,94,0.348,80,6,Mr. KETCHUM.," Mr. Speaker, when  the House passed H.R. 4481, the Emer gency Employment Appropriations Act,  it  took an  irresponsible step that can  only make our economic mess worse. I  do not quarrel with the stated intent of  this bill-to create  jobs, stimulate the  economy and eventually produce more  revenue  to balance a  bloated Federal  budget. The problem is that this bill will  produce none of these salutary goals, but  rather will worsen inflation, further de press the construction business, reduce  the amount of capital available to busi nesses, and create an intolerable amount  of deficit in the Treasury.  It is plainly false to believe that this  bill will cure unemployment. In the first  place, if the wildest dreams of its spon sors come true, only 1 percent of those  now jobless will be employed. Secondly.  we are not giving anyone meaningful,  full-time jobs. Take a  look at the kind  of  jobs  created-improving  picnic  grounds, patching up fish hatcheries, re pairing duck nests,  constructing out houses--do  these  represent  long-term  solutions to unemployment? Third, pub lic service  jobs are ridiculously expen sive: the price tag for these 900,000 jobs  is over $6 billion. Fourth, up to 65 per cent of all municipal public service jobs  are recalls-that is, local employees who  are terminated and then put back on the  Federal payroll in these leaf-raking jobs.  I can share with my colleagues a recent  example of this from my own district.  At the China Lake Naval Weapons Cen ter a reduction in force program seeks to  terminate 36 employees at the same time  that a  local public service program is  creating 28 jobs with Federal funds. This  is a lunatic way to solve unemployment!  The bill is literally a Christmas tree  filled with programs for which no need  has been established. For instance, we are  asked to spend $443 million to purchase  120,000 motor vehicles for the Federal  Governinent. This doubles the number  of cars  that the General Services Ad ministration now has. Does anyone sin cerely believe we need all these cars? I  get scores of letters from my constitu ents complaining about the already ex orbitant numbers of Government-owned  cars and  trucks, using up gallons and  ",1975
104,,94,-0.269,93,6,Mr. ANDERSON of California.," Mr.  Speaker, our educational system repre sents one of the most important factors  in America today. No other segment of  our society has such a direct bearing on  our hopes for the future, since it deals  with  the preparation of our youth  face the challenges the future represents.  The men and women who serve in our  educational  institutions are more than  mere employees. Administrators, secre taries, teachers, custodians-these people  are the very heart of the schools they  serve. Without them, there would be no  education for the leaders of tomorrow.  On April 10, 1975, the Torrance Uni fied School District of California will  hold a banquet in honor of 25 outstand ing employees who are  retiring after  many years of dedicated service.  Buildings,  classrooms,  books-these  are not the important aspects of a school  system. It is the men and women who  use them, along with the student, who  turn our educational  institutions  into  living, vibrant centers of human experience.  Those who work in our schools are not  drawn  to  them by visions of personal  6765  wealth or dreams of  renown.  Instead,  they are faced with the purpose of teach ing our children the knowledge they will  need when they are ready to assume their  responsibilities as  the next generation  of leaders.  The goal of an educator is not simply  to get students to memorize facts and  figures. Knowledge and wisdom go far  beyond  that. It is necessary  that our  educators do so in order to prepare to day's youth for the challenges ahead. Not  only must they be able to live within a  society, today's youth must have the de sire, incentive, and ability to make this  world a better place in which to live.  Mr. Speaker, this is why those of us  in government, as well as the public, owe  so much to educational personnel. Those  25  persons who  are  retiring  in my  district  personify  the  qualities  that  have made our educational system so  outstanding. Their  true reward  is not  only in the future;  their reward is the  future.  ~hen we think of schools, we usually  think of teachers. Certainly, the instruc tors in our classrooms perform a vital  function. They deserve our highest praise  and gratitude.  However, we often forget the adminis trators who keep the schools running. We  forget  the custodial and maintenance  staffs who see to the upkeep and develop ment of the buildings and facilities. The  secretaries and assistants who work in  almost all aspects of education rarely re ceive mention. Yet their jobs are also im portant  to education. They  too  along  with the instructors, deserve ou~ grati tude and recognition.  I would like to offer a word of thanks  to these men and women, who have given  so much of themselves to set our children  on the paths they must take in the fu ture.  Those  retiring are: Mrs. Clarine G.  Hamilton, Mrs. Pearl D. Hebert, Mrs.  Kathryn N. Widney, Dr. Harold S. Wid ney, Mrs. Rose Franklin, Mrs. June K.  Allen, Mr. Patrick K. McManus, Mr.  Joseph M. Stuart, Mr. Clyde A. Perdiew,  Mrs. Ada Belle D. Myers, Mr. Howard c.  Shoen, and Mrs. Lorene D. Shoup.  Also retiring are: Mr. Virgil U. Bau guess, Mr. Ray R. Arnett, Mr. Edmund F.  Curtis, Mrs. Bernice J. Lee, Mr. Salvatore  F. Grasso, Mr. Cecil H. Butts, Mr. Erwin  B. Jarrett, Mr. Edward W. Ford, Mrs.  Beulah Latham, Mr. Merlin M. Trepp,  Mr. Courtney R. Munsey, Mr. Charles A.  Newville, and Mr. Leonard L. Powell.  Mr. Speaker, the influence of these men  and women will never stop; it will con tinue to be felt in future generations.  The philosophical tenets of the Tor rance Unified School District state that Education is a dynamic, evolving relation ship with subject matter the means, man the  product, and society the result.  Because of the dedication of these in dividuals to that philosophy, we can look  to the future with great optimism and  hope.  For this our entire community, and the  Nation, is eternally grateful.

109,House,94,-0.496,132,6,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the last word, and I rise  in opposition to the amendment.  The gentleman  from Arizona  <Mr.  STEIGER)  was  complaining  about  the  rhetoric. Apparently it depends on who  is putting out the rhetoric, because we  have had mostly rhetoric on this amend ment, and I would like to put a few facts  in the RECORD.  The facts are, first of all, that there  will never be a  fuel adjustment clause  passthrough unless the price of coal to  the electric companies goes up. As I have  already stated, the price of coal has risen  from $4.62 a ton on an average in 1967 to  $15 a ton in 1974.  But let us take a look at the profits of  the coal companies. On page 7 5 of the  committee report there are some selected  profits from coal companies for the third  quarter of 1973 versus the third quarter  of 1974. Here the percentage changes.  Pittston had a percentage increase of  787  percent; Westmoreland Coal Co.  had  a  1,242  percent  increase; Con solidation Coal Co. had a  7,860 per cent  increase; and Island Creek Coal  Co. had a 3,690 percent increase.  Unless there is a conspiracy to restrain  trade in the coal industry, adding the  small additional cost of the reclamation  fee to the cost of producing coal, will not  increase the price. It will simply take a  little slice out of the profits of the coal  companies.  Therefore, we are not necessarily add ing one dime to  the cost  to the con sumer. We are merely producing a slight  windfall profits tax against these astro nomical profit  increases  that the coal  companies are experiencing now.  Mr. McDADE.

For example, on the  F-111, 12 aircraft were authorized at a  cost of $205 million. $72.2 million of that  has either been spent or obligated.  According  to the best estimates that  we could get, if we did not permit this  program to continue, we not only would  not get the 12 F-lll's, but the cost to  the Government would be $72.2 million  for contract termination and other costs.

117,,94,-0.444,353,6,Mr. STUDDS.," Mr. Speaker, on Monday  last, the Honorable WILLIAM J. HUGHES, a  colleague from New Jersey, appeared be fore the Merchant Marine and Fisheries'  Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife  Conservation and  the Environment  to  argue a strong case for the interim estab lishment of a 200-mile fishing limit off  our shores.  For those who were unable to be pres ent for Mr. HuGHES' presentation, I ask  unanimous consent to insert his prepared  remarks  in  full at  this point  in  the  RECORD:  TESTIMONY OF HON. WILLIAM J. HUGHES  Mr. Chairman, distinguished Members of  this Subcommittee:  When I appeared before this panel in field  hearings held last June in Toms River, New  Jersey, I remarked that if fortunate enough  to win election to Congress, I would make a  matter of priority the introduction of the  legislation we are considering here this morn mg.  The Interim Fisheries Zone Extension and  Management Act was among the first group  of bills I cosponsored. Needless to say, it gave  me a great deal of satisfaction to join my  colleague, Gerry Studds, in support of this  legislation.  But I am even more pleased today. This  subcommittee is moving with great dispatch,  and rightly so.  If we do not move decisively this year to  regain control of our fish resources off our  own coasts then we just might not have any  commercial fish stock worth saving when and  if an international accord is reached at some  future Law of the Sea Conference.  ""It sounds incredible to say it,"" to quote  John R. Stevenson, chief of last year's U.S.  Law of  the Sea delegation, ""but today we  have a completely lawless regime for 70 per cent of the globe. The necessity to reach a  result is overwhelming.""  But getting 140 or more nations to honor  a series of complex agreements of which fish ng is but one important consideration may  be more  than next week's conference  in  Geneva or any Law of the Sea Conference can  resolve in the foreseeable future.  So to the question: Can our domestic com mercial and recreational  fishing  industries  await an  international accord of doubtful  certainty? The answer is as obvious as the  scarcity of haddock off New England and  porgies off New Jersey.  THE VIEW FROM MY WINDOW  I live in Ocean City, New Jersey, in a home  which has a marvelous view of the Atlantic  Ocean. And seldom does a day go by when  a stream of foreign trawlers, processing ships  q,nd  refrigerated  transports fail  to pass in  ;rocession.  In ever-increasing number, foreign trawlers  .:ave  been methodically  decimating  fish  -~tock in both Atlantic and Paciflc waters.  It  is a mechanized flotilla of ptra.te ships.  They don't fish. They harvest, but without  regard to conservation.  Since the early sixties these floating fac tories from the Soviet Union, Poland, Japan  ~----444---Part6  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  and other nations have  raked our waters  scooping aboard everything  that  floats or  swims  including, not  rarely, an American  fisherman's nets or lobster pots.  What's too small to freeze or too strange  to filet is ground up for meal or fertilizer.  By contrast, the American ""fleet"" is actu ally  144,000  full and part-time  fishermen  who put to sea in 88,000 craft that range  from skiffs to trawlers, the largest of which  in Atlantic waters is still no match for their  foreign rivals.  American  fishermen were  simply unpre pared for  the competition of foreign  fleets  operating as sea-going warehouses and proc essing plants.  To cite but one example,  it wasn't ten  years ago that 120 million pounds of haddock  a year were being caught from the Georges  Bank of Cape Cod. But after Soviet flotillas  turned their nets to haddock, the catch of  New England fishermen plummeted to where  six years later only 11.7 million pounds was  brought ashore.  The irony, of course, is that the American  consumer continued to buy haddock. But  now it came imported and frozen, at prices  far less than our own fishermen could match.  The consequence of a depressed American  fishing fleet has been a necessity to import  today 70 percent of our fish products. This  added a  staggering $1.3 b111ion  to our bal ance of payments deficit last year.  This, in a nation whose seas teem with fish.  NEW  JERSEY FISHING--ON THE BRINK  In my youth, I can remember a bustling  fiShing port in Wildwood, New Jersey. It was  in fact, the second largest commercial fishing  harbor on the Atlantic Ocean.  Today  that distinction  is gone. We are  left with a near deserted harbor, a victim of  neglect and dwindling catches brought about  in large measure by overfishing.  I intend to do what I can to reopen Ottens  Harbor and revitalize the fleet there, in At lantic City, and along the entire Jersey coast.  It's essential  to  these seaside communities  where unemployment is at this moment ap proaching 25 percent in some counties.  We  in New Jersey can work on getting  the state and  the Corps of Engineers  to  dredge our harbors for the anticipated return  of fishing fleets. But very soon, we're going  to need the help of this Committee.  We're going  to need a  200-mile  fishing  limit off New Jersey  just as sorely as  the  cod fishermen need a. protective zone off New  England. We need the time that a  fishing  limit will bring in order to create a more  efficient domestic  fleet  to satisfy  the de mands of the U.S. market. In this way we  can put an end to the practice of buying  back from others what lies just off our shores.  Without a 200-mile limit and the protec tion it offers to our outmanned fishing fleet,  American fishing wlll continue its rapid de cline from its preeminent position of a gen eration ago. La.st year five nations recorded  larger catches, assisted by treaties that pro vided ready access to our coastal waters.  Less than a decade ago more than 270,000  metric tons of fish was hauled in by New  Jersey  fishermen.  Today  that  figure  has  dwindled to barely 100,000 metric tons.  Operating in many instances just beyond  the 12-mile  limit, vessels  from  the Soviet  Union, Poland, Japan, Romania and other  nations remove 800,000 metric tons of fish  from Cape Cod to Cape Hatteras each year.  Our domestic catch, meanwhile, has fallen  off to less than 200,000 metric tons.  And while most American fishermen are  limited by the size of their craft and facili ties for freezing day-to-day fishing, foreign  trawlers and  their crews operate day and  months on end.  Using  fine mesh nets which  comb  waters clean of all  living  things,  foreign  trawlers and  their crew operate day and  night  removing,  cleaning,  packaging  and  freezing  tons of fish around-the-clock.  the  7025  It has been estimated that as a direct result  of just this overfishing that the entire stock  of fish from Cape Cod to Cape Hatteras has  been depleted by two-thirds.  In just a decade haddock and porgies, the  latter once bountiful off the Jersey coast, are  now nearly extinct. Threatened species now  include mackerel, flounder, cod, shrimp, hali but, herring and yellowtail. Ben Callaway,  fishing  editor  for The Philadelphia Daily  News,  recently wrote  that  three years ago  foreign trawlers were removing 99.3 percent  of the mackerel, 87.5 percent of the herring,  90.1 percent of the red hake and 88.2 percent  of the silver hake, all in total disregard to  fish conservation.  TERRITORIAL LIMITS  Eight nations today claim territorial rights  of 200-miles while  two others--costa Rica  and Nicaraguar--claim  economic  rights  to  200 miles. Several of these nations--notably  Equador, Peru and Chile---have become no toriously  aggressive  in  enforcing 200-mile  fishing claims. Equador last month demanded  and got $3.5 mi111on for the release of seven  American tuna boat crews.  Yet while American fishermen are arrested  and hauled into port for fishing 140 miles off  Equador, we are permitting the depletion of  fish stock by foreign  trawlers far closer to  our shores  to  the  ruination of U.S.  com mercial and sport fishing.  This simply must stop.  I.C.N.A.F. TREATY  An interim 200-mile limit before the end  of this year is essential. But for it to be effec tive, the United States must announce this  June its intention to withdraw as a signa tory  to  the  International Commission  of  Northwest Atlantic Fisheries, effective in De cember, 1975.  We are linked by this treaty to the greatest  offenders of fish exploitation off our shores.  Not only has this treaty failed to achieve its  most important objective---the conservation  of fish resources-but threatens to severely  restrict the effectiveness of a 200-mile limit  to a handful of nations actively fishing At lantic waters.  IN CONCLUSION  This legislation has been properly termed  an  interim measure. The  long-range solu tion is to discourage rivalry among nations  by ratifying an international accord fixing  uniform  territorial  limits and a worldwide  plan for fish management and uses of the  sea by all nations.  But in the short term, if we are to shore  up the American fishing fleet, we need the  temporary protection of a 200-mile fishing  limit.  I would only ask that this subcommittee  consider, as several members have assured  me you shall, the addition of language that  would prevent overfishing by fleets whether  of foreign or domestic variety.  An  annual  scientific  determination  of  maximum  sustainable  yield  per  species  backed by quota  limitation  should meet  this objective.  As for enforcement, the U.S. Coast Guard  headquarters for the Atlantic region has ad vised me that it would take only a modest  five percent increase in their annual budget  to enforce  a  200-mile  limit. This  is  cer tainly  reasonable and  in our  interest  to  provide.  On a  final note, I am not one of those  who believes that the imposition of a  fish ing limit wlll make it more d11Hcult to reach  an international accord on territorial rights  and cooperative uses of the sea.  I believe that the reverse is true. It's going  to take forceful unnateral action by major  countries such as the United States to pro vide tmpetull to reach an international agree ment. At present there appears to be no ur gency among na tlons  to consider  the set tlement of these issues. We can look forward  to protracted negotiations and nation-by",1975

I will not belabor my colleagues by  a  further  recitation of  the merits of  the legislation. When both plans were  originally passed there was some ques tion  raised  concerning  the  true via bility and benefit of the programs but  think the experiences we have gained  from the plans have proven their merit,  and certainly justify the extension that  is sought by the existing legislation.

120,House,94,-0.469,366,6,Mr. BARRETT.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in  support of H.R. 2783, a bill to extend the  urban riot reinsurance program and the  Federal crime insurance program for an  additional 4 years from April 30, 1975, to  April 30, 1979. Under existing law, the  authority of  the Secretary of HUD to  provide new riot reinsurance and crime  insurance coverages will  terminate on  April 30, 1975. It is important that the  Congress act promptly to provide con tinuation of these two important feder ally assisted  insurance programs. The  gentleman from IDinois <Mr. ANNUNzio),  the sponsor of H.R. 2783 and the chief  architect of these two valuable insurance  programs, is  to be commended for his  action and his persistence in seeing that  these two  insurance programs are ex  tended.  The urban riot reinsurance program  was established in the Housing and Ur ban Development Act of 1968, Public Law  90-448. Under the so-called FAIR-fair  access to insurance requirements-plan  system the Federal Government agrees  to reinsure insurance companies for riot inflicted  losses provided  the  insurance  companies write fire insurance and ex tend coverage to homeowners and busi nesses who are unable to obtain cover age through normal commercial chan nels. This program operates in 26 states  and the District of Columbia and Puerto  Rico. They are: California, Connecticut,  Delaware,  Georgia,  IDinois,  Indiana,  Iowa,  Kansas,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Maryland,  Massachusetts,  Michigan,  Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New  York, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio,  Oregon,  Pennsylvania, Rhode  Island,  Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.

121,House,94,-0.391,405,6,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  has  renewed his request for  funds  begin production of the new binary nerve  gas system. Chairman Brown stated the  Department  of Defense  position  on  chemical warfare  during  his  recent  statement on the U.S. military posture  for fiscal year 1976.  The proposal to begin production of  the binary chemical weapon was the sub ject of considerable debate in the last  Congress. The Congress  adopted  an  amendment to the military procurement  appropriations bill which deleted  the  Defense request for similar funds in the  fiscal year 1975 budget.  I am interested in our chemical war fare program, as I know many of you  are, and have many questions regarding  the Chairman's statement. I have writ ten General Brown, and so  that  the  Members may be aware of this request  and the important issues involved, I am  inserting the text of this letter in the  RECORD.  I have also inserted in the RECORD a  copy of that portion of the general's mili tary posture statement which pertains to  his chemical warfare proposals.  The letter and General Brown's pos ture statement follow:  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, D.C., March 11, 1975.  Gen. GEORGE S. BROWN, USAF,  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, De partment of Defense,  the  Pentagon,  Washington, D.C.  rea.1lze  DEAR GENERAL BROWN: One of the first is sues to arouse my interest when  began my  duties with the 94th Congress was the pro posed milltary procurement of the binary  chemical munition. Perhaps this is because  I was already fa.m.1lla.r with other aspects of  chemical warfare controversies in the recent  past. I had assumed, from all of the news an nouncements concerning  the problems of  chemioaJ. wea1p0ns disposal, the recent Presi dential signing of the Geneva Prortocal, and  similar developments, that we had stabilized  this controversy, at least for the time being.  I was somewhat surprised, therefore, to learn  upon examining your recent statement on  the United States Military Posture for FY  1976,  that instead the Department of De fense actually was continuing to propose a  complete renov81tion of our chemical wa.rfa.re  stockpiles.  I  thMi the proposals discussed 1n  your st81tement refer to only relartlvely minor  lnltlaJ. procurement of facillties, but it 1s ob vious that should this binary concept be ap proved by  the Congress,  the procurement  would soon become a multlmllllon dollar  program. In fact, in yom same statement, you  emph1slze that the Navy and Air Force are  already pla.nning to initiate procurement of  binarles by oompleting engineering develop ment of a binary bomb. For this reason, it  would be very helpful to me and to other in terested Members if you would be so kind as  to provide us with some additional informa tion with regard to your recent comments.  (1) You mention in your statm.ent on page  114 that ""Since World Wa.r I, toxic chemicals  have been used only a.galnst forces unable  to defend against them or to retaliate in  kind"". One obvious implication of this re mark is to support a case for the mainte nance of a U.S. retaliatory capability in order  to prevent the use of such weapons against  U.S. forces.  Questions. Isn't it true, however that the  use of chemical weapons during World War J  continued even after both sides had  the  capab111ty  to use  and did use  chemical  we81pons against each other? Or did the use  of chemical weapons cease promptly once  each side secured the capa.blllty to retALUate  in kind?  Isn't it also true that, in those instances of  the use of chemical weapons since World  War I, the nations attacked lacked nuclear  weapons, modern well-equipped armies, and  slmllar accoutrements of modern warfare?  If so, how can we be so certain that it was  the absence of a chemical warfare retaliatory  capab111ty that made these post World War I  uses of chemical weapons a compelling ad vantage to the attacking nation? Further, in  each of those instances, was the use of chem ical warfare weapons a  decisive  factor  in  winning the wars or battles involved  (and  this could include our own use of tear gas  and herbicides in Vietnam)?  (2) Beginning on page 117 of your state ment, you point out that the forces with a  poor defensive capab111ty would be particu larly vulnerable  to a  chemical attack and  that this might require the use of a nuclear  response if a chemical response could not be  effectively initiated. You cite what appears  to be an  intelligence estimate which de scribes a strong Soviet defensive capab111ty.  You also describe what can only be inter preted as a reasonably certain estimate of a  very strong Soviet offensive chemical weap ons ca.pabllity.  Questions. As  I  examined  these pages,  I  was reminded that an essentially identical  estimate of Soviet capabllities was discussed  ",1975
122,Senate,94,-0.439,444,6,Mr. MONDALE.," Mr. President, Sena tors CLARK, HUMPHREY, and SCHWEIKER,  and I are today reintroducing the Rural  Rail Preservation and Improvement Act,  a bill which we  introduced in the 93d  Congress  to preserve and upgrade  the  quality of rail services to rural America.  During the debate on the Rail Serv ices Act of 1973, Senator HuMPHREY and  I proposed the essence of this legislation  in the form of two floor amendments to  that bill. These amendments were de signed to expand the protections against  precipitous  railroad  abandonment  communities located outside the North east rail corridor. The first amendment  mandated a comprehensive study of the  impact of branch line abandonments on  our Nation's economic, social and en vironmental requirements, and it author ized Federal assistance to continue serv ices  along  essential  lines  that would  otherwise be discontinued. Our second  amendment would have placed a 2-year  moratorium on railroad abandonment..s  outside  the northeast  region, pending  completion of the study and the imple mentation of State and local programs to  utilize Federal rail service continuation  grants. These amendments were adopted  by the Senate, but unfortunately, they  were dropped from the bill during conference committee.  to  ",1975
123,Senate,94,-0.311,496,6,Mr. TUNNEY.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased today to join several of my col leagues as a cosponsor of S. 662, the Na tional Mass Transportation Assistance  Act Amendments of 1975. This measure  will go a long way to insure the handi capped and elderly equal access to mass  transit  facilities  and vehicles  around  this Nation.  Today, our public transportation sys tems are designed with little attention  to the special needs of the handicapped.  Obstacles--small  things such as steps  and  turnstiles which  the more  able bodied person passes without notice pose impassable barriers to handicapped  persons.  The  handicapped  possess  valuable  training and skills. They have both an  ability and a desire to learn. Yet sense less obstacles prevent many from taking  full advantage of the economic oppor tunities of our society. For the Nation  as a whole, this is a waste of a valuable  resource. For the individual. influenced  by a society which holds productivity ac tivity and personal autonomy  the  highest esteem, it can mean a  life of  despair and self -criticism, and for  the  elderly, often a  sense of  total worth lessness.  Perhaps even more tragic, while  the  handicapped have the same needs as all  of us for social and personal relation ships, needless travel barriers cut off a  handicapped person  from  friends  and  relatives, plunging him  into a  life of  loneliness.  An Urban Mass Transportation Ad ministration study found that an esti mated 13,370,000 handicapped Americans  experience difficulties in using mass tran sit systems. This is more than the comin  bined populations  of America's  three  largest cities: New York, Chicago, and  Los Angeles. Of these 13,370,000 persons,  an estimated 5.3 million are unable to  use mass  transit at all-though  they  would be able to use it if transit facilities  were modified and improved to accom modate them. Among the 5.3 million are  1.2 million  arthritics  needing wheel chairs, most of the half million Ameri cans who are victims of cerebral palsy,  66,000 paraplegics, 34,000 quadraplegics,  and many of our 2 million hemiplegics.  It is unconscionable for Congress to  use Federal funds to build yet more tran sit systems which segregate the handi capped and elderly.  We have made some progress. In 1970,  Congress  recognized  the rights of  the  handicapped by enacting section 16 of  the Urban Mass Transit Act whi-ch de clared that it is:  National policy  that elderly and handi capped persons have the same right as other  persons to utilize mass transportation faclli ties and services.  In 1973, by passing the Federal-Aid  Highway Act, Congress took a further  step by requiring that mass transit proj ects funded with moneys from Federal aid highway projects ""shall be planned  and designed so th&.t mass transportation  facilities and services can effectively be  utilized  by  elderly  and  handicapped  persons.""  Yet, there is still no uniform provision  making a similar requirement of other  transportation projects  funded by  the  Federal Government. Last year, I intro duced S. 3648 which would have insured  that transportation facilities built and  rolling  stock purchased with Federal  UMTA funds would be designed and con structed to be accessible to the physically  handicapped and elderly. The bill would  have gradually phased in mass transit  facilities and vehicles which are accessi ble, culminating in the requirement that  when transbus becomes available on the  open market, all bus transit must be fully  accessible to the elderly and handicapped.  Regrettably, Congress was not able  to  act decisively on this proposal.  This year, however,  two major reaf firmations of Congress commitment to  develop equal access to our mass tran sit facilities have already been heard.  I was pleased to cosponsor Senator RAN DOLPH's resolution calling for a barrier free public  transportation system, and  am delighted today, to join as a cospon sor of Senator WILLIAMs' bill.  This legislation mandates immediate  action. It clearly mitigates against the  development of  ""separate but  equal""  systems as a substitute for making new  systems for the general public accessible  to  the handicapped. Effective  immedi ately,  all vehicles,  buildings,  stations,  and other str:Ictures for rapid rail sys tem.,, feeder systems, and other vehicles  integrated with such systems must be  accessible  to  the  elderly  and handi capped. Further, local advisory commit tees--of whic:l. half  the members are  handicapped and/ or elderly persons are  to be established  immediately  draw up local compliance timetables for  all mass  transit  facilities  to  become  equally accessible.

Certainly the support of  this dis tin guished and influential group is vitally  important, and because of the interest  of my  colleagues  and  the American  people  in this most important matter,  I place in the RECORD an article by Re porter Nat Caldwell  in  the Nashville,  Tenn., Tennessean:  RIVER GROUP BACKS N-PLANT AT HARTSVILLE  (By Nat Caldwell)  The Tennessee River Valley Association  yesterday approved TV A's Hartsville nuclear  plant, in particular, and TVA's program for  building 17 nuclear plants, in general.  The  association,  a  valleywide  business,  civic, and power distributors' group, whose  chief goal is industrial development, held its  quarterly meeting here yesterday and Mon day.  The pro-Hartsville nuclear plant resolution  was sponsored by  two electric cooperative  managers, Charles Stewart, Bowling Green,  Ky., and Louis Wise, Columbus, Miss.  Because several supporters of their posi tion and several who urged caution in the  nuclear  advance  sought  an  amendment  urging a speed up in coal research and en couragement of  coal mine expansion,  the  sponsors agreed to leave a.  final drafting of  both positions t-o the association's executive  committee.  7311  AI Smith, Russellville, Ky., publisher, and  Ralph Minor, Virginia cooperative manager,  both urged that expedited research on coal  gasification, liquefaction, and MHD be speed ed up to offer alternatives to nuclear power.  On Monday night, John Seigenthaler, pub lisher of  the Tennessean, had warned  the  group that all the answers on nuclear power  are not in yet. He said:  ""I am not yet satisfied with all of the an swers that the TV A board has offered to ques tions raised by some nuclear scientists as to  the safety of  radioactive waste materials,  transportation of nuclear fuels, or the pros pects of a so-called class nine accident.""  The publisher said that ""this does not mean  that there are answers to be found ... the  developing technology may provide adequate  answers.""  Seigenthaler continued:  ""As a  representative of the press, this is  one area where I intend to continue toques tion  .  .  . because the destructive power of  nuclear energy is well known ... just as its  constructive uses may be boundless.""  The  association  president, Tom Green,  president of  the Third National Bank of  Nashville,  said  that he considered  that from now on-the group's chief goal should  be developing the Tennessee Valley into the  energy capital of the United States.  Green  insisted  that  the odds  ""are very  good that the people and their institutions  are capable of achieving this goal, if they wm  get in step and work toward it.""  ""SPffiiT OF '76""  HON. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 18, 1975  ",1975
132,,94,0.043,639,6,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, recently I  was pleased to have conducted a contest  for high school seniors in the 26th Dis trict of New York on the subject of the  ""Spirit of '76"" and what it means to them  as citizens.  Because of the intense feeling of pride  that these essays exhibit for accomplish ments of our Nation in the 200 years since  our Nation was founded, it is my privi lege to submit for the review of my col leagues, three essays which won honor able mention in the contest. These essays  were written by Calvin Mendelsohn of  the senior class of Nanuet Senior High  School, Nanuet, N.Y.; Kerry Ann Metzler  of the senior class of Marlboro Central  High School, Marlboro, N.Y.; and David  Ehrman of  the senior class of Suffern  High School, Suffern, N.Y. The essays  follow:  OUR NATION'S BICENTENNIAL  (By Calvin Mendelsohn)  Ten score years ago,  the founders of our  land wrested power from their colonial rulers  through revolution. The principal aim of this  revolution was to establish a working democ racy in which the average citizen could exist  with minimal interference from the govern ment. To  insure  this,  freedoms  of press,  speech, and  religion were assimilated  into  our government in the Bill of Rights.  Those freedoms guaranteed above served as  an impetus for immigrants to flock  to our  shores. Those who came valued personal free dom over the realities of an immobile hier archy in Europe. They strove hard  to pre serve that freedom which we hold so dear by  bearing hardships such a.s climatic extremes.  crop failures, and economic hard times.  And our democracy flourished.

133,,94,0.241,665,6,Mr. BURKE of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  almost 57 years have passed since the  end of  the First World War. Of  the  4,744,000 U.S. participants it is estimated  that only a million are still living. Even  so the average age of surviving World  War I veterans is more than 80 years.  I have previously introduced two sepa rate bills urging that these veterans be  given a pension. One of my previous bills  would have established a new general  service pension for World War I veter ans. The other previous bill would have  amended the existing Veterans' Admin istration program which has long been  in force for Spanish-American War vet erans and  their survivors. Frankly,  I  would be happy with passage of either  bill. The result would be  the same-a  pension would be given to World War I  veterans. However, I personally favor set ting up a new program for World War I  veterans. They are a unique part of our  past and they deserve unique treatment.  The program for the Spanish-American  War veterans will probably  fit  them  about the same way the styles of 1917  would fit 1975 people. That is they would  be serviceable but highly uncomfortable.  The Committee on Veterans' Affairs  has traditionally had reservations about  an unrestricted pension for World War I  veterans and their dependents, and has  resisted strong support from many Mem bers of Congress for such a program. Vet erans of every war prior to World War I  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  have been awarded an unrestricted pen sion, and I believe World War I veterans,  at an average age of 80 years deserve a  pension.  In 1917, President Wilson called the  young men of the United States into the  bloodiest war in human history; 81,000  men did not return. Many came back in jured. It is  too late to repay most for  their service to our country, but we can  still do something for those still with us  today.  It is my sincere hope that the 94th  Congress will enact a pension for World  War I veterans, and hence I am today,  reintroducing legislation which I spon sored in previous Congresses to provide  for this much-needed income to  these  very special senior citizens.  100 MEMBERS SUPPORT OPEN  HOUSE REFORMS  HON.

The danger  in not passing  this biD  is the continued depletion of the number  of small farms in Pennsylvania and the  United States.  It is essential for the long-range future  of our agriculture  industry  to have a  floor which will stabilize this essential  industry and help  to keep  the small  farmer in business.  In the long range this is a consumer  bill.  I  yield  to  the  <Mr.  ",1975
139,House,94,-0.153,704,6,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California <Mr. KREBs).  I see no need to encourage farmers to  increase their cotton acreage when there  is an 11-month surplus. By setting tar get prices at 45 cents and the loan rate  at 38 cents, we will  insure a sufficient  cotton supply while enabling some cotton  lands to be freed for other needed agri cultural products. We must not encour age  farmers  to grow cotton simply  to  meet the loan level instead of the mar ket.  Mr. Chairman, I do intend, however,  to support the remainder of H.R. 4296  as is. I do not have to look very far to see  dairy farmers struggling to keep in busi ness. In my native Salem County and  adjoining  Cumberland  County  dairy  farmers cannot afford feed, while at the  same time they cannot afford to sell out  due to the low prices they would receive  for  their dairy cows on the butcher's  block.  America must look to the long haul:  We must encourage farmers to produce.  Last year, farm products accounted for  $21 billion of exports-to help pay for  such imports as overpriced Arab on.  No longer are we independent of the  Arab shiekdoms for oil. To allow for for eign dependence on agricultural prod ucts would constitute irresponsibility of  the gre81test magnitude. As we  have  learned from the oil experience, such de pendence is prohibitively costly-in the  long run-to the consumer. Shortsight edness today will result in a terrible de pendence and increased prices for every one tomorrow.  So, Mr. Chairman, my concern for the  farmer and the consumer prompts me to  support the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California-to discour age production where supply is already  excessive-while  favoring  the  remain der of H.R. 4296 which will insure food  supplies by dependable domestic pro ducers. It is high time that we started  planning ahead in agriculture and other  fields, instead of simply reacting to crisis  situations.  ",1975

However,  I would like to say that I am supporting  this amendment not on the basis that  this is a gopd amendment, but that it is  a better situation than we have in the  existing bill.  When  the Members  vote  for  this  amendment, which I hope they will, and  I hope  they will carry  this point and  have to recognize that potentially they  are voting a cost this year of several hun dred million dollars-do not be misled  that this is not going to cost anything  because unless the market falls dramati cally, it will cost a great deal.  However, although  I  am supporting  the amendment, I  received a call  this  morning from some people involved In  the export of cotton, where obviously a  good deal of our market lies, and they  pleaded with me not  to support any  amendment here, but  to really defeat  this bill, because this amendment, they  feel, as well as the bill itself, will remove  cotton as a  competitive force  for  the  United  States  in  the  international  market.  However, I do want to say that I will  support  the amendment.  hope when  we have finished the various amending  processes, which are going to go on for  some  time  today, when every Member  gets a look at what is happening to this  bill  and  recognizes  that without  the  amendments  that are going  to be of fered, that this committee really means  I  to have the bill, again perhaps the Mem bers will vote against the entire bill.

144,House,94,-0.134,717,6,Mr. BOWEN.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to point  out to the members of this committee  that we labored very long and arduously  in order to arrive at a fair compromise  in terms of a figure which we felt would  be defensible and would insure adequate  cotton production and adequate carry overs for the possibility that we might  find ourselves  in an upturn from  this  recession, and might very badly need the  additional cotton production.  We had 3 days of  testimony,  and  no producer in the Nation came forth to  indicate  that he wanted a  loan  level  lower  than that which  the committee  recommended, namely 40 cents. We feel  that in terms of the spread between the  loan level which the committee has rec ommended and the target price that we  have given maximum protection to the  taxpayer, the actual differential between  these in terms of cost is only about 5  cents spread, r~ther than 8 cents spread  between loan and target. We feel that the  compromise  is one which certainly  is  not satisfactory to everyone. There are  those who wanted much more protec tion. We have discovered since we did  report this bill out that there are some  cotton growers who would like to have  less of a loan than this and less of a tar get level than this. But, I feel we have  arrived at a fair and balanced figure.  Certainly, the present law is totally in adequate. There is no escalator in the  present legislation at all, and the target  price level under the 1973 law is 38 cents.  When we consider the fact that the De partment of Agriculture has predicted a  cost of production of about 50 cents a  pound during this coming year, I think  the Members can see that the target price  is totally inadequate, and the loan level  announced by the Department of 34.27  cents is also inadequate. We should ac cept the fact that the present law is com pletely inadequate. I would certainly ac cept the fact  that the amendment by  the  gentleman  from California  <Mr.  KREBS)  is a decided step forward from  the present law, but I do feel the com mittee position should be supported. It  passed the full committee by a vote of  25 to 15. I certainly intend to support it,  and I hope the Members will do so also.  ",1975

166,Senate,94,0.322,834,6,Mr. DOLE.,"  I agree with the distin guished Senator from Louisiana if any body has any amendments, whether they  want to go to their office here or in their  home State, if they want to do that and  bring them back before we have a vote  on  this particular amendment. To  the  Senator from Kansas, it seems that the  issue, as stated earlier, is whether or not  we are going to tend to make this a wel fare program or whether we are going to  face up to it realistically in the Senate  Finance Committee and in the Congress.  I do not question the motives or the  objective of  the distinguished Senator  from Rhode Island, but it seems to me  we have now had about a week of hear -ings in the Senate Finance Committee;  we had a full day and a half of markups;  we have been on the Senate floor for 2  days, and we have yet to get to a tax cut  amendment. I wonder how the American  people must feel as they witness what is  now happening in the Senate with ref erence to tax-cut legislation because of  not just the oil amendments, not  just  what we have done to the oil industry,  but what we have done to a great indus try. I am talking about the independent  oil industry which is about to be taken,  I would guess within the next 24 hours.  In the meantime, if we are going to  start offering amendments that  have  really no relevance to tax cuts, then I  think perhaps we ought to open the bill  up and add a welfare provision, add a  provision for veterans, add a raise for the  military personnel. They are suffering  from inflation. Everyone who is on the  Federal payroll ought to receive an in crease of whatever it is-8.7 percent. I  do not believe we should leave anyone  out, if we want to help America and help  stimulate  the economy.  I would guess  there are probably amendments being  drafted now to include the military, those  on welfare, those in our offices, those in  other Federal offices. If that is the intent, we can probably wrap this bill up  within the next month or two.  ",1975
167,Senate,94,-0.333,873,6,Mr. STEVENSON.," Mr. President, be fore the Nation can settle upon a foreign  policy geared to its interests in the world  and to the realities of a new era, it must  realize that it has no foreign policy little except habit, impulse, and the ad ventures of its Secretary of State to guide  the conduct of its affairs everywhere in  this interdependent and restless world.  That point about the absence of prin ciple and purpose to guide and inform  our discussion of foreign policy, and its  formulation,  is made in an article en titled ""Is This  a Foreign Policy"" by  David Edwards  the March 8  issue  of the Nation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent  that this article be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  in  THE FmEFIGHTER's DETENTE: Is THis A FoR EIGN POLICY?  (By David V. Edwards)  The United States desperately needs a for eign policy--not a new foreign policy, a for eign policy. The recent brouhaha over the  possible use of force in the Middle East to  guarantee oil for the West, the fascination  with Henry Kissinger's  inner  drives,  the  rush to condemn or defend our meddling in  Allende's Chile,  the moral exhaustion over  our role in Indochina that seems unending- all  these media phenomena  and  cocktail  circuit  topics  seem  to have prevented us  from  realizing  that  the United States no  longer has a foreign policy.  In recent years,  there has been growing  criticism of American foreign policy--as if  we had one. It is not, as some say,  that  American policy  is bankrupt--there are no  real assets  left at all, but only  liabilities  masquerading as pieces of policy.  The responsibility lies first, of course, with  the Secretary of State. But the important  thing  is not, as growing numbers suspect  and as Richard Nixon  is now reported by  Charles Colson  to have said  in 1973,  that  Kissinger ""really is unstable at times."" The  important thing is that, despite a stunning  array of books produced before he took of fice and the ""State of the World""  reports  he wrote for several years  thereafter, Kis singer is a man singularly without the tem perament and imagination required to de velop a policy sufficiently comprehensive and  venturesome to restore to America a world  role commensurate with  its  resources and  with the deep concerns of its people. Kis singer is essentially a fireman, unfortunate ly put in total charge not only of fire fight ing but also of fire prevention, law and order,  public welfare and the exchequer.  This understood, it is not surprising that  the Nixon-Kissinger-Ford ""policy"" of ""a gen eration of peace"" consists almost entirely of  periodic  pronouncements,  exclusive  inter views,  jet-powered fire-fighting expeditions  to  the Middle East, hastily drafted arms  ""control"" aides-memoires subject to no re assuring interpretation, and high-level inter continental visitation. The only thing miss ing from this panoply is policy. Some have  in the past celebrated American improvisa tion  as pragmatic, undogmatic, unideologi cal and constructive, arguing that the nature,  the national character, of the United States  is such that it couldn't or shouldn't, have a  general, over-arching policy. But that view,  popular though it bas been, is a misreading  of American history from  the days of  the  founding  fathers,  as well  as  a misunder standing of the requirements of the emerg ing world situation and a misperception of  the concerns of the American people.  Just as  the founding fathers had a  for eign  policy  of  avoiding  ""entangling  alli ances,"" so that the New World could develop  its strength and set a moral example for  corrupt old Europe,  so  the fathers of  the  cold war  in America.--such bold and  im aginative men as Marshall, Forrestal, Ache son and Dulles--developed a policy of en tangling  alliances  to encircle any and all  Communist states and to organize military  resistance to changes in the status quo that  might threaten the safety and prosperity of  American capitalism around the world. How ever misguided all of  those  involved may  now seem  to many of us, there can be no  doubt  that America had and sustained a  viable  foreign policy  in  those years--with  considerable  assistance  from  the Kremlin  and the domestic subversion hunters.  The  cold war was  socially  created  and  maintained by  the United States and  the  Soviet Union, sometimes through cooperative  intransigence, at other times through inad vertence. But the usefulness of the cold war  to the superpowe!""s for reasons of domestic  politics and economic  interests eventually  waned, and  the emergence of  independent  Third World countries, destined  to entice  close-range  superpower  confrontation  and  ultimately  nuclear  proliferation,  under mined  the  shared American-Soviet world  view that was the keystone of the cold war.  And so the cold war crumbled.  With  it  degenerated American  foreign  policy. But both pundits and policy makers  were slow to notice this. for the appearance  of policy survived the disappearance of the  cold war, primarily for  two important rea sons.  First, American policy had long since taken  on a territorial focus. What had originated as  end-goals  or  process-goals -primarily  ",1975
168,,94,0.213,925,6,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. Speaker, we have  all been concerned with creating an en ergy independent America. But have we  ever concentrated our efforts in creating  a mineral-independent America? That  was  the subject of an editorial in the  Brookings Register of February 25, 1975.  I would like to submit that editorial for  publication  in  the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD.  The Brookings Register is published 5  days a week in Brookings, S. Dak., a city  of some 13,000 persons in east central  South Dakota. The newspaper has a cir culation of 4,200.  In this specific editorial, it was pointed  out that the Nation may face a future  crisis in its mineral supply unless new  research efforts are undertaken. And it  warns that some minerals are already in  short supply, with resources almost de pleted. It raises some serious questions  about the mineral situation in the United  States.  I would  like  to  share  these  thoughts and questions with my fellow  Congressmen. The editorial follows:  Too LATE To STOP MINERAL SHORTAGE?  What is there about oil that has given rise  to almost universal agreement among Amer icans that this country must eventually be come totally independent of foreign sources  for its energy needs?  The United States is now, and for years  has been, importing most of the raw mate rials required by modern industry and tech nology. Yet no one says we must become  bauxite-independent  or  chromium-inde pendent or this-or-that-independent.  A little-noted report by the U.S. Geological  Survey last year predicted that the nation  may face future crises in the supply of some  of its important minerals unless massive reEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to develop  search  efforts are begun soon  domestic resources.  But while there is a substantial undevel oped potential for some of these minerals,  the report also warned that others are seri ously depleted or nonexistent. A couple of  examples:  Zinc. In 1972, the United States imported  about 52 per cent of its Zinc consumption,  chiefly from Canada, Mexico, Peru and Aus tralia. U.S. reserves are put at about 30 mil lion short tons.  Identified resources of zinc are estimated  at more than 80 million t<>ns but are mostly  in  subeconomic  low-grade  or  deep-lying  deposits.  Chromium. The United States  imported  100 per cent of its consumption of this es sential mineral  in 1972, mainly from  the  Soviet Union, the Republic of South Africa  and Turkey. The U.S. has no  reserves of  chromium.  Identified domestic resources of chromium  amount to only about 1.67 mlllion short tons  and again  they would be ditllcult  to mine  and expensive to use.  Survey scientists noted that while the na ture and  implications of the energy prob lem virtually exploded into public conscious ness,  concern  about our mineral  supply  remained, for the most part, within the pro fessional and technical communities.  ""Whatever the reasons for this-perhaps  one  is  the fact  that energy problems are  more  immediate and affect people in more  direct manner-the  supply  problem  for  minerals may become just as serious as it is  for energy,"" they said.  HOW  INFLATION BREEDS RECES SION  HON. LARRY McDONALD  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 18, 1975  Mr. McDONALD  of Georgia. Mr.  Speaker, although we are in the middle  of an economic recession brought about  by the inflationary policies of the Fed eral Government, we are being told that  the only way out is to embark on a new  even bigger debasement of our currency.  Economically, this is nonsense. Politi cally, it makes sense  to a certain type  of politician: One whose lust for power  is  exceeded  only by  the microscopic  range of his mental awareness. He got  into power by promising bigger and big ger Government handouts, has stayed in  power by doing just what he promised  while not ostensively raising taxes, but  has gotten a bit of a fright by the effects  of his inflation-produced recession. So he  proposes huge tax cuts and budget defi cits that will spur inflation anew: But so  what he figures, anything to get us out  of the recession and boost employment.  But what he is unable or unwilling to  acknowledge is that the recession is are sult of his own policies and that if he  is concerned over an unemployment rate  of 8 percent, wait until his chickens  hatched by the fiscal 1976 budget deficit  come home to roost.  How and why inflation breeds reces sion is clearly and precisely outlined in  the  following  essay by Henry Hazlitt,  which appeared in the March 1975 issue  of the Freeman:  7597  adopt  HOW INFLATION BREEDS RECESSION  (By Henry Hazlitt)   Both general economic and purely mone tary theory are supposed to have made im mense  advances  since  the middle of  the  eighteenth century, yet the confusion and  chaos in economic and monetary theory have  never been greater than they are today. One  would think, listening to television and read ing the newspapers and magazines, that in flation-in  the popular  sense  of  soaring  prices--were  some  infinitely  complicated,  mysterious and incurable atHiction that had  suddenly struck us from  the blue,  instead  of simply what it is-the inevitable conse quence of the actions of government in over spending and  then printing paper money.  And as the cause is obvious and simple, so  is the fundamental cure. The direct cause  of soaring prices 1s printing too much paper  money;  the direct cure is to stop printing  it. The indirect cause of lnfiation is govern ment overspending  and unbalancing  the  budget;  the indirect cure is to stop over spending and to balance the budget.  But if the cause and cure of inflation are  so  fundamentally  simple, why  is  there so  much befuddlement? One reason, of course,  is that the problem is not merely economic,  but political. The problem is not merely, for  example, to get the politicians to recognize  the true cause and cure of inflation. It is  also to get them to acknowledge that cause  and  that  cure.  In  brief,  one  reason so many politicians do not under stand the problem is not merely that they  are to stupid to understand it, but that they  do not want to understand it.  They realize  that  inflation  is a political  racket. They find  that the way to get into  office is to advocate inflation, and the way to  stay in is to practice it. They find that the  way to be popular is to appropriate handouts  to pressure groups who represent mass votes,  and not to raise taxes except those that seem  to fall mainly on some unloved or envied  minority group-on companies, corporations  generally,  the  reputedly ""rich"" or ""super rich.""  The ultimate result of such policies is to  bring about exactly what we have today inflation plus recession.  But we are brought back to the fact that  politicians could not exploit the befuddle ment of the public about inflation if that be fuddlement did not already exist. So though  we must not overlook the political side of the  problem, we must recognize that our main  task is stlll one of educating the public.  This is a much bigger problem than it is  commonly thought to be.  Even when we have explained  to people  that inflation is caused by excessive issues of  paper money, and by budget deficits  that  lead to excessive issues of paper money, we  have done only a small part of our task. We  have explained what causes inflation, but we  have not explained why inflation is so perni cious. The truth is that the greater part of  the public still thinks that inflation is on the  whole beneficial. They know that it raises the  prices of commodities, but the chief thing  they consider bad about this is that it may  not raise their wage-rates or salaries to the  same extent. Nearly everybody thinks that  inflation is necessarily stimulating to busi ness, because they think it must raise profit  margins and so lead  to greater production  and employment.  This 1s  indeed usually true  the first  in  Mr. Hazlitt, noted economist,  journalist  and author, adds what might well be another  chapter  to one of his books: What You  Should Know About Inflation.  This article is based on a paper delivered  January 6, 1975, at a monetary conference  in Miami.  ",1975
169,,94,-0.509,938,6,Mr. BINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, perhaps  the most prevalent myth among hand gun owners is that a handgun is neces sary for self-protection. The belief that  a handgun may be useful  in repelling  an attacker or thief is cited as justifica tion for  the possession of these deadly  weapons by the ordinary citizen.  The fantasy that the ""good guy"" wins  the shootout is exploded by a sober look  at the facts. A recent study at Case West ern Reserve University Medical School  concluded that the family gun is six times  as likely to be used against a friend or  family member as against an intruder.  March 19, 1975  The editorial below points out the expert  testimony of law enforcement officials,  who confront this problem every day of  their lives, to the effect that a handgun  simply  is  not  useful  as  a  defensive  weapon.  The editorial which follows, appeared  in the New York Post on March 11:  GUNS AND PROTECTION  Despite their exposure to the exotic arma ment displayed on TV police shows and in  spy movies, few Americans are specially so phisticated about weaponry for the self-de fense department. In fact, their ""qeterrents""  can lead to disaster.  Thus at a  recent hearing on gun control  legislation being conducted by a House sub committee,  the police chief of Atlanta re ported on frequent cases  in which holdup  victims carrying guns tried to draw them and  outshoot armed robbers-and were quickly  shot dead  themselves. Public Safety Com missioner A. Reginald Eaves said he believes  a handgun offers the average civilian nothing  much more than .. a false sense of security.""  There are  limitless other hazards associ ated with keeping a loaded handgun around  the house; many a homicide has followed a  family squabble because such a weapon was  at hand. But Eaves' point is especially worth  remembering. Pretending to be a gunfighter  can be fatally risky and not even the best  trained and ablest  target shooter  is auto matically qualified, by either experience or  equipment, to subdue armed attackers.  The current hearings have again aired the  informed opinion of competent law enforce ment  authorities  about  gun  control  in  America. They are virtually unanimous  in  urging a tougher law.  It is that legislation, not a cheap pocket  pistol, that offers the best hope of reducing  the spreading nightmare of armed violence.  Gunplay is not a rewarding exercise for am ateurs. Domestic disarmament ha-s  become  an increasingly urgent challenge to Capitol  Hill.  VOICE OF DEMOCRACY CONTEST GEORGIA WINNER  HON.

171,,94,-0.102,964,6,Mr. TEAGUE.," Mr. Speaker, this month  the House of Representatives will con sider the authorization for the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration.  Each year when the Congress considers  this authorization Members often ask,  ""Why does not this Nation get other na tions  to help pay  for  the space pro gram?"" The answer is that they do. One half of  the launches  this year will be  payed for by commercial, Government,  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  and foreign users. This point is brought  out in the February 9, 1975, Washington  Star-News. The article points out several  important facets of our space program  and I hope every Member of Congress  will read it.  The article follows:  OTHERS FOOT BILLS FOR NASA LAUNCHES  (By Howard Benedict)  The space agency has its heaviest traffic in  nine years scheduled to go rumbling skyward  this year-with half the launches being paid  for by commercial, foreign or other U.S. gov ernment users.  The 28-shot schedule, 11 more  than last  year, is a barometer of NASA's growing use  as the common carrier of space and of the  increasing benefits being returned to earth  in communications, weather  research and  survey of global resources.  ""NASA will be fully reimbursed by com mercial, government and foreign users for  14, or half its launches this year,"" said Dr.  George M. Low, deputy NASA administrator.  ""It shows that space is coming of age and  people around the world are using space for  their own needs.""  Low outlined  the schedule  last week  in  discussing the agency's proposed budget of  $3.498 billion for fiscal 1976.  The highlight will be a joint flight by three  American astronauts and two Soviet cosmo nauts, planned for July. Spaceships of  the  two nations are  to link in orbit  to test a  common docking device that could be used  by either for a space rescue mission.  Such a flight would have been considered  unthinkable a  few years ago as the United  States and Russia engaged in a race for space  supremacy-a race won by  the Americans  with the Apollo moon landing project.  The  two Russians, Anatole Filipchenko  and Nikolai Rukavichnikov, and eight other  cosmonauts arrived in the United States Fri day and yesterday toured the space center at  Cape Canaveral.  Nine European nations are building a small  scientific space station  to be carried  into  orbit in 1980 by a U.S. space shuttle, a re useable rocket plane being developed.  Nearly all the 1975 satellites have  inter national aspects, with foreign nations either  owning them or sharing in the results.  Eleven of  the commercial  launches are  communications satellites, underlining  the  global  importance of  these  space  switch boards for reliable relay of television, radio  and other traffic.  Four will be launched for the 89-nation  International Telecommunications Satellite  Organization, and one each for Canada, a  joint U.S.-Canadian venture, and  a  joint  France-West German effort. Domestic com munications payloads will be launched for  RCA and Comsat Corporation. And there will  be two launches of a new breed of satellite  for Comsat-to provide maritime communi ctttions links for ships.  One NASA launch already has been con ducted. That was  the Landsat-2  satellite  orbited  in  January  to  survey earth's re sources,  including  crop  inventories, water  and mineral resources and pollution sources.  Several countries, including Iran, Italy and  Brazil, are building their own ground sta tions  to  receive photos directly  from  the  satellite.  Four weather satellites are on the 1975  schedule, including two operational vehicles  for the National Weather Service. The other  two are NASA  experimental craft  to  test  improved sensors for future operational use.  The Space Agency  also will  launch an  operational navigation satellite for the U.S.  Navy, providing pinpoint location data for  ships and submarines.  Sclenti.flc research will include two Project  Viking spacecraft scheduled  for  launching  March 19, 1975  in August  toward Mars. They are  to  land  capsules on  the Red Planet  to search for  organisms or other forms of life.  Other scienti.flc payloads will study  the  oceans, the sun and earth's atmosphere. A  probe developed by the European Space Re search Organization will survey extraterres trial gamma radiation and a unique Amer ican satellite will test Einstein's Theory of  Relativity.  NASA uses  two basic  rockets. For each  commercial or foreign satellite it launches  on an Atlas-Centaur rocket it receives $22.2  million; for each Delta it is paid $9 Inillion.

172,,94,-0.366,964,6,Mr. VANIK.," Mr. Speaker, I am deeply  concerned about  the condition of  the  unemployment trust fund and the ad ministration of this program during this  most difficult period  in  the program's  post-Great Depression history.  Earlier this month, my office made a  number of telephone inquiries to various  State unemployment offices around the  Nation. A memo on my findings was for warded to the chairman of the Unem ployment Compensation Subcommittee,  the Honorable JAMEs CoRMAN, who for warded these observations to the Depart ment of Labor for comment. Mr. Ben  Burdetsky, the Deputy Assistant Secre tary for  the Manpower Administration  replied to the memo, generally assuring  the Congress that there were no problems  in the administration of  the program.  The discrepancies between the State's  complaints listed in my memo and the  Administration's assurances were strik ing. There were differences of opinion  over the frequency of long claims lines,  payment delay, space availability, per-  sonnel qualifications, operating proce dures and administrative funds.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker,  in order to  investigate  the Department's reply,  I  asked one of my staff members to spend  a day at the District of Columbia Un employment  Office. While  the  civil  servants at the D.C. office were polite and  as helpful as possible, there were obvious  problems. If the District's office-with  relatively  low  level of unemploy ment-is having problems, then it should  be evident that in areas of high unem ployment  the  situation  is  even more  serious.  It is imperative that Congress review  the entire unemployment compensation  program and require the development of  more efficient procedures for serving the  public.  I would like to enter the full text of  my staff's observations at this point in  the RECORD.  its  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE  THE WAI;riNG GAME  One of the major problems encountered  by claimants 1s  the amount of  time  they  must spend  in the agency.

174,House,94,-0.475,977,6,Mr. BURLISON of Missouri.," Mr.  Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, my friend from Dlinois  <Mr. FINDLEY) knows of the very high re gard in which I hold him. He is a very ar' ticulate spokesman for his position. How ever, I  think that he is certainly wrong  on this particular issue. I have a number  of reasons for that. I want to talk to the  Members about them for just a moment.  In the first place, the gentleman from  Dlinois  (Mr. F'INDLEY)  has given  the  position of the administration and the  position of  the processing  industry  in  the country, and  that has been  their  position ever since I have been in this  Congress.  The purpose  of  that position, Mr.  Chairman, is to keep the soybean price  down as low as possible for the processor  of the product. I can recite a little his tory of this issue. It was just perhaps 5  years ago, when this administration re duced the soybean loan to $2.40 a bushel,  over  the vigorous objections of myself  and some other Members of the House.  It was not  too  long after  that  that  this administration reduced the soybean  loan to $2.25 a bushel, again over the  objections of some of us.  The reason given by the administra tion at that time was that, with such a  loan, the price of soybeans would be too  high, it would encourage overproduction  of soybeans on the domestic and on the  world market.  Finally,  the administration and Mr.  FINDLEY succeeded in getting a loan low  enough that they could come back with  the argument that the soybean loan is  not used,  therefore, we might as well  eliminate it. That is just what the ad ministration did  this past year. Now  they are seeking to continue that policy  by preventing the inclusion of a man datory soybean loan program in the pres ent emergency farm bill.  Mr. Chairman, there has been much  discussion about the cost of this farm  program, the cost of agriculture to our  economy, the contribution that it makes  to our deficit spending. Please  let me  remind the House that, of the 15 func tions of Government, only agriculture  has been reduced in expenditures since  1971, from approxL'nately $4.5 billion to  somewhere between $1  billion and $2  billion.  Let me also remind the House that, of  these 15 functions of Government, agri culture takes a smaller amount oi that  budget, a smaller piece of the pie, than  any other of the 15 functions of Govern ment.  To be specific,  that amount  is  five tenths of 1 percent, compared, for  in stance, to 34 percent""for security income  and 27 percent for national defense. I  am using fiscal year 1976 figures for this.  So, Mr. Chairman, I say to my friends,  do not be misled by this e1Iort, this at tempt, to keep the soybean price to the  producer down so that the processor can  make a larger profit at the ultimate ex pense of the consumers and the producers  of the country. Let us remember that if  we are going to get production from our  farmers, we must give them some pro tection.  This administration has done every thing conceivable  to get our croplands  planted  from  fence  row  to fence  row  without giving any consideration to some  insurance to the farmer in order to pro tect him and share with him the risks of  overproduction.  ",1975
175,House,94,-0.24,977,6,Mr. BEDELL.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the requisite number of words, and  I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, in this age of antidis crimination I cannot understand why my  colleague,  the gentleman from  Illinois  <Mr. FINDLEY), would want to discrim inate still further against soybeans.  We have already discriminated against  soybeans, in that the other items in this  bill have a target price. We do not ask for  a  target price for soybeans; all we are  asking for  is  that we establish a  loan  value on soybeans as we have done for  these other crops.  If we will look at the 1973 cash value  of farm crops, we will find that for corn  it was $13.4 billion, for wheat $6.5 billion.  for cotton $2.8 billion, and for soybeans  $8.8 billion.  Mr. Chairman, soybeans is the second  largest cash crop in America; it is almost  as large as cotton and wheat combined.  Because of its high protein content, soy beans has come to be the wonder crop of  the world. And indeed the demand has  tended  to  increase more  rapidly gen erally than the supply, so there was no  need for this type of legislation.  However, recently we find ourselves on  a roller coaster. We cannot tell what to  expect in regard  to demand or in re gard to prices. I  think it is important  that we bring some stability to Ameri can agriculture. If we are going to be a  soybean exporter, we must have some  product to export.  During the last 2 years our exports of  these farm products for the 2-year period  were as follows:  Corn, $6.6 billion; wheat, $8.5 billion;  cotton, $2.2 billion; and soybeans, $7.4  billion.  ",1975
176,House,94,-0.332,990,6,Mr. HUNGATE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the Findley amendment  and to the Richmond amendment. We  have been asked, 'Where is the evidence  to support the need for 85 percent of  parity?""  Where is the evidence?  For 20,000 dairy farmers have gone out  of business in the past year under the  current 80 percent price support level.  Where is the evidence?  Since 1969, 56 percent of the Nation's  dairy farmers quit business.  Where is the evidence?  The number of dairy  cows  in  the  United States has declined 10 percent  since 1969.  Where is the evidence?  The costs of  labor,  feed grains and  credit rose 17 percent from 1973 to 1974,  and the minimum wage for farm labor  has increased 50 cents an hour in the  last 10 months.  Where is the evidence?  National milk production is declining  at a rate that indicates our country will  no longer be self-sufficient in the pro duction of dairy products by 1980.  Mr. Chairman, I believe in small busi ness. I believe competition helps the con sumer, and it is clearly impossible to in crease competition by reducing the num ber of producers.  I urge defeat of both of these amend ments and support 85 percent parity as  proposed in the committee bill.  PARLIAMENTARY  INQUIRY  ",1975

178,House,94,-0.562,1055,6,Mr. ROSENTHAL.," A growing cam paign is underway by certain segments  of the business community-particularly  the automobile industry-to halt, slow  down, or roll back Federal regulatory  programs which preserve our environ ment or protect the health, safety, and  economic well-being of American con sumers.  Through a variety of political, legal,  and public relations techniques, industry  spokesmen are blaming much of our cur rent economic difficulties on existing and  proposed consumer and environmental  regulations.  Encouraged by a sympathetic admin istration, regulations pertaining to auto  safety and pollution control, food and  drug labeling and toxicity, occupa tiona!  safety and health, and consumer protec tion are being weakened, delayed, or re versed.  I believe we should know both the so cial benefits and the monetary costs of  Federal regulation and that we should  eliminate or  curtail  costly  programs  without substantial benefits  to society.  But, an  investigation by my office  strongly suggests that business attacks  on Federal consumer and environmen tal regulations are little more than s~lf­ serving attempts to use Federal requrre ments as a scapegoat for deeper econom ic problems or managerial shortcom ings. our study shows that where ~ed­ eral regulatory programs are inflatiOn ary, they are invariably designed to pro tect one segment of the business com munity against another, not to fo~ter  consumer and environmental protectiOn.  I support action to measure the eco nomic impact of Federal programs. ~ut  I oppose the attempt by certain sp.ec1al  interest groups to attack the. costl!n.ess  of Federal  requirements wh1le h1dmg  their actual cost increases, if any, be hind the veil of ""proprietary or confi dential information.""  In many instances, the legitimacy of  industry-challenged cost increases from  Federal requirements have been chal lenged by the Federal agency involved,  by consultants in the private sector, or  even by actual price increases measured  after  implementation of  the Federal  standard.  .  While industry complains about pr1ce  increases resulting from Federal regula tions, they are strangely silen~ about cost  increases resulting from unw1se or self serving industry decisions or practices.  An excellent example is the expense and  inefficiency of decisions made in the au tomobile sector to make unneeded annual  styling changes  and unnecessary but  standard lu.wry-type features which add  far more to the cost of a car than Fed eral safety and pollution requirements.  Accordingly, we are asking the public  to join with us in opposing misdirected  industry efforts to undo the progress we  have made in the environmental, safety,  and consumer protection areas. We must  not confuse our legit-imate efforts to solve  the Nation's economic crisis with the un wise and self-serving industry call for a  return to laissez faire government.  I am introducing today the Cost Justi fication and Price Control Act, along  with 32 of my colleagues,  to  require  major business firms to furnish the Gov ernment with cost data to justify their  claims that Federal consumer and en vironmental regulations are in:flationary  or responsible for much of our current  economic problems.  This legislation requires that leading  corporations file reports with the Federal  Trade Commission explaining in detail  any increases in costs resulting from a  Federal regulation; and prohibits any  such corPoration or dealer from passing  through to the ultimate consumer, more  than the actual dollar and cents cost  increases associated with such Federal  requirements.  This legislation will in no way deter  Congress proper effort to eliminate costly  and unnecessary Federal regulatory pro grams, such as those governing airline  rates or transportation costs. It will only  insure that useful consumer and environ mental regulations will not be used as a  scapegoat for explaining industrial fail ures or as a means of artificially inflat ing prices  so as  to discourage  future  regulation.  Mr. Speaker, I am  inserting  in  the  RECORD at this point, my report on busi ness oppositions  to Federal consumer  and environmental regulations and the  text of the Cost Justification and Price  Control Act:  THE EcoNOMIC IMPACT OF FEDERAL CONSUMER  AND ENVIRONMEN'I'AL REGULATION: A STUDY  BY CoNGRESSMAN BENJAl\UN S. RosENTHAL  Evaluating  industry  arguments  against  consumer and environmental regulation  is  extremely d11ficult because most federal regu latory agencies must rely on the voluntary  submission of cost data by industry and be cause the societal costs of failure to regu late are often d11ficult to measure.  If economic considerations are going  to  become increasingly a kingpin of regulatory  decision-making,  then  federal  regulatory  agencies should have an unqualified right to  verify industry cost claims; and the public  should be allowed maximum practicable ac cess to cost data, so that they too can par ticipate in the regulatory process.  Notwithstanding  Presidential  Executive  Order 11821, which makes economic impact  studies mandatory for all  federal agencies  involved in developing legislative proposals  and regulatory rules, agencies charged with  making  these studies may lack clear legal  authority to mandate such information from  industry. Almost all cost data from the busi ness community  is obtained by voluntary  means. In exchange for this cooperation, fed eral agencies are quick  to promise confi dentiality, even where such claims might  be unsupportable under the Freedom of In formation Act.  In recognition of the reluctance of indus try to part with meaningful cost informa tion, Congress has armed the Environmental  Protection Agency  (EPA) and the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHT  SA) w1.th authority to require industry to  furnish cost data to appropriate agency offi cials. But until all federal agencies are au thorized to compel cost data from industry  groups claiming inflationary federal require ments and until the publlc has substantial  access to this information, it will be lm.pos sible to measure the true economic impact of  such regulations. Moreover, it is imperative  that federal regulatory decision-makers develop more  sophisticated  techniques  for  measuring the societal costs of failure to reg ulate harmful industrial activity in key sec tors of the economy.  I. INDUSTRY CLAIMS OF INFLATIONARY FEDERAL  CONSUMER AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS  ARE FREQUENTLY DISTORTED AND AT VARIANCE  WITH 'rHE FINDINGS OF AGENCY EXPERTS AND  PRIVATE CONSULTANTS  In many  instances,.  the cost estimates  supplied by industry to federal  regulatory  agencies are at variance with estima.tes de veloped by the agencies  themselves or are  higher than the costs reflected in actual price  increases after  the  regulation has  taken  effect. A number of examples follow:  (A) National Highway Traffic Safety Ad ministration  (NHTSA),  Department  oj  Transportation:  $414  ($116.00  1. .In a speech and press release on No vember 13, 1974, the president of Ford Motor  Company, Lee Iacocca, claimed that of the  $1,010 price increase for a Ford Pinto be tween the years 1971 and 1975, $530 was due,  either directly or indirectly, to federal en vironmental and consumer regulations. He  claimed further that proposed safety, dam ageab111ty and pollution regulations for 1978  models would add an additional $847 to the  price of a Pinto.1  In contrast to  these figures,  released as  part of an automobile industry campaign to  halt pollution and safety regulations, data  collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  of the Department of Labor from the auto  industry  itself, are much  lower. According  to BLS figures, based on a composite of 16  domestic automobiles,  the  total price  in crease for safety and emission standards for  the years 1967 through 1975  (a period en compassing :three years worth of safety and  environmental standards beyond that meas ured in the Ford president's estimate), was  less  than  the  Iacocca esti mate) $190 for emission controls and $224  for safety equ1pment.2  If industrial profit and excise  taxes are  excluded from these figures under a formula  established by the National Academy of Sci ences, the actual cost to the auto industry,  based on their own data submitted to the  BLS, was $259.a  An even greater discrepancy exists between  the cost  findings of  the Bureau of Labor  Statistics  on  the one hand and  the New Jersey branch of the National Auto mobile Dealers Association  (NADA), on the  other. In a recent full page ad in the New  York Times and in other newspapers to.cross  the country, NADA claimed that federal en vironmental and safety regulations from 1968  through 1975 added $700 to the price of an  automobile.  The contrast in data between  the auto  industry and governmental or private groups,  strongly suggest the unreliability of industry  claims.  2. Industry claims about future costs (Jf  proposed regulations appear similarly inflat ed. Lee Iacocca of Ford has claimed publicly  that when stricter emission controls and a  passive restraint of air bag system proposed  for 1978 models are in effect, they will raise  the price of a Ford Pinto by $740---$450 for  emission controls and $290 for the passive re  straint or air bag system.   But in September 1974, John DeLorean, a  former General Motors vice president and  safety engineer, testified before the Depart ment of Transportation that an air bag/lap  belt system should only add $88 to the price  of  an  automoblle. This  figure  included  amortization of research and development  costs. Even adding '$15 for installation costs,  $30 for dealer profit and $15 for manufac turer's profit, DeLorean put the top cost o!  lap belt/air bag systems to the consumer at  $148 per vehicle, $142  less  than the Ford  president's prediction.

Another $13 billion will be given  out  this year and next. As discussion  begins on extending the program, I think  it wise to see what has been accomplished  so far.  Certainly, many government units particularly our large cities-have bene fited greatly from  these moneys. With  property taxes and sales taxes extended  to the limit, revenue sharing has been a  source of salvation to our urban centers.  As we examine the data which have  been coming out, however, we begin to  jurisdictions with  heavy burdens  are  getting a pittance, while many affluent  communities are building up surpluses.  few disturbing  trends. Some  notice  a  the  does  following  There is a wide disparity, both among  States  and  among  local  governments  within a given State. Some of these in equities arose, because of the consensus  politics which produced the current law;  others were not foreseen.  Mr. President, I did not support the  revenue sharing bill when it was before  us in 1972. I voted against its enactment,  and many of the points I raised at the  time have been shown to be valid. I still  have many doubts about this program,  but now that we have the hard facts,  with 2 years and $13 billion yet to go,  I think it timely that we redress some of  the imbalances in the current law.  I am introducing today a bill to amend  the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act  of 1972. My bill would modify and sim plify the allocation formulas to make a  more equitable distribution of the funds,  one that is also more in keeping with the  stated purposes of general revenue shar ing.  Briefly,  the bill  two things:  Changes the State-by-State allocation  from the higher of the original two for mulas to the average of the two formulas.  This would narrow the wide per-capita  discrepancies among States.  Modifies the State-local division from  the current  two-thirds  local and one third State to reflect the actual spend ing burdens at each  level of Govern ment. On a nationwide basis, the 2-to-1  ratio would be roughly maintained, but  in a given State the local share could be  substantially above or below two-thirds.  Mr. President, there are a number of  other reforms that could and should be  made  the Revenue Sharing Act.  In  particular, the statutory floors and ceil ings have worked  the disadvantage  of our struggling big cities and have  helped prop up many marginal  local  governments. I have not addressed these  issues in my bill, as I am seeking only  to correct the major imbalances which  have arisen. Nevertheless,  I hope that  these other reform  issues will be con sidered.  In the original deliberB~tions over reve nue sharing, the House of Representa tives developed a  formula for the allo cations to States based on five factors:  Population, urbanized population,  per  capita income, State income tax collec tions, and tax effort. The Senate then  came up with its own formula, based on  three factors: Population, tax effort, and  income. Rather than settling on one for mula or the other, the conferees decided  to include both formulas intact. For each  State, the entitlement under each for mula  is  calculated, and  the State  is  given the higher amount-subject to a  uniform adjustment factor to bring the  sum of State allocations into line with the  total amount  to be distributed during  the entitlement period.  The formula in the 1972 Revenue Shar ing Act produced some perhaps unex pected results. Instead of striking a bal ance  that would  equalize  allocations  across States, the formula rewards differ ences from the norm. Some States ended  capita as others, either because they were  very rich or very poor, very urban or  very rural.  up receiving nearly twice as much per  to  to  ",1975

Although section 1152 of title 18 makes  the general laws of the United St_ates and  the violation of those laws applicable to  Indian country, an exception was made  for offenses committed by one  Indian  against another within Indian countr?.  Jurisdiction in those cases was vested m  the tribal courts. In 1885, however, Con gress extended  the  jurisdiction of  the  United States  to major offenses com mitted within Indian country with  the  passage of the Seven Major Crimes Act.  Subsequently legislation has increased  the number of crimes to be subject to the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of  the United  states  to 13. They are murder, man slaughter, rape, incest, assault with in tent  to kill,  arson, burglary,  robbery,  larceny, carnal knowledge, assault w!th  intent to commit rape, and assault With  a dangerous weapon. In 1968, Congress  added the offense of assault resulting in  serious  bodily  injury. Kidnaping,  al though a ""major"" crime has never been  included in section 1153. This bill seeks  to include this offense within the purview  of this section.  Kidnaping, as defined by section 1201  of title 18 would, through this amend ment,  beCome  applicable  Indian  country.  to  By Mr. RANDOLPH (for himself,  Mr. PELL, Mr. KENNEDY, Mr.  SCHWEIKER, and Mr. TAFT) :  s. 1264.

I introduced identical legislation in the  92d and 93d Congresses. The Subcom mittee on Juvenile Delinquency, chaired  by my distinguished colleague from In diana  (Mr. BAYH)  held a hearing on  February 25, 1974, to receive testimony  on the bill I had introduced and a sim ilar measure introduced by Senator BAYH.

191,House,94,0.276,134,11,Mr. ESHLEMAN.," Mr. Speaker, at this  point I would like to call to the atten tion of my colleagues a study completed  recently by the noted Pennsylvania his torian, Frederic S. Klein. In this paper  Dr. Klein shows convincingly that the  Continental Army was born at Lancaster,  Pa., on June 25, 1775. From that muster  of volunteers came our U.S. Army.  Since my  congressional district  in cludes Lancaster, I am proud to make  my colleagues aware of another major  contribution our community made to the  struggle for independence.  The item follows:  CoNGRESS SELECTED PENNSYLVANIA RIFLEMEN  TO BEGIN A CONTINENTAL ARMY  On June 14th, 1775, the Continental Con gress brought all the American colonies to gether in a war for independence by a bold  decision to call up and control a Continental  Army, whose first volunteers formed the of ficial beginning of what was to become the  United States Army. They were sk1lled ritle men, from Pennsylvania, Maryland and Vir ginia, who had defended their frontiers in  previous years against French and Indians.  t\fter Lexington and Concord and during  the siege of Boston, the Massachusetts Con vention appealed to the Congress in Phila delphia to assist New England m1lltia in the  defense of American rights. The response of  Congress was to call on other colonies for  special  troops, by the following resolution:  ""Resolved, that siX companies of expert rifle men be immediately raised in Pennsylvania,  two in Maryland and two in Virginia;  that  each company consist of a  captain,  three  lieutenants, four sergeants, four corporals, a  drummer or trumpeter, and siXty-eight pri vates ... "" The resolution included a pay  scale and a  form of enlistment, as follows:  ""I have this day voluntarily enlisted myself  as a  soldier  in  the American Continental  Army, for one year ... and I do bind myself  to conform to such rules and regulations as  are or shall be established for the govern ment of said Army.""  This  is  the first official reference by the  Congress  to a Continental Army, and  the  rules and regulations were not established  until June 30th.  The day after these soldiers for the Con tinental Army were called out, Congress re solved that a General must be appointed to  command  all  forces,  and  elected George  Washington. On June 17th Washington was  commissioned, by June 22nd, Pennsylvania  had raised a battalion of eight companies in stead of six, and by June 25th, the first com missions printed by Congress were issued to  the Pennsylvania Battalion officers-Colonel  William Thompson, of Carlisle; Lt. Colonel  Edward Hand, of Lancaster, and  the eight  captains of the rifie companies. By July  the  riflemen, With two Lancaster companie~ in stead of one, were marching to Boston, armed  with  their  long  Pennsylvania  rifles-the  secret weapon of the Revolutionary War with  the precise accuracy and long range that kept  the British pinned  down  in Boston  for  months.  Militia and New England volunteers who  had been opposing the British were speedily  enrolled in the new Continental Army, but it  is significant that when Congress first de cided to raise and manage an army, they con fidently began by selecting the group  they  considered most formidable-the rifiemen of  Pennsylvania, Maryland  and Virginia-for  the beginnings of the United States Army.  Even the very first act of the newly ap pointed Congressional Treasurers, on the very  day of their appointment, July 29th, 1775,  was to pay Colonel Thompson five thousand  dollars, as advance pay for his battalion of  riflemen-the first pay ever granted to Ameri can soldiers.  It is a significant coincidence that June  14th, the day the Army began, is also now  Flag Day, officially  recognized  in Pennsyl vania as a legal holiday.  In Lancaster during the last week in June,  representatives of rifle companies from vari ous counties in Pennsylvania which raised  troops for the new army will meet at the  home of General Edward Hand, first a rifle  company commander,  and  later Adjutant  General of the Army under Washington, to  commemorate the beginnings of the army in  1775 by demonstrations of marksmanship,  uniform displays and battle re-enactments  on the grounds at Rockford.

194,,94,-0.33,173,11,Mr. TRAXLER.," Mr. Speaker, in the  wake of  the fall of South Vietnam,  I  think it is essential that we let no nation  or government misunderstand our pledge  to meet our standing commitments to our  allies in the remainder of the Far East,  Europe, and South America, particularly  Israel.  The tragedy in Indochina does not af feet our strength as a nation and should  not affect our reliability as an ally.  With the morass of Vietnam removed  as a  reason for devisiveness in our so ciety, I believe the United States will be  more likely and better prepared to honor  our longstanding ties and treaty com mitments.  It is time for us to reassure nations  with whom we have longstanding rela tions that we remain their friends, that  we are offering them our continued sup port, and we are not turning our backs  on them.  Our  first priority must be  renewed  efforts for a  true and lasting peace in  the Middle East.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  And  I believe  it  is more  important  than ever  to  reaffirm our support for  Israel.  We must continue  to support Israel  both economically and militarily to the  extent necessary to maintain a balance  of power in the Middle East and to en courage the Arab States to enter into  direct negotiations with Israel to settle  the Middle East dispute.  I am not in favor of the United States  continuing to arm both sides of the con fiict at a level that might trigger another  war. However, to abruptly cut off or cur tail aid to Israel at a  time when Arab  countries seem to be arming themselves  at a record pace would only result in the  threat of more war at the expense of a  negotiated settlement. We can expect  successful negotiations only if both sides  enter with equal relative strength and the  understanding that there are no other  alternatives.  I am opposed, as are United States and  Israeli o:tficials, to the use of any Ameri can troops in Israel or the Middle East.  The United States must reaffirm our  support for the integrity and sovereignty  of the State of Israel within recognized  and secure borders.  Israel's right to exist and to maintain  its position as a democratic state should  be recognized as an important factor in  the foreign policy of the United States  so  Israel may be able  to continue  its  peaceful  negotiations with  the Arab  States.  There are those who say that the fall  of Vietnam signals an end to the Ameri can credibility in foreign policy. There  are those who say Americans no longer  have the will, or the strength, to stand  by  their friends. We must not permit  those who would test our will to overrun  Israel, a small, stalwart nation that has  endured much hardship since its begin nings just a few decades ago. We must  rea:tfirm our commitment to the strength  and viability of the state of Israel.  This is a moment for all Americans  to look back, profit by our mistakes and  to look forward and recommit ourselves  to making the world safer for ourselves  and the rest of humanity.

195,,94,0.204,173,11,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Speaker, I know  that I will miss Bill Bonsell, as will all  of us who had the honor and pleasure  of working with him, on his retirement  as minority doorkeeper of the House.  In the more than 6 years since I have  known him, I always am impressed by  Bill's unflappable qualities, easygoing na ture, and his keen insight and knowledge  of the inner workings of the House. I  think it is a  tribute to Bills  character  that after 29 years of House service he  never has lost  these sterling traits that  have endeared him to so many of us.  As a freshman, I soon discovered that  Bill was a  reliable and well-informed  13451  House aide who could be depended upon  to exert that extra effort to help those  of us who were groping our way into a  new system and surroundings.  I  later  discovered that this was Bill's way and  he never stinted in helping new Mem bers and old friends.  In the broader concept of Federal Gov ernment service, Bill Bonsell is the type  of public servant who exemplifies  the  best. I know that too often we only hear  of the worst-through the news media  or from others in Government. That is  another reason why knowing Bill has  been a greater experience and delight  for me.  To Bill, his wife and their son, I wish  only  the  best  for  a  bright,  happy,  healthy, and secure future. I hope that he  will  look back on occasion  to his re warding service in the House of Repre sentatives with the knowledge that we  who were associated with him, indeed,  were rewarded by his friendship.

196,,94,-0.278,173,11,Mr. GAYDOS.," Mr. Speaker, should  Congress reopen a  full-scale investiga tion of the 1963 assassination of Presi dent John F. Kennedy on the possibility  that  the Warren Commission Report  does not tell the entire tragic story?  This question is becoming of increas ing importance here in Washington as  more and more Americans, their interest  heightened by recent TV showings of a  technically improved reproduction of the  famed Zapruder film of the murder, have  expressed doubts that Lee Harvey Os wald was  the lone gunman that fatal  day in Dallas.  Now Congressman HENRY B. GONZALEZ,  of Texas, has provided Congress with a  ""draft brief"" written by students at the  University of Virginia calling for another  inquiry. He has introduced legislation to  this purpose which is awaiting action.  The chief point made by the students  concerns  the Warren Reports  ""single  bullet"" finding-the conclusion that the  same shot caused the President's back  and neck wound and also  the wounds  suffered by Gov. John B. Connally as he  rode in the jump seat of the Presidential  car.  The students contest this assumption  with evidence from  the Zapruder film  which they claim shows  the President  was hit while Governor Connally was  still unharmed, ""holding his hat in his  yet uninjured right hand in a position  higher than when it was struck.""  I need not point out that the single  bullet theory as to the President s  and  Governor Connany s wound is essential  to the Warren Commission verdict that  Oswald acted alone.  If the President and Governor Con nally, however, were struck by separate  bullets, then the timespan, as shown by  the Zapruder film, was not great enough,  ",1975
197,,94,0.3,186,11,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  great sadness that the world has received  word of the death of Cardinal Minds zenty.  Joszef Cardinal Mindszenty was born  in the small town of Mindszenty, Hun gary, in 1892. He was ordained in 1915  at the age of 23, and changed his name  to Mindszenty in 1940. In March of 1944,  he was named bishop of Veszprem. That  fall he was arrested by the Nazi-con trolled Hungarian government.  When victorious allied forces effected  his release in 1945, Pope Pius xn ap pointed him archbishop of Esztergom,  which automatically made him prince  primate of Hungary. He retained  this  title until his death, even though Pope  Paul VI formally announced his removal  as primate of Hungary on February 5,  1974, after Cardinal Mindszenty refused  to resign.  On  December  26,  1948,  Cardinal  Mindszenty was arrested again by  the  Nazi occupiers of Hungary, and sen tenced to death after a mock trial. His  sentence was commuted to life imprison ment, and he spent almost 8 years in  solitary confinement until he was freed  by the Hungarian Freedom Fighters in  the short-lived war for independence in  1956. He fled to the top-floor apartment  in the American Embassy in Budapest,  where he lived for 15 years in self-im posed confinement despite repeated tries  by the Vatican and the American Gov ernment to leave Hungary.  Cardinal Mindszenty steadfastly main tained that, as he served the Hungarian  people as prince primate of their church,  he would not leave his flock. He vowed to  remain  in his homeland until he was  completely cleared of all charges by the  Hungarian  government.  ""Cardinal  Mindszenty cannot abdicate,'' he said re peatedly. He finally agreed to leave h1s  native land under extreme pressure and  a communique  that indicated that h1s  presence in the American Embassy was  becoming  an  embarrassment  to  the  United  states  in  its  efforts  toward  detente with  the Communist govern ment.  Mr. Speaker, Joszef Cardinal Minds zenty was truly one of the giants of our  time. In his unceasing efforts to combat  the evils of communism and its total an nihilation of individual freedom, Cardi  nal Mindszenty was a beacon of hope for  Hungarians and freedom loving people  everywhere. In submitting to the tortures  of his Communist oppressors without  surrendering his duty to his native coun trymen, he singlehandedly led the Hun garian people in their drive for independ ence throughout three decades of occu pation.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in tribute today to  the memory of a great man who put God  and country before his life. May he al ways be remembered for his heroic self sacrifice,  for  his  total  opposition  to  tyranny, and for his courageous fight for  the preservation of liberty for Hungar ians and for all mankind. One of the  great honors of my congressional career  was receiving from the Cardinal himself,  his ""Mindszenty medal"" as a ""fighter for  freedom."" I pray that we carry on his  great work.

The mere existence of a na tional strategic oil reserve would serve  as a deterrent to future embargoes and  would increase the flexibility of U.S. pol icymakers. If we start now, in 5 to 6 years  we will have enough oil  in storage  to  enable us, with modest emergency pre cautions, to withstand an embargo with out economic hardship for 6 to 8 months.  The National  Petroleum Council NPC-completed a study of emergency  preparedness against a disruption of for eign oil supply. The Council reported that  a strategic petroleum storage program  should be established and that ""efforts  to  implement such a program should  begin immediately because of the long  construction  leadtimes  involved."" The  NPC has followed up with an analysis  and specific recommendations on how a  storage program would work. This imple mentation  report  should be available  early next month.  The Project Independence Report also  strongly recommends strategic petroleum  storage and points out  the  favorable  cost/benefit ratio for oil stockpiles. If  another embargo should occur, the econ omy would save $3 to $5 for each $1 cost  of storage.  The Federal Energy Administration  has in the works a comprehensive long range plan-LRP-as well as an earlY  storage program-ESP. This early stor age program could give us 150 million  barrels of storage by 1978. A recent FEA  paper, ""Strategic Petroleum Storage Pro gram Plan and Objectives,""' emphasizes  that because of long construction lead times, implementation of an early stor age program should begin as soon as pos sible and should not wait for completion  of the long-range plan.  Excerpts from the FEA paper appear  below:  STRATEGIC PETROLEUM STORAGE PROGRAM PLAN  AND OBJECTIVES  I . NEED FOR STRATEGIC STORAGE  The Administration's decision  to under take a  large-scale  ( 1.3 billion barrels)  oil  storage program is based upon the continued  need for foreign energy resources, the un reliability of such sources  (which are sub ject to disruption for political and economic  reasons) , the lack of an adequate standby  production capacity and consideration of the  protection which a security storage program  would afford the country. The 1973-74 em bargo, which reduced our projected imports  about 2.5 million barrels per day, resulted  in a GNP loss of between $10--20 billion and  substantially contributed  to  infiation and  unemployment. Emergency petroleum sup plies, used in conjunction with demand re straint and allocation programs, could have  substantially lessened this impact if avail able.    *    *  *  No matter what  reasonable actions we  take  to  increase domestic supplies and  to  conserve energy, analysiS indicates that im ports will be at least four  to five million  barrels per day by 1985  if prices  remain  at or near present levels. A one bllllon barrel  civlllan reserve would provide three m1llion  barrels a day for domestic allocation in the  event of an embargo of one year's duration.  The remainder could be dealt with through  imposition of various emergency conserva tion and allocation measures. National de fense would be guaranteed an additional 300  million barrels during a crisis by means of  a mllltary strategic reserve.  May 7, 1975  Standby production capacity,  to be uti  lized only in an emergency situation, would  not provide a sufficient amount of crude to  limit the economic effects of an embargo.  For  example,  it  is  estimated  that Naval  Petroleum Reserve No. 1  [Elk H1lls ], with  estimated reserves  in excess of one billion  barrels, could only produce at the rate of  300,000 barrels per day, while our projected  imports were  reduced by over 2.5 million  barrels per day during the 1973-74 embargo.  Further, the cost of developing and main taining new standby production capacity is  substantial-not only in capital and resource  requirements-but it also increases our de pendence on imports if domestic production  remains unutilized. Our balance of payments  problems would  increase  because  of  the  continued use of higher priced  imported  crude.  While a program of the magnitude outlined  in Titles I and II [of the Administration's  Bill] will  take many years  to fully  imple ment, it ls essential that we begin immedi ately. Even in the early stages of the pro gram, as  facUities are being acquired and  stocks are being built up,  the Nation will  have protection not now enjoyed.  One of the principal advantages of a stock pile program  its  fiexiblllty. The  target  size of the stockpile can be adjusted as we  reassess our vulnerablllty to imported sup plies, and also 1f the schedule and level of  domestic production lags behind projections.  We would also be in a position to take ad vantage of variations in the price of oil.  Finally, the International Emergency Pro gram (IEP) specifies that we must maintain  reserves sufficient to maintain current con sumption without imports for 60 days (later  to be increased to 90) . While according to  the  IEP defini tlons, our  reserves are cur rently far in excess of requirements (approx imately 120 days), the amount of reserves we  could actually draw down in an emergency  situation without  seriously  impairing  the  operation of our refinery/distribution system  is quite limited. However, strategic reserves  in excess of IEP requirements are valuable  in  that the IEP Treaty specifically allows  their use in place of the specified demand  restraint measures when imports are reduced  by seven percent.  ls  U. BACKGROUND  *  1. Salt Dome Cavities.    *  *  *  *  *      Salt dome cavities or existing salt cavern  storage  provides  a  potentially  economic  method of providing sufficient capacity for a  strategic reserve system.  Large salt dome  formations are  located  near the Gulf Coast, either  inland or off shore. The major limitations in the prepara tion of leached salt dome cavLties are the  availabllity of fresh water  to dissolve  the  salt  (salt water can also be used if avail able) ,  the time required  to  leach cavities  in the salt formations, and the environmen tal constraints  in disposing of  the brine  solution either in the sea or in subsurface  salt water acquifiers. It iS estimated that  it would take three to four years before we  can begin to fill salt dome storage facilities  adequate  for  large-scale  storage.  Salt  cavities are much less expensive to construct  and maintain  than steel  tanks. Estimates  place  the cost at about $1 per barrel for  construction and less than 1c a barrel per  year to maintain, as compared to $4 to $5  per barrel for a steel tank construction and  lOc for maintenance.  There is no doubt about the feasibility of  salt dome storage facllltles. In both France  and Germany, large amounts of crude oil are  currently being stored  in salt domes and  additional facilities are being prepared. Even  in the United States, large amounts of pe troleum products are currently being stored  in salt domes.  An additional advantage of salt dome stor",1975

205,House,94,-0.468,342,11,Mr. LEGGETT.," Mr. Chairman, var iable-rate mortgages are something the  country needs about as badly as we need ed the Vietnam war.  Variable rates make no sense what ever. We have already found that bank ing is probably the most recession-proof,  infiation-proof industry in the Nation.  When a recession comes, the amortiza tion from existent loans keeps rolling in  regardless. When infiation strikes, banks  simply  jack up  their interest rates. If  deposits fall, banks  just jack up  their  interest rates further, or stop giving loans  altogether.  In general, it is nearly a sure-win, no lose situation. Banks get the short end  only when inflation and interest rates  escalate sharply after a loan is given. But  this happens only after a period of many  years. For example, a bank is today losing  money on a 5-percent mortgage given in  1960. But in the interim, it has been re ceiving payments which for many years  were made up almost entirely of interest.  So the total picture on this loan is far  from one of loss; rather, it is merely a  case of a small proportion of the profits  being paid back.  In an effort to give itself totally loss protected conditions, the industry now is  offering loans on which it can raise the  interest at a later date if prevailing rates  go up. Rates can also be lowered, but this  is true in any case because most loans  can be prepaid and refinanced if pre vailing rates decllne.

206,,94,-0.589,420,11,Mr. YOUNG of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  the United States has long lagged behind  the industrialized nations in the field of  health care. No significant programs for  personal health care were enacted prior  to medicaid and medicare in the 1960's,  although Congress has considered a suc cession of proposals over the last 30 years  to alter the role of the Federal Govern ment in prvviding health care  to  the  American people.  I would hope that as this debate be gins to take form in the 94th Congress,  we  recognize  the need  to attempt  to  formulate a national policy on health  care. I personally feel that in a country  with a gross national product approach ing $1.5 trillion, health care ought to be  a right. A healthy people is indispensable  to a healthy nation. But even  if this  Congress can not address itself to such  a broad policy question, we ought to be  able at least to agree that health care  should not be the cause of destruction of  a  family;  it ought not ruin careers: it  ought not cost a man his home and all of  his hard-earned savings.  With the recent upsurge in unemploy ment, people who have lost their jobs  may also  lose  their medical insurance,  and most insured individuals can not af ford catastrophic coverage.  Mr. Speaker, I recommend to my col leagues an article from the May 1, 1975,  issue of the Atlanta Journal concerning  the most tragic case of the Byrd family  of Orlando, Fla.:  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  FAMU..Y LoSING HOME OVER LEUKEMIA BILL?  (By Ann Hellmuth)  ORLANDo.-Nine months a.fte:r 4-year-old  Rusty Byrd developed leukemia, doctors dis covered his  twin brother,  Jamie, also was  suffering from the often-fatal disease.  ""I don't ask the purpose of these things,""  their father, Jerry Byrd, 29, said. ""I think  there is a purpose behind all suffering and  difficulty. I believe this will give us an op portunity  to come out better people than  we went in.""  Now the Byrds, facing $20,000 in medical  bills have lost a legal battle to prevent their  Orla~do home from being foreclosed. Circuit  Judge Maurice Paul today enterd a $14,000  foreclosure judgment against Byrd and or dered his house sold at publlc auction May 26.  Frances  Schneider, who  requested  the  foreclosure, said she  lent Byrd more than  $10,000 to help with medical bills. She said  she thought she was getting a second mort gage on his home but in fact it was a third  mortgage.  ""We borrowed  the money  to help pay  Rusty's medical bills,"" said Byrd, an insur ance agent who also has two daughters, ages  10 and 7. ""We planned to sell our house to  pay the woman back, but because of  the  economy we couldn't find a buyer.""  Byrd said tragedy first hit the family last  May.  ""We love to go to the ocean and we were  at the beach when I noticed Rusty wasn't as  active as Jamie and his Ups were pale,"" Byrd  said.  Doctors at Shand Teaching Hospital  in  Gainesvllle diagnosed the problem as leuke mia, a  form of cancer which attacks  the  blood cells.  ""He has been in and out of the hospital  ever since but now  is  in remission,"" Byrd  said.  He said ""everything was starting to level  out and we felt confident about the future""  when  last month he noticed an unusual  bruise on Jamie's cheek.  ""I got suspicious and we took him to an  Orlando doctor who  told us  the dreadful  news,"" Byrd added.  Byrd said he and his wife, Patty, 28, had a  heartbreaking  journey  to Gainesville with  Jamie, who chatted all the time about how  he was going to be like his twin brother.  ""He said, 'Gee, Daddy, I'U get to eat an  my meals in bed like Rusty and I'll lose all  my hair and all the girls will laugh at me in  church and  I'll get  to  ride around  in a  wagon with a tube in my arm',"" Byrd said.  Byrd said Jamie's disease is now in remis sion and doctors will say only that if the boys  go  five years without  lapses  they may be  cured.  ""The thing that makes you angry is the  helplessness of  the middle  income people  in a situation like this,"" Byrd said.  CARDINAL MINDSZENTY-A GIANT  IN THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM DIES  HON. LARRY McDONALD  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 8, 1975  Mr. McDONALD  of  Georgia. Mr.  Speaker,  the death of Cardinal Mind szenty this week left a great void in the  ranks of those who oppose totalitarian ism in the world. The Cardinal had the  distinction of being imprisoned by both  tne Nazis and the Communists at differ ent times.  However, he will be largely remembered  for his stand against athiestic commuMay 8, 1975  nism in the little Hungarian nation. His  spirit stood out  like a  shining beacon  as Soviet tanks crushed the Hungarian  nation again in 1956. His selfless example  of no compromise with evil was a great  contrast to the inactivity of the West and  in particular  the United States, when  the Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest.  The year 1956 was a great dividing  point and never again would any of the  ""Captive Nations""  in Eastern Europe  take seriously our statements espousing  'freedom for all nations of the world. The  U.S. weak reaction  to  the  invasion of  Hungary was among the first in a series  of evasions and procrastinations in our  foreign policy  that are exemplified by  no-win wars in Korea and Vietnam. But  now the downhill slide is moving at a  fa..ster pace and no one knows where it  will end. Therefore, it behooves my col leagues to think of t'he life of Cardinal  Mindszenty and the example he set in  the struggle for freedom. The story of his  death as it appeared in the Washington  Star on May 6, 1975, follows:  JOSEF CARDINAL MINDSZENTY, COLD WAR  FoE OF REDS, DIEs  VIENNA.-Josef  Cardinal  Mindszenty,  strong-willed former primate of  the Hun garian Catholic church who became a symbol  of inflexible resistance in the Cold War, died  here  today,  the Catholic Press Service re ported. He was 83.  A bitter enemy of Communism, Mindszenty  was a refugee in the United States mission  in Budapest for nearly 15 years. Commu nists had tortured him and sentenced him  to life imprisonment in 1949 for fighting the  Red takeover of his country.  He spent 23 years of his life, except for four  days, either in prison or as a refugee in the  U.S. Mission, which he reluctantly left for  Rome in 1971 after the Hungarian govern ment granted him amnesty.  To be closer  to his homeland, he soon  moved  to Vienna, where he died  today. A  spokesman said the former primate of Hun gary underwent prostate surgery at Vienna  hospital this morning and died four hours  later from heart failure.  He was a symbol of life-long resistance to  Nazi and Communist tyranny.  When he was only a parish priest,  the  short-lived Communist government of Bela  Kun arrested him after World War I  for op opposition to the regime.  Nazis jailed him during World War II for  protesting the slaughter of Hungarian Jews.  Freed by Hungarian Freedom Fighters dur ing the 1956 uprising, he pledged ""Now  will continue where I had to leave off eight  years ago."" But his optimism was  short lived and he fled to the U.S. Mission five days  later when Soviet tanks crushed the revolt.  There he remained in self-imposed confine ment, a symbol of bitter opposition to the  Communist  government until  September,  1971, when age and falling health forced him  to leave Hungary for good.  Pope Paul VI removed the cardinal as pri mate of Hungary and Archbishop of Eszter gom on Feb. 5, 1974. Mindszenty empha.tl ca.lly denied that he stepped down volun tarily.  As h1s years in the U.S.  legation passed,  the gaunt churchman ceased to be a threat ening martyr in Communist eyes and there  was frequent specUlation that a change was  to be made in the cardinal's isolation.  I  In  April  1963,  for  example, Pope John  XXIII, who was anXious for M!ndszenty to  come to Rome, sent Franz Cardinal Koenig of  Austria to Budapest for secret talks with the  primate, reportedly to persuade him to accept  amnesty terms.

210,House,94,0.236,472,11,Mr. MYERS of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker,  those people who opposed our involve ment  in helping South Vietnam  :fight  communism were extremely vocal a few  years ago. Many of us have noted how  silent they have been as the Communists  were murdering and plundering South  Vietnam. A  friend of mine has written  his views on this. I share with you this  fine article:  VIETNAM 1975  (Submitted by Pastor R. L. Shotts, Fremont  Street  Baptist  Church,  Crawfordsville,  Ind.)  Where are  the Vietnam Peace Marchers  today? Where are those demonstrators who  worked so hard to get the United states out  of Vietnam, or at least to stop the U.S. from  bombing those ""poor little, defenseless"" Com munists in North Vietnam? Where are those  letter-writing Communist sympathizers who  wrote so much for peace, saying that the  U.S. was the aggressor and that those ""peace loving"" leaders of Hanoi were just defending  themselves and their people from the tm perialistic onslaughts of the capitalistic des pots in Washington, D.C.? Where are those  who said our servicemen, who are held as  prisoners of war by the Communists would  be released, if we got out? Where indeed are  rthose who have done nothing about the 1,500  men who are still unaccounted for by the  North Vietnamese? Where  are  those who  could not  in  their wildest  dreams  even  imagine that the Communists could ruth lessly shoot down women and children and  even bury many alive in trench-like graves  as they did outside the city of Hue?  Wherever they are, they should be hiding  their faces in shame, weeping over their sins,  and anxiously seeking God's mercy and for giveness, and if not that, they should be in stantaneously  transporlted  to flee  in terror  with the thousands upon thousands of dads  and moms and little children from the cities  like Pleiku, Kontum, Hue, and even Da Nang  who are right at this moment running for  their very lives from the Communist butchers  that delight  in hanging  the dismembered  pieces of  innocent girls and boys out for  display  to enforce  the  subjection of  the  population.  If the ""peace crowd"" should not like that  medicine so well, perhaps it would be enough  to have them visit in the 50,000 homes where  the best of America's manhood lived, where  there is an empty place now, because a boy  died defending places like Pletku or Kontum,  ",1975
211,Senate,94,0.495,576,11,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, a  few days  ago I was honored to have the oppor tunity  to  a  demonstration aircraft  for  the AWACS  system,  the airbome  warning .and control system. I must say,  Mr. President, that I was extremely im pressed with this system.  fashionable,  I  know,  to argue  that we are living in a postbomber mili tary situation now, and that we should  not continue development of bombers  ourselves, or defenses against bombers.  According to this line of argument, mis siles is the name of the game; bombers  are obsolete, and since missiles are so  hard to defend against, we should per haps not even try, relying only on the  MAD  strategy,  the mutual  assured  destruction.  Mr. President, I am not convinced by  this line of reasoning. It is true that our  bomber fteet is outmoded, and that we  do not seem to be very impressed with  a need to upgrade it. But I do not see  a similar reluctance on the part of other  to mention only the Union of  nations,  Soviet Socialist Republics by name. The  U.S.S.R. has not discontinued its con struction of aircraft, and in fact now has,  according to the London International  Institute for Strategic Studies 1974-75  report on military balance, a  fteet of  about 1,400 bombers each capable of  reaching major cities within the con tiguous 48 States. The United States  has  about  bombers  of  similar  capability.  As a military pilot myself, Mr. Presi dent, I  recognize the need for adequate  radar facilities  if bomber missions are  going to be successfully carried out or de fended against.

212,Senate,94,0.278,615,11,Mr. TAFT.," Mr. President, no one today  will seriously contest the fact that both  labor and !llanagement and their inter relationships constitute ""big business.""  I understand  it, one of  the prime  reasons  supporting  labor's exemption  from the ACA's coverage is the thought  that big labor and big business can take  care of themselves. In other words, each  is powerful enough in its own right so  that it can protect itself without a Gov ernment-sponsored advocate.  I am quite alarmed at this rationale  because it is my understanding, and the  understanding of  several of my  col leagues,  that the basic purpose of  the  Consumer Protection Agency Act is  to  protect the interests of consumers and  to promote consumer protection in the  United States. To that end, I oannot see  the wisdom of exempting labor from the  ambit  of  the  Consumer  Protection  Agency Act on the theory that it needs  no advocate or that labor and manage ment interrelationships and disputes are  too far removed from the marketplace to  have any impact on consumers. This ap proach avoids the realities of the marAs  ketplace and does not serve to promote  the consumer's manifest interests. I op pose a far-reaching blanket exemption  for  labor which would remove it from  the scrutiny of consumers through the  watchful eye of their representative or  advocate, the ACA Administrator.  The IJabor-Management Relations Acl  in several pertinent parts provides for  protections to persons, many of whom  are consumers. Under the present bill, of  course,  the ACA  is expressly excluded  from becoming involved with a ""labor  dispute"" within the meaning of section 2  of  this act. The fundamental question  that we must address is the following:  Is the NLRB specifically precluded from  taking into consideration the economic  effects of the practices that it regulates  and is it divorced from the interests of  consumers?  I submit that the answer is ""no,'' it is  not. The National Labor Relations Board  is specifically mandated to do  just the  opposite-to  take  into  consideration  those economic effects on consumers.  The NLRB's major function is to regu late unfair labor practices by employers  and labor organizations.  The National Labor Relations Act, un der which the NLRB functions, makes  clear that the decisions of the agency  were intended to have a substantial im pact upon the interest of consumers. The  congressional findings and policies set  forth in the act are, in pertinent part,  as follows:  The denial by some employers or the right  of employees to organize and the refusal by  some employers to a-ccept the procedure of  colleotive  barga.1ning  lead  and  to  other  forms of tndustriru strife or unrest,  which have the intent or the necessary effect  of burdening or obstruc'tlng oommeree by  impairing the effic'lency, safety, or op eration o!  the  merce;  (B)  occurring in the current com merce;  (C) materially affecting, restraining,  or controlling the flow of raw materials or  manufactured or p~t;>eessed goods  from or  into the channels of commerce, or the prices  of such materials or goods in commerce; or  instrumerutaJities o! com strikes  (D) oa.us1ng diminution of employment and  wage::,  in such volume as substa.nt1ally  impair or disrupt the market for goods flow ing from or inJto the ohannels of oommeree.  (Emphasis added.)  (A)  to  Experience has further demonstrated that  cerUM.n  pra.otices by some  labor organim tlons, their officers, and members have  the  intent or the necessary effect of burdening  or obstructing commerce by preventing the  free flow of goods in such commerce through  strikes and other forms of industrial unrest  or  through concerted activities which  im pair the  interest of the public in the tree  flow of such commerce. The elimination of  such practices  is a necessary condition  to  the assurance of the rights herein guaran teed. (Emphasis added.)  It lis declared to be the pollicy of the United  States  elimiilla.te  the causes of cerbain  subsba.ntla.l obstructions to the free fiow of  commerce and  to mitig.ate and  ellmlna..te  these  obstructions when  they  have  oc curred-29 U.S.C. § 151.  to  I submit that the statute itself gives  us guidance with regard to the issue of  whether the act was viewed by Congress  at the time of its passage as being remote  from marketplace consumer  interests.  The passages I have  just read clearly  establish that the matters with which the      Board is concerned are not private, they  are matters in the public interest, which  include the consumer interest.  Other passages in the statute readily  support this conclusion. Specifically, the  secondary boycott provisions of the act  as set forth in section 8(b) (4)  seek to  prevent a labor organization from unlaw fully enmeshing neutrals who might be  other employers or other persons includ ing employees and consumers from bemg  involved in a labor dispute which is not  their own or concerning which they have  no interest. Indeed, section 8(b) (4)  In  the proviso recognizes and permits pub licity, other than picketing, for the pur pose of truthfully advising  the public,  including consumers and members of a  labor organization,  that a product or  products are being produced by an em ployer with whom the labor organization  has a primary dispute.  Again,  section  8(b) (7) {c)  the  statute makes specific reference to the  protection of consumer  interests. The  proviso of this section states:  in  Provided further that nothing in this sub paragraph  (c)  shall be construed  to pro hibit any picketing or other publicity for  the purpose of truthfully advising the public  (including  consumers)  that an  employer  does not employ members, or have a con tract with, a.  labor organization, unless an  effect of such picketing  induce any  individual employed by any other person in  the course of this employment, to pick up,  deliver or transport any goods or not to per form any services.  to  is  I  submit  that  the statute makes  ft  abundantly clear that it was the intent  of Congress to recognize  the existence  of pubHc and consumer  interests and  that there is no logical justt:fication for  concluding that labor-management rela tions are too remote in time, space, and  effect to warrant elimination from the  coverage of an ACA.  Moreover, although the National La bor Relations Act is very clear on this  point, I submit the relevant court cases  are  just  as  clear  as  the  following  indicate:  The Board was created not to a.djustica.te  private controversy but to advance the pub lic  interest  in eliminating obstructions  to  interstate commerce. NLRB v. Fant Mill Co.,  1959, 79 S. Ct. 1179, 360 U.S. 301, 8 L. Ed. 2d  1243, on remand 272 F. 2d 773.  Board was created not to adjudicate private  controversies but to advance public interest  NLRB v. United Packinghouse Workers oi  America, AFL--CIO, C.A. 5, 1960, 275 F. 2d 816.  The Board was created to avoid, through  adjustment,  serious  labor disputes which  might hurt employers, employees, and the  public. NLRB v. Barrett Co., C.C.A. ru. 1941  120 F. 2d 583.  '  There is another aspect of the labor  issue which warrants examination Ac cording to my reading of the exemption  the ACA could not become involved tri  any matters concerning a ""labor agree ment"" within the meaning of title II,  section 201, of the Labor Management  Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 171. Of course  this title of the act refers to the con~  cillation of labor disputes in industries  affecting commerce and national emer gency disputes. As I view it, the role of  the ACA is to protect and promote the  ""interests  of  consumers""  by,  among  other  ways,  representing  consumers  ",1975
213,,94,0.416,641,11,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, Altoona,  Pa., Juniata shops of the Penn Central  Transportation Co. has set a new na tional safety  record  for  railroad and  transportation workers. At 3 p.m. on  Thursday, May 8,1975, the shops reached  its 1 millionth man-hour without a losttime accident.  This new record is so outstanding that  it staggers  the  imagination. In recent  C.XXI-878-Part 11  years, the American worker has taken  a ""bump rap"" in some circles, for alleg edly falling behind in productivity, qual ity craftmanship, and personal pride in  their work. This could not be farther  from the truth in Altoona, Pa. The en viable record of achievement set by the  thousands of employees at the Juniata  shops brings the fallacy of those conten tions home clearly and impressively.  This milestone brings home another  point as well. It goes far to solidifying  the wisdom and credibility of the U.S.  Railway Association, which earlier this  year designated the Juniata shops as the  key locomotive repair facility in the new  Consolidated Railroad network. That se lection could not look better now, and  the care and professionalism with which  the employees of the Juniata shops carry  out their duties will be a prime moving  force in getting our Nation's railroads  back on the right track.  Many congratulations are in order, Mr.  Speaker. Mr. Joseph S. Fadale, general  manager  of  Penn Central's Altoona  shops, deserves the accolades of all of us  for making safety a primary factor in  the operation of  the shops, Mr. R. C.  Ambelang, general superintendent of the  Juniata shops, has earned our praise for  instilling in the employees a fundamental  concern for their safety and the safety  of their coworkers. All the union leaders  merit a strong vote of thanks for their  constant encouragement to make safety  a priority concern. And, of course, the  record could not have been set without  ",1975
214,,94,-0.477,654,11,Mr. HARRINGTON.," Mr. Speaker, the  Christian Mission  to  the Communist  world has recently made serious allega tions about the persecution of Christians  in Romania. I am inserting in the REc ORD, for the benefit of my colleagues, a  telegram I received from the mission dis cussing these allegations in detail.  If these charges are even partially  true, they indicate a flagrant violation of  the United Nations Universal Declara tion of Human Rights.  I  urge  every  Member to express his or her outrage at  this situation to the Department of State  and the Romanian Government.  The text of the telegram follows:  Representative MICHAEL HARRINGTON,  U.S. House oj Representatives,  Washington, D.C.  Dear sir: We protest  the persecution of  Christians which 1s expressly undertaken 1n  Roma.nla. For your  information, here are  some facts proving that Christians are per secuted in Communist Romania.;  A Christian by the name of Vasile Ra.s col, 12 Dr. Ma.rinescu Street, Bucharest, was  arrested on May 25, 1974, on account of dis tributing bibles and Christian literature and  sentenced to two years. His only crime: pos sessing bibles. This arrest would seem flag rantly to contradict the principle of religious  liberty which had been proclaimed over the  radio by President Cea.usescu.  Lately many fines were given to believers  who were found praying. The pollee can enter  homes without warrants, even days after  prayer meetings took place and fine the be lievers with enormous fines. Retired people  who get a. couple hundred lei, received fines  of thousands of lei, even chlldren are fined.  The  following  have been  fined  1000  lei:  Brother Turturea.n, Village Pa.trauti, Region  Sucea.va.i; Brother Nica, Village Ma.ierush  Jud, Brasov; Brother Radu, V11lage Sin Pet ru, Jud, Brasov; Brother Lingura.ru Nicula.e  of the Village Herculean, Jud.

215,Senate,94,-0.379,706,11,Mr. MUSKIE.," Mr. President, I am de lighted  to  join  in cosponsoring  these  amendments to S. 1426, the Older Amer icans Act Amendments of 1975. These  amendments address the serious, chronic  problems of the elderly  living in rural  areas by requiring a more equitable dis tribution of assistance under the Older  Americans Act between urban and rural  areas.  I am particularly sensitive to problems  faced by our rural elderly because of the  nature of my home State of Maine.  Currently, Maine has the fourth larg est percentage of elderly population in  the Nation, and projections indicate that  by 1980 we may well lead the country in  the proportion of our population classi fied as elderly.  At  the same  time, Maine is a  rural  State, with no town or city larger than  65,000 population and often with large  distances between centers of population  which provide services such as medical  and dental care and a choice of markets  or shops.  This means that many of our elderly  live in areas cut off from social contacts,  without easy access to health care, with  no transportation other than the auto mobile, and out of touch with the senior  citizens centers, nutrition programs, and  agencies  to which our more urban el derly can go to for help.  Often they are trying to maintain their  own home, and their greatest concern is  improving the quality of their lives by  their own actions--to continue an in dependent existence. The difference be tween  success  and  failure  for  them  could simply be access to transportation,  the occasional company of a volunteer  worker, or the knowledge of Federal pro grams available to help them repair their  homes.  The amendments being introduced to day could well provide  that relatively  small r..cded zervice which would  t'.!low  these elderly  to keep  their homes and  remain in their communities.  I am certain that there is no shortage  of imaginative ideas and approaches at  the local level to help the rural elderly.  In western Maine, one experimental  project is Project Independence, which  serves a  three-county area. The execu tive director, Harold Collins, wrote that:  We have  .  .  . become a. model for other  States, areas, or cities to follow.  Project Independence hopes to expand  services  to more rural areas next year  if the necessary funds are made avail able.  Mr. President, the amendments intro duced today require no new funds. They  merely would end an unintentional dis crimination against our rural elderly in  the allocation of Federal resources set  aside to improve the lives of our older  citizens.

218,House,94,0.213,810,11,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  say that I strongly support overriding the  President's veto on the farm bill. I grew  up on a family farm. That farm is still  my home. I was there last weekend and  I  talked with my parents--who  still  operate our  farm-and  some  of our  neighbors. Mr. Speaker, I can assure you  that both consumers and farmers will  benefit from the override of  this veto.  Family farms such as those which popu late eastern South Dakota will be a thing  of the past without some help. Numerous  studies  by  independent  groups  have  demonstrated  that  family-sized  farms  are the most efilcient units of agricultural  production-thus  consumers will  .ulti mately suffer from a destruction of fam ily-sized  farms. Mr. Speaker,  I  plead  with this House to recognize the long-run  interests of farmers and consumers by  overriding this veto today.  ",1975
219,House,94,0.372,810,11,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, I come to  the well today as a Member representing  a farm district. As a matter of fact I am  one of only 41 or 42 Members of  this  House whose districts are still considered  to be rural in nature. I have had exactly  two letters from farmers urging me to  override the President's veto of this farm  bill.  Regardless of your feelings about Sec retary Earl Butz, he has given real lead ership in turning us around from the  discredited program of the past. We now  have a reasonably free market in agri culture and that is what we have been  st1iving for.  Just a few years ago these control pro grams under which we were operating  then were costing $3.5 billion not to in crease production but  in payments  to  farmers to decrease production, and we  were paying over $1 million a day in  storage costs. In the agricultural appro priation bills we  brought before  this  House in years past, we have had vast  sums amounting to billions of dollars to  restore  the capital  impairment of  the  Commodity Credit Corporation. Some of  this restoration was 7 years in arrears,  all with carrying charges costing the tax payers dearly and charged against the  farmers.  In the past 3 years the $4 billion we  were spending for payments to farmers  not to grow and for storage .costs are  now going for food stamps for the poor.  That is a good argument it seems to me  to sustain the veto for the Members from  urban districts.  The fact that this $4 billion that initi ally was going for payments to farmers  not to grow and for storage costs and  which is now going for food stamps is the  big significant transformation that has  taken  place  and  big  city members  should take special note of this.  But it is good more importantly for the  thinking farmers who will remember how  our warehouses under the old program  were bulging with surpluses, and when ever the Commodity Credit Corporation  felt disposed to do so it could dump the  surpluses on the market and the poor  farmer was then helpless. And make no  mistake about it, that was taking place  in those days.  And  if  the CCC did not reduce  its  stocks by selling in the open market, we  also heard from Members of Congress  who were crying all over about tht exor bitant prices being paid for  increased  storage costs. Those of us from the farm  districts, with only 42 or 43 votes were  helpless in making an argument to the  contrary. It seems to me the farmers of  those days were taking a bum rap for  something not of  their own doing but  something which was imposed on them  'by  the Congress--a  rigidly  controlled  price support program.  Today, we are doing all right. We have  broadly expanded our markets abroad  to dispose of our surpluses for dollars.  As a matter of fact its the bright spot in  our balance of payments--something in  the range of $24 billion of sales abroad  this past year.  The  distinguished majority  leader  made a remark earlier that the farmers  are getting less than 4 cents for a loaf of  bread which is costing the consumers 40  cents, but years ago when a loaf of bread  was  costing  consumers  20  cents  the  farmer was getting less than 2 cents of  ",1975

222,House,94,0.419,823,11,Mr. KINDNESS.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I must express a con cern that many Americans would feel,  upon having a good look at the bill that  is before us. That concern arises out of  the fact  that this  is another subsidy,  another substitution of  the  taxpayers'  dollar for the dollars that would ordi narily be spent elsewhere in our economy.  In this case; because of  the economic  .conditions, I suspect that the travel and  tourism industry of the States and locali ties that would normaly be advertising  more have cut back  their advertising  budgets. It has happened in all kinds of  advertising budgets all over the country.  Now, we are asking to devote the tax payers' dollars to fill in that gap. I sus pect most America1-:s would find this a  repugnant concept, especially with the  tax burden resting somewhere close  to  40 percent of the national income. The  taxpayers do not want the Congress to  decide to use their tax dollars in such  ways as this.  Mr. Chairman, I would strongly urge  defeat of the bill.  The CHAIRMAN.  If there  are  no  further amendments, under the rule, the  Committee rises.  Accordingly the Committee rose; and  the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. McFALL)  having assumed the chair, Mr. MIKVA,  Chairman  of  the Committee  of  the  Whole House on the State of the Union,  reported  that that Committee, having  had under .consideration the bill  (H.R.  5357)  to authorize appropriations to the  Secretary of Commerce for the promo tion of tourist travel, pursuant to House  Resolution 445, he reported the bill back  to the House.

223,House,94,-0.539,836,11,Mr. DIGGS.," Mr. Speaker, throughout  the last few years of deteriorating U.S.  policy in Africa-and especially with re gard to the liberation of Southern Afri c~I have warned that change is com ing  in Southern Africa with our help,  or without it. I have stressed that the  future of U.S. public and private  in terests  in Southern Africa was being  jeopardized by-our shortsighted posture,  and that a dramatic escalation of vio lence over  there  is  inevitable without  conscientious action on the part of the  United States and other world powers  to encourage an end to apartheid and  minority  dominion  through  peaceful  means.  The  coup  in Portugal which over threw the Caeteno regime on April 25,  1974, came about in large part as a re sult of the success of wars of liberation  waged in Portugal's African colonies. In ternational recognition of the independ ence of Guinea-Bissau, and the impend ing  independence of Mozambique and  Angola have had a profound impact in  Africa. These events make it imperative  that the United States seriously reex amine its policy and behavior with re spect to Southern Afric~as others are  already doing. On April 7-11, the Orga nization of African Unity held a special  session at Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, for  this purpose. The opening remarks of  the President of Tanzania before  the  delegates  to  that meeting make clear  that my  concerns  about  the present  status and apparent future direction of  U.S.  foreign policy  in Africa are not  without foundation. Continued inatten tion on our part could have unfortunate  consequences for ourselves and for our  friends.  It would indeed be a serious error on  our parts if we ignore all the early warn ings. We must not allow ourselves to be  deluded by the recent public relations  initiatives of the South African Govern ment to convince  the world that it is  seriously moving  toward meaningful  change, and that there is detente and  dialog between itself and other African  governments. There is a depth of feel ing, which we should not underestimate,  behind President Nyerere's declaration:  I believe that whether we are dealing with  Portugal or South Africa., the principle 1s the  same:  if they are ready to talk about de colonisation, we talk;  if they are not ready  to talk, we fight until they are ready.  Mr. Speaker, the Dar-es-Salaam de claration, which has already been entered  into the RECORD, gives ample indication  that Africa is united on this point. The  alternative to peaceful change is war in  Southern Africa. I would urge my col leagues to give close attention to Presi dent Nyerere's speech, which I hereby  submit for  inclusion  in  I  would further urge that we waste no time  in bringing our full support to bear to ward policies that may enable a peace ful transition in Southern Africa, leMt  we find ourselves again allied with the  forces seeking to repress the indomina table spirit of people seeking to be free.  The speech follows:  the RECORD.  TEXT OF THE SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE OPEN ING SESSION OF THE OAU COUNCIL OF THE  MINISTERS SPECIAL SESSION BEING HELD IN  DAR-E8-SALAAM BY  JULIUS K. NYERERE,  PRESIDENT OF TANZANIA  Your Excellencies, Friends,  it gives me  great  pleasure to welcome you to this OAU  Conference of Foreign Ministers,  and  to  DAR-Es-sALAAM. I do so on behalf of all  the people of the United Republic of Tan zania as well as on my own behalf. We hope  that your stay in our country will be com fortable and pleasant so  that your heavy  responsil>llities to Africa can be discharged  without unnecessary strain or personal dis tress.  I do not  intend  to make a  long speech  today. Instead, a paper has been made avail able to Ministers which sets out the Tan zanian position on the subject to which this  meeting will be addressing  itself. We hope  that Ministers will find this paper helpful  in their important task.  .  But  the paper we have circulated gives  only a Tanzanian view of the matters under  discussion. And the important thing is not  the view of any one country. The important  thing Is the united view of Africa as a whole.  For the objective of this meeting, like others  we have held  in  the past,  is  to promote  the cause of African liberation and African  unity. These are the two major objectives of  the Organisation of African Unity and they  are  really  two aspects of  the same thing.  Neither is possible without the other.  The connection between unity and  the  freedom  struggle has  always been  recog nised by the OAU and experience has con firmed  that knowledge. For,  the degree of  our advance toward the ultimate liberation  of our continent, the increasing internation al awareness of the Southern African prob lem and the increasing world condeinDatlon  of colonialism and racialism is not the result  of any one event nor of any one Nation or  Group's activity.  It is Africa's steady and united hammering  at conference after conference, visit after  visit,  and newspaper article  after article,  which has led to a  recognition that world  peace and human dignity require justice in  Southern Africa. This campaign has not been  waged only by Africa or by Africans; but the  unity and common purpose of Africa have  been and still are essential for progress.  There has never been any problem about  united verbal condemnation of colonialism  and  apartheid. But gradually, with  some  faltering  and  setbacks, Africa  has  also  secured a  large degree of unity in action.  There have been many other  factors  in volved  in the continued  lsolatlon of  the  Smtth Regime over nine and a half years.  But not least among these factors has been  the clear knowledge that recognition of this  regime or open Government support for lt  by any country would arouse the whole of  Africa to angry retaliation.

Szostak)  The news of the death of Josef Cardinal  Mindszenty, strong willed former Primate of  Hungry who became the symbol of freedom,  has come as a shock to all, especially to those  who have known the Cardinal and worked  with hiin in his years of exile. Almost a year  ago to the day Washington was fortunate to  have Cardinal Mindszenty as an honored  guest of  the  city,  the Congress  and  the  Archdiocese.  For me his passing was  a personal  loss  because during  this  two day visit,  I was  privileged  to be his personal photographer  who covered his Washintgon visit from begin ning  to end. The  feeling and observation  that I gathered during those two days was  as though I was covering a Saint. Right I  was because Cardinal Mindszenty is a Saint  of our times.  During tho~e close photographic moments  especially  in  private  one  could  capture  through t~e lens of the camera the suffering  he bas gone through, his love for God. his  love for Holy Mother the Church, his love for  mankind and his s'Jecial affection for chil dren. At one private-moment as he was pray ing having his eyes fixed on the crucifix one  could see tears come down his cheek, I was  moved  to do  the same. In le~ving to give  him privacy, the Cardinal said, ""Please stay  my son"" this I will never forget, his humillty  and kindness. I had the same feeling as the  author of  the book  titled  ""Journal of  a  Soul""  the  private moments with  Pope  John XXIII.  Finally to personify his greatness one can  best put it in these words:  The Church and the world will mourn for  they have lost a great example of our faith  and patron of freedom.  The Church and the world will remember  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  him as the man of the hour who has stood  for the Church in ita darkest hours.  The Church and the world w111 write trib ute and finally  remember him as a Saint  of our time.  WILL THE UNITED STATES  WEAKEN ISRAEL?  HON. JONATHAN B.

225,,94,0.253,888,11,Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT.," Mr. Speak er, the month of May atfords U'3 an ap propriate opportunity  to highlight the  enormous and  integral  role played by  radio in our everyday lives, for May is  traditionally National Radio Month.  In the rapid pace of life, we unfortu nately take many things for granted and  too often tend to forget the influence on  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  May 13, 1975  to  and enrichment of our lives by many of  our surroundings. The radio is as power ful and forceful an influence as any other  form of communication. I am, therefore,  privileged to focus attention on National  Radio Month and on  the outstanding  men and women throughout the Nation  whose etforts not only insure the dissemi nation of new.s and information, but who  are concerned and involved citizens as  well.  The local radio stations managers play  a maJor role in the community. They op erate small business and, as anyone who  is an independent businessperson can tell  you, they have their share of problems.  The demands made upon them are ex tensive and they are continually called  upon to meet the requirements of Gov ernment regulation. The station mana gers are alert to any potential threat to  our freedom of speech and expression  and  they  insure that those rights are  safeguarded. This is not always an easy  task.  Often, the managers wear many hats:  News director, program director, sales  manager, and announcer. But, moreover,  they make  invaluable contributions  to  public  service and  the community.  They must recognize the deep interre lation of  countless major  issues  and  events of the day and must understand  their current and potential impact upon  our lives. I believe they approach these  responsibilities with objectivity and con cern.  Every  community has  its  share of  emergencies or crises. Certainly, when  tragedy or disaster befalls a community,  the local radio personnel can point with  enormous pride, as can the entire broad casting industry, to their record of public  service. They are right there-involved,  concerned, and contribute to achieving  order, assuaging the concerns and fears  of the people.  In the Third District of Arkansas, we  can boast of a group of outstanding radio  stations. They enrich the quality of life  for Arkansans, providing not only enter tainment, but a meaningful link to the  entire world and the entire spectrum of  broadcasting-civil,  cultural,  national,  and international. Radio enables us  view the world more realistically and ob jectively. Like a bridge, it enables us to  expand our horizons. It can free us from  ignorance and helps us better understand  the world we live in.  Mr. Speaker,  I  know  that our col leagues join me in commending the thou sands of men and women across the Na tion who are involved in and associated  with the medium of radio. Their contri butions are important and noteworthy  enough to warrant an entire month of  national  observance-National  Radio  Month.  to  PLIGHT OF GOLDSTEIN BROTHERS  IN U.S.S.R.  HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 13, 1975  ",1975
226,,94,-0.473,888,11,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, for the  past few years a number of citizens in  to  my district have been deeply involved in  the struggle of two Soviet citizens, Greg ory and Isai Goldstein to obtain permis sion to emigrate to Israel. Focus on the  plight of  the Goldsteins resulted from  personal contact with them by Mrs. Silvia  Thaler of Los Angeles. In addition  maintaining continuing contact with the  Goldsteins, Mrs. Thaler enlisted the as sistance of the late Rabbi Dr. Max Nuss baum. Dr. Nussbaum, in turn, encouraged  his  congregation at Temple  Israel of  HollyWood to join with other interested  groups in a concerted etfort to help the  Goldstein brothers in their fight for free dom. That fight has reached a critical  stage.  Both of  the Goldstein brothers are  physicists who specialize in automation.  They have  long since despaired of ob serving their ethnic and religious con victions in the Soviet Union. They, there fore, applied for permission to emigrate  to Israel in December of 1971. Since that  time they have been subjected to all man ner of harassment, intimidation, and per secution.  Gregory and Isai Goldstein of Tbilisi  in the Republic of Georgia, U.S.S.R., are  classic victims of the Soviet system. On  one occasion, their homes were searched  in predawn hours for ""slanderous mate rials."" Among the items confiscated were  a Hebrew language textbook, Israeli pho nograph records, several copies of  the  U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, and  three  sacred  scrolls-Mezuzos. After  much harassment and repeated arrests,  legal proceedings against the Goldsteins  were dropped. It is their belief that they  were spared prison or labor camp sen tences only by the scope and intensity  of interest in their case in Western coun tries.  The burdens and responsibilities of the  Goldsteins increased greatly when, in De cember 1973,  Isai's wife, Elizabeta Bi cova, gave birth to their first child whom  they named Abraham.  In addition  caring  for  themselves,  the Goldstein  brothers must now concern  themselves  with supporting a young mother and in fant. Of course, the desire to emigrate is  greater than ever because of Isai and  Elizabeta's hope of rearing their son in  an environment where a fully Jewish life  is possible. The most immediate difficulty,  however,  is  that of providing  for  the  minimum needs of the family, as they are  not able to work.  For several years now, both Goldstein  brothers have been denied the right to  work. Though both have  applied  for  emigration, both are ""refuseniks"" whose  requests are invariably rejected. In per fect Orwellian logic, the Soviet authori ties-who have denied employment  to  the Goldsteins-are now asking why the  Goldsteins are not engaged in productive  work.  to  As a  result of their involuntary un employment, as well as their statements  of protest, possession of  incriminating  reading material and similar forbidden  exercises of religion and exPression, the  Goldsteins  now  face  charges  for  the  grave  crimes  of  ""slandering  Soviet  reality"" and ""antistate activities.""  Under the Article Code of the Soviet  Union, Gregory and Isai Goldstein, upon  conviction of  the  charges  threatened  ",1975
227,Senate,94,-0.145,1018,11,Mr. NUNN.," I  thank the chairman, my  colleague from Maine, and I  certainly  have no points to cast on him. I under stand  the exigencies he was operating  under and I certainly understand the cir cumstances.  I do hope in the future that on mat ters as important as this conference re port and  the budget  resolution,  there  would at least be notification by the vari ous members of the committee that are  handling the matter even though no roll call vote is contemplated. I would hope  under  normal  circumstances-and  know this morning's circumstances were  not normal-there would be a  rollcall  vote on something setting  the overall  level of the Government expenditure for  the fiscal year that is forthcoming.  Mr. President, first of all I object to the  conference report for a  reason  that I  think many Members share, and that is  that the overall deficit is too high. It does  go up considerably from the Senate def icit, but I also understand the conferees  have to reach a compromise, and that is  not the major point I would like to make  today.  The major point I would like to make  is  that when we started this year, the  administration requested an outlay ceilI  I  I  ing of $94 billion, and at the very begin ning of this process Senator McCLELLAN  announced, after due deliberation and  study of the defense budget, that he felt  we could cut $5.2 billion off budget au thority and $2.1 billion out of outlays.  The net result of this budget resolu tion which has just passed is that we will  be cutting out of outlays or we possibly  can be cutting out of outlays certainly  a minimum of $3.3 billion.  The other point I would like to make  is that this is not really the most likely  outcome. The most likely outcome is that  we are going to be cutting $5.1 billion out  of outlays.  The reason for this is, I suppose, a lit tle complicated, but it needs some ex planation.  In the report that the conferees pass ed, they make it clear on page 9 that  the conference report sets a total target  limitr---and this is a  target, not an ab solutely binding limit--a target limit of  $90.7 billion on outlays for the Defense  Department--a $3.3 billion cut from the  President's request.  But unlike any other department in  Government,  they have a provision on  page 4 in discUssing the national defense  budget, labeled (a) on page 4, that states  as follows:  (a) If Congress should decide not to llmlt  increases in defense salaries and retirement  allowances, there are sufficient funds within  thls total to support that decision.  Mr. President, what this means is that  if we do not go along with the request  of the President of the United States to  put a 5-percent cap on military and  civilian salaries of employees of the Fed eral Government, then that $1.8 billion  additional cost, according to the Budget  Conference Committee report, can come  out of the $90.7 billion in outlays.  If we assume for a moment that the  cap will be removed by Congress-in all  likelihood it will be, based on the House  resoluti,on which has already passed then that means that instead of a $90.7  billion outlay ceiling, what we practically  have as a real target is an $88.9 billion  ceiling.  I am not here, Mr. President, to take  a position at this time one way or the  other about whether these caps are de sirable, or whether  there should be a  full cost-of-living allowance. That is not  the purpose of this colloquy. But I  think  we should assume a couple of things for  a moment: No.  1,  that  this  budget  resolution  is  a  serious  resolution; No.  2,  that  the  targets,  even  though  they are targets, are the basis on which.  the total has been arrived at. If we start  exceeding these targets on various items,  like national defense and others, instead  of having an estimated deficit of about  $68.8 billion, we will have a deficit much  larger than that as we proceed through  the years.

230,House,94,-0.493,1057,11,Ms. HOLTZMAN.," Mr. Speaker, in re luctantly supporting the conference re port on the first joint resolution on the  budget, I do not wish to indicate com plete approval of it. Among my reserva tions about  this congressional budget  are the following:  First. It allows an  inflationary $4.5  billion increase in defense spending;  Second. It does not reflect a careful  scrutiny of the military budget, nor any  study of intelligence spending;  Third. It does not contain adequate  stimulus for the economy, accepting in stead an unemployment rate in excess  of 7 percent for fiscal year 1976;  Fourth. It provides only minimal as sistance to State and local governments  in dire financial straits because of the  recession; and  Fifth.  It contains  an unnecessarily  high deficit because the Budget Commit tees did not make and because they were  so newly created could not make a sub stantial effort to close tax loopholes and  eliminate wasteful spending.  Nonetheless, I am supporting this reso lution because  it  is a  substantial  im provement over the President's budget,  and because it represenst Congress' first  attempt to exercise unified control over  Federal revenues and expenditures.  The  President,s  budget  called  for  greatly  increased defense spending-to  I  $94 billion, $3.3 billion higher than this  resolution-while starving vital programs  to meet human needs and combat the  recession. It sought to take away from  CXXI--904-Part 11  elderly and disabled Americans their le gally mandated and desperately needed  cost-of-living increases. It anticipated an  unemployment rate close to 8 percent for  fiscal 1976. It sought cuts in health care,  education, aid to the elderly, and in fact,  in every category of Federal expenditure  except energy and defense. The confer ence report makes significant improve ments in each of these areas.  Most  importantly,  the Congress has  shown, in this resolution, its intention to  assert its constitutional power over the  Federal budget. The Federal budget de termines the allocation of economic ac tivity between the public and private sec tors.  The  budget  also  describes  the  choices of which public programs are  supported and how well they are to be  funded. It is here that the questions of  national  priorities  are most  squarely  faced.  Control over the Federal budget, there fore, gives the Congress the opportunity  to tackle such issues as the cost to Amer ica of  its unconscionably high  infant  mortality rate, of lost productive capac ity through debilitating hunger and a  too high rate of illiteracy, of our decay ing urban centers and deteriorating mass  transit systems. Preparing a budget also  requires that we look into the waste and  inefficiencies produced by counterpro ductive Government regulation and tax  incentives.  As a member of  the House Budget  Committee, I criticized its failure to un dertake the comprehensive review of na tional priorities that I believed was nec essary and was its responsibility. I have  reservations about  this  resolution be cause it does not reflect such a review.  I  support the resolution, however, be cause I believe that it is a first ste~an  essential first step but a wobbly one toward  the redirecting of Federal ex penditures, by the Congress, toward this  country's basic human needs.  ",1975
231,House,94,-0.658,1057,11,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Chairman, I made  known my opposition to the House budg et  resolution when  it passed  through  the Chamber 2 weeks ago. I was 1 of 19  Members who voted against that reso lution not because we were hypnotized  by a deficit figure but because the budg et really did not reflect any kind of pol icy that this Government ought to en gage  in or any objectives  that ought  to logically flow from the budget. It did  not seek to remedy in more than a per functory way the tremendous economic  crisis engulfing this country. Specifically,  it did not attempt to reduce to any mean ingful extent the depression level of un employment which exists in many parts  of  the country and which  is growing  worse daily.  Rather, the preoccupation of so many  members was with the deficit as if that  were  the measuring stick by which  to  develop a budget. In this, I  think they  were seriously in error.  I strongly oppose  the present con ference report for different reasons than  the gentleman from Georgia, and I  think  it is time that many of us who represent  I  areas where unemployment and ravaged  cities are creating more and more of a  problem realize that we cannot go back  to our constituents talking about some  intangible notion of a deficit when the  fact of the matter is that we are not  creating a full-production economy; we  are not stimulating employment;  and  we are not adding to the gross national  product.  As has been previously acknowledged,  the necessity of a deficit stems from the  deteriorated economy in the first place,  not from reckless Government spending.  If unemployment stood at 4 percent,  the President's budget would have ex hibited a $12 billion surplus rather than  a $51.9 billion deficit, and likewise the  congressional budget would  also have  c'IP.monstrated a sizeable surplus.  But the House's budget resolution was  aimed at a 7.4 percent unemployment  rate by the end of fiscal 1976; that was  the most optimistic  forecast  that  the  authors of the resolution could venture.  Time and again Members of the House  were told in discussions with the chair man and staff of the Budget Committee  that 7.4 percent was the lowest rate of  unemployment we could realistically ex pect  to achieve; and we were warned  that if the present policies do not work,  which I believe they will not, the rate  will probably be somewhat higher.  find that the present conference re port embodies all the deficiencies of the  original House budget resolution and is  in fact worse than the resolution that  narrowly passed the House. Instead of  putting money  into people  and  jobs,  which it would seem conscience should  dictate in this depressed  time, we are  pouring more mopey into that bottom less sieve at the Defense Department.  The conferees added an additional half  billion dollars  to  the already bloated  level of defense spending when instead  they should have been looking for ways  to channel more money into the civilian  sector of the economy, where the benefits  would  have  been  real  rather  than  imagined.  As Prof. Seymour Melman of Columbia  University has so ably pointed out, the  excess billions of dollars that are rou tinely being pumped into lavish and un necessary  defense  spending  programs  are depriving  the productive,  civilian  economy of needed investment capital,  technological  resources,  and  research  and  development  capital. The  $1,500  billion that the United States has put  into  creating  a  sustained  military  economy is equal  to 63 percent of  the  total money value of everything that is  manmade on the surface of the United  States. The permanent war economy, in  which  the Federal Government  uses  more than half its tax revenue to pay for  past,  :present, and future wars, causes  the decay from within of the country's  relative production capabilities, resulting  in the loss of millions of jobs.  If the Federal Government had spent  the $39.7 billion which it had proposed  to spend at the end of the Vietnam hos tilities  for  fiscal year 1972-from the  vantage point of 1969-in the areas of  education, manpower,  social  services,  ",1975
232,House,94,0.355,1070,11,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise today to express strong misgivings  about the new funding authority con tained in this bill. This legislation pro poses to authorize the appropriation of  such sums as may be necessary for the  payment of costs  incurred  in helping  Southeast Asian refugees. I believe that  American has a clear responsibility to as sist these people. This legislation declares  that the Congress recognizes and accepts  that responsibility. I do not quarrel with  that aspect of the legislation.  However, I do have deep reservations  about any funding approach that adds to  the current $50 billion to $70 blllion Fed eral deficit. I am particularly concerned  about any approach that does not take  into account the possibility of utilizing  existing, but unexpended funds.  lieve we can do it without further adding  to the staggering Federal deficit.  I am suggesting that the Congress pro vide for the reallocation of any and all  Department of Defense Southeast Asian  .military and economic assistanc.e funds  the Southeast Asian migration and  refugee assistance program. Testimony  made on the :floor of the other body by  Senator HA""rFIELD 1n the introduction of  Senate bill 1696 suggested that there may  be possibly $147 million in unexpended  funds in the pipeline.

Mr. Chairman, the class to which H.R.  6755 addresses itself is to aliens who, in  turn, meet  other  requirements  con tained within the legislation The per manent legislation to which this pending  legislation is related, since this is tempo rary legislation, is Public Law 87-510, the  Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of  1962 which also deals with aliens as a  class to which that legislation pertains.

238,,94,-0.514,1148,11,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, while the  average American  is currently  feeling  the recessionary crunch as we approach  the Bicentennial,  the  average  black  American has consistently suffered eco nomic recession, if not depression, irre gardless of the health of the economy.  Although we are fully a ware of this im balance, there is a much more stubborn  force  that maintains and perpetuates  these inequities. Therefore, the progress  that is  thought to have been made by  blacks in this country, is not really prog ress at all, as statistics continue to show  that the discrepancy between white and  black attainment continues to grow.  Our distinguished colleague, the Hon orable WILLIAM L. CLAY has addressed  this problem in a  recent column in the  I would like to share it  Bo~ton Globe.  with my colleagues at this point in the  RECORD:  How MUCH PROGRESS HAVE BLACKS MADE?  (By WILLIAM L. CLAY)  Many blacks,  to remain sane no doubt,  grow up in America believing that discrimi nation and inequality illustrate nothing more  than a  long-term historical event. Slavery,  then emancipation; segregation, then a suc cessful  civil  rights movement.  Progress?  Doubtless. But  coming  down  from  our  euphoria, we've learned in the last eight years  or so that some of the problems are a great  deal more intractable (if soluble at all) than  those mere  legal barriers  to  fundamental  civil rights.  Beneath that thin layer of courts and leg islatures  lies  the whole American  institu tional infrastructure, resistant and poisoned  to the core-universities and public school  systems, businesses, city halls, labor unions,  families and neighborhoods, police depart ments, fire departments and on and on. The  results are socio-economic statistical meas urements that show our relative status in  America as largely unchanged.  Let's look at  the most recent record in  the salient categories:  Income:  the median income for  white families 1n America was $12,600. For  black families it was only $7270. From 1969  to 1973, the median income for white fam ilies grew. For black  families,  it did not,  meaning the income differential is widening,  not narrowing, (Other evidence suggest it has  widened still more since 1973.) Even  the  much sought after college degree has given  false promises.  a. black with four  years of college made $8715, a mere $102 more  than a white with four years of high school.  The white college graduate made over $11,000. It's no small wonder then that in 1973,  31.4 percent of all blacks found themselves  below the low income level of $4540, a plight  endured by only 8.4 percent whites.  Employment: In a trend that has persisted  1n an even trajectory since the Korean War,  blacks a.nd other minorities are twice as like ly to be unemployed as whites, black teens  over 2% times as likely as white teens. How ever high the overall rate is, the American  formula  instructs us  to double it for  the  black rate.  Education: In 1973, 8.3 percent of blacks  between 25 and 34 had completed four years  In 1969  In 1973  May 14, 1975  of college. For whites, the figure was 19 per cent.  Family: Between 1965 and 1974, the pro portion of black families headed by a woman  rose  from 24  to 34 percent. Among white  families, only a  slight  increase was  regis tered-from 9 percent to 10 percent.  Housing:  In 1970, 23 percent of the 6.2  milllon housing units occupied by blacks  were classl.fied as ""substandard."" The cor responding white rate was only 7 percent.  Health: For the last two decades, the in fant mortality rate for blacks has been ap proxlmately double the rate for whites and  black mothers stlll die in childbirth at about  flve  times the rate of their white counter parts. But if we have a harder time coming  into this world, we have an easier time going  out. Among blacks, the average life expect ancy is now 69.3  for females and 61.2  for  males. Corresponding figures for whites are  75.6 and 68.3 years, a better than six-year  differential.  These are the real indices of residual rac ism and stubborn inequality in America to day. And 1f the barriers are less visible they  are  indeed more damaging to our psyches  and material welfare precisely because they  are less visible.  It would appear that, the great victories  taken into account, black Americans have  little to celebrate in this nation's Bicenten nial.  DEFICITS DESTROY JOBS  HON. JOHN M. ASHBROOK  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 14, 1975  ",1975
239,,94,0.612,1148,11,Mr. ASHBROOK.," Mr. Speaker, today  the House of Representatives adopted a  budget that calls for a $68.8 billion def icit for the next fiscal year. This would  be  the  largest deficit  in our Nation's  history.  Liberal economic theorists argue that  such a large budget deficit will stimulate  the economy and produce jobs. In reality,  however, large deficits destroy jobs.  this so? Deficits must be fi Why  is  nanced. Simply stated, financing takes  place by printing more money, borrowing  more money, or a mixture of both.  Printing more money with no backing  leads  to greater  inflation and higher  prices. Federal Government borrowing  results in crowding out others who are  trying to borrow. This harms industries  like construction which are so dependent  on credit.  When the Government has to borrow  more and more, it crowds out mortgage  money. Money and resources are taken  from mortgages and construction loans  for homes, and commercial and indus trial building.  It has been estimated that for every  $10 billion the Federal Government bor rows, 500,000 new housing starts can not begin due to lack of mortgage funds.  This lack of housing starts results in the  direct loss of over 1 million jobs and the  indidect loss of over 2 million more in  affiliated  industries. The  construction  industry depends on supplies made by  numerous other industries-from plumb ing equipment to paints to nails to elec trical appliances.  In a  recent advertisement the AFL",1975
240,House,94,0.177,1174,11,Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama.," Mr.  Speaker, I am very proud of our coun try and our President today. When the  chips were down, we did not shirk our re sponsibility in a time of crisis.  The President did a superb job of deal ing with a very tense situation concern ing the Cambodian seizure of the Maya guez. He tried every diplomatic a venue,  but when  these avenues  turned out to  be deadend streets, he moved decisively  With a  restrained use of our military  forces  to protect American  lives  and  property.  It grieves me that American lives were  lost in this operation, but do not tell me  that there might have been a better way.  Let us have no Monday morning quarter backs on this one. The time came when  a  show of strength was  required and  President Ford did not flinch. He dis played on our behalf a national resolve to  take  swift and appropriate action. If  Vietnam was a low point for the United  States, then the recapturing of the May aguez and the saving of all its crew is  certainly the first step on the road back.  Someone has referred to the tyranny  of the weak and the weakness of  the  strong. It is easy for a small upstart of a  co\mtry to flex its tiny muscles and at tempt to infiict damage and embarrass ment on a powerful country  like  the  United States. It is not so easy for the  strong nation to respond in a  measured way.  I think we met the test. We could have  acted like a helpless giant, as we did in  the Pueblo affair, or we could have blown  Cambodia off the face of the earth.

The  levels authorized, with the exception of  the Reserve Components, are strength  ceilings which may not be exceeded by  the Department of Defense.  The Committee recommendations for  title m, which deals with active duty  end strengths are as follows:  Fiscall3/J  197T  Navy________________________  ArmY-----------------------Marine Corps_________________  Air Force____________________  TotaL________________  785, 000  528, 651  196, 303  590,000  793, 000  535, 860  196,498  590,000  2, 115,358  ---------------2, 099, 954  The end strengths recommended are  those requested by the Department of  Defense.

The policy of the executive branch to  bypass Congress by  the use of  these  agreements  is not  in accord with  the  intent of the Constitution.

245,House,94,-0.422,1226,11,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker, on the first  of March of this year the distinguished  Secretary  of Health, Education,  and  Welfare, the Honorable Caspar W. Wein berger, made a very significant address  at the 16th Annual Bob Hope Dinner of  the National Parkinson Foundation at  the  Fontainebleau  Hotel  of Miami  Beach, Fla., in my congressional district.  My wife, who  is  the chairman of  the  Women's Division  of  the  National  Parkinson Foundation has  long been  the chairman of this dinner and I had  the honor  to act as  toastmaster. Bob  Hope, for  the 16th  time, honored  the  dinner with his presence and participa tion by his own inimitable appearance  and the presiding over the many tal ented performers who provided the de lightful entertainment for the evening.  Secretary Weinberger, speaking from his  broad  background  and  knowledge  of  health matters and particularly out of  his general supervision over the National  Institutes of Health, spoke very signifi cantly of research in its relation to the  provision of health care in our country  and especially of the problem of Parkin son's disease with which  the Institute  of Neurological Diseases and Stroke in  the National Institutes of Health is pri marily concerned. Secretary Weinberger  spoke on  the progress  that has been  made in acquiring a knowledge of the  causes of Parkinson's disease and how to  deal with it. He expressed the dedica tion of the Department of Health, Edu cation, and Welfare to the continuation  of this research and to finding a cure  for this crippling and killing disease. The  Secretary  warmly  commended Mrs.  Jeanne Levey, who with her husband,  many years ago founded  the National  Parkinson Foundation and the Parkin son Research Institute in Miami, an arm  of the foundation, and the great work  that the National Parkinson Foundation  has done  in the treatment of Parkin son's patients and  in research  in  the  Parkinson's field. He recognized that the  National Parkinson Foundation has the  largest number of Parkinson's patients  of any institution concerned with that  disease and, therefore, the contribution  the foundation can make in cooperation  with the National Institutes of Health  in finding  the cause and  the cure of  Parkinson's disease.  I may add that since  the Secretary  spoke at  this very meaningful dinner  there has been established in Miami by  the National Parkinson Foundation, un der the inspired leadership of Mrs. Jeanne  Levey, the Bob Hope Parkinson Research  and Clinical Center, consisting of a fine,  new building of four stories, splendidlY  adapted to the treatment of Parkinson's  patients and especially adapted  to re search  in Parkinson's disease and  the  treatment of the whole person afHicted  with that disease in one center. Bob Hope  was present at  the dedication of  this  new  research center and spoke  in his  usual inimitable way in commendation  of Mrs. Levey and the work of the Park inson Foundation. My wife and I had the  privilege of participating in this dedica tion. All who are concerned about this  disease,  of which  there  are  about  1  million in the United States constantly  afflicted, will profit from reading the able  address of Secretary Weinberger at the  Bob Hope Dinner and I include the Sec retary's address in the RECORD following  these remarks:  TRANSCRIPTION OF TAPE RECORDING  (Remarks by The Honorable Caspar W.  Weinberger, Secretary of Health, Education,  and Welfare before the National Parkinson  Foundation, Inc., Miami, Fla., on March 1,  1975).  Following an introduction by Congressman  Claude Pepper, Mr. Weinberger made the fol lowing remarks:  Thank you very much, Senator. That's a  very generous welcome and I'm extremely  grateful  to you and  it's a great honor  to  have the opportunity to be here and join all  of you in paying tribute to Mrs. Levey and  to the magnificent work that she has done.  Your Mayor said a  little while ago that he  knew that you could hear him because he  could hear you and  I  think that that's a  very fitting description of tonight. I'm not  going to continue long because I know that  we're all waiting eagerly to hear the perform ance of Bob Hope and his Company. But I  did want you to know that the very distin guished record of Senator Pepper with which  you are thoroughly familiar is similarly re garded by all of us in Washington and it is  an honor to have the opportunity to be in.  troduced by him tonight.  Yesterday I hw occasion  to  talk  to  the  President and he, when he knew that I was  coming down to Florida, expressed hie; great  interest and hoped that he would be able to  be part of the Dedication of the Parkinson  Research Foundation building a  llttle later  this month; and he also asked me particu larly if I would convey his deep appreciation  of the contributions that all of you here to night have made and of his great happiness  at  the willingness  to contribute that has  made possible this very fine  institution.  I  assure him I would convey all of his per sonal greetings to all of you and I'm very  honored, of course to have the opportunity  to do that on behalf of President Ford.  You know one morning a  few weeks ago  a very unusual and attractive lady came to  see me in my office and during the visit 5he  told me of a very fine new building that her  organization had  just finished. She sa.id  it  didn't have a cent of federal money in  it,  that it was all loaned and it was all paid for  down to the last nail before it was finished.  I told her I very much wished that we could  have her in the Federal Government, that we  could really use her and we're not likely to  be able to achieve this kind of solvency :in  Washington  soon,  I'm afraid. Nor are we  likely to be able to hire Mrs. Levey, although  we would certainly like to. But we are going  to do the next best thing and that is to work  with her and with the Foundation which she  more  than anyone  else has brought  into  being. It's a real inspiration to be here. When  you can see what she has accomplished  in  the past 16 years with her spirit and her  drive, you know why she has won  the ad miration of all who know her here and that  her  reput3.tion has spread a  long way  to  Washington and beyond.  What I think we must resolve to do tonight  is to help maintain the momentum that she  has created. I'd also like to say a word as a  fellow Californian about Bob Hope, who has  done such an enormous an1ount for so many  people and so many causes all over the world.  This is his 16th year in helping the Founda tion and he's been  responsible  for  raisinP  over 5 million dollars in contrib-utions and  as a Californian of course I know the VP.ry  great contributions he's made to a number  of other worthy causes throughout our state,  as well as the country. As an official of the  United States Government I'm delighted to  have the opportunity to pay tribute to him  for the very magnificent work that he has  done with our  troops overseas year after  year at great cost and personal expense and  effort and time on his part. It's been an in spiration for all of us and it's an honor to be  on the same program with Bob.  The Institute that we come to honor to night has been created  in a  great spirit,  similar to that Bob Hope and others have  exercised in their voluntary work. The vol untary movement is  largely responsible  in  many ways too for the work of government.  Behind almost every governmental program  there is a volunteer group which has origi nated interest in that subiect and has moved  government to enter it. That has been the  way in a number of different kinds of re search into a number of different kinds of  disease and it is certainly the fact with re spect  to Parkinson's disease  too. Your or ganization is unique in a number of ways.  It's the only institution of its kind in the  country and probably in the world that de votes itself exclusively to the needs of Par kinson patients. In  the usual neurological  clinic, this is one of many nervous system  disorders being treated. In the great Institute  which Dr. Tower heads so ably in Washing ton, that is the case. But here all of the at tention is focused on Parkinson's disease and  so a very powerful spirit of hope and opti mism has been generated here and we know  that that is going to replace the despair that  is the common lot of so many who suffer from  this terrible disease.  Secondly your Institute is unique also in  the services that it offers  its patients. Its  physical facilities and rehabilitative therapy  are unparalleled and what is more your pro gram here is one in which the whole patient  is  treated. You  just aren't looking at the  disease or its symptoms, you're looking at  the whole patient and how he can be made a  happier, more whole citizen and  therefore  you concentrate training also on his famUy  and on others who will be taught to care for  him.  Finally the Institute has uniform records  on the largest population of Parkinson pa tients of any in the world and our efforts  at NIH, at the National Institutes of Health.  have greatly benefited from this achievement.  Our department, as you know, is heavily com mitted to research into Parkinson's disease.  Our Food and Drug Administration is respon sibile for  the safety and efficacy of drugs  and in fact it now has under review a new  drug combination  for Parkinson's disease.  Our Social and Rehabilitative Service, which  is another of the units of our department  through the states, provides funds for reha bilitation for many kinds of patients includ ing some with the disease that we are con cerned with tonight.  But  the agency  that offers  the greatest  hope in terms of impact is, of course,  the  National Institute of Neurological Diseases  and Stroke, and you heard from  its very   distinguished director, Dr. Tower. Dr. Tower  can give you far more detailed and scien tific reviews than our program tonight has.  but I want to mention a  few of the more  active  research  areas and give you  some  sense of the reason that we feel optimistic  for the future after a great many years of  pessimism in dealing with this disease.  In the research that we're doing now, the  main action  is in  the study of druas and  how they will work. Most of you kno~ that  the recent advances we have made tn drug  therapy centered around  the one drug of  L-dopa and  the amount of benefits  that  we've had and the amount of care with which  we must use that drug. Our scientists have  played a very crucial role in baste research  going back more than 20 years and that led  to the L-dopa and you heard the interesting  story of how that was put together by work ers all over the world from Dr. Tower.  But that's been more of a beginnina than  an end. It's provided a great many o prime  ",1975
246,Senate,94,0.512,1265,11,Mr. FANNIN.," Mr.  President,  this  morning, I am very pleased to have the  privilege of talking on the bilateral re sponsibility of the defense commitments  of the Free World.  I wish to discuss a situation which I  feel is of immediate importance to the  American people and the defense of the  free world. The situation  to which  I  refer is the lack of an adequate com mitment on the part of many countries  of the free world to share the respon sibility of defense. The United States  has carried the major burden of defense  since World War II. Our immediate post war responsibilities  to our allies were  immense given the wide-spread devasta tion.  The world situation has changed dra matically.  Thirty  years  of  varying  degrees of prosperity have changed the  world order. The commitments made  and  responsibilities  assumed  by  the  United States for an overwhelming share  of the defense of the free world is no  longer a viable solution to actual de fense  requirements. Events  in  recent  years,  and more pointedly,  in  recent  days-in  fact,  presently happening clearly  illustrate  the necessity of  the  other free nations of the world carrying  a heavier load of that commitment.  There is no question that the defense  of all free nations is essential to our own  personal security. The interdependence  of the free nations has never been more  obvious. That  interdependence neces sitates a bilateral responsibility of de fense commitments.  Mr. President, 30 years ago the United  Nations was founded with great fanfare  and naive hopes for the maintenance of  future peace. That international institu tion was dedicated to the preservation  of world peace;  to the development of  friendly  relations between nations;  to  the promotion of principles of  equal  rights and self-determination; and  to  the cooperation of member nations  overcoming economic, social, and cul tural problems.  The United Nations was, of course, es tablished in this great country of ours.  The United States today believes in these  goals, the same goals established at that  time.  These are noble goals. The United  States subscribed to these goals in help ing to establish the United Nations. The  United States  today believes  in these  goals. However, it has become increas ingly obvious that the U.N. is a failure  as an organization and that the original  goBtls have been subverted. The nature  of the U.N. has changed drastically, and  I now believe that it not only is a waste  of U.S. tax money to support the U.N.,  but it is contrary to our own national  interest and that of the free world. It  in  to  saddens us to come to that conclusion.  This reality heightens the necessity of  mutual  dependence  by  free  world  countries.  Recent events in Western Europe and  Asia have spurred a renewed interest on  the part of free nations to review their  defense postures. Mr. President, it is my  opinion that the United States should  work with these nations to assure them of  our continuing support as a complement  their own  sound,  internal defense  structure. It should not in any way be our  purpose  to abandon  the  free nations  of the world who continue to view the  United States as a country of military  and moral strength.  Mr. President, it appears to me that  the development of the relationships be tween the NATO countries is a healthy  example in point. In cooperation with our  NATO allies, we have devised a common  strategy to meet changing conditions and  realities. Within that common strategy,  our allies are working with us to improve  their force contributions, to get better  results from their defense efforts and to  help meet  the special burdens  falling  on the United States as a result of sta tioning our forces in Europe. Europe has  continued to increased its share of the  defense burden as they should. For some  time after World War II, we furnished a  large share of NATO's troops and weap..:  ons until our allies could rearm them selves. At the present time, Europe pro vides 90 percent of  the ground forces,  80 percent of the ships, and 75 percent  of the aircraft deployed in Europe. Their  defense expenditures increased 10 to 15  percent in constant prices between 1970  and 1973.  .  Their forces are for the most part be ing modernized and improved in accord ance with agreed NATO priorities  in  whose  formulation we have played a  major role. Mr. President, this develop ment with NATO is a healthy one which  should serve as an example  to other  nations of the free world.  I especially would like to refer to some  of  the other areas of  the world. The  areas of the world which most concern  me are Asia and the Middle East. Our  involvement  in  Southeast Asia  has  brought heartache and bitterness to the  inhabitants of these countries and to the  American people. It should be clear that  the remaining free nations of Asia have  difficult days ahead in their own defense  efforts. It is equally clear that the only  true deterrence to Communist takeover  in Asia  is a  strong determination  withstand aggression and  the military  capability to back up that determination.  The United States should supplement  those efforts but we cannot supplant  them.  Japan must play a crucial role in the  self-defense  responsibilities  in  Asia.  Today,however,Japanisdependentupon  the United States for virtually its entire  defense.  Mr. President, we know that this will  continue for some time, but we also know  that  the Japanese have  the ability  to  contribute a great deal more financially  in providing an umbrella, not only  their area, but in many areas of the free  world. We have had a relationship with  Japan that has been in effect now since  to  in  to  to  II. This  World War  relationship has  proven the ability of a victor to assist a  nation that has gone down to defeat in  making an almost unbelievable come back. Japan was a devastated nation,  but one with great determination, and  they have made an industrial comeback  that has been the envy of most of the  countries of the world. We have partici pated in that endeavor, being the great est foreign contributor to their efforts in  making this remarkable recovery.  But we have a  responsibility  the  American people  to recognize  the re sponsibility  that the Japanese have  our Nation.  We have been successful in rebuild ing and helping  them to rebuild their  industries which have become  highly  competitive with the United States in  many parts of the world. It was inevi table that they would be competitive in  parts of the world where we did not have  the same advantages that accrue to the  Japanese people.  We were, as a nation, very proud that  they were able to step forth and fill some  of the vacuum in areas where the needs  were the greatest.  But it has gone beyond that to where  we have been  the recipient of a good  share of their exports, and it is doubtful  that this Nation can continue to accept  the same conditions  that exist  today.  That is why we have inaugurated a pro gram of trade relationship through the  trade bill that was recentlY passed,  in  order to have a better quid pro quo with  other nations of the world such as Japan.  We want to continue the wonderful  relationship we have, but this relation ship of complete dependence must cease,  and the Japanese must accept the bur den of defense which  their productive  economy can sustain.  As we consider what has happened  in our country, with the decline in many  industries, we can begin with our  in dustries that have suffered perhaps the  most, our electronic and auto industries.  This  is not only true of the Japanese  imports, but we can talk about the fact  that almost 20 percent of the cars being  sold in America today are imported cars.  This is something that we must recognize  as quite a barrier to employment in this  country.  This is not on a quid pro quo exchange  of goods. We allow cars to be imported  with a 3.5-percent tariff  imposed, and  with  few  nontariff barriers. However,  when we  ship motor vehicles  to other  countries of the world we not only have  higher tariffs in all those other coun tries, but we have very serious nontariff  trade barriers.    If we are going to work with the coun tries of  the world that are dependent  upon us for their defense, then they must  work with us to a far greater extent than  they have in the past. No longer can we  accept the responsibility of covering the  seas, covering the different areas of the  world with protective facilities. This is  very true of the Middle East countries.  We have been protecting their waters. It  is evident from what has been covered  this morning by our colleagues just what  has happened as far as naval facilities  the United States has today as compared  with the Russians.  ",1975
247,Senate,94,0.489,1278,11,Mr. HANSEN.," Mr. President, millions  of Americans  today are proud of  the  courageous correct action President Ford  has taken to retrieve the Mayaguez. This  has done more to restore confidence in  Washington and to repair the tarnished  image of America worldwide than any  event of the past year.  This country  is  solidly behind  the  President. The effect of that action has  been to reestablish in significant degree  world respect for the United States.  Mr. President, without the strong de fense establishment maintained by the  United States, it would have been im possible to even contemplate retrieving  the Mayaguez by force. If the United  States were not the most powerful nation  in the world,  the President would not  have been able to make the decision he  did  take positive  action,  as  con fidently or as expeditiously as he did.  Obviously, no other nation stood ready  to come to the rescue of the Mayaguez.  The world knows that this is a powerful  nation that views power as an obligation  and not a privilege, and that has been  pointed out a number of times on this  :floor  today already., This  is a Nation  that does not abuse the power it has.

248,Senate,94,0.135,1317,11,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, I am  submitting a resolution today to reaffirm  our intention that the States should not  tax individual income tax rebates paid  under the Tax Reduction Act of 1975.  The need to reaffirm this has arisen be cause  the attorney general of Oregon  has recently decided  that the Federal  tax rebate will be made subject to Ore gon State income tax. I think the action  of Oregon is wrong, and it concerns me  that other States may follow  this ex ample.  The  recently passed Tax Reduction  Act of 1975 (Public Law 94-12) provided  for a rebate of individual income taxes  totaling an estimated $8.1 billion. The  purpose of this massive, one-shot rebate  was to fight recession by infusing addi tional purchasing power into the econ omy.  I  believe  the States are acting  against the best interest of consumers  and against the wishes of the Congress  if they attempt to profit from the rebate  payments.  As a cosponsor of the President's pro posal to extend general revenue sharing,  I  respect the need of States for addi tional revenue. However, taxing the re bates is not the proper vehicle. In fact,  I  am afraid  that an attempt by  the  States  to profit from  the rebates may  weaken support for revenue sharing.  It is clear from  the reports of both  the House Ways and Means Committee  and the Senate Finance Committee that  the Congress did not intend the rebate  to be subject to Federal income tax. The  Ways and Means Committee report- House Report 94-19, at page 25-and the  Finance Committee report--senate Re port 94-36, at page 27-stated that the  rebate would not constitute income for  Federal income tax purposes.  In addition, I believe that the Congress  intended the rebates to not increase or  decrease State tax revenues. A number  of States allow a tax deduction for Fed eral income tax. For tax year 1974, Ore gon allowed a deduction for Federal in come taxes up to $3,000. The attorney  general of Oregon has recently decided  that the rebate will be treated as a re duction of Federal  income  taxes paid  for 1974. This reduces the State tax de duction for Federal income taxes paid,  by the amount of the rebate.  For example, prior to the Tax Reduc tion Act, an Oregon taxpayer with $12,000 income and $2,000 in Federal income  tax would pay State income tax on $10,000. Assume  this  taxpayer  received a  $200  rebate. The Oregon decision is to  treat the $200 rebate as a reduction of  1974 Federal income tax liability, reduc ing Federal  taxes to $800 and leading  to computation of State income tax on  $10,200. This makes the rebate subject  to State income tax.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a letter to me from Dr. Law rence Woodworth, chief of staff of the  Joint Committee on Internal Revenue  Taxation, dated May 15, 1975, be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the letter  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  JOINT COMMITTEE ON  INTERNAL REVENUE TAXATION,  Washington, D.C., May 15, 1975.  Hon. BOB PACKWOOD,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR SENATOR PACKWOOD: You have asked  me for a.n explanation of the way in which  Congress intended the special refund of 1974  Federal  income  tax  (contained in the Tax  Reduction Act of 1975) to affect a. taxpayer's  State income tax liability.  As you know, the Tax Reduction Act pro vides for a. refund on 1974 tax liability to be  paid in one installment beginning in May  1975. It will genera.ll¥ equal 10 percent of tax  11a.b111ty up to a. maximum of $200. However,  each taxpayer will receive a. refund of a.t least  $100 (or the full amount of the tax 11ab111ty  if less than $100). The refund is to be phased  down from the maximum $200 to $100 a.s the  taxpayer's  income  rises  from  to  $~0,000  $30,000.  The Act provides that the taxpayer will be  treated a.s if he had made a.n additional payis  ment to the Treasury against his 1974income  tax  liab111ty. This constructive payment  treated a.s  if made on the due date of the  taxpayer's 1974 return. In effect,  this con structive payment w1l1  in most  cases be  processed by the Internal Revenue Service a.s  an overpayment of tax by the taxpayer and,  as such, will be paid to him in the form of  a refund of tax. In accord with the general  rule  that Federal  income  tax  refunds do  not constitute income, refunds received un der the Act w111  likewise not constitute in come for Federal income tax purposes to the  taxpayers who receive them.  In the case of the trea. tmen t of the refunds  for State  income  tax purposes, both  the  committee reports of the House Committee  on Ways and Means and the Senate Finance  Committee on the Ta,x Reduction Act contain the following statement:    ""By deeming the amount of 1974 tax which  is to be refunded under the blll a.s a. payment  of 1974 Federal income tax by the taxpayer  on the due date of his return, the committee  expects that for State income tax purposes,  States wlll treat the Federal refund of this  deemed payment a.s a refund of a.n overpay ment of Federal income tax. Such treatment  would also reflect the committee's view that  the refunds under the bill do not involve any  reduction in the taxpayer's Federal income  tax liability a.s such for 1974."" (H. Rept. 9419, p. 25; S. Rept. 94-36, p. 27)  My understanding is that both committees  intended this statement  to mean that the  special  refund of Federal  income  tax  for  1974 should not operate  to  increase, or to  decrease,  income  tax  collections  by  the  States. Some States,  for  example,  impose  their tax as a. flat percentage of the taxpayer's  Federal income tax lia.b111ty. In such Juris dictions, if the special Federal refunds could  be interpreted a.s reflecting a. reduction in the  taxpayer's Federal  income  tax  liability for  1974, the effect would be to reduce the tax payer's State  income  tax  liability and, in  turn, State revenues. Congress intended that  such a. result should not occur.  Some States, by contrast, allow a. taxpayer,  in computing his State taxable income,  deduct Federal taxes paid by him during the  year. In such jurisdictions, Congress intended  that the special Federal refund should also  not be interpreted a.s reducing the taxpayer's  1974 Federal tax liabll1ty so a.s to reduce his  deduction  (on his State return)  for 1974  Federal income taxes paid. Such a. reduction  would, in effect, subject the special Federal  refund to tax by the State.

250,,94,-0.422,1460,11,Mr. MADDEN.," Mr. Speaker,  it was  exactly 8 years ago Friday that I brought  to the attention of my colleagues a con stituent of mine from Munster, Ind. To day, Mrs. Mary Lou Kieswetter is known  across the breadth of our land as ""The  Flag Lady.""  I am calling attention to her again  because we will be observing, within a  few days, two very important holidays both of which will mark personal tri umphs for Mrs. Kieswetter and her tire less pursuit of restoring patriotism as a  way of life in America.  On May 26, we will be celebrating  Memorial Day. On July 4, we will be  celebrating the 199th anniversary of our  Nation's birth-signaling the start of this  Nation's 200th year of existence and the  year-long Bicentennial observance.  Memorial Day will be an especially sig nificant occasion  for Mrs. Kieswetter  who, in her efforts to instill a better sense  of patriotism among her fellow citizens,  founded  the National Council  for  the  Encouragement of Patriotism to achieve  that purpos~.  One of her council's endeavors has been  to proclaim U.S. 41-a major national  road which begins at the Nation's north ernmost border at Copper Harbor, Mich.,  and winds through eight States to its end  destination  at Miami,  Fla.-as  the  ""Highway of Flags.""  The Governor's of the eight States Michigan, Wisconsin,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Flor ida-have issued proclamations to that  effect.  For the last several years, Mrs. Kies wetter and her organization have been  raising donations to erect a monument  in Highland, Ind.--one of the countless  communities which are situated along  the ""Highway of Flags.""  That memorial, built with donated  money and labor, will be officially dedi cated as a tribute to our Nation's ban ner and U.S.  servicemen on Memorial  Day.  The dedication ceremonies will feature  Brig. Gen. David W. Winn, deputy com mander of the 22d North American Air  Defense  Command  Region.

251,,94,0.234,1473,11,Mr. HASTINGS.," Mr. Speaker, our col league, Congressman H. JOHN HEINZ, m,  of Pennsylvania, in a speech before the  Pennsylvania Medical Society, recently  discussed reasons why he believes that  the Federal Government should not in in the medical malpractice  volve itself  crisis unless absolutely necessary. The  responsibility for resolving this problem  should lie primarily with the States, Mr.  HEINZ said.  The first part of his remarks appeared  in yesterday's RECORD. I include the text  of this portion of Mr. HEINZ's remarks in  the RECORD:  REMARKS BY HoN. H. JoHN HEINz,  III  In each State where a  crisis exists,  leg islation to rectify the problem is being con sidered. Over 200 bills on malpractice  in surance have been introduced in State leg islatures since January 1.  Four States-Arkansas,  Idaho,  Indiana,  and Wisconsin-have already enacted legisla tion guaranteeing avallab111ty of insurance.  Slmllar legislation is pending in at least 10  other States, including California, Massachu setts, and New York.  A Federal program enacted now would fall  to recognize individual problems in individ ual states. It would also cut short valuable  state  initiatives which  could  result  in a  synthesis of many approaches or in the de velopment of others not yet tried.  Finally, regulation of  the  insurance  in dustry has always been a state government  responsib1Uty.  The  Federal  Government  should not preempt that responsib111ty unless  absolutely necessary. For  instance,  if  in surance becomes unavailable and a  state  falls to act, or 1f it acts unsuccessfully to  resolve the crisis,  temporary Federal inter vention would be warranted at two levels:  One, a  joint underwriting pool composed  of all insurors writing personal  liablllty in  that state;  Two, Federal  reinsurance  in  the  crisis  state on all claims paid above an established  amount--perhaps $200,000.  Admittedly,  this is a  stop-gap approach  that merely guarantees avallabll1ty of  in surance without addressing any of the basic  causes of the problem. But these temporary  measures would keep Federal meddling to  a minimum while providing the time needed  for the residents of a State, working through  their public officials and in cooperation with  both health care providers and insurors, to  solve their medical liability insurance crisis  the way they believe makes the most sense.  But I would sound one clear warning solving this crisis is a State responsibility,  and no State legislature, including the one  assembled here in Harrisburg, should labor  under the 111 usion  that Congress will ball  them out. Congress should not and will not  relieve the States of their solemn responsi bility. With this fact in mind, I urge the  Pennsylvania State Legislature to act with  wisdom and dispatch to solve this crisis.  So you can see that I believe strongly in  State responsiblllty for solving the medical  malpractice mess. But  let me add a  few  words about a special responsibility-yours.  Only the medical profession itself, and par ticularly you,  the chosen  leaders of  that  profession, can improve the quality of care  delivered by both physicians and hospital  personnel. Let's be frank. Malpractice does  occur  in  this country. An estimated 75%  14751  of alleged malpractice events occur in hos pitals. Often these are poorly managed hos pitals, understaffed by inadequately trained  personnel. As the leaders of the health care  team, it's your responsibility to help improve  the quality of care delivered in hospitals.  Furthermore, let me say the unspeakable:  Doctors are not gods. Like politicians, you are  often  too human. We  all make mistakes.  Some doctors are  incompetent. Thank God  there are so very few. But these few must be  weeded out to protect the many. Yet in most  states, neither state medical boards of ex aminers, nor state medical  societies have  sufficient power to pollee your profession.  The Secretary's Commission on Medical  Malpractice found that state boards generally  limited themselves to policing cases of crim inal or moral misconduct rather than moni toring patient-care quality. In fact, as re cently as 1972, only 15 states allowed a phy sician's license to be challenged on the basis  of professional incompetency. What's more,  only in eight states did medical boards have  the power to act against a practitioner whose  license had been revoked in another state.  Malpractice proven to be the result of not  simply human error, but of sheer incompe tence or gross negligence must be punished  and dealt with decisively. Such a physician  deserves  to have his license revoked,  tem porarily or permanently, in a fair but expe ditious open proceeding. The responsibility  lies squarely with you to assure that these  few physicians cannot visit their negligence  or incompetence on still other unsuspecting  patients.  The disciplinary mechanisms proposed by  the Pennsylvania medical  society  and  spelled out in Pennsylvania house blll 805are a step in the right direction. But I urge  you to press as well for a new, tough State administered program of medical  licensure,  continuing education and rellcensure. Such  a program would be combined with necessary  machinery, manpower and financing to swift ly identify, discipline and rehabllltate or bar  from practice those few unworthy physicians  which stain  the good  reputation of your  profession.  Such changes in the law are clearly in the  public interest, since they would protect pa tients against irresponsible practitioners. But  these changes would benefit all other physi cians as well. Not only would they help con trol malpractice occurrence, checking both  high insurance premiums and hassles over  insurance coverage, but these improvements  would strengthen public  respect  for your  profession.  You and I know that there are those who  wlll not rest until total control of health  care  resides  in Washington. The  current  crisis in medical Uablllty protection 1s seized  by some as stm another opportunity to re make our health care system over to their  own liking. These politicians would have the  Federal giant jump in with a massive un tried scheme of federally administered no fault insurance or a national arbitration pro gram for all malpractice claims.  Both these proposals would explosively in crease Federal meddling in the day-to-day  practice of medicine. Federal boards would  investigate malpractice  claims  and  assess  judgments on the merits of the claims.  Even more disturbing, however, would be  the mandating of Federal, medical licensing  and rellcensing programs for all physicians  in America-to be administered by stlll an other bureaucracy with the power to regu late-and even to ban-the practice of med icine by an individual physician.  I know you find this approach as allen to  American values and as alien to the Ameri can way of lite as I do. Your strong leader ship in swiftly and fairly d1sc1plln1ng negll gent or  incompetent colleagues would do  more  than merely  improve  the quality of  American health care.  ",1975

255,House,94,0.23,36,19,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to House Resolution 605. This  resolution is a classic example of the depressing state of affairs  regarding  the  serious petroleum problem  facing  the  United States. It is a resolution of dis approval. It is easy to say no, and it is  much more difficult to act affirmatively.  The no-action impasse situation which  we  find  today will only be aggravated  if House Resolution 605 is approved, in  my judgment, and H.R. 7014 is passed as  reported. A rejection of gradual decon trol and a  rollback of crude oil prices  may have some short-term political ap peal, but continuation of such a policy  can only result in long-term economic  and political disaster.  There  indeed might be  some  tem porary consumer relief from high petro leum product prices, but we would pay  and pay dearly  for  the  resultant ex panding oil consumption and the con current  increased dependence on  the  volatile mood of the oil sheiks. The two  oil measures before us today only post pone  the  inevitable and  thereby will  make coming to grips with the oil reality  more unpleasant for the delay.  We must cut oil consumption, reduce  imports, and increase domestic produc tion. As unpleasant as  this approach  may be, there is no other way out of or  around this dilemma over the next few  years. The time  to bite  the proverbial  bullet has arrived,  instead of deluding  our constituents and ourselves into be lieving that we can wave a  legislative  wand and make the oil crisis get bet ter or go a way. We cannot, and there is  no painless, cheap way out of our pre dicament. Within  the next  25  to  40  years the world's oil well will run dry,  barring a major unforeseen technologi cal breakthrough. During that same time  frame, demand for petroleum will con tinue to  increase. It does not  take an  economic genius  to realize  that rising  aggregate demand and  falling  supply  can only result in oil prices that will  continue going up and up.  This week we  can do  one  of  two  things. We can pass the two oil policy  charades before us  today and subject  the people and industry to an adminis trative monstrosity that soon will cause  long Enes at gas stations and  impose  reams of red tape and bureaucratic im position on a significant segment of the  business community. At the same time,  we will become  increasingly more sus ceptible  to Arab passions and oil boy cotts. The alternative is to use the ad mittedly imperfect device of the market place and its pricing mechanism to re dLce demand and encourage domestic  oil recovery and exploration.  I do not feel we can remove all con trols today without serious economic im pact. But phased decontrol over a 30month period makes a  lot of sense  to  me, with a windfall profits  tax and a  plowback provision.  I  feel  the Presi dent's approach would move the Nation  toward less dependence on foreign oil.  It will accomplish these necessary ends  without  the swarm of bureaucrats  to  administer economic regulations. Realis tically,  this approach w111  cause some  immediate pain to the American peo ple, but may I respectfully suggest that  it will not be nearly as burdensome over  the long haul as trying to maintain a lid  on domestic crude oil at $5.25 a barrel,  ",1975
256,House,94,0.218,49,19,Mr. CLEVELAND.," Mr.  Chairman,  I oppose House Resolution 605 which  would disapprove the President's plan to  deoontrol oil prices gradually over a 30month period subject to a $13.50 cap and  a windfall profits tax with plowback pro visions and tax rebates for low-income  energy users.  I do so not only out of a growing sense  of frustration over the inability of the  Democratic  leadership  in Congress  to  enact a comprehensive and effective na tional energy policy but also because I  believe the President's latest attempt to  compromise with the Congress in ,:;olving  our energy problems  represents a  far  better solution  than  the mishmash of  ineffective proposals which have been  offered to counter it.  Almost 2 years have passed since the  Arab oil embargo forced us to face up to  the reality of our dependence upon foreign sources for as vital a  resource as  petroleum. Yet, in this time period the  Congress has done little except to pass  legislation which helped us to live with  the problem rather than attempt to re solve it.  We are now faced with the August 31  expiration date of the Emergency Petro leum Allocation Act of 1973 under which  domestic  ""old""  oil which  constitutes  about two-thirds of our domestic produc tion is subject to a price ceiling of $5.25  per barrel.  Obviously, the effects of immediate de control of oil prices would be severely  disruptive on our already seriously trou bled economy. For this reason, I chal lenge my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle to put an end to partisan dis putes and compromise with the admin istration in working out the details of an  effective energy program which will lead  to our eventual self-sufficiency. Defeat  of this bill today would represent a posi tive attempt to do so rather than con tinuing the present pattern of mere neg ative  reaction  to  the President's pro posals.  ",1975
257,House,94,-0.308,49,19,Mr. MACDONALD of Massachusetts.,"  Mr. Chairman, as a cosponsor of House  Resolution 605, it is my hope that the  House will pass the disapproving reso lution for  the President's plan  to de control domestic old oil prices over a  period of 30 months. There has been a  great deal of information submitted on  this subject by my colleagues, and there  is perhaps little factual data I can add;  however, I would like to mention three  areas which are of particular concern  to me in the President's decontrol plan.  First, President Ford has stated that  the effect of his plan on the American  economy will be minimal. As my col leagues on  the Commerce Committee  have stated,  the  facts and figures on  which he bases  this estimation are at  best misleading and at worst plain mis truths. The truth is that the President's  decontrol plan will have a very signifi cant adverse  impact on  the American  economy. In fact, any decontrol plan will  have an effect on the economy, but the  particular error in the President's plan  is that it attempts to decontrol over a  30-month period. I feel strongly that this  period is not long enough to allow the  American economy to adjust to the sud den price increases. Other Members of  Congress have proposed 5-year decontrol  plans, and while I do not agree with this  policy,  these plans at  least allow  for  gradual price increases over an extended  period of  time. A 30-month decontrol  plan would have a disasterous effect on  all businesses directly dependent on oil  and would have a  significant rippling  effect on all other industries in the Na tion. The Commerce Committee analysis  which I might add was expertly done i~  such a  short period of  time,  indicates  that the President's plan would increase  unemployment by 800,000, increase con sumer prices by 2 percent, and decrease  housing starts by 268,000 units. This im pact on the economy is not what I term  as minimal.  Additionally I would like to add that  although the Members of this body may  be tired of hearing about the problems  ",1975

261,House,94,-0.414,75,19,Mr. MEZVINSKY.," Mr. Speaker, reces sion has swollen the number of Ameri cans needing food stamps  to unprece dented levels, creating a new urgency for  comprehensive  reform of  the Federal  food  stamp program.  In  the  coming  weeks we will be debating many vitally  needed changes in food stamp certifica tion procedures, designed to insure that  those who need food stamps receive as sistance promptly. But we must not stop  there. The food stamp program is riddled  with outmoded and unjust procedures  and regulations, making fundamental re form imperative.  I am introducing legislation today de signed to correct several basic inequities  in the food stamp program. This bill is  not meant to be comprehensive, but it  does strike at three regulations which  often deny the benefits of this program  to the impoverished elderly, the handi capped, and the poor.  The first provision of  this bill would  eliminate a  regulation which  requires  that a household have a kitchen in order  to qualify for food stamps. That require ment works against many elderly citi zens who have their main hot meal of the  day at a senior citizens' center and use  hot plates or eat cold meals at home.  This legislation would also allow elder ly or handicapped food stamp recipients  to use their stamps to pay for meals on  wheels, a program which provides hot  meals for individuals confined to their  homes. Presently, a food stamp recipient  must be both elderly and handicapped  before ""meals on wheels"" can be paid  for with the stamps.  Finally,  this measure would prohibit  the Department of Agriculture from ineluding Federal housing assistance in its  determination of a  food stamp appli cant's income level. Section 7(b) of the  Food Stamp Act of 1964, limiting the cost  of stamps to ""30 percent of the house hold's income"" clearly implies that ""in come"" is that amount of money available  to the family to buy food. Government  housing assistance goes for rent, yet the  USDA persists in calculating housing as sistance as ""income.""  As long as such assistance is included  in determining  income  levels  it means  that the poorer the family and the larger  their housing assistance, the more they  will have to pay for food stamps, and the  more likely it is that they may not even  be eligible for stamps. We must eliminate  this ""catch 22"" predicament.  The House Agriculture Committee is  currently preparing a report on needed  changes in the food stamp program. It is  my hope that the committee will recog nize the inequities I have pointed out and  move to correct them.  H.R. 8736-PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  AND  IMPROVEMENT COSTS OF  PUBLISHERS  ",1975

263,,94,0.225,244,19,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Speaker, I have re ceived letters from OMB, the Justice De partment and the Civil Service Commis sion expressing concern over some of the  provisions in H.R. 6844,  the Consumer  Protection Safety Commission Improve ments Act. For the benefit of all my col leagues in the House, I am inserting these  letters at this point in  the RECORD  in  order to inform the Members about the  specific objections raised regarding H.R.  6844.  The letters follow :  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT,  OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET,  Washington, D.C., July 6, 1975.  Han. JoHN J. RHODES,  House of Representatives,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN RHODES: We WOUld like  to call to your attention a number of prob lems in H.R. 6844,  the ""Consumer Product  Safety Commission Improvements Act."" We  understand that H.R. 6844 is scheduled for  House floor action in the near future.  We strongly object to Section 4 since it  ignores the principle of the career/noncareer  distinction in the Federal civil service sys tem. CPSC would be allowed to appoint indi viduals to career civil service positions with out having  to comply with  the rules and  regulations governing such appointments ap plicable throughout the civil service system.  Section 12 of H.R. 6844 would authorize  the Consumer Product Safety Commission  (CPSC}  to represent itself in all civil en forcement and subpoena enforcement pro ceedings. We  strongly oppose  this section  because it violates the long-standing tradi tion of Justice Department control over the  conduct of Federal Utigation. Centralization  of Federal litigation is necessary to present  a uniform position on important legal issues  before the courts, to exercise selectivity in  the filing and presentation of cases in order  to place  the Government's position in the  most favorable light, to provide greater ob jectivity  in the handling of cases, and to  achieve better rapport with courts through  the daily working  relationships developed  by U.S. Attorneys.  We understand that the Civil Service Com mission and the Department of Justice will  be submitting letters to you shortly which  discuss the above objections to Sections 4  and 12 in more detail.  H.R. 6844 would authorize $51 million for  fiscal year 1976, $14 million for the transi tion quarter, $60 million for 1977, and $68  million for 1978. We believe that these ap propriations authorizations in H.R. 6844 are  excessive. We  recommend  that  they  be  amended  to be consistent with  the Presi dent's Budget request for CPSC of $36.6 mil lion for 1976 and $9 million for the transi tion quarter.  We also recommend repeal of Subsection  27(k)  in the Consumer Product Safety Act,  which provides for simultaneous submission  to the Office of Management and Budget and  Congress of all budget request and legislaJuly 22, 1975  tive  information. Our  experience  during  CPSC's three years of operation has been  that this provision leads to confusion. Sub section 27(k) also prevents the coordination  of legislative recommendations among CPSC  and other Federal agencies. It does not allow  CPSC to benefit from the views of other af fected agencies before submitting its legis lative proposals, or to comment on the legis lative proposals of other Federal agencies be fore  congressional  submission. The provi sion, therefore, prevents necessary issue de velopment and dialogue within the Executive  Branch. Repeal of Subsection 27(k) would  help assure maximum effectiveness of both  CPSC a.nd other Federal agencies  through  better coordination and development of con sistent programs.  For all of the above reasons, the Office of  Management and Budget strongly urges that  H.R. 6844 be amended as recommended above.  Sincerely yours,  JAMES T. LYNN,  Director.  DEPARTMENT OF  JUSTICE,  Washington, D.C., July 16, 1975.  Han. JOHN J. RHODES,  Minority !-eader, House of Representatives,  Washmgton, D.C.  to  DEAR CONGRESSMAN RHODES; The Depart ment of Justice would be pleased to present  its views on H.R. 6844,  the proposed ""Con sumer Produot Safety Commission Improve ments Act.""  Section 12 of H.R. 6844 would constitute a  major abridgment of the Attorney General's  traditional position of supervising the con duct of government litigation. Subsection (a)  would delete references to the Attorney Gen eral  in subsection 11 (a}  of  the Consumer  Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2060(a)) con cerning the judicial review of certain Con sumer Product Safety Commission  rules.  Subsection  (b) would amend subsection 27  (b) (7)  (15 U.S.C. 2076(b) (7))  to authorize  the Commission  to  initiate, prosecute, de fend, or appeal  (other than to the United  States Supreme Court) any civil action in  the name of the Commission for the purposes  of enforcing the laws subject to its jurisdic tion, a.nd  to initiate, prosecute, defend, or  appeal any criminal action in the name of  the Commission for  the purpose of enforc ing  the  laws  subject  its  jurisdiction,  through  its own  legal  representative with  the concurrence of  the Attorney General.  Subsection (c) of section 12 of the bill would  delete from section 27(c)  (15 U.S.C. 2076(c))  the requirement that the Commission obtain  the concurrence of the Attorney General be fore it brings its own subpoena enforcement  actions.  The Department of Justice strongly op poses the amendments proposed by section  12. We  consider  them  inconsistent with  sound po11cy and precedent, and wholly un necessary to assist in vigorous and effective  enforcement of the important public safety  statutes within  the Commission's respon sibility.  The basic and traditional policy with re spect to Government litigation is declared by  28 U.S.C. 516, 518, and 519, which provide  that, except as otherwise authorized by law,  officers of the Department of Justice, under  the direction of the Attorney General, are  responsible for the supervision and conduct  of litigation  involving  the  interests of the  United States or its agencies. The policies  underlying this rule include the desirability  of the government speaking with one voice  on common issues of law and policy arising  under diverse statutes; the necessity for con sistency and  fairness  in  law enforcement;  the ability to exercise selectivity in the fil ing or presentation of cases in order to maXi mize  the  likelihood of a  successful  result,  since court determinations frequently have  ",1975
264,,94,-0.339,257,19,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, today I wish  to insert the final article in a  six-part  investigative series conducted by the New  York Daily News into the private child  care agencies in the city of New York.  The previous articles uncovered some  in the system  very serious abuses  eluding misuse of funds, and abuse and  neglect of children housed in these agen cies. Yet the most serious charge leveled  at these agencies deals with their failure  to provide permanent adoption oppor tunities for children.  I intend to hold a congressional hear ing on August 19 and 20  in New York  to examine  the problem and propose  remedial  legislation.  I  intend  call  agency officials as well as children vic timized by agencies as witnesses. It is  my hope that meaningful legislation can  be developed and passed by Congress to  rid  this Nation of  this unconscionable  scandal.  to  Mr. Speaker, at this point in the REc ORD I insert the final article in the series  entitled ""Adoption Agencies Work Hard at Keeping Kids.""  The article follows:  ADOPTION AGENCIES WORK HARD-AT KEEPING  KIDS  (By Wllliam Heffernan and Stewart Ain)  Private child-care agencies, intent on keep ing homeless city children locked in long term foster care, are openly resisting a new  organization whose sole purpose  is to find  adoptive homes  for children  the agencies  have labeled ""impossible to place.""  In a three-month investigation of the city's  child-care  system, The News  found  that  thousands of children were being denied the  chance of  finding permanent homes while  these private agencies collect millions of tax  dollars for their continued maintenance.  The  investigation found also  that many  of these agencies have refused even to meet  with the new organization CS-Spauldlng for  children, the only private agency created spe cifically to find adoptive homes for difficult to-place children.  Other agencies, it was found, have refused  to give Spaulding information needed for the  adoptive process and some have even ""hung  up"" on Spaulding telephone contacts about  possible adoptions.  Eve Smith, Spaulding's director, told The  News that most of the private agencies her  organization has contacted seem ""to be geared  to keeping children in care, rather than get ting  them back  to  their  families or  into  adoptive planning.""  She cited the case of a 2-year-old brain damaged girl recently referred to her organi zation by  the New York City Interagency  Relationship Program. When Spaulding tried  to con tact the agency caring for the child,  who is legally free for adoption, the agency  ""refused  to meet with us,  let us  see  the  child or in any way look for an adoptive home  for her,"" Mrs. Smith said.  In the  few months Spaulding has been  working to move children out of foster care,  they have managed to place seven children  in adoptive homes and are in the midst ot  placing seven others.  Mrs. Smith  stressed  that her organiza tion's policy is to ""cooperate with and serve  agencies who refer children to us."" But while  some  agencies have been  cooperative,  the  others have thrown roadblocks in Spaulding's  path.  ""We have encountered various  forms of  resistance,"" Mrs. Smith said. ""One agency's  adoption worker  talked about  referring  a  black, 11-year-old girl  to us. The  referral  was 'squashed' by the director of the agency  because the director felt Spaulding was 'stlll  too new.' So the child goes unplaced, even  though we presently have a prospective adop tive family requesting such a child.""  TRY TO ""DUMP"" KIDS  to  ""There have been other instances when an  agency showed a desire to use Spaulding to  'dump' kids  for whom  there  is no other  place,"" she said.  Mrs. Smith cited the case of a 17-year-old  boy whom an agency worker  referred  Spaulding. A check of  the child's records  showed that he was not legally free and had  never  been  consulted  about whether  he  wanted to be adopted. But the worker had to  ""move the boy and saw Spaulding as a con venient way of getting rid of the problem.""  In another instance, an agency caseworker  expressed ""ambivalence"" about the adoption  possibilities of a 12-year-old black boy re ferred  to Spaulding a year ago when  the  child became legally free.  ""Although we have offered our assistance  to the agency and spent many hours helping  the worker prepare the child for adoption,  ",1975
265,,94,-0.386,270,19,Mrs. SULLIVAN.," Mr. Speaker, the Na tional Association of Housing and Re development Officials-NAHRO-an out standing  organization  of  professional  men and women in the field of urban  planning and housing improvement, re cently held a national conference in my  city of St. Louis to discuss the social goals  and social impact of housing and com munity  development. As  the  ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Housing  of  the House Committee on Banking,  Currency and Housing, and a member of  that subcommittee since it was estab lished 20 years ago, I was pleased to ac cept NAHRO's invitation to deliver the  keynote address at the opening of the  conference.  The picture I painted of the outlook  for  our  cities,  unless  fundamental  changes are achieved in the safety and  well-being of the fearful people who re side in our cities, was rather grim. The  acute housing problems cannot be solved  by professionals  in  the housing  field  alone, or by unlimited appropriation of  funds for them to administer. It is going  to take the combined and coordinated  efforts of many professional groups the sociologists, the clergy, the educators,  the political leaders, the police, the pros ecutors,  the judges, and the probation  officers, among others-to save our cities  by making them once again safe and sat isfying places in which to live. We must  find a way to meld all of these profes sionals  into a  strike force  for human  safety and dignity, and enlist the people  of the community into the same war.  That was supposed to be the concept  of model cities, until model cities was  transformed from a concentrated dem onstration approach in a  limited num ber of areas into yet another broad pro gram  for  channeling  some  additional  Federal funds  into every city. So we  ended up with no truly ""model"" cities.  Mr. Speaker, I now hope that many of  our cities will use substantial amounts of  their fund allocations under  the new  community development block grant pro gram, which supersedes the old categori cal assistance programs,  to coordinate  their attack on housing problems with  an attack also on all of the other prob lems in the community which contribute  to neighborhood decay and urban blight.  And :first and foremost is the necessity to  make the city a safe place to walk, in  which householders are secure in their  ",1975

284,,94,0.291,530,19,Mr. MYERS of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker, I am inserting in the RECORD  two articles from a newspaper in my dis trict, the Beaver Falls, Pa., News-Trib une, which carried first-hand stories of  the difficulty business has  in making  progress under the blanket of Federal  Govemmen t rules and regulations.  Babcock and Wilcox Co. in my district,  Mr. Speaker, operates plants  four  States employing 7,000 people. It is trying  to accumulate capital for plant additions  to employ more people. Soon it will com plete one plant in Ambridge, Pa.  in my  district and employ 600 new work~rs. But  cash is getting scarce. In 1971 Babcock  and Wilcox spent $14 million on air and  water purification systems and spends  another $100,000  a  year  to maintain  them. The Babcock and Wilcox system  in  July 23, 1975  set the standards for similar industries  and the company is proud of what they  have done to make the 25th district a  better place to live. The public and the  government look upon Babcock and Wil cox and other industries of its size as  profit takers ripe for tougher economic  controls and taxation.  Mr.  Speaker, Babcock  and Wilcox  profits last year were 2.7 cents on each  sale dollar.  The articles follow:  [From the Beaver Falls {Pa.) News-Tribune,  May 21, 1975]  B&W OFFICIALS FRUSTRATED BY GOVERNMENT  Government indecision, lack of long-range  planning  and  attempts  to  regulate  every  phase of business are creating a serious sense  of frustration for official of Babcock & Wilcox  Co., Tubular Products Division, according to  George Kross Jr., vice president and general  manager of  the division headquartered  in  Beaver Falls.  ""Our enormous government complex seems  no longer satisfied with protecting the long term interest of the American people,"" Kross  said. ""Government seems far more concerned  with running and regulating business than  in planning  for and meeting  the crucial  issues which face the nation.  ""Through its present policies, regulations,  indecisions and lack of foresight,  the gov ernment is destroying the businesses and in dustries  that through  taxes, products and  payrolls have helped build this nation and  our current standard of living.  ""And unless government does its job and  allows business and industry to do their job  there won't be many people left working ir{  this country's industries.""  Kross  cites  the  ""alphabet of  agencies""  that now attempts to manage business' every  move---,in the use of fuels, in profits, in em ployment practices, in pollution control and  in many other areas.  B&W's ability to produce and to employ  is directly influenced by numerous agencies  created through legislation: Federal Energy  Administration (FEA), Interstate Commerce  Commission  (ICC), Environmental Protec  tion Agency (EPA), state departments of en vironmental resources (DER), Federal Power  Commission (FPC), the Occupational Safety  & Health Administration (OSHA), plus other  dictated policies from government.  ""We at B&W favor much of the more hu manitarian government legislation, but there  is a  limit to what companies like B&W can  immediately do. There is a. limit to how much  money we can immediately afford to spend in  non-productive areas,"" Kross said, ""and con tinue to produce and employ our people.""  B&W officials want cleaner air and water  both inside and outside their plants. They  don't want  to spend American dollars on  foreign oil. They want reasonable profits. But  they also want to keep the more than 7,000  men and women working at their plants in  Beaver Falls; Alliance, Ohio; Milwaukee, Wis.  and Elkhart, Ind.  ""It comes down to a. matter of economics.  Not what we'd like to do, but what we can  economically do.  ""This country's growth and  future  are  based on the economic concept of profits:  selling goods for a certain price, and then  reinvesting profits  from  sales  to  expand,  modernize  and produce more and better  goods-goods  that  are  needed by people  throughout the world,"" Kross said. ""Without  pro:fl ts and the expansions and moderniza tions  they produce, we will be unable  to  continue to provide more and better jobs.  ""Unless business and industry in this coun try make a. reasonable pro:fl t, the only growth  we'll see wm be in the length of the unem ployment lines,"" he added.

292,House,94,-0.055,556,19,Mr. PEYS'ER.," I  thank the gentleman  for his comments.  Mr. Chairman, this is not an easy vote  for me today. I am a Republican, and we  have, I believe, an outstanding Republi can President sitting in the White House  today. But, I also feel that if President  Ford were sitting in the House with us  today as a Member of Congress, I am  confident he would say to us, ""Listen to  both sides of the argument and act using  your own judgment as to what you think  is best for this country.""  I am equally sure he would never sug gest  that Congress  act as  a  rubber stamp for the executive branch. I have  very much appreciated the opportunity  given to me by President Ford to let me  hear  the administration's side of  the  picture, and I am equally  indebted to  the many Members of this body, who  have been actively  involved over  the  past 8 months, in learning their points  of view. I have, after careful thought,  reached a decision on  this  issue. My  decision is based on many factors; but  due to the very limited time, I am going  to touch on just two of them.  In the fall of 1972 the Turkish Gov ernment put  into force an agreement  reached with the U.S. Government not  to have its people grow the poppy that is  ultimately used for  the production of  heroin. In exchange for this, the United  States agreed to pay the Turkish Gov ernment in excess of $35 million. There  is no need for me to outline to the Mem bers the havoc that was being wrought  in this country by the influx of heroin.  In the summer of 1974 the same Turk ish Government  ultimately broke  its  agreement unilaterally and once again  reinStated the tight of ~he farmers  in  Turkey  to grow  lbhe  mated by our people this year that over  140  tons of o~um wi'll be produced in  Turkey.  !POPPY. It is esti The impact on our country, if we are  not successful  in stopping the flow of  heroin into this country that is now be ing produced,  is going  .to be perfectly  terrible. For this reason, I feel ithat the  word of tflhe Turkish Government is very  much in doubt. This is a government  that  tod.ay says  Ito us:  ""Approve our  arms deal or we will throw you out of  the mi1ldtary bases.""  I would also like to note that today  in ltftle press  lthe GovernmenJt of Jor dan-and thiis ls King Hussein speak ing-said:  deaa or ,we WI  wiN.  Do not attempt Ito soale d'OWll our arms  go elsewhere. Such attempts  entMl adverse effects on  the Untlted  StaJtes and Jordan 'l'ell81tionsh'ips.  the  I wonder, are we really a!bout to go  down a road in foreign a:ffiairs !that has  a signJI>OSt on i't 1that says, ""Shout loud  enough, threaJten us enough, and we win  give you whlat you want, whether we  agree wilhh tt or not.""  I am beginning to 'beldeve we are in a  period of foreign policy by blackmail,  and I hope we can .get out o'f that period  and get out of 1:t right now and th1a;t for eign governments recognize that our ac ti:ons will ndt lbe controilled lby threats.  I believe thlat lthe people of this coun try want us to be pavt of the world com munity, but they want and demand thait  we  in GovernmenJt act  independently  and not under the threS~t of reprisal.  I believe that thls Vldte today against  further aid to Turkey, at this time, will  make our feelings very clear.  The CHAIRMAN. The  ttime of  gentleman has eX~pired.  ",1975

I would  suggest that there is a more immediate  concern to which we are directing our  attention in the adoPtion of this bill,  and that is the concern that we feel in  our healits  for  fue  180,000 or more  Cypriot refugees who have been driven  from their homes because of this tragic  inltercommunal or civil conflict. I would  suggest that  if we  really want  to do  something for  'tlhose people,  for  those  that we ought to adopt this  refugees,  legislation ftod13JY.  When we look at the Middle East to day, what is the problem there thS~t for  more than a quarter of a century has  continued to feSter and break ou't once,  twice,  three  timees,  in tragic war? It  has been the prdblem of the Palestinian  refugees, has it not? The problem of  hundreds of  thousands of people who  were driven from their homes, 'and be cause we have ndt had a poliltical or  judicial settlement of the issues involv ing those refugees, they continue to keep  the  threat of war hanging over  the  Middle East even today.  I would suggest that unless we can do  something to solve the problem of the  refugees on Cyprus, unless we can have  a political settlement of that dispute, we  are going to continue to have 'the threat  of war hanging over tba;t unhaJPPY  land. This bill, in my judgment, in my  hUJmble opinion, at least moves us off  the position of tota~ impasse where we  stand today.  The suggestion has been 'that some of  us supporting -this  legisla;tion  are not  realily  interested  in the plight of  the  refugees, that the U.S. Government has  been  less  than coneemed about  these  people driven from their homes.  I  think  the  facts  belie  any  such  charges. This country was one of the very  few countries to respond to the world wide appeal that was made by the United  Nations High Commission on Refugees  and the International Committee for the  Red Cross last summer. We have donated  in the  last fiscal year,  the one ended  June 30, $36 million for the assistance of  these people. We have requested an ad ditional $25 million in the fiscal year 1976  tO finance the U.S. support for Cyprus,  $15 mil1lcm of that to cover some of the  is I  relief activities, the cost of the U.S. sup port of the relief activities. The cost of  feeding these displaced persons in both  zones of Cyprus is estimated to cost more  than $3 million a month alone.  Let us do something, I plead with the  Members of this House, about the plight  of these unhappy people. Let us at least,  with the passage of this legislation, try  to  take one positive constructive step  forward to move us out of the present  stalemated condition in which we find  ourselves, and hope that thereby we can  encourage the reasonable ongoing nego tiations between the major powers who  had agreed to guarantee the security and  the independence of Cyprus, that we may  achieve a  solution rather than a con tinuation of the stalemate.

294,House,94,-0.186,582,19,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  without any enthusiasm to announce my  intention to vote for S. 846 a bill to sus pend in part the existing ban on U.S.  arms shipment to Turkey.  This issue presents to me an excruci ating dilemma.  A vote for S. 846 is a vote to resume the  flow of arms and armaments to Turkey a country in deep conflict with its neigh bor, Greece.  I believe it is an unwise and improper  policy for the United States to be arms  dealer and weapons purveyor  to  the  world.  I  think  this  is wrong  regardless of  whether the arms are sent to Turkey,  Greece, and Arab nations, or to Israel.  On the other hand, a vote against S.  846 is a vote against taking an initiative  which might lead to the resolution of the  impasse now existing between Greece  and Turkey over the Island of Cyprus.  And as long as this impasse is not bro ken, the plight of the Greek and Cypriot  refugees deepens and worsens.  I am persuaded, Mr. Chairman, by the  statements of leading Members of Con gress, by  the President, and Secretary  Kissinger  that  the only  real hope  for  prompt, constructive moves  toward a  peaceful settlement of vexing issues in volved in the Cyprus question is by a par tial lifting of the ban-imposed this past  February by  the Congress-on  arms  shipments to Turkey.  Resolving  this dilemma has been a  terrible task for me.  In the final analysis, Mr. Chairman,  I have decided to vote for S. 846 only be cause irts passage might ease the human  travail and suffering of  the people of  Cyprus.  The CHAIRMAN. All time has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the Clerk will now  read the amendment in the nature of a  substitute printed in the bill as an origi nal bill for the purpose of amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of the United States of Amer ica in Congress assembled, That the Congress  rea.mrms the policy of the United States to  seek  to  improve and harmonize  relations  among the ames of the United States and  between the United States and its allies, in  the interest of mutual defense and national  security. In particular, the Congress reoog(a.)  nlzes the special contribution to the North  Atlantic Alliance of Greece and Turkey by  virtue of  their geographic position on the  southeastern flank of Europe and is prepared  to assist in the modernization and strength ening of their respective armed forces.  The Congress further reaffirms the policy  of the United States to alleviate the suffering  of refugees and other victims of armed con flict and to foster and promote international  efforts  to a.mellora.te  the conditions which  prevent such persons from resuming normal  and productive  lives. The Congress,  there fore, calls upon the President to encourage  and to cooperate in the implementation of  multilateral progra.ms, under the auspices of  the Secretary General of the United Nations,  the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees or other appropriate international  agencies, for the relief of and assistance to  refugees and other persons disadvantaged by  the hostilities on Cyprus.  SEc. 2.  In order that the purposes of  this Act may be carried out without awaiting  the enactment of foreign assistance legisla tion for fiscal year 1976 programs(!) the President is authorized, nothwith sta.nding any other provision of law, to fur ni~h to the Government of Turkey those de fense articles and defense services with re spect to which contracts of sale were signed  under section 21 or section 22 of the Foreign  Military Sales Act on or before February 5,  1975, and  to  issue  licenses for  the  trans portation to the Government of Turkey of  arms, ammunition, and implements of war  (including technical data relating thereto):  Provided, That such authorization shall be  effective only while Turkey shall observe the  cease-fire and shall neither increase its forces  on Cyprus nor transfer to Cyprus any United  States supplied implements of war; and  (2)  the President is requested to initiate  discussions with the Government of Greece  to determine the most urgent needs of Greece  for economic and military assistance.  (b) The President is directed to submit to  the Speaker of the House of Representatives  and to the Foreign Relations and Appropria tions Committees of the Senate within sixty  days after the enactment of this Act a report  on discussions conducted under subsection  (a.) (2), together with his recommendations  for  economic  and military  assistance  to  Greece for the fiscal year 1976.  SEc. 3.  (a.) Section 620(x) of the Foreign  Assistance Act of 1961  is amended by strik ing out all after the word ""Provided,"" and  insel'ting in lieu thereof the following: ""That  the President  is authorized to suspend the  provisions of this section and of section 3 (c)  of .the Foreign Military Sales Act only with  respect to sales, credits, and guaranties under  the Foreign Military Sales Act, as amended,  for the procurement of such defense articles  and defense services as the President deter mines and certifies to the Congress are nec essary  in order  to enable Turkey to fulfill  her defense responsibilities as a. member of  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Any  such suspension shall be effective only while  Turkey shall observe the cease-fire and shall  neither  increase  its  forces on Cyprus nor  transfer to Cyprus any United States sup plied arms, ammunition, and implements of  war."".  (b) Section 620(x) of the Foreign Assis tance Act of 1961  is  further amended by  designating the present subsection as para graph ( 1) and by adding at the end thereof  the following new paragraph :  ""(2) The President shall submit  to  the  Congress within sixty days after the enact ment of this paragraph, and at the end of  each succeeding sixty-day period,  a.  report  on progress made during such period toward  the conclusion of a. negotiated solution of  the Cyprus conflict."".  (c) Nothing in this section shall be con strued as authorizing ( 1) mmta.ry assistance  to Turkey under chapter 2 of part II of the  Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, or (2) sales,  credits, or guaranties to or on behalf of Tur key under the Foreign Military Sales Act for  the procurement of defense articles or de fense services not determined by the Presi dent  to be needed  for  the  fulfillment of  Turkey's North Atlantic Treaty Organization  responsib111ties.  (d) This section shall become effective only  upon enactment of foreign assistance legisla tion authorizing sales, credits, and guaranties  under the Foreign M111ta.ry Sales Act for fiscal  year 1976.

298,House,94,-0.49,608,19,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Chairman, it is a fa miliar saying in legal circles that when  the law is against you, you should at tack on the facts. When the facts are  against you, you should attack the law.  When both the facts and the law are  against  you,  you  should  attack  the  credibility and character of your oppo nent. That is precisely what is happen ing with this issue.  First. The opponents of H.R. 5900  claim  that the building  trades unions  do not deserve any assistance because  they are ""racist.""  Second. They claim  that  the  con struction  tradesmen do not need any  assistance  because  they  are  already  overpaid.  Third. They claim,  finally,  that the  building  trades are  too strong at  the  bargaining  table. They  argue  that a  ""balance"" between  labor and manage ment in the construction industry now  exist, and passage of  this  legislation  would tilt that balance toward labor.  Let me briefly comment on these three  points.  It would be asinine for me to deny a  history of  racism within  the building  trades unions, just is it would be asinine  for me to deny a history of racism in any  other institution within our Government  or culture. Historically, our schools, our  churches, our system of justice, our polit ical parties, all of our institutions have  practiced  racial discrimination  in one  form or another. The building  trades  unions also share this ugly blot on our  democratic promise of equality.  But we must deal with the present, not  with the past.  The AFL-CIO and the building trades  department worked side by side in push ing the major civil rights bills through  Congress. Where were the opponents of  H.R. 5900 during the great struggle for  human decency in the sixties? Every na tional union has long since called for a  halt in discriminatory practices within  their  ranks;  and with  rare and  iso la ted exception  the  local unions have  responded.  Nine percent of all craft union trades men today come from minority groups.  The number of minority tradesmen em ployed by the ""open shop"" nonunion em ployees is almost nonexistant.  OVer 16 percent of all current appren tices under union-sponsored programs  come from the ranks of minority groups.  Very few other industries or segments of  society can match this record.  We have heard, in testimony by op ponents of this bill, that in a given time  and in a given place a small given group  of highly  trained  tradesmen make an  hourly wage which  is  somehow much  more than they deserve.  However, the average hourly wage in  construction is $6.76; slightly above that  paid in steel mills, $6.25 an hour; in au tomobile factories, $6.20 an hour; and in  transportation, $5.40 an hour.  But the hourly wage  is  just a small  part of the economic picture. Rain, snow,  and other elements  stop construction  work, but not  the work  in  the other  comparable industries. A full work year  generally consists of 2,080 hours; but in  construction  it  is  somewhere between  1,500 and 1,800 hours. The consequence  is that the annual earnings in construc tion are less than in the industries above  referred to. The figures are as follows:  the average annual income in construc tion is $10,254; in steel mills, $10,918; in  automobile plants, $12,458; and in trans portation, $11,738.  Income should be somewhat commen surate to skills, training and experience  brought to the job. Thus, we accept the  fact  that doctors,  lawyers, and others  with professional  training earn on an  average far more than the lesser trained  persons in our society. We also accept the  fact that athletes with special skills earn  amounts far in excess of that earned by  most of us.  The opponents of H.R. 5900 complain  that the skilled tradesman is ""overpaid.""  But they never mention the training, the  skills and the experience he brings onto  the  job. Young men and women enter  the  construction  trades with  a  high  school diploma, and enter an apprentice  program lasting up  to 6 years. During  this  time  they are paid apprenticeship  wages. Then, follows a period of ""jour neyman worker,"" while skill and experi ence is acquired. Finally, after years of  classroom and on-the-job  training the  worker becomes a master craftsman and  reaches the highest financial rewards.  Finally, any discussion on wages and  income is only meaningful when one talks  about the risks and dangers assumed in  the process of earning a living. The dan gers in construction are well known.  Who here wants to earn a living weld ing steel on a 40th-floor construction?  Who amongst us wants  to carry high  voltage wires in high places or in low?  Who wants to go under the Earth and  tunnel through porous rock?  Who  knows  a  painter without  a  chronic cough? A plumber without a  sore back? An electrician without burn  scars on his torso?  The  risks  in  construction are well  known, and well documented.  The rate of  injuries  in construction  almost doubles  that in transportation:  19 per 100 workers in the former, 10.8  per 100 workers  in the latter. But the  numbers of  injuries does not  tell  the  complete tale. The severity and duration  of the injuries is even more significant;  and each days' paper tells of some ca tastrophe somewhere in construction.  Finally, when the opponents of H.R.  5900 say that the balance of power in the  construction industry  is ""about right,''  I think of the testimony at our hearings.  Robert Georgine,  president  of  the  Building Trades Department lamented  before us one day that the number and  percentage of ""union construction jobs""  was on a steady decline.

And, as the Senator from  Delaware suggests,  there is no easy or  good solution to this serious problem. The  only thing we can be sure about is that  the President  is not able, will not be  able, to get everything he wants in this  regard; and we can be equally sure Con gress will not be able to get everything  it wants in this regard.  That being the case, the only logical  thing to do, it seems to me, is for both  the President and Congress to work out  some acceptable compromise.

(By Art Harris)  A ""do-nothing"" Democratic Congress did  something last night.  They came out of oblivion to upset the  perennial champion Republicans in the 14th.  annual U.S. Congressional baselball game at  Memorial Stadium Monday night.  There had been speculation in Washington  on whether the near ""veto-proof"" Democratic  majority in the Congress could end the Re publican's domination of the game. Among  players the GOP lost (due to their not hav Ing  been  re-elected)  were Vinegar Bend  Mizell, a  former major leaguer.  I have no depth left at all,"" said Republi can manager Silvio Conte, wearing a Boston  Red Sox uniform. ""This is like in 1965 after  the Goldwater landslide, when we also lost  some of our best fielders and hitters,"" he  said.  ""To win, we'll  them,"" he smiled.  While ecstatic Democrats hovered around  their winning manager after the game, Sen.  Howell Weicker of Connecticut was more  philosophical.  ""For every ballgame we win, we  lose an  election. I'd trade a loss here for a sweep in  1976"" he said.  Different congressmen  took  the serious ness of  the game 1n different ways. Rep.  Bob Duncan of Oregon expressed that ""you've  gotta relax once in a whUe,"" between chews  of tobacco.  However, the Republican's starting pitcher,  Bob Michel of Illinois, said he ""would tra-de  some legislation for this ballgame.""  During the game, some Democrats tried to  explain why the Republicans have dominated  this July classic in the past.  ""Republicans spend more time practicing,  and less time legislating,"" said Sen. Joe Biden  of Delaware.  One reason for the absence of many fresh man Democrats was advanced by Rep. Dun can: ""They're either in the ltbrary or plot ting to overthrow. the Speaker.""  Maryland was poorly represented 1n the  game, with only  third District Rep. Paul  Sarbanes showing up--in street clothes.

309,House,94,0.16,946,19,Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  today have joined with several of my  colleagues in sponsoring a  joint resolu tion calling for free elections in Portugal.  The purpose of our resolution is to tell  the Communist forces in Portugal that  the American people and the rest of the  free world cannot remain indifferent to  the blatant Communist effort to subvert  the expressed will of the overwhelming  majority of  the Portuguese people.  In an election held in April in which 92  percent of the registered voters went to  the polls, the anti-Communist parties re ceived 64 percent of the vote while the  Communists received only 12.5 percent.  These figures clearly indicate the desire  of the people to establish a free and plu ralistic society.  Communist party leader, Alvaro Cun ha!, recently boasted that:  We Communists don't accept the rules of  the election game. No, no, no;  I care noth ing for elections. We don't await the results  of elections to change  things. Our way  is  revolution. Portugal will never be a country  of democratic freedoms.  The brutality of his statement has  sickened the entire free world.  I  am also appalled by  the violence  which has taken place in Portugal. In  Oporto,  the second  largest city, 75,000  anti-Communists  rallied  to  proclaim  their support to democracy. The Com munists  responded with  barbed wire  roadblocks  and  nail-studded  planks.  Even this did not stop the demonstration.  The situation  in Portugal also con cerns me inasmuch as it directly threat ens our security. A Communist takeover  would deny us our base in the Azores,  which would limit our ability to respond  promptly and appropriately  in critical  situations.  Portugal  and  the Azores  Islands are critically important to Eu rope,  the Mediterranean,  the Middle  East, and  the United States. For  this  reason, we must offer  encouragement  and support for those leaders in Portu gal who are revolting against this Com munist  takeover and struggling  to see  that the country remains a free and open  society. Our  traditional economic and  security interests are very much at stake  and should Portugal go Communist it  will have a profoundly adverse effect  on our free society.  My recent trip to the NATO countries  underscored for me  the importance of  a strong and firm position in this part  of the world.  President Ford recently stated that:  The U.S. would do what we  can  in a  legitimate, proper way  to make  sure  the  rights of the Portuguese people are protected.  Our resolution provides the vehicle for  such action by the President. Our pro posal calls for the adoption of a resolu tion at  the upcoming Helsinki Con ference proclaiming  the  right of  the  Portuguese people  to determine  their  own form of government  through free  elections, and  the establishment of a  special committee to supervise the hold ing of the elections.  Our resolution further calls upon the  Soviet Union to end its financial aid and  arms support to the Communists. Soviet  interference is clearly a self-serving ef fort. A complete takeover of the Portu guese Government by  the Communists  would provide the Soviets with a stra tegic point from which they could ulti mately control the Middle East oil and  thus  economically  strangle  the  free  world. They could also gain control over  the countries  in northern Africa and  those around the Mediterranean.  I grew up with, went to school with  and came to know many people of Portu guese descent. I found them to be hon est,  extremely hardworking  and very  proud of their Portuguese culture, and  of  the  relationship which has existed  between the United States and Portugal.  From this relationship I have enjoyed  with my many Portuguese  friends,  I  have many  reasons  to be more  than  sympathetic and concerned with  this  blatant attempt by the Communists to  subvert the election process and by tak ing over the military and security orga nizations with the sole purpose of impos ing a government on the people that is  not consistent with  their free election  choice.

And unless we  write another law saying they cannot fly  into the limits of the United States, they  can. They can come over New York, they  can ask landing permission.  Now, unless the law says they cannot  land, all that can be said is ""We are very  sorry, boys, but we cannot give landing  instructions,"" in which case he says, ""I  declare an emergency.""  Now, when that happens, it is all over.  He is going to land.  I  just point this out as a very prac tical thing. I do not believe the writers  of this amendment gave any attention  to this.

313,,94,0.378,1115,19,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr.  Speaker,  as a member of the Committee on In ternational Relations,  I  join with  the  Honorable WILLIAM S. BROOMFIELD  of  Michigan in calling for hearings on our  policy of detente with the Soviet Union.  We are now at a time when we must  completely reassess our foreign policy.  As a nation, we must hold a vigorous  discussion on our place  in  the world.  One of the primary focuses of this de bate must be ""detente.""  We came out of World War II believ ing in collective security. We felt that  collective security could have prevented  the war. Yet our faith in collective se curity has been severely shaken during  the last 25 years. We have suffered over  900,000  casualties--both  killed  and  wounded-in defense of a collective se curity which was not collective. Ninety  percent of the non-Koreans defending  South Korea were Americans, and 80  percent of the non-Vietnamese fighting  against the Communists in Vietnam were  Americans. This was not  the kind of  collective  security  envisioned  by  the  signers of pacts such as NATO, SEATO,  etc. A reexamination of collective secu rity is certainly due.  In our zeal to correct the mistakes of  the 1960's, however, we must not rush to  accept the mistakes of the 1930's. The  policy of ""fortress America"" could easily  lead to disaster in a nuclear world. Un der  the policy of  ""fortress America,""  we would isolate ourselves from the rest  of  the world until  the situation were  totally hopeless, and our only alterna tives would be nuclear destruction or  surrender. We cannot afford  to  limit  ourselves or future generations to these  options.  Our answer, then, has been ""detente.""  It seemed to work for a while. The United  States and the Soviet Union have com municated with each other on an un precedented  scale.  The  Quadpartite  Agreement on Berlin has done much to  eliminate that city as a ""hot spot."" Ten sions have eased and the world appears  to be further from a nuclear ""hot war""  than at any time during the last 20 years.  But a brief  look around  the world  indicates that everything is not well. The  recent setbacks  in Southeast Asia are  on everyone's mind. Right now, Thai land and the Phillipines are seeking to  drastically weaken  their  ties with  the  United States, Laos is coming increas ingly under  the control of  the Pathet  Lao, and  the  situation  in Burma  is  worsening. In India, the world's largest  democracy has moved in the direction  of dictatorship. The Arabs are practically  waging an economic war with the United  States.  The situation is little better in Africa  and Europe. Anarchy prevails in Angola,  and the situation in the southem part  ",1975

OBEY  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 25, 1975  ",1975
315,,94,-0.45,1128,19,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker,  last week,  reporter Mike Jackson presented a most  moving and important story on the NBC  Nightly News. Mr. Jackson reported on  the fate of a dairy farmer who has been  forced out of business by high costs and  low  prices. His  report  illustrated,  in  striking human terms, the crisis our dairy  farmers are facing, and  it gave some  much-needed attention to a problem that  has too often been neglected by the news  media.  Although this particular farmer was  from Minnesota, his story is being re peated all over the country. In my own  State we ha;ve already lost 1,000 farmers  so far this year, and there is no relief in  sight. It has long been my belief that  a strong and self-sufficient dairy industry  is vital to American consumers as well as  farmers. News reports such as this one  are one of the best means I know of to  impress  the American people with the  tremendous economic pressures our dairy  farmers are facing, and the tragic conJuly 25, 1975  sequences those pressures hold for indi vidual farmers, as well as for the Nation.  Often I hear expressed the feeling that  network news  is biased  toward urban  life and does not seem to adequately com municate  the problems  faced by rural  America. I frankly disagree with that. I  think that on balance during the last  3 years the plight of farmers has been  more adequately explained to the Amer ican people by the  television networks  than by any other group in our society.  I have seen at least 9 or 10 different seg ments on the evening news throughout  the last year which make quite clear-to  anyone who is willing to listen-the cost price squeeze  faced by farmers across  the country and dairy farmers in par ticular.  I want to commend Mr. Jackson and  the NBC Nightly News for this clear de scription of the human problems faced  by dairy farmers.  I know that because of the milk money  scandals some people view dairying as a  plush business with huge herds, huge real  estate  and  plenty  of  bucks  floating  around. That picture may describe 5 per cent of American dairying but it does not  describe the plight of the average dairy  farmer in the State of Wisconsin who  gets up at 5:30 in the morning, runs the  farm through the efforts of Ma, Pa, and  the kids, has 40 cows, not 400 or 4,000.  and has to work mighty hard-harder  than most people I know would be will ing to work-in order to make a halfway  decent living.  The NBC effort last week contributed  to giving  the American people a more  clear understanding of what life is really  like for all too many people these days  down on the farm.  I commend Mr. Jackson and the NBC  Nightly News staff for  this fine effort.  and request that the transcript of the  report be printed in the RECORD.  TRANSCRIPT OF A SEGMENT FROM THE NBC  NIGHTLY NEWS, JULY 16, 1975  MIKE JACKSON. There are dairy farm sales  almost every week in Minnesota and Wiscon sin. Farmers like Clifford Greenwood giving  up the business because they say there's no  money in it.  Greenwood grew up on a farm, but worked  in  the city as a  transmission mechanic to  earn enough to buy his own dairy herd. Two  years ago, he bought this 100-acre farm. Back  then, dairy prices were good. But prices have  dropped; costs have risen; and Clifford Green wood has given up.  CLIFFORD GREENWOOD.  I can go Up  to the  bank today, and borrow money. But I hate  to work half to death and keep on borrowing  money to break even. I'm hoping that some day I can say ""this is mine, and nobody can  take it away from me."" And I'm not gonna do  it by keeping cost.  JAcKsoN. Clifford Greenwood couldn't even  break even selling out. His 22 cows cost al most $600 dollars a piece two years ago. At  his auction, he got  little more  than half  that.  Many of the farmers at the auction main tain that Clifford Greenwood's farm was just  the right size to succeed. His was a one-man  operation. Overhead was low. But profits he  could make  from milk were  not  nearly  enough to cover his expenses.  Clifford doesn't know who to blame. He did  everything he could do to make it. But he  says the government hurt him by not raising  ",1975
316,Senate,94,-0.269,1180,19,Mr. MONTOYA.," Mr. President, there maining items in this title are based on  the formula in the Postal Reorganization  Act-Public Law 91-375-for appropria tion of funding for public service costs,  revenue foregone, and the unfunded lia bility of the Post Office Department when  it was a Federal agency.  The committee recommends a separate  appropriation of $7,000,000 for reestab lishment of a revolving fund for making  advance payments to U.S. international  air carriers. These carriers are having a  difficult  time in collecting funds  from  foreign countries for the carriage of mail  pursuant  to  international  agreements.  This revolving fund is authorized by 39  U.S.C. 2602 and was in operation until  1965.  TITLE UI-EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE  PRESIDENT  The committee recommends $64,911,000 for the Executive Office of the Presi dent. This is a reduction of $18,151,000  from the budget estimate and a reduction  of $16,230,000 from the House bill.  Public Law 93-346 established the for mer residence of the Chief of Naval Op erations at the Naval Observatory as the  temporary, official residence of the Vice  President. The committee recommended  an increase of $170,000 to the House bill  to air-condition this residence. The Vice  President and his family will occupy the  residence during  fiscal year 1976.  In creases are also  recommended  to  the  House bill of $500,000 for the Office of  Management and Budget for increased  staffing, and $200,000 for increased start up costs for the Office of Federal Pro curement Policy.  It is recommended $500,000 be reduced  from the unanticipated needs appropria tion  to provide contingency funds  for  the President at the level appropriated  during fiscal year 1975; $400,000  from  the Office of Telecommunications Pol icy; and $16,200,000 from the appropri ation request for expansion of defense  production expenses, Defense Produc tion Act. This appropriation, authorized  by Public Law 93-426, is the interest on  the current market value of materials  stockpiled under the Defense Production  Act <DPA).  It was  anticipated  these  funds would procure additional materials  for  the DPA stockpile when  required.  The committee ha.s been advised that no  material is planned to be procured in fis cal year 1976.  TITLE  IV-INDEPENDENT AGENCIES  For independent agenc.ies, tl:e commit tee recommends $2,220,9~o.noo. This is a  reduction of $21,743,000 from the budget  estimate and an increase of $64,013,848  over the House bill. This is due primar ily to inclusion of $65,000,000  for payment to the general supply fund of the  General Services Administration to  in crease  capitalization of  the  revolving  fund. This fund has not been augmented  since 1967. Due to continuing increases  in sales volume and substantial price  increases, there has been a constant ero sion of available resources. The House  denied  this amendment without preju dice as it wa.s too late to hold hearings.  The committee recommends $94,700,000  for  the Civil Service Commission.  This is an increase of $200,000 over the  House bill to provide the Office of Vet erans' Affairs with resources  to  imple ment fully its new responsibilities pur suant to the Vietnam Era Veterans Read justment Act of 1974-Public Law 93.508.  An increase to the House bill of $760,000 for the salaries and expenses, Federal  management policy appropriation is rec ommended to provide for continued op eration of  this organization under  the  General Services Administration during  fiscal year 1976 pending the results of a  review by the Office of Management and  Budget as to proper organizational place ment for this responsibility.  For the allowances and office staff of  former Presidents, the committee recom mends an increase of $53,848 to the House  bill. This provides a  reduction  to  the  budget estimate of $28,000 and will pro vide  $65,000  for pensions  and postal  franking privileges for widows of former  Presidents,  the pension of $60,000  for  for former President Nixon and $175,000  for his office staff and related expenses  under the Former Presidents Act of 1958,  as amended.  The Federal Supply Service and the  Office of Preparedness are each recom mended for reductions of $1,000,000 from  the House bill.  For the Federal buildings fund, which  was  created by  the Public Buildings  Amendments of 1972, Public Law 92-313,  the committee recommends  limitations  on the availability of revenue collected  from the standard level user charges of  $1,142,554,000. This  is  an  increase of  $26,200,000 over  the House bill and a  reduction of $7,429,000 from the budget  estimate. The increase over the House bill  will provide for construction of a sorely  needed tunnel at the Federal office build ing in Oklahoma City, Okla., and  in creased limitations for rental of space,  program direction and centralized serv ice, and for real property operations. The  latter will continue current building op erations and services at the fiscal year  1975  levels and provide for known in creases in utility rates and fuel adjust ment charges.  The House bill recommends langug,ge  which would require all sums accruing  to  the Federal building5;  fund  above  $1.141,354,000 to be deposited in the mis cellaneous receipts of the Treasury. The  House  language would  include  funds  which were  carried  over  from  prior  years. The committee recommends that  prior year funds remain in the Federal  buildings fund. :rt is the opinion of the  committee that sufficient control of the  fund is exercised by the Congress in ap proving  the annual  limitations on  the  availability of revenue.  The House bill directs construction  ",1975
317,Senate,94,-0.314,1193,19,Mr. HUDDLESTON.," Mr. President, as  a member of the Subcommittee on BUD Independent Agencies of the Senate Ap propriations Committee, I am pleased to  support the pending bill, H.R. 8070.  There are certain basic items which  we in this Nation must provide for our  people. Decent housing is certainly one  of these. And while we have done much  to provide adequate housing for millions  of our citizens, much remains to be done.  Over 9 percent of our Nation's 67.7 mil lion housing units are considered sub standard. Some 7 million families live in  such housing. Another 9 million pay a  disproportionate portion of their incomes  for housing. Thousands of others have  recently found a lack of mortgage credit  a barrier to new or improved housing.  New housing starts have dropped from  an annual rate of over 2 million in 1973  to a rate of 1.07 million in June of this  year. Unemployment in the construction  industry remains high, despite a slight  drop in the past several months.  My State of KentuckY has not been  unaffected by these developments. Some  22.5 percent of our housing is considered  substandard. The number of building  permits issued has fallen. In mid-July,  unemployment in the construction in dustry was running about 20 percent.  Certainly, with this appropriation, we  will not solve ali--or even most-of our  problems but it will, I believe, help us  move forward in a number of important  areas.  First, the bill earmarks $100 million  for  the SMSA balance fund under the  community development program. This  is the fund which provides assistance to  small  communities  within  standard  metropolitan statistical areas. Last year,  the first year under this program, there  were more than 1500 preapplications for  assistance. The only funding available,  however, was $54 million, and that was  made available in a supplemental appro priations bill. With the budget estimate  for fiscal 1976, perhaps as little as $36  million would be available, which is far  below what many of these areas expected  to receive when  the program was de vised. Many communities  in my State  have applications for funding under this  program. In some cases, these communi ties had previously worked on similar  applications under other programs only  to have the rules of the game changed  in the middle of their efforts. Now to pre sent them with an absence of funding  under the new program will only dis courage them and hold back needed proj ects. This, it seems to me, is not the cor",1975
318,Senate,94,-0.465,1219,19,Mr. HATHAWAY.," I  tor.  Mr. President, I support the bill for  all  the reasons raised by the Senators  from Maine, Massachusetts, New York,  and Maryland.  Mr. President, I rise in nupport of the  vote to override the President's veto of  S.  66.  I  commend  the Senator  from  Massachusetts  and the  Senator from New York (Mr. JAVITS) for  their statements in behalf of this most  important health matter and whole heartedly endorse their position as well  as the reasons for their positjon.  There is no question that l.a.ealth care  should rank among the highest of our  Nation's priorities for Federal expendi tures. The United States ranks far be hind over progressive nations  in  the  world in the amount of money expended  for health care as a percentage of gross  national product.  The President's veto is based more on  the grounds of programmatic differences  than the amount of money authorized in  the bill, although he does question that  amount. As far as the amount concerned  there is some question as to the possible  budget violation. However, any possible  errors can be corrected when we con sider the appropriation for this impor tant legislation.  I would like to point out in the Presi dent's message in support of his veto he  states that without further Federal help  we can expect to increase the number  of registered nurses by 50 percent dur ing the next 10 years and for that reason  argues that we do not need the authori zations for capitation and construction  included in this bill. This observation by  the President, while undoubtedly cor rect,  indicates  contrary  to what  the  President intended a considerable defi ciency in our nurse training program.  The need for registered nurses is at least  50 percent lower than the number work ing today to say nothing of what we will  need 10 years from now. The 50 percent  increase which the President boasts of  is only an average of 5 percent per year  for the next 10 years which would barely  meet tt'""' increase in nursing care mandated by expected increases in popula tion during  the same period of  time  based on the assumption we have an ade quate number of trained nurses  today.  Furthermore, when you  consider  the  number of health care proposals now  pending including national health insur ance, and with adoption of only the mod ified proposal of national health insur ance advocated by the President him self,  the  increased number of  trained  nurses needed will be far in excess of  those which the President seems to feel  will be sufficient.  In fine, Mr. President, it appears that  the President bases his veto of S. 66 on  inaccuracies with regard to our projected  needs and in the President's difference  in philosophy with regard to health care.  The principles of S. 66 have been en dorsed by both Houses of Congress by  substantial votes and I am hopeful that  this body will, by an overwhelming vote,  show  the President that we adhere  to  the tenants of our philosophy with re gard to health care.

319,Senate,94,-0.284,35,23,Mr. GRAVEL.," Mr. President, the flight  from democracy in India may well sound  the death knell of democratic attempts  at national economic and political de-  velopment in most of the third world. It  may well be  the bell  tolling not only  for India but for  the rest of  the poor  world. And while one out of every seven  human beings on this planet loses his  freedom, we have remained silent.  Over  the past few months,  I  have  asked myself why I and others have not  spoken out. Perhaps our collective re luotance to comment on the growing op pression in India is due to the personal  charm of the Prime Minister. Perhaps  we  find  it hard to be harsh with  the  daughter of Nehru. Perhaps we think it  will not do any good.  However,  the  loss of democracy  in  India is a matter we must all take seri ously. It is not, as some have claimed,  the final end of a colonial hangover. It  should not be proclaimed as conforming  to ""Indian realities."" It should not be  said that democracy is something India  can afford to jettison as so much excess  baggage. It should not be heralded as  the first step in the solution of India's  economic problems. For years, the Prime  Minister has  held virtual  dictatorial  powers and little if any social or eco nomic progress has beer. made.  The recent events in India are star tlingly  reminiscent of Watergate. The  fear of losing power compels the govern ment of India  to ""delay"" an election,  while in America similar fears corrupted  the electoral process. In India, the chief  accuser is quickly jailed.  ln America, a special prosecutor was  summarily fired. In India, the institution  of Prime Minister must be preserved. In  America,  the Office of  the Presidency  was not to be weakened.  It is claimed in India that the workings  of democracy have become cumbersome  and inefficient. In America,  the tenets  of democracy and justice were  treated  in the same indifferent manner. In In dia, democracy is described as a simple  pipedream, in conflict with the best in terests of the people of that nation. In  America, democracy was the victim of  similar appeals to national security.  In India, the restraint of democracy is  removed from the path of those seeking  absolute power. In America, it was this  very check on the quest for power which  saved our democracy. In India, antisocial  elements  are blamed  for government  crisis. In America, public figures on pri vate enemies' lists were similarly blamed  for domestic troubles. In India, laws are  passed to make crimes innocent acts, and  to make innocent acts crimes. In Amer ica, a President took it upon himself to  decide what  is  innocent and what  is  criminal.  Is this not evidence enough of the fu tility of basing the welfare of a nation  on acts which hold within them the de struction of the very means with which  to secure social and economic  justice?  After all  this Nation has experienced  during the tragedy we have come to call  Watergate, can we  in good conscience  sit calmly by in silence and watch a sim ilar drama unfold in a nation we all once  proudly called the largest democracy in  the world?  Our silence in the face of such a trag edy has been  justified on the basis of  ""lessons we have learned in Vietnam.""  We have been told that ""we should not  meddle in the internal affairs of other  nations."" That is very true-we should  not drop bombs on people, not obliterate  their homes and cities, nor prop-up tin hom dictators. That is very  true-we  should not  funnel  billions  of dollars  worth of arms to help ignite coups and  brush-fire wars. That is true-we should  not send in the Marines or the CIA when ever we disagree with another nation's  policies.  The policies of the past generation of arsenal diplomacy, of armed interven tion, of engineered coups and ""dirty trick"" operations, of cozy relationships  with dictators everywhere, has made us  turn inward. We have shied away from  playing a  role of moral and political  leadership in the world. We have reacted  to the point of greeting the establishment  of tryanny over one-seventh of human kind with little more than a yawn.  result,  the very organs of free  opinion in this Nation have been used by  representatives of India  to  justify the  elimination of those same institutions in  India without so much as a single reply  from our political leaders.  After the loss of thousands of lives and  the waste of billions of dollars in Viet nam, we should ask ourselves whether  this is the lesson we want to learn. Have  we learned to shrink from speaking out  in the face of blatant totalitarianism?  Have we lost the courage to speak out in  the face of such a tragedy? Is it proper,  is it consistent with the ideals of this Na tion to remain silent in the face of the  naked seizure of power and the elimina tion of the freedom of over 600 million  people? Especially in a nation we have  long called our friend?  I do not believe so. I cannot see how  the cause of freedom, or the ideals for  which we  conduct  foreign policy, are  served  by  the  silence,  the deafening  silence, of the United States. It is direct ly contradictory, not only  to our past  ideals but to our future hopes. For what  is a foreign policy if it is not the expres sion of a national conscience?  thus raise my voice, as a Senator for  the State of Alaska, as a citizen of the  United States, and as a citizen of this  world, in protest over the growing politi cal carnage in India. I  raise my voice in  answer to the self-serving statements we  have heard in recent weeks  that have  attempted  to  casually  dismiss  these  tragic events. Our silence on this issue is  a dark stain on our foreign policy, on  As a  I  our desire to see law, and not force, gov ern the affairs of the world.  I urge the Government of India to lift  the cloud of oppression that hangs over  the people of India. I urge that we all  speak out and support the survival and  renewal of freedom in India. I urge that  we do  this within the same spirit and  conscience that gave birth to this Nation.  The  tragedy  in India  is not only a  tragedy for democracy. It is also a trage dy for all of us personally. Having met  Indira Gandhi, I could not but be im pressed by her charm, her  leadership  and dignity. But her role as a genuine  leader in the affairs of humankind has  now been washed a way by the flood of  her recent actions. The flight from de mocracy in India is a tragedy for India,  for her people,  for  the people of  this  world, and for Indira Gandhi herself.  S. 865,  MAKING PUBLIC BUILDINGS  PUBLIC  ",1975
320,Senate,94,0.283,35,23,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, just prior  to the August recess, the Senate passed  the Public Buildings Coopera tive Use Act of 1975. I was pleased to be  a  cosponsor of  that legislation and  to  have supported it at the  time of pas sage with a speech on the Senate floor.  The bill is now pending before the House  Committee on Public Works and Trans portation.  Following  passage  of  the  bill,  the  Washington Post ran an editorial that  evaluated S. 865. As I believe my col leagues will find the editorial of interest,  I  ask unanimous  consent  that  it be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the editorial  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  MAKING PUBLIC BUILDINGS PUBLIC  The public  rarely ventures  into public  buildings, unless bent on unavoidable busi ness--or caught in a sudden rain. The rea son is that there is usually nothing public,  let alone inviting, about public buildings in  Washington and the towns and cities across  America. Federal buildings are the exclusive  domain of the bureaucracy and, more often  than not, massive, forbidding and dour, set  apart  from  the community  they are sup posed to serve. They die every evening around  about 5 p.m. when the government workers  go home. Their neighborhood usually dies  with  them. With rare exceptions,  they are  uncongenial neighbors.  A new bill,  just passed by  the Senate,  would change this. Introduced by Sen. James  L. Buckley (Con. R-N.Y.) and his colleagues  on the Senate Public Works Committee, the  bill is probably the most tangible result so  far of the efforts by the National Endowment  for the Arts, under Nancy Hanks, to breathe  new life into federal architecture and make  the government understand that good design  can help  improve  the  environment. The  Buckley bill is based on a readable and per suasive study of ""multiple use"" in federal  architecture, prepared by  the endowment's  ""federal design"" task force.  The bill would permit federal offices  to  share the same buildings with commercial  ventures, such as stores and restaurants and  would encourage  the General Services Ad ministration  to acquire and ""recycle"" old  buildings  for government purposes.

322,House,94,-0.599,113,23,Mr. BADILLO.," Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4222  is one of the most important pieces of  children's legislation ever to come before  this body. At a  time when the economy  is suffering so badly, it could be easy to  acquiesce to the demands of the admin istration for spending cutbacks because  it is ""only"" children who are involved.  After all,  they are not voters. But our  children are our constituents too, and if  we fail to respond to their needs now,  we are jeopardizing our country's future  as well as theirs. In fact, it is because  of the state of the economy that we must  move forward with this program to nour ish our young.  This bill contains far-reaching, inno vative  and  thoughtful  provisions  for  every segment of our young society. It  will provide, during this time of high un employment,  lunches  for  the children  of those out of work. It will extend food  programs  to  institutions-to hospitals,  to centers for abused children,  to  the  retarded, even to juvenile detention cen ters, and homes for the physically and  emotionally  handicapped.  We  have  learned over  the years how  important  the relationship is between a nourishing  breakfast and educational performance.  By extending the school breakfast pro gram to new areas of needy children, we  are providing a base for developing a new  level of response to learning among the  young.  The  summer  feeding  program will  finally put an end to the struggle to find  existing programs through which to feed  the young when school is not in session.  In my own district, when OEO funding  was cut back, it was extremely difficult  to find activity programs that would take  children just for meals. Now, programs  can be initiated solely for that purpose.  And, for the first time, nonprofit camps  that take needy children, like those i:n  ",1975

During the Au gust recess a response from the Federal  Energy Administration was received in  my office. I ask that this be printed at  this point in the RECORD so that my col leagues and other interested people may  have  the opportunity  to  read  the re sponse.  The letter follows:  FEDERAL ENERGY ADMINISTRATION,  Washington, D.C., August 15, 1975.  Hon. CLAIR W. BURGENER,  House of Representatives,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR MR. BURGENER: Thank you for your  letter of April  14  regard.lng  the  ""Nuclear  Safeguards  Initiative"" presently being cir culated in California. I do apologize for the  delay in replying.  With regard to the first two questions in  your letter, the Federal Energy Administra tion (FEA) does not have statutory author ity, or  any  regulations which have been  promulgated pursuant to statutory author ity, which would be directly affected by the  ""Nuclear Safeguards Initiative."" Th1s initia tive would, however, have very serious impli cations on the Nation's abtlity to achieve its  basic goals of energy  independence in the  next decade. This  is  the  subject of your  third question.  Although  the  language of  the  initiative  clearly avoids use of the term ""moratorium,""  it  is clear  that  the end  result would be  just that. The conditions that must be met  through Federal and State actions are virtu ally impossible to attain, and would conse quently  lead  to a halt  in construction of  new nuclear plants, as well as the phasing  out of existing plants. The impact of such an  action on Callforn.la would be great.  Currently, utilities  in the State of Cali fornia have approximately 12,000 MWe of  nuclear capacity either operating, under con struction, or in the licensing stage. Should  circumstances dictate that this capacity be  replaced  by  oil-fired generating units,  it  would mean an additional consumption of  121 million  barrels of oil  annually. The  economic consequences to the State of CaU fornia  in meeting  its growing demand for  electricity would be substantial in terms of  lost jobs, income, and the cost of electricity  to its citizens.  I  recently delivered a speech to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco entitled  ""Nuclear Power-A Time for Decision."" The  speech portrays very clearly the position of  FEA on the substantive aspects of the ""Nu clear Safeguards Initiative."" I have enclosed  a copy for your convenience.  Thank you for writing.

I want to congratulate them  on this special occasion.  This year, because of their awareness  of and involvement in community affairs,  they have decided  to select and honor  an individual who has contributed great ly to the community. They have chosen  a  truly outstanding gentleman for their  Man of the Year Award. I applaud their  choice and I want to join them in rec ognizing and commending the mayor of  my home community of South Holland,  Mayor Harold J. Gouwens. This gentle man has given unselfishly of his time  and efforts throughout the area for many  years.  Mayor Gouwens has been a  lifelong  resident of South Holland. He and his  lovely wife, Vera, have one daughter,  Susan, and she and her husband, Mr. Ed  DeVries, also  reside  in South Holland  with their three daughters.  A graduate  of Thornton Township  High School, Mayor Gouwens received  his bachelor and masters degree from  Northwestern University. He earned a  degree from the University of Wisconsin  Central Banking School and graduated  from the Northwestern School of Finan cial Public Relations.  His career as a banker began in 1939  as an associate cashier at the First Trust  & Savings Bank of Riverdale. After his  move to the First National Bank in Dol ton he became first a director and then  the president in 1964, a position he still  holds.  To say that the mayor is active in com munity affairs is surely an understate ment. In addition to serving as mayor of  South Holland for the past 20 years, he  is also chairman of the board of direc tors for the Ingalls Memorial Hospital  in Harvey,  ill. He  is president of the  South Holland Lions Club and vice presi dent of the Municipal League Board. In  the past he has served as chairman of  Harvey Memorial Hospital, as a member  of the Thornton Township High School  Board,  the Thornton Township Junior  College Board, and as president of Cook  County Banker's Federation.  The Knights of Columbus especially  recall Mayor Gouwens' untiring efforts  and support for their tootise roll drive  for mentally retarded children.

325,,94,-0.506,217,23,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr. Speak er, I wish to bring to the attention of my  colleagues a recent article from Science  magazine about the science fellows pro grams which have developed in recent  years. A  few weeks ago my friend and  colleague, Mr. MIKE McCORMACK,  in serted into the RECORD a  sketch of the  fellows who have devoted their time and  expertise to Government. He quite right ly praised their personal contributions,  and the programs which bring these val uable additions of brainpower to Capitol  Hill.  We should all be grateful for this in ftux of intelligent, highly motivated and  highly energetic talent. I am especially  grateful for  the input that I have re ceived  from  those  fellows who have  chosen to work for the Office of Tech nology Assessment,  the Committee on  Science and Technology and my own  personal office.  The following article describes some of  the background of the fellows programs,  and gives some information about par ticular fellows. Among those mentioned  in this article is Dr. Renee G. Naves, who  will be the first American Chemical So ciety fellow, and who will also be join ing the staff of the House Subcommittee  on Environment and  the Atmosphere,  which I chair.  I  would  recommend  the  following  article to every Member of Congress, be cause whether you directly interact with  fellows, or not, you will be seeing the re sults of their work during your delibera tions in the Congress. The article from  the September 12 issue of Science fol lows:  SCIENCE FELLOWS IN WASHINGTON: FROM LAB  WORK TO LEGISLATION  During the past couple of years, about 30  scientists and engineers have been lured out  o:f classrooms, offices, and  laboratories and  into Washington, D.C., to work behind the  scenes of the national political stage. They  are the beneficiaries of variously sponsored  fellowship programs that appear to be help ing scientists and Washington discover a new  relationship with each other. A few of the  fellows have recently earned their doctorates;  most have well-established careers and have  seized on the program as a means to expand  their professional horizons.  The scientist as guru-who  is called on  sporadically to render ""definitive"" judgments  on technically related national policy mat ters--is a familiar figure. The new programs  cast scientists not as advisers, but as work ers in the political hive.  The decision of various scientific societies  to sponsor scientists in Congress was by no  means sudden. They have been pondering for  years,  in  their various science-and-society  committees, ""how to expand the science and  engineering presence in Washington,"" as one  official put it. The collapse of the presidential  science advisory structure intensified  the8e  ponderings, as did, even more so, the incre~­ ingly distressing state of federal funding of  research. But it may be more accurate to say  that the move toward scientists working on  the Hill  is part of nationwide trends-the  growing need felt by ""consumers""  (in this  sense, everyone affected by actions of the fed eral government)  to know what is going on  why, and how to take a hand in decisions;  as well as the trend toward interdisciplinar ity and the recognition that no discipline is  an island unto itself.  There are two distinctly different opera tions afoot. One is a collection of 1-year con gressional science fellowship programs spon sored by various societies, most of which are  being  coordinated  and monitored by  the  AAAS. (This group does not include the pro gram  of  congressional  health  fellowships  sponsored by the Institute of Medicine and  funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Founda tion.)  The other involves fellowships awarded by  the National Academy of Sciences  (NAS)  that enable academic scientists to work on  in-house projects of the National Academy  of Sciences-National Research Council or the  Institute of Medicine.  The former casts scientists where few have  set foot before-in the machinery of Con gress. In fact, the program has at least dou bled  the number of  technical people em ployed  there. The NAS  program  enables  scientists to grapple with science policy with in the more academic milieu.  While the programs appear to have been  successful from  the standpoints of the fel lows,  their employers, and  their sponsors,  both endeavors are suffering from financial  frustrations. This is particularly true of the  NAS program, which got a  from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, to be  used  in diminishing amounts over 3 years  and supplemented increasingly by academy  funds. Six  fellows were  supported by  the  grant the first year and three in the year just  ended. But because of the academy's inability  to attract money from other sources (several  foundations have been  approached  to no  avail), the program is now in limbo, and it  is possible that only one fellow will be invited  to fulfill the third year of the Sloan contract.  For the congressional science fellowships,  money is not such a problem, because the  societies themselves are willing to foot most  of the bill. The Ford, Rockefeller, and Sloan  foundations have kicked in to support the  AAAS fellows  (all receive stipends of up to  a  year), but program coordinator  Richard Scribner says that what is needed is  a foundation willing to furnish steady sup port over a period of several years. Such a  commitment is not yet forthcoming, which  is one  reason why  the 1975-1976 program  (running  from September  to August)  is  sponsoring 12  instead of  the hoped-for 15  $250,000 grant  $15,000  ",1975

Mr. Speaker, House Resolution  723  provides for an open rule with 1 hour of  general  debate on H.R.  5397,  a  bill  amending ti tie 5, United States Code, to  authorize the retirement of U.S. Govern ment employees after 30 years of service.  The purpose of H.R. 5397  is  to au thorize  the voluntary  retirement of a  Federal employee under the civil service  retirement provisions after completing  30 years of service, without regard to age.  However, H.R. 5397 provides  that  the  annuity of an employee who  is under  age 55 at the time of retirement will be  reduced by 2 percent for each full year  he is under age 55.  Under present law Federal employees  may retire at age 55 with 30 years of  service, at age 60 with 20 years of serv ice, or at age 62 with 5 years of service.  It is estimated that the enactment of  H.R. 5397 would increase the unfunded  J.iability of the civil service retirement  fund by $3.4 billion which would be  amortized by 30 equal annual payments  of $209.6 million.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of  House Resolution 723  in order that we  may discuss and debate H.R. 5397.  ",1975

328,,94,0.162,373,23,Mr. JOHNSON of Colorado.," Mr.  Speaker,  the question of grain sales to  the Soviets continues to draw the com ments of Members of Congress, voicing  the  producer  and  consumer-oriented  .concerns of their constituents.  I would direct my colleagues' atten tion to an opinion that appeared in the  Sterling Journal-Advocate on Thursday,  August 28, 1975. Mr. Glenn E. Bunnell  articulates  a  position  that should be  heard without the emotion and rhetoric  that often accompanies this discussion.  The article follows:  THE WHEAT GROWERS' SIDE OF THE STORY  (By Glenn E. Bunnell)  The sale of wheat to Russia. has stirred up  a tempest of opinion both pro and con. The  biggest argument against the sale 1s that it  will increase the cost of bread to consumers  and further inflate the cost o! food.  People from eastern states which are con sumers rather than producers o! wheat and  the labor unions are the loudest voices pro testing the sale.  The !ear that the sale of wheat to Russia,  or any foreign power, wlli increase the price  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  of bread and other products produced from  wheat is groundless. I! the exporters sell the  grain abroad at the same price they charge  local millers and similar volume buyers, it is  a sale that gives the wheat grower the mar ket he needs to sell his crop profitably. It is  estimated that less than 20 per cent o! a nor mal American wheat crop is consumed in the  United States.  Actually the farmers share of the price of a  loaf of bread is very small. The addition of  one or two dollars to the wheat price would  actually, in iteelf, add very little to the bread  price. According to a local baker the amount  o! flour in a pound loaf of bread is about 10  ounces. This will vary slightly from bakery  to bakery. Checking his costs he estimated  that the cost for the total ingredients in a  pound loaf of bread is less than ten cents.  The rest goes for rent, gas, electricity, packag ing materials, labor and his profit.  Now let us look at labor's position on the  wheat sale and the elements of inflation that  increase the price of bread. Labor's share of  the price of a  loaf of bread  is probably greater than that of the wheat farmer. The  price  increase spiral  in the price of steel,  automobiles, transpotration, etc. most often  starts with labor demand for increased wages  and  fringe  benefits. These  increases  are  passed along to all of the various steps in  the price of bread, not to mention the in creases to the farmer for equipment, fuel,  taxes and labor.  Since the domestic consumption o! wheat  is far less than the annual production, even  on poor crop years, the farmer needS the for eign market to dispose of the surplus and get  a profitable price for his crop. The wheat  farmer must sell his crop on the basis of  supply and demand, and if the demand is re duced by stopping foreign sales, the farmer  has to take less for his crop without reducing  his cost of production.  Another factor to consider in the foreign  sale of wheat, whether to Russia or some  other country, is the advantage gained in our  balance of trade. In spite of America's stand ing as an industrial and food producing na tion, imports often exceed exports in value.  This puts a drain on our cash reserves and  credit that puts us at a disadvantage in the  world's markets.  Because the voices of labor unions in the  industrial  east  are  far  louder and  exert  greater political pressure, and if the farmer  cannot make his voice heard and under stood; he is apt to get the ""shaft"" to use a  slang expression.  When you examine the facts it is NOT hard  to see that the sale of wheat to Russia, or any  other country, will have very little impact on  the average American's food budget, but it  will greatly enhance the economy of Colorado  and neighboring wheat producing states.

331,House,94,-0.479,399,23,Mr. MINETA.," Madam Chairman, I rise  in support of H.R. 6227, which, to state  it simply, would afford Federal employees  the same protection, no more nor no less,  than that provided private sector em ployees under the National Labor Act as  interpreted in the recent Supreme Court  decision of NLRB against Weingarten.  This protection would be twofold:  First, the bill would require that an  employee of an executive agency who is  under  investigation  for  misconduct  which could lead to suspension, removal,  or reduction in rank or pay be advised  in writing of the investigation and his  or her right  to  representation during  questioning regarding such misconduct.  Second, H.R. 6227 would provide an  appeals process for employees suspended,  removed,  or  reduced  in  rank or pay  where  the right  to representation was  violated, and would prohibit the admis sibility  in any subsequent disciplinary  action of any statement or evidence ob tained during questioning in the event  that an employee was not informed of  their right to representation.  The most often-heard charge against  H.R. 6227 is that it would have a nega tive effect on routine day-to-day rela tions between supervisors and employees.  This charge, I believe,  is neither valid  nor based on the actual provisions of this  bill, for section 7171 (a)  specifically ap plies the right to representation to Fed eral employees under  investigation for  misconduct which could lead to suspen sion,  removal, or reduotion in rank or  pay--or simply, when  the questioning  pertains to serious misconduct, not the  daily responsibilities or activities of the  employee.  In short, the bill would provide Fed eral employees with the same rights as  employees  in  the private  sector-the  same rights afforded to other Americans,  not employed by  the Federal Govern ment, under the due process clause of  the Constitution.  Your concurrence in the extension of  this basic constitutional right to Federal  employees is mandatory.  Thank you, Madam Chairman.  ",1975

This fine institution, located in my dis trict, will officially celebrate its 50th an niversary on Saturday, September 27.  An article by Peter Almond  in  the  Cleveland Press on September 8, 1975,  portrays the role played by Parmadale  in Greater Cleveland. The article reads  as follows:  PARMADALE To MARK  ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY  (By Peter Almond)  Fifty years ago, State Road in Parma, an  area of gentle, wooded hills in the country side, became home to a group of orphan boys.  It was a unique experiment, the first cot tage-plan institution in the world.  This week the Insti tuion, Pa.rmadale Chil dren's Vlllage of St. Vincent DePaul, is pre paring to celebrate its 50th anniversary by  trying to tell the world how it has progressed  since those early days.  When  it was opened by  the Cleveland  Catholic Diocese and St. Vincent De Paul  Society on Sept. 27, 1925, Parmadale con sisted of a school, church, 14 cottages, gym nasium, parish house and laundry on 360  acres of land.  Basically nothing has changed.  But now there are 17 cottages, a hospital,  dental clinic, variety of recreational equip ment, facilities  for students with  learning  disabilities, and a budget of $1,200,000 a year.  The land area has been cut down to 178  acres, but other changes have opened  the  facility  to girls-100 of the 250 youngsters  there are girls-and the village has become  home to ""problem"" children as well as those  who have no families.  Parmadale  takes children from  the ages  of three  to 18 or 21. Most are referred  to  Cuyahoga County social workers or Juvenile  Court authorities, but others come from sur rounding counties.  According  to  Parmadale  administrator  Father John Leahy,  there  is now only one  child there who could truly be described as  an orphan.  ""The  average  age  of our youngsters  is  13 Y:z ,'' said Fr. Leahy. ""Ten years ago, it was  seven. It seems the early teens are becom ing increasingly difficult for more children.""  For much of the year, the children who  would  normally  be  at public or  private  schools in grades one through eight attend  the non-graded school on the grounds. Fr.  Leahy said they get individualized instruc tion and cl!l.ss  size averages 13 pupils.  The high school students go out to nine  high schools in the county, both public and  parochial.  The average length of stay at Parma.dale is  three years, during which time they live in  the cott!l.ges with youngsters their own age  and sex.  These children, including those from the  newly-merged St. Anthony's Home for Boys,  are cared for by house parents and a staff  of 130 who work to give each child the con centrated attention he or she needs.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Funding comes from a variety of sources,  including the United Torch Fund and cath olic Charities.  The 50th anniversary celebration starts  this Saturday with an ""all-American picnic""  sponsored by the Knights of Oolumbus. It  continues with various events until an an niversary Mass and dinner Saturday, Sept.  27, concelebra.ted by Bishop Jrunes Hickey,  Bishop Raymond Gallagher  of Lafayette,  Ind., and diocesan priests.  A public open house will be held from 2  to 5 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 21. Parma.dale is at  6753 State Rd.  FOUL  HON. ALLAN T. HOWE  OF UTAH  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 23, 1975  Mr. H;OWE. Mr. Speaker, I note that  our distinguished majority  leader,  the  Honorable TIP O'NEILL,  recently cried  ""foul"" at President Ford's attempt  to  pluck at the emotions of the people by  calling the Congress ""chicken.""  I, too, would like to object to this at tempt by the President to duck his own  responsibility by trying to make it appear  that the Members of Congress have egg  on their faces. I  think the Members of  this distinguished body have a  lot  to  crow about.  The President, evidentally, would like  the Congress  to  take under  its wing,  every scheme he hatches and make  it  work. But this Congress, fortunately, has  not been content to follow the President's  rather scrambled approach  to  solving  this Nation's problems. Not that we are  hardboiled about  it--when  the Presi dent has proposed good programs this  Congress has not been reluctant to pro nounce them ""grade A"" and pass them.  But, frankly, very often when the Presi dent proposes a program, he simply lays  an egg. If this Congress had passed some  of  the President's programs that were  obviously doomed  to failure, we would  now be in the position of having to recoup  our losses.  But this Congress has worked and is  working  hard  at  good  solutions  to  America's problems-we have taken up  the yoke and we are rolling along toward  responsible programs.  Some  people may  charge  that  the  progress of Congress toward solutions to  such  problems  as  the  economy  and  energy is so slow, that the Congress is  working by the hunt and peck method.  But, if it is true that we are pecking away  at problems and that we sometimes seem  to be scratching around for ideas, it is  equally true that this Congress is taking  such a  slow and deliberate course of  action in order to make sure that in cur ing our Nation's ills, we do not kill the  goose  that lays  the golden egg by at tempting to gain too much too soon. Of  course, we cannot brood over problems  forever, and I do not think this Congress  has.  The President's charges against Con29905  gress are, in my opinion, simply a polit ically motivated attempt to feather his  own nest.

337,,94,0.347,711,23,Mr. MARTIN.," Mr. Speaker,  the at tempted assassination of President Ford  yesterday is alarming and cause for con cern. It is also alarming and cause for  concern that Members of Congress are  using this as a springboard to call for  a  congressional  investigation  of  the  Secret Service.  While it is proper for any citizen to  raise questions about the effectiveness of  the procedures used to protect the Presi dent, a question must also be raised as to  what good it would do to intrude con gressional  expertise  into  those proce dures. The Secret Service does not need  exposure of  its operations by congres sional committees. All that would achieve  would be: First, headlines for Congress.  and second, blueprints for potential as sassins.  These recent events spotlight the es sential problem  that protective proce dures can never be  foolproof. To ap proach  that  standard would  require  wholesale violation of the rights of law abiding citizens. These events focus on  two potential assassins who got through  the protective net, burt ignore the hun dreds who were kept from the vicinity.  Even so, the Secret Service is itself more  acutely aware of any procedural short comings than anyone else. They do not  need  to be told publicly how to revise  their procedures.  Certainly, the President, if he has res ervations about the level of protection he  gets, can deal with those arrangements  directly. He should not have to disclose  how he does it. If he needs congressional  help, be knows he can get it on request.  For example, while I do not expect the  President to isolate himself from the peo ple, I do expect unannounced changes in  his modus operandi that will decrease  risks as they are perceived. It would de stroy  the protective purposes of  those  changes if the curiosity of Members of  Congress or reporters insisted on know ing the details.  Do we  really need  to know or com ment knowingly on the type of protective  clothing he wears or does not wear? Do  we really need to advertise the vulnerable  points in his schedule? Do we really need  to publicize the kinds of personality traits  that attract the attention of the Secret  Service investigations of potential assas sins?  Let us simply be thankful that Presi dent Ford has been spared. Let us leave  to his office and the Secret Service the  ",1975

339,House,94,0.26,880,23,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for allotting me this time.  I appreciate the efforts of those Mem bers who have spoken on the issue in  favor of not agreeing to recede and con cur. Let us take a look now at the lan guage that they have agreed to.  I want to make it perfectly clear that  I do not have  too much disagreement  with those folks who say this is not a  very good vehicle to put this on, and I do  not have much disagreement with those  who say that we probably ought not ap proach it in this way. But the difficulty  is that this is the only way we are going  to be able to approach it.  The  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  and some of the rest of us have had  resolutions  lying in the Committee on  Foreign Affairs for years, and we cannot  get hearings, we cannot get them re ported. What the Congress, or the House  thank  of Representatives at least, thinks about  this  issue was reflected in the vote of  June 26, 1975, when it carried right sub stantially.  The truth of the matter is that if we  could get this issue out here in the right  way, we would probably get a bigger vote  than that. But we have to take it any  way we can get it. We had to word the  amendment so that it would be germane,  and that is the route we had to go.  What is wrong with this sense of the  Congress  resolution that the conferees  have agreed to? I will tell the Members.  First, it gives congressional approval  to a new treaty. It gives congressional  approval to giving away the land, that is,  giving away the zone. Let there be no  doubt about that. It says thaJt it is the  sense of Congress that any new Panama  Canal treaty or agreement-it pre~up­ poses one-must protect the vital inter ests of the United States.  Mr. Speaker, I think the question was  quite apropos a moment ago when one  Member said: Might not the State De partment think it is in the best interests  of the United States to give it away? We  know  the State Department has  that  attitude, because on September 9 they  had a briefing down at the State Depart ment.  They briefed on the status of negotia tions. What they said was not too far  away  from what  the gentleman from  Pennsylvania told you that Torrijos had  released,  the dictator  in  the  republic  down there.  Yes, they said they were going to give  the zone away in a couple of years, not  the canal, but the 10-,mile strip of land  down  there. We are going to keep the  canal, that is, the waterway, for 25 years,  maybe just 20. Perhaps we are going to  try to keep a military operation for 40 or  50 years.  Yes;  they said that the United States  shall possess  certain operating  ri-ghts  during the treaty's lifetime-the lifetime  of the treatty, 20 or 25 years.  Wh~t happens after that? They turn  it over to Panama. They say, ""Panama  is going to give us the right to use it.''  How do we know  that? Since 1903  Panama has had 59 presidents, while we  have had 13. Only four presidents have  finished their 4-year constitutional term  of office.  There is no st~bility down there. When  we give  the zone away, we are giving  away the waterway through which traffic  passes, 75 percent of which either origi nates or terminates in the United States.  This is vital to .the commerce and vital,  I might say, to the defense of this coun try.  This was verified just recently by Gen eral McAuliffe,  the new commander of  our southern command  there. He said  that it is just as important to the United  states, from the military point of view,  as it was in World War II.  What else  is  there about  this  lan guage? Yes,  it says  that we shall not  give away the vital interests, but the vital  interests, according to the people of the  State Department who do these things  about which  I have  talked here, are  something else.  rt also 5ays  the ""Panama Canal."" It  to  does not say ""zone"" because they know  they have agreed  to give  the zone  them.  Mr. Speaker, I will tell ~the Members  this: They can say, through their vote.  that they will not give away the Panama  Canal. However,  it is nothing else but  that. Down home,  they'd say I'm just  putting the fodder where the cows can  get to it. I'm telling it like it is.  Our man down there-I will get his  name here out of  the paper-John D.  Black, of the U.S. Embassy in Balboa ..  was down  there making a  speech. He  said:  Nothing in the 1903 treaty or its amend ment indicates that Panama ever ceded the  Oanal Zone to the United States.  He had not read Wilson against Swann.  I am sorry I do not have more time as I  am not finished but my time is up.  The SPEAKER. The time of the gen tleman from Kentucky <Mr. SNYDER) has  expired.  ",1975

That is to send  this back to committee on this particular  point.  I  think all of us recognize what the  situation is in the Panama Canal Zone.

343,House,94,-0.028,919,23,Mr. GUDE.," Mr. Speaker, when I voted  for the Federal Environmental Pesticide  Control Act in 1972 I  relied, as we all  frequently must, on  the recommenda tions of my colleagues on the committee  proposing the bill as contained in their  report. Together with my recreational  reading-which told of emerging scien tific evidence of negative side effects from  the postwar miracle chemicals-that re port persuaded me  that  the Nation  should impose a new, more cautious legal  framework on the use of these chemicals.  After all,  these poisons are the only  toxic pollutants  intentionally and reg ularly sprayed and dusted on millions of  acres of farmland, applied directly  to  waterways and used in our homes and  gardens. The benefits are substantial, ob vious  and  immediate-reduced  crop  losses, control of insect-borne disease, in expensive weed control and land clear ing, protection of nursery stock, eradica tion of  rodents, disinfection of sterile  areas. We know  that  these materials  kill living things and demand that they  be effective for their intended purpose.  Less obvious and frequently far from  immediate are the costs of using a bil lion pounds of killing-chemicals each  year. But the Agriculture Committee in  its report did draw our attention to these  costs and a need to balance them against  the beneficial features of these chemicals.  Their bill seemed to place  the greater  burden in this balancing process on a  finding that a particular chemical posed  an unreasonable  risk  to man and  the  ecosystem which supports man as  its  most developed species.  In order not to assure that some very  dangerous but effective and inexpensive  to  to  to  pesticides would have to be banned be cause of such a  risk, the bill included a  feature which  looked  to me as though  it would add another weight to the side  of  the balance  that measures benefits  of pesticides. The Government would  only allow persons of demonstrated skill  and competence to use high-risk pesti cides. This would require two very ambi tious undertakings. A Government de cision on whether each and every pesti cide product was a high-risk formula tion, and a  concurrent State program  for farmers to upgrade their knowledge  about poisons and demonstrate it so as  to be  licensed  to use  these high-risk  chemicals.  By most predictions, the former was  to be a herculean task-examining new  data on more than 30,000 products made  subject  regulation by  the bill. The  latter would be almost revolutionary explaining  long-standing  users  of  pesticides that they would no longer be  able  to buy  some products  they had  traditionally used without first proving  their ability. Too many accidental or  unthinking abuses to  the environment,  documented by fish kills and bird deaths,  the poisoning of  .:>arnyard animals or  occasional  field  wor:ker  injuries  and  fatalities, had demonstrated that a small  minority of users should be responsible  for ending laissez-faire in the applica tion of poisons. The bill we passed  in  1972 provided 4 years to allow for an  evolutionary rather than a  revolution ary change. Besides, we were given  to  understand  it would probably  require  that entire period for  the  responsible  agency  to evaluate and classify  those  30,000 formulations.  According to my calendar that task is  not supposed to be completed for more  than a year, but some Members are ap parently prejudging the outcome of the  scientific  evidence  being  reviewed  classify pesticides into the low risk/high  risk categories. By my calendar farmers  don't need to be certified to use ""restrict ed"" pesticides for well over a year. Mem bers-even some from the score or so of  States with completed plans for certify ing  the users of pesticides-are ques tioning the need to upgrade the abilities  of private pesticide applicators, some ad to use high risk  vocate  that licensing  poisons be dependent only on prior ex perience by the applicant whether that  experience be good, bad, or indifferent.  Some Members have advocated selec tively  overturning  the  laborious  and  scientifically based determinations  the  law requires of the responsible agency in  suspending  cer.tain  pesticides.  They  would ask Members to assume responsi bility  for  authorizing  specific  poisons  against specific pests on the recommen dation of a  legislative committee's brief  deliberation. This is imposing a grave re sponsibility which I, for one, am most  reluctant to assume. In deciding to re move these chemicals the weight of evi dence between costs and benefits is de~  termined by exhaustive administrative  procedure. Many months of expert testi mony are presented, rebutted and rebutted in tum, by witnesses and counsel  for all parties concerned.  I sympathize with my colleagues' de",1975

345,House,94,-0.384,1010,23,Mr. DENT.," Mr. Chairman, I want the  Members to take a look at this list after ward. They will see check marks after  the countries that are exporting to the  United States ferrochrome, and they do  not have a pound of this ore to make  ferrochrome. Where does it come from?  It comes from Rhodesia.  So we are told that we do not need  Rhodesian chrome. We buy all of  the  Rhodesian  chrome  through  whom?  Through all of the sanctimonious mem bers of  the United Nations who point  the finger of guilt at the innocent. And  we are innocent. We have stood up for  this right and we have taken a position  as a legislative body that is in the best  interests of America,  its workers, and  its people. But these other countries have  not lifted the embargo, no, they just do  not see it. They ignore the embargo.  I am ashamed of some of the Members  who have said to me that this is only a  symbolic measure, go along with this. We  will not ask your companies to live up  to the embargo.  But, Mr. Chairman, rather I would die  than live a lie.  And we are living a lie. They are ask ing us today to join that fraudulent and  corrupt membership that have voted to  put upon themselves a burden that they  will not carry. This House has no reason  to follow this kind of position.  Yes, my district will lose, but we will  survive. We will add  the unemployed  steelworkers to the other 11 or 12 per cent who are on relief. But I would rather  not condemn one more family in my dis trict to a relief existence.  Let me say that every black worker in  my factories and in my mills have signed  this petition. They do not know anything  about highbrow politics.  I have heard  too much about ideologies and philoso phies. I would like to hear a  little bit  more about bread and butter.  At this time, I want to read into the  RECORD  the text of a  letter sent to all  of you by the gentleman from Missouri  (Mr. !cHORD) and myself early on in this  debate, as well as last week's letter from  PPG Industries, urging opposition to H.R.  1287.

346,House,94,0.308,1023,23,Mr. HAGEDORN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  oppose H.R. 1287, the bill to halt the im portation of Rhodesian chrome. It an ex ample of our continuing obsession with  interfering  in  the  internal  affairs of  other nations. Apparently,  there  are  those who learn nothing from the past;  when we attempted  to  tell  the Soviet  Union how  to handle their emigration  policies, we succeeded only in undermin ing very important trade negotiations.  We in the Congress are on the verge  of  prohibiting  imports  of Rhodesian  chrome because there are those who are  still intent on imposing our morality on  other nations. What is most perplexing  is that these advocates of  interference  intend to demonstrate  their moml in dignation with minority rule in Rhodesia  despite the clear evidence that this ac tion is not in our best interest.  I do not believe it is in our best inter est to make our country almost totally  dependent upon  the Soviet Union for  chromium. From past experience, we can  certainly expect that the Soviet Union  will take advantage of our self-imposed  dependence upon them. During the 196772 embargo agai.n.Sit Rhodesian trade, the  U.S. ferrochrome industry became more  reliant on Soviet supplies of metallurgi cal grade chromite. During the embargo,  such  supplies of Soviet metallurgical  grade chromite almost doubled in price  and during the same period the price of  ferrochrome reacted similarly.  Of course, anyone with the slightest  knowledge of chrome at all is aware of  its importance to our national defense.  Contrary to the claims of some propon ents of renewing the embargo, the U.S.  strategic stockpile of chromite and fer rochrome would not guarantee that our  defense needs would be met. Much of  the chromite now available out of the  stockpile is not economically usable and  the ferrochrome industry could not use  the  remarmng  metallurgical  gmde  chromite  in significant quantities be cause of shortrun capacity constraints.  Chrome's major use  is  in  stainless  steel for functional rather than decora tive applications. Chrome  is used in a  number of essential industrial and con sumer  applications,  such  as  nuclear  powerplants, conventional powerplants,  refineries,  chemical processing  equip ment, food processing equipment, cata lytic converters for automobile emission  control, masonry hangers, locks and se curity devices, hospital equipment, fiat ware, pots, pans, rivets, and hose clamps.  Conceivably, consumers of stainless steel  products would face higher costs.  The hypocrisy involved in the attempt  to prohibit imports of Rhodesian chrome  is most striking. We are being asked to  support this legislation because we sup posedly should not tolerate minority rule  in Rhodesia. Certainly, it would be pref erable if every nation of the world al lowed their citizens to enjoy a system of  government such as we have here. But,  how can we make an exclusive issue of  Rhodesia and at the same time ignore  the fact that the Soviet Union is ruled  by a similarly elite class-the members  of the Communist Party. In both cases,  the countries are ruled by a minority.  But, H.R. 1287  is nothing more  than  a method to punish Rhodesia for their  unappealing system of government and  then turn around and reward the Soviet  Union for their variety of equally unap pealing system of minority rule. If it is  our responsibility to impose our values  of democracy on other nations, we could  at least try to be consistent with that  policy.  ",1975

CONGRESSIONAL CONTROVERSY  OVER STUDENT AID  (Mr. YOUNG of Georgia asked and  was given permission to extend his re marks at this point in the RECORD and  to include extraneous matter.)  ",1975
351,House,94,-0.589,1049,23,Mr. YOUNG of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  how should Federal student aid be dis tributed? Should  limited financial  re sources be spread out in small amounts  to a larger number of students, or should  it be concentrated on  those who have  little or no funds of their own to use?  A stated policy of the Federal Govern ment is to assure equal educational op portunity to all students even if they are  from the poorest of families. Should we  allow the refocusing of funds now tar geted at the most needy students away  from those students?  A bill to extend student aid legislation  introduced  by  Representative  JAMES  O'HARA, chairman of the Subcommittee  on Postsecondary Education, would make  important changes in the way Federal  student grants and loans are awarded.  The following article which appeared  in the Capitol Hill .Forum attempts to  answer  these and other questions con cerning Mr. O'HARA 's bill.  (From the Capitol Hlll Forum, Sept. 22, 1975]  CONGRESSIONAL CONTROVERSY OVER STUDENT  Am  (By Patricia Fleming)  The Education Amendments of 1972 were  an anomaly, for  in 1972,  the retreat from  programs with a poverty focus had already  begun. The Great Society,  only partially  realized, was  a  fading  dream. The Baste  Educational Opportunity Grants  (BEOGs)  program-a student aid program in which  grants are awarded solely on the basis of  need-was a proposal that originated in a  paper by Alice Rivlin in 1968 when she was  assistant  secretary at  the Department of  Health, Education, and Welfare. A  slmllar  idea was mentioned by President Nixon  in  his 1970 education message, but the actual  basic grants legislation was drafted and in troduced  in 1971  by Sen. Claiborne Pell,  Chairman of the Senate Education subcom mittee. This program was the heart of the  new congressional thrust toward equal edu cational opportunity at the post-secondary  level. It was adopted by the 92nd Congress.  The Education amendments, authorizing  Basic Grants, Supplemental Educational Op portunity Grants, State Students Incentive  Grants, College Work-Study, and the student  loan programs, expires on June 31, 1976, the  end of this fiscal year. There is about a year  left in which the Congress can make any  changes in the programs it desires, and au thorize them for several more years.  In the House of Representatives, Congress man James O'Hara (D-Mich.) now chairs the  subcommittee on Postsecondary Education,  formerly headed by Edith Green. Rep. O'Hara  has introduced a bill, H.R. 3471, that reau thorizes  student aid  programs,  extending  them  through fiscal year 1980, with some  significant and controversial alterations.  The O'Hara bill, when introduced, caused  an  immediate  negative  reaction  among  groups and individuals concerned with the  struggle for equal access for minority and  low-income students. What appeared in the  form of legislation was a new direction for  the  student  aid programs-turning  away  from  the goal of equal educational oppor tunity, at least as it was defined by groups  with low-income or minority constituencies.  Congressman O'Hara's conception of equal  educational opportunity  is education ""for  the masses."" To him, equal educational op portunity means universal access to educa tion for any person, at any  level, at any  time of life. Ideally, he says, education should  be a life-long undertaking, meaning an indi vidual should be able  to move in and out  of the education process whenever necessary  or desirable, ""for any reason, at any age.""  Education, he asys, should be free. No charge.  He asked a black witness at the student aid  hearings which of  the following two alter natives he would select if be had the choice:  to  increase  total  college  enrollment with  proportions of minority and white students  remaining  the same as  they are now, but  having a larger number of blacks, as well a.s  whites, in higher education; or to increase  the proportion of minority students to reach  a larger number as well as a larger percent age of non-white students.  The witness chose the second alternative James O'Hara chose  the first. This points  out the major difference  in definitions of  equal educational opportunity. Rep. O'Hara  does not think in terms of race and the ef fects of generations of discrimination on a  person trying to enter college. Evidence for  this can be found in Section 498 of his bill.  Section 498  is the nondiscrimination provi sion. It bars discrimination on the basis of  race,  color, national origin, sex,  and age.  However, it also prohibits preferential treat ment. It says, in effect, that no person shall  be admitted to participation in, or provided  the benefits of, programs under this title on  the basis of race, sex, and so forth.  A report of the Carnegie Council on Policy  Studies in Higher Education advocated fo cusing federal student aid on students from  the lowest income groups. Rep. O'Hara says  this  ignores  the needs of  the middle and  lower-middle class family. A  student with  ""exceptional need"" can now get a full basic  grant of $1400 plus a supplemental grant,  bringing his grant up to $2900 to attend a  prestigious private institution. He asks why  ",1975

In the years that I have known Bob  John, I have found him to be an ex tremely fair and conscientious newsman.  Possibly the finest thing I can say about  his professionalism  is  that although  I  consider him my personal friend, his re porting of me and my activities has al ways been objective and  informative.  That to me is one mark of a  first-rate  journalist.  I should also add that Bob has been  active in many community affairs and  civic interest activities. Most notable of  these has been his great accomplish ments in directing the Route 219 Associ ation as a member and currently as pres ident of the group. Joining with citizen  groups from New York and West Vir ginia, this group is working hard to im prove the central part of Pennsylvania  and bring new economic prosperity  to  the area.  While it is an oft-repeated quote,  would like to repeat Thomas Jefferson's  view of the press:  The basis of our government being  the  opinion of the people, the very first object  should be to keep that right; and were it  left to me to (leclde whether we should have  a. government without newspapers, or news papers without a government, I  should not  hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.  I would add that our newspapers are as  good as our journalists. In the case of  Johnstown, this means our citizens have  I  30378  benefited greatly from the work of Bob  John.

357,House,94,-0.19,181,28,Mr. AMBRO.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  a great sense of sadness and anger that I  rise today to express my shock, indigna tion, and also my regret that the United  Nations General Assembly voted yester day to equate and condemn Zionism as a  form of racism. In passing this resolu tion, the United Nations has engaged in  another hypocritical act which not only  puts  that organization on record as a  supporter and instigator of anti-Semi tism on a  grand,  international  scale,  but also tragically destroys the principals  of  its Charter-the upholding of  the  ideals of human rights and the peaceful  resolution of international disputes.  In a way, the passage of this particu lar resolution on this particular evening  is fraught with irony. It was that night November 10-37 years ago-in 1938that  Hitler's  Nazi  storm  troopers  launched a  coordinated attack on  the  Jewish community in Germany, burned  the synagogues in all its cities, destroyed  Jewish holy books and attacked Jewish  homes. In addition, it leaves an especially  bitter taste to think that the interna tional organization that was born out of  the  struggle  against  the  horrors  of  Nazism and its anti-Semitic philosophy  should now become the crucible for anti Semitism and anti-Jewish hatred. That  is what makes this situation doubly sad.  I am at a loss to surpass the stunning  eloquence of our Ambassador  to  the  United Nations, Daniel P. Moynihan, in  expressing my anger and disappointment  at the passage of this resolution, so  I  shall just take the liberty of quoting from  his statement and echo his sentiment  that ""a great evil has been loosed upon  the world. The abomination of antisemi tism has been given the appearance of  international  sanction-and  the  vote  granted symbolic amnesty, and more, to  the murderers of 6 million European  Jews"" during World War II. I can only  express pride and enthusiastic agree ment with  his  declaration  that  the  United States ""does not acknowledge,  will not abide by, never will acquiesce in  this infamous act.""  Mr. Speaker, for all the fancy rhetoric  on the part of the proponents of this res olution, it must be emphasized that anti Zionism is merely a euphemism for anti Semitism, that adherence to a resolution  condemning Zionism means adherence to  anti-Semitism, and the legitimization of  aggression  against  Israel,  the  great  achievement of Zionism. Another of the  great ironies emerging from this situa tion is  that the State of Israel, in its  brief, 27-year history has amply demon strated that it is a society of humani tarian ideals, social justice, and tolerance  for all peoples. Infiamatory Arab invec tive  to  the contrary, even  those Arabs  living in territory occupied since the 6day war in 1967 have been treated hu manely, and indeed many residents of  the Gaza strip have been given jobs and  are presently experiencing  the highest  standard of living that they have known  since they voluntarily became refugees  during the first Arab-Israeli War in 1948,  when they were persuaded to leave so  that  they might return as conquering  heros. Since 1967, when Israeli troops re unified Jerusalem,  this city central  to  three of the world's major religious faiths  has been treated with the respect and  reverence due its holy status. All faiths  have been allowed free access  to  their  houses of worship and their shrines and  all pilgrims have been welcomed. This is a  stark reversal of the situation existing  during the 21-year tenure of Arab juris diction  in east Jersusalem when Jews  were not only denied access to their holy  places but these places were desecrated  and otherwise violated in an ugly fash ion. This is the picture of a society that  is anything but racist!  I  can only conclude with a  deeply  moving quotation from Albert Einstein  dating back even before the Nazi holo caust:  The Source of Zionism is depeer than the  motif of Jewish suffering. Zionism is deeply  rooted in the Jewish spiritual heritage, the  existence and development of which are, for  Jews, a source and essence of their continued  survival as a community.  Mr. Speaker, I denounce this hideous  resolution and suggest that our Govern ment reexamine its relationship to those  who were its sponsor, and to the organi zation which said ""Amen.""  ",1975

360,,94,-0.61,246,28,Mr. ROYBAL.," Mr. Speaker, on No vember 14, 1975, Fletcher Bowron Square  will be dedicated  in Los Angeles. This  represents a tangible memorial from the  city to one of the great mayors in the  history of Los Angeles.  During my first term on the Los An geles City Council, I had the privilege  to serve with Mayor Fletcher Bowron.  Mr. Bowron was first elected to the office  of major in 1937 as an anticorruption  candidate. He was subsequently reelected  to three additional 4-year terms. During  his tenure in office, the city of Los An geles expanded into one of the larges~  cities in the country and initiated pro grams which were pioneers in their field.  For instance, Mayor Bowron recom mended the modernization of an obso lete building code. The new code  that  resulted from this recommendation was  viewed as a model construction guide  throughout the Nation.  Los Angeles was the first large city to  modernize  its zoning ordinance. Under  Mayor Bowron's direction, the city plan ning department prepared a master plan  for highways,  schools, parks, beaches,  and branch administrative centers. Also,  the civic center authority developed a  master plan for the civil center which,  at that time, was  the largest grouping  of public buildings in any city other than  Washington, D.C.  Under Mayor Bowron, Los Angeles ex panded its health care centers into neigh borhoods  that were medically under served. The result was a dramatic de cline in the spread of many diseases and  an increase in the general level of health  care among the people served by these  centers.  At  the same  time,  there were  far reaching changes  in  the operation of  city government. The mayor centralized  the collection of all  taxes  in  the city  clerk's office. This greatly reduced  the  unit cost of collecting the various city  taxes. Mayor Bowron helped establish  the position of city administrative offi cer. This position helped simplify de partmental  activities,  improve  work  standards and practices, and eliminate  unnecessary expenditures.  Finally, there were vast improvements  made to the facilities at the Los Angeles  Harbor and Los Angeles International  Airport. Also,  the morale and compe tence of the fire and police departments  increased under Mayor Bowron's tenure.  Following is a brief biographical sketch  of Mayor Fletcher Bowron:  ""Mayor Bowron was born at Poway, in  San Diego County, August 13, 1887. As  a boy, he helped work his father's farm  and was educated in California public  schools. His father sold his farm and  moved to Los Angeles when the young  Bowron was old enough to attend high  school, in order to afford his son better  educational opportunities.  Fletcher Bowron thereafter attended  Los Angeles High School, the University  of California at Berkeley, and the Uni versity of Southern California and var ious night law schools. In order to fi nance his legal education, he worked for  almost 5 years as a reporter on the Los  Angeles Record and  the Los Angeles  Examiner.  In 1917 he finally realized his ambi tion to p~actice law and was admitted  to the California Bar in April of that  year. His practice was, however,  inter rupted by military service in World War  I with the 144th Field Artillery, and with  general staff military intelligence.  After the war, Mr. Bowron practiced  law in Los Angeles until 1923, when he  was appointed deputy corporations com missioner. In 1925, he was selected to be  the  executive  secretary  to Governor  Richardson.  A year later, in 1926, Bowron was ap pointed a  superior court  judge in Los  Angeles County, and was reelected both  in 1928 and 1934. He was presiding judge  of the criminal department at the im panelment of the locally histori~ grar1;d  jury of 1934, which was called to myes~l­ gate charges of widespread corruption m  city government.  In 1936, Mr. Bowron was elected pre siding judge of the superior court, where  he  sponsored  procedural  reforms  de signed to expedite  justice for litigants ..  Less  than 2 years later, the League of  Civic Betterment selected him as its can didate to run against Frank Shaw, then  mayor, who was being challenged in a  recall election instituted as a result of  the grand jury investigation of civil cor ruption. Bowron was elected by a decisive  vote.  The forthrightness and honesty which  Mayor Bowron brought to the city gov ernment resulted in his reelection by sub':""  stantial majorities  in 1941, 1945,  and  1949.  Like the mayors of most large cities,  Bowron received numerous awards and  decorations from other governments. But  in the case of Mayor Bowron, they re sulted from his sincere efforts  to pro mote  trade and cultural  relations be tween Los Angeles and the various States  and people with whom Los Angeles citi zens dealt.  Among the honors given him by for eign countries are: ""the Order of Merit""  from the Government of Chile, in recog nition of the mayor's Pan American ef forts and  the helpful  interest received  by Chile at the mayor's office;  the ""Di ploma of Honor"" from the Associacion  Consular Latino-Americano; decoration  of  the  ""Mexican Order of  Eagle"" in recognition of his promotion of  understanding with  that country; and  similar awards  from France, Holland,  Norway, Italy, and Luxembourg.  Among his national activities, Mayor  Bowron served as president of the Amer ican Municipal Association and as a  trustee  for  the U.S.  Conference  Mayors. He also served as president of  the ~ague of California Cities. His perthe Aztec  of  sonal associations included the American  Legion, Delta Chi Fraternity, Masons,  Native Sons of the Golden West, and the  Jonathan and Kiwanis Clubs.

364,,94,-0.055,415,28,Mr. PEYSER.," Mr. Speaker, the recent  vote in the United Nations to condemn  Zionism as a form of racism is a hypo critical and callous political maneuver  that seriously  threatens  the continued  participation of the United States in that  organization. It is an action that in fact  seriously threatens the continued viabil ity of  the United Nations. Continued  abuse of this organization with actions  such as this will insure the termination of  the organization, and hence, the end to a  potentially valuable tool for world peace.  The action at the United Nations is hy pocrisy because those sponsoring the res olution know only too well that Zionism  is not racism. On the contrary, it is the  successfU: and heroic  struggle by  the  Jewish people to es~ablish the democrat ic State of Israel. Obviously, those spon soring this resolution have no use for the  peace functions of  the United Nations,  but instead now seek only to use it as a  tool to attack their enemies and under mine world stability.  It is essential that the nations of the  world recognize that the United States  will no longer continue to subsidize blind ly these abuses of the United Nations.  The actions which the Congress took yesterday in passing resolutions of condem nation and reassessment of the role of  the United Nations are important. They  are not idle actions by the House and  Senate. There is no doubt in my mind  that the U.S. contribution to the United  Nations will be cut back as a result of this  action. It will now be up to the mem ber states of the United Nations to take  affirmative steps to help lift the cloud  that now covers it. Certainly this is the  darkest hour that the United Nations has  had in its history, and only a timely rec ognition of this can restore the effective ness of this organization.

365,,94,-0.171,441,28,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker, Wash ington is engaged in its favorite game of  trying  to determine who did what  to  whom, who won, and who  lost in the  dramatic  personnel  changes  recently  announced by President Ford. Donald  Rumsfeld,  the White House Chief of  Staff, replaces James Schlesinger as De fense Secretary; George Bush, the head  of the U.S. Liaison Office in China, suc ceeds William Colby as the Director of  the Central Intelligence Agency; Secre tary of State Henry Kissinger yields his  second post as Assistant to the President  for National Security  to his  deputy,  Brent Scowcroft; and Elliot Richardson,  the Ambassador  to Great Britain, be comes  the Secretary of Commerce. In  addition, Vice President NELSON RocKE FELLER announced he would not be the  President's running mate in 1976.  I am inclined to believe that the cen tral decision in the shuffle of the Presi dent's national security team was  the  President's decision  to replace Defense  Secretary Schlesinger. The President's  uneasiness with Secretary Schlesinger  personally had grown  to  include dis comfort with policy differences over de fense and detente. His warnings about  the Soviet military build -up had become  so strident lately that they had upset  many officials in the Ford administra tion, including the President and Secre tary  of  State  Kissinger.  Secretary  Schlesinger's problem was more that he  could not get along with the President  than that he could not get along with  Congress. The Secretary of Defense was  held in high esteem by Members of Con gress, who  recognized him as an ar ticulate,  sophisticated,  and  tough",1975
366,House,94,-0.162,467,28,Mr. PIKE.," Mr. Chairman, I have voted  both ways over the course of my time in  Congress on the debt ceiling. When I first  got here, it used to be kind of fun to vote  on it, because it was a big game_ we all  played. When there was a Republican  administration, there were those in the  Democratic Party who  thought it was  fun to vote against increasing the debt  ceiling and thereby embarrass the ad ministration. When there was a Demo cratic administration, there were those  members of the Republican Party who  thought it was fun to vote agaill.St it.  We do not change many votes with  anything we ever say on the floor here;  but one day I was sitting here getting  ready to play fun and games by voting  against the increase in the debt ceiling  and the gentleman from Arkansas, Mr.  WILBUR MILLS, made a speech and the  gentleman said that it just gets down to  a question of whether the bills are going  to get paid or not. The whole concept  that increasing the debt ceiling is some thing which the Democratic majority is  thrusting down the throats of a reluctant  President at this particular time is just  plain laughable. We do not want to in crease the debt ceiling anymore than the  President wants  to  increase  the debt  ceiling; but he knows it has to be done  and we know it has to be done.  While I am very tempted to go along  with the gentleman from Pennsylvania  with his current mood, because it would  be very popular with  the  folks back  home,  it  is always wonderful  to vote  against  increasing  the national  debt  with the folks back home, but I think I  am constrained at this particular time to  not go with the fun and games, to go with  the agencies of the Government which  need  the money,  to go with  the em ployees of the Government who would  like to be paid.  I will only sa'y that if the President  does, in January, come up with $28 bil lion of spending cuts which he proposes,  I predict that the popularity of  those  cuts, when we do not know what they are,  will vanish with  the snows  in March,  when we do know what they are. I pre dict that there will not be that over whelming popularity for all of those cuts  when the President tells us which par ticular rabbits he is going to pull out of  the hat.  ",1975
367,House,94,0.347,467,28,Mr. MARTIN.," Mr. Chairman, I am one  of those who, in the past, have been gen erally opposed to a measure to increase  the debt ceiling. What point is there is  having one if the Congress is merely go ing to increase it at will?  We have also seen in the past that  there have been many  successful at tempts to attach the various nongermane  riders to debt ceiling bills. I  think now  it is time to attach a germane rider in  the form of a spending ceiling. To me,  that is so important that I would vote  for  the spending ceiling even  if  it  is  attached to an increase in the debt ceil ing.  But, without that discipline of a spend ing ceiling, Mr. Chairman, I will be con tent to continue to let those who voted  for  reducing our  revenues,  those who  voted for increasing spending by 18 per cent and  those who voted for the $72  billion deficit in the budget resolution  to continue to take the further responsi bility of voting for  the consequent in crease in the debt ceiling.

368,House,94,-0.53,467,28,Mr. CORMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I am  reasonably certain that a majority of  this House will soon vote to permit the  President to borrow money to run the  Government for the next four months.  However, as I listened to the statement of  my colleague from New York <Mr. CoN ABLE) whom I greatly admire, I was sad dened by the thought that once again  the members of the minority party will  not support this measure. Once again,  Republicans will evade their responsi bility for allowing  the Government  to  borrow funds to pay for already commit ted spending and let the majority party  bear this burden alone.  All of the Members of this body know  that twice a year we are called upon to  place a limit on the debt ceiling. To try  to attach to it an amendment calling for  a cut in spending for fiscal year 1977 is  both unreasonable and unrealistic. I re gret that my colleagues from the other  side of the aisle intend to vote to halt the  Go.vernment unless they can also vote to  comply with the President's politically  oriented request to cut spending from a  budget that he will not even submit to  this body for another 2 months.  I do not believe that the Government  will be stopped from paying its bills to day. There are enough Democrats willing  to bear the responsibility for the fiscal  soundness of this Nation. But I urge my  good friend from New York <Mr. CoN ABLE)  and other members of this party  to share this responsibility. I call upon  him to exercise his lead~rship and enthe  to support  courage his colleagues  measure before us today.  ",1975

370,,94,-0.478,805,28,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker,  every  year a significant number of people are  killed or injured because of an irrational  belief that ""It won't happen to me.""  I am introducing today a bill  to re quire the States, under penalty of a 10  percent reduction in Federal-aid high way funds, to enact legislation making  the use of safety belts mandatory for all  citizens at all times, subject to certain  State-determined exemptions  for  rea sons of physical or mental infirmity, oc cupation, or body size. Trame citations,  which would carry fines of between $10  and $25, would be issued for violations  of such laws.  The use of safety belts already  in stalled in passenger cars constitutes the  single most cost-effective measure  for  reducing serious  injuries and fatalities  in motor vehicle crashes.  No one can dispute  the emcacy of  safety belts  in preventing  injury and  death in automobile accidents--there is  a veritable mountain of available evi dence on this point. And since the nec essary safety equipment is already in stalled, not one additional dollar need be  spent on this invaluable means of pre ventive medicine.  The National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration--NHTSA--an arm of the  Department of Transportation, estimates  that in 1974, 13,530 deaths and 1,260,000  serious injuries could have been avoided  if 80 percent of all motorists wore safety  belts. In 1975, estimates would be even  higher due to the establishment of the  55 mph  speed  limit-the  lower  the  speeds,  the more effective  the  safety  belts.  In addition to the dramatic physical  benefits of safety belt use, moreover,  there are tremendous financial advan tages  involved. NHTSA estimates  that  $12.6 billion would have been saved in  36575  1974 alone if 80 percent of all motorists  ""buckled up,"" and again, 1975 estimates  would be even higher due  to reduced  speeds.  The importance of wearing safety belts  is also underscorerl by the recent trend  toward  the manufacturing of smaller,  lighter weight vehicles which are sub stantially  less able  to withstand colli sion impacts than the larger cars which  comprise  the majority of  the present  fleet. NHTSA estimates that such a shift  to  smaller  cars,  resulting  from  the  tremendous increase in the price of gaso line as well as from energy and clean air  legislation presently before the Congress,  could lead to an increase of up to 25 per cent in the rate of serious injury and  death. The shift could also send the an nual cost-savings figure soaring over $16  billion.  Yet if we only doubled  the present  usage  rate  of  about  29  percent, we  would more than offset the harmful re sults  to safety of energy conservation  policies and  legislation promoting  the  use of smaller cars. As we conserve our  energy resources, surely we have a moral  obligation to consider the precious hu man resources which will inevitably be  lost if compensatory safety measures are  not taken.  At a time when we are spending $120  billion annually, or more  than 8 per cent of our total GNP, on health care, at  a time when we are moving toward fund ing a program of national health insur ance which will give further impetus to  these soaring costs, the Congress and the  American  taxpayer should be particu larly conscious of-and adamantly op posed  to-vast  needless  and  clearly  avoidable  expenditures on  claims  for  health care, lost work or death. No tax payer should be forced to bear the costs  of another's gross negligence.  Furthermore,  these  expenditures do  not even take into account the diversion  of such valuable, and limited, J.'esources  as police, ambulance and medical serv ices from other areas in which preven tion--of crime, for example, or of seri ous  illness--is  far more difficult,  and  far more costly.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, we must not for get while studying these dramatic sta tistics that numbers cannot possibly con vey the terrible human tragedies involved  in any serious injury or death, particu larly if such tragedies are pointless and  easily preventable.  There is a great need for leadership,  for concern, for open-minded awareness  in this area. The experiences of other na tions, such as France, Australia, and New  Zealand, have been spectacular, and have  exceeded all expectations. Seat belt us age rates have shot up.-and stayed UP and serious  injuries and deaths have  dropped dramatically.  In Australia, for example, each of the  States has had regulations concerning  the compulsory wearing of safety belts  for 3 years. The rate of use has increased  from about 25 percent to over 85 percent.  Deaths have dropped by over 25 percent,  with an accompanying reduction of 30  percent in serious injuries.  Yet,  in  this country, we  ignore  the  problem of safety belt use as unfortunate  ",1975

Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 5512  Mr. Chairman,  I voice not only my  personal support of the National Wild life Refuge System Administration Act,  but  the hope  that my colleagues will  join me in approving this legislation.  This measure  represents  a  rational  step toward proper management of the  four major wildlife  ranges  presently  under  our National Wildlife Refuge  System. Joint management of the Kofa,  Russell,  Sheldon,  and Cabeza Prieta  wildlife ranges by the Bureau of Land  Management  and  the U.S. Fish  and  Wildlife Service has not proven satisfac tory. The conflicting responsibilities of  these  two agencies has made the joint  administration of wildlife  ranges par ticularly difficult.  It is  right  that  the  Congress  transfer the sole administra tive duties  to  that agency  responsible  for the protection and enhancement of  wildlife,  the U.S.  Fish  and Wildlife  Service.  It should be the duty of the Congress  to assure that our wildlife refuges are  correctly managed. Given the failure of  the Interior Department to advise  the  Merchant Marine and Fisheries Com mittee of the intent to divide the exclu sive authority over the ranges, it is prop er that the Congress mandate that fu ture transfers be approved by this body.  Especially since jurisdktion over three  of the ranges was  to be transferred to  BLM despite reports indicating the in ability of BLM  to properly handle the  task.  In our efforts  to maintain and  protect wildlife refuges, we must see that  the  job is handled in the most proper  and best possible manner.  ",1975

In Tuesday's Washington Post,  the  lead editorial, amplified  the need  for  some  form of victim compensation.  I  sincerely hope that in the near futwe,  we will be able to answer to the chal lenges presented in this article. With the  crime rate  increasing, now more  than  ever, Congress needs to act on legislation  in the area of victim compensation.  We must also make it much more dif ficult for the felons and other irrespon sible members of society to secure hand guns, provide our law enforcement au thorities with  the  tools  to  combat  crimes, and demonstrate  to  those who  with the handgun, .that we mean busi ness in the sentencing process. The ar ticle follows:  [From the Washington Post, Nov. 4, 1975]  CRIMES AND VICTIMS  The dismaying story of Sally Ann Morris  is an admonition to this city and a reproach  to the way that we who live here are running  it. While walking through Georgetown with  a  friend  in mid-evening  last  June, Mrs.  Morris was shot in the back. It was an un provoked attack, apparently a botched at tempt at a holdup. She was gravely wounded,  and is still far from recovery. Because of her  long convalescence and the prospect of fur  ther surgery, her employer dismissed her.  Since she had separated from her husband  several years before, she and her five-year old daughter now have no support but wel fare. Not only has this assault lnfl!cted great  physical suffering and financial poverty on  her, but she is fearful  that her assailants  may  try to klll her as a witness  to  their  previous crime. Police arrested four suspects  after the June shooting but they were all re leased  on  personal  recognizance  pending  trial, and they immediately disappeared. So  much for  their putative  ties  to  the com munity.  Here we have,  in one unhappy case,  the  illustration of at  least  three  serious and  harmful deficiencies in our present laws. First  of all, the District of Columbia needs legisla tion  to compensate  the victims of crimes.  Health insurance covers most, but not all, of  Mrs. Morris' medical bills. So far they come to  about $10,000. But while she recovers she has  nothing on which to live but $20_0 a month  in welfare payments. The traditional publlc  response  is  to murmur, ""tough luck,"" and  turn  the conversation  to something more  cheerful. That isn't good enough.

Number one wish would  have to be, that I could take any trip in  the world and that I could spend as much  money as I could on anything that I-ever  wished for I know it sounds conceited, but  you do have to admit that you would like  it, too. I have never been out of the United  States, and it would be a great adventure to  visit other countries.  My second wish would be that our great  country wouldn't have so many great prob lems.

This wish would also clean out all of  the problems we have now, and make the  ones  that'll be coming up not so bad.  My third, and last wish has to do with our  country again.  I wish  that people would  understand  the problems our government  people face. They try to do what's right for  the country. People think that these people  can do  everything, but  that  they're  just  not doing anything. Well, they're wrong. No  one can do everything, including them. I'd  hate to see them fake up that leadership.  If they did, they'd soon find out what it's  like.  Those were my three wishes.

OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 14, 1975  Mr. RmGLE. Mr. Speaker, on Wednes day, November 12, Ambassador Daniel  P. Moynihan, U.S. Representative to the  United Nations, proposed a worldwide  amnesty for political prisoners. As the  Ambassador pointed out, the time for this  amnesty is long past due. I would like  to call to the attention of my colleagues  a partial  text of Ambassador Moyni han's speech to the United Nations Com mittee Three:  AMNESTY FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS  (By Daniel P. Moynihan)  Mr. Chairman, my delegation rises to ad dress the Third Committee in a matter which  may be the most important social, cultural  and humanitarian proposal which the United  States has made in many years and which  we regard as one of the most important which  this committee will ever have had before it.  In an address on the occasion of the 30th  anniversary of the United Nations, U.S. Sec retary of State Henry A. Kissinger took note  that we are living at one of the rarest mo ments in the modern history of the world.  For at this moment, in all of the world, there  is not a single nation-state engaged 1n war  against another nation-state.  It appears to the United States that such  a moment  invlte&-calls for-not  less ex traordinary measures of reconclliation not  only between nations, but within them. To  thls end, the United States desires to pro pose a world-wide amnesty for political plis oners. It proposes a General Assembly resolu tion which:  ""Appeals to all governments to proclaim  an unconditional amnesty by releasing all  political prisoners in the sense of persons de prived of their liberty primarlly because they  36809  have, in accordance with the Universal Dec laration of Human Rights, sought peaceful  expression of beliefs and opinions at variance  with  those held by  their governments or  have sought to provide legal or other forms  of non-violent assistance to such persons.""  The United Nations has, 1n truth, already  taken, at this General Assembly, at least two  steps 1n this direction.  A draft resolution in the Special Political  Committee  entitled  ""Solidarity with  the  South African Political Prisoners,"" calls on  ""South Africa to grant an unconditional am nesty to all persons imprisoned or restricted  for their opposition to apartheid or acts aris ing from such opposition. . . .""  The United States voted for this resolu tion.  A draft resolution in the Social Cultural  and Humanitarian Committee, entitled ""Pro tection of Human Rights in Chile,"" called  for  the government  there  to ensure ""The  rights of all persons to Uberty and security  of person, in particular those who have been  detained without charge or in prison solely  for political reasons.""  The United States voted for  tion.  Is there, however, any reason to stop there,  to limit our concerns to only two members  of the United Nations, when there are alto gether 142 members?  this resolu THE APPEAL OF AMNl!:STY  Now l't follows from these considerations  that even as South Africa and Chile are  obliged by certain standards concerning pris oners, for example, so equally are all other  members of the United Nations. It is im plicitly acknowledged, however, that it is for  governments themselves to conform to inter national  standards. And  if some govern ments, then all governments.  Hence, at this moment, the singular appeal  of amnesty. A moment of peace and of peace making, and a mode which allows govern ments to do what they ought without the  appearance of coercion. All governments.  Universality in this matter is of special  concern to the United States government and we would hope to all governments. There  are two grounds for this concern which strike  us with special force.  The  first  is  that  the selective morality  of the United Nations in matters of human  rights threatens the integrity not merely of  the United Nations, but of human rights  themselves. There  is no mystery  in  this  matter. Unless standards of human rights  are seen to be applied uniformly and neu trally to all nations, regardless of the nature  of their regimes or the size of their arma ments, unless this is done, it will quickly be  seen that it is not human rights at all which  are invoked when selective applications are  called  for, but  simply  al'lbitrary political  standards dressed up in the guise of human  rights. From this perception it is no great  distance to the conclusion that in truth there  are no human rights recognized by the inter national communJty.  A generation ago the British poet Stephen  Spender came to this perception in the course  of visits to Spain during its long and tragic  civil war. He had first come to Spain out of  sympathy for one of the sides 1n that heart rendering confiict. He had returned to Eng land to report what he had seen of atrocities  committed by the other side. Thereafter he  made several trips to Spain, over the course  of which he was forced to reaJize that atroci ties were not a monopoly of one side only;  they were, indeed, all too common on both  sides. At which point, to his great and lasting  honor, he wrote: ""It came to me that unless  I  cared about every murdered chUd 1ndis cr1m1n&tely, I didn't really care &bout chll- dren belng murdered at all.""  This ls what the United States proposal ls  about. Unless we care about political pris oners everywhere, we don't really care about  them anywhere.    ",1975
376,House,94,0.253,1156,28,Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT.," Mr. Speaker,  as a cosponsor of H.R. 10283, the amend ment to the Senate bill S. 2327, which  we are now considering, to amend the  Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act  of 1974, I urge passage of the bill in or der to eliminate its more objectionable  features and thus hopefully resolve the  serious problems that have resulted from  its implementation.  I am certain that we have all received  the expressed concerns of businessmen  associated with real estate and lending  institutions, the overwhelming majority  of whom go about their daily conduct of  business in an honest, ethical way, but  who are being penalized and treated as  suspected criminals under this law, due  to the misconduct of a very small per centage of others. On the original .enact ment I voted  to send the bill back to  committee for further consideration of  these matters but that vote failed.  While RESPA  .was enacted  in good  faith-by a majority of Members-for  the purpose of correcting abuse of un reasonably high settlement costs and en couraging homeownership, the statute is  clearly having the opposite eff.ect. The  measure now before us seeks to eliminate  the  unanticipated  adverse  effects  of  Public Law 93-533.  Consider,  for  example,  the  type of  stated concerns  I have  received  from  people in Arkansas, relative to problems  under'RESPA:  ""The enactment of  the Real Estate  Settlement Procedures Act has created  numerous problems for both the lender  and the borrower on certain real estate  loans.""  ""The people  that need  this  type of  thing to keep  them honest need to be  out of the banking business.""  ""While there is no question as to the  legitimate concern of Congress for this  legislation,  it remains questionable at  this point whether or not the act, as it  has been promulgated-in reality does  offer the buyer any more protection than  he already was being afforded.""  ""In reality this legislation, like so much  Government regulation, has worked  the detriment of those it was intended  to help. It not only increases the costs of  settlement, but causes considerable de lay in closing a loan.""  These are representative, Mr. Speak er, of the sentiments being expressed by  to  to  to  so many reputable and honest business men and businesswomen  in Arkansas.  They probably closely resemble those of  others throughout the Nation. I believe  the message is clear. Therefore, I urge  enactment of S. 2327 as amended, which  will enable business persons and con sumers alike to live with RESPA.  ",1975
377,,94,0.236,1208,28,Mr. MYERS of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thought  that many would  find  the  statement of my colleague, ELwoon H.  HILLIS referencing the recent United Na tions action against Israel of  interest.  His remarks of November 14, 1975, before  the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation  follow:  S~ATEMENT BY  CONGRESSMAN  ELWOOD  HILLIS  IN REFERENCE  TO RECENT UNITED  NATIONS ACTION AGAINST ISRAEL  H.  I think many of us remember 30 years ago  when a war-weary world turned its hopes to ward  the belief  that a world organization  must be created to guarantee peace for fu ture generations.  From these hopes came a meeting in San  Francisco where delegates assembled to draft  a  charter adopting ~the broad principles of  such an organization-the United Nations  Organization. This would  then be  the ve hicle for affirming a dedication to peace and  tolerance for member nations.  I quote from the first article of this char ter: ""The purpose of the United Nations is  to achieve international cooperation in solv ing international problems of an economic,  social, cultural or humanitarian character,  and in promoting and encouraging respect  for human rights and for fundamental free doms for all without distinction as to race,  sex, language or reli{;lon.""  The recent action  taken  in the General  Assembly whereby a  resolution adopted No vember 10 declares Zionism to be racism is a  distinct contradiction to the intent of the  U.N. Charter. It is a direct contradiction and  affront to all of those who placed their hopes  and dreams of peace into the writing of this  charter. To equate Zionism with racism is  unthinkable! To me it is all the more de plorable since the date of its enactment fell  upon the same day as Kristall Nacht.  I  support our Secretary of State Henry  Kissinger, who said: ""We think that it is an  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  example of the bloc voting, of the one-way  morality, that has weakened the public sup port  in  the United States for  the United  Nations.""  It is my thought that this vote represents  a move away from peace, rather than toward  peace. It is an action by a political power  bloc to achieve  indirectly what some mem bers of that bloc had been unable to achieve  with a policy of direct military action.  Needless  to say,  there are some who say  we should now leave the United Nations-!  do not feel that we can take such action. For  us to leave the field would only permit the  forces which follow such a wrongful course  to move forward unchallenged.  In turn, it is my feeling that now is the  time to assert a uniform policy of support  for the nation ofIsrael. We must work with in  the United Nations and do everything  within our power to reverse this wrongful act  which violates the very  intent of  the U.N.  Charter. We must work hard toward restor ing and reasserting that feeling that the U.N.  can stand for peace, cooperation, tolerance,  and understanding, in the family of nations.  TRIBUTE TO RALPH KREISER  HON. WILLIAM M. KETCHUM  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, November 17, 1975  ",1975
378,,94,-0.069,1221,28,Mr. TAYLOR of North Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, the attached articles, the first  entitled ""Penny Pinching in the Parks A Shadow Over Spirit of 1976,"" from U.S.  News & World Report of October 13,  1975; and, the second entitled, ''National  Parks Getting Short End of Budgeting,""  from the Asheville Citizen of November 3,  1975, deserves the consideration of Mem bers of Congress and other American  citizens.  Since 1960, 99 new areas have been  added to the National Park System and  visits to the parks have tripled, but per sonnel to operate and manage the parks  have not kept pace. In 1960 it was one  employee for each 27,000 visitors, now it  is one for each 44,000. National parks  are being shortchanged in  the budget  process.  The two articles follow:  PENNY Pr.NCHr.NG m  THE PARKs-A SHADOW  OVER SPmrr oF 1976  Millions of financially pinched Americans  are planning to spend all or part of their  Bicentennial vacations in the national parks  in 1976. But  the way  things stand now,  many face bitter disappointment.  Because of a federal-budget squeeze, cut backs are in prospect for the 286 U.S.-Gov ernment-operated  parks  stretching  from  Maine and the Virgin Islands to Hawaii and  Alaska--during the year,  ironically, when a  record 250 million or more visits are ex pected.  Among possible  measures:  Parts of Philadelphia's Independence Na tional Historical Park-a keystone of the na tion's 200th-birthday celebration-may be  closed for lack of manpower.  Independence Hall, where the Declaration  of  Independence was  signed  in 1776, will  definitely be open. But other points of in terest  in  the old  city area,  such as  the  Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial,  the economy  results of  where the Polish general and Revolutionary  War hero once  lived, may  remain  locked.  Reconstruction of the home is nearly com plete--supposedly for the Bicentennial.  Many concerts and plays that were to have  been among highlights of the Bicentennial  program in the nation's capital have been  eliminated.  In Yellowstone National Park, half the pic nic grounds are closed, because there is in adequate manpower to maintain and clean  the areas.  The ancient El Morro Castle in San Juan.  Puerto Rico, faces collapse into the Atlantic  unless millions of dollars are allocated for  repairs and a sea wall.  Restrictions may be ordered against use  of parts of many parks. In some, such as  Shenandoah  in Virginia,  roads  in certain  sections have deteriorated to the point where  fire-access trails are impassable. ""I hate to  think what would happen if there was a fire  now,"" commented one ranger.  In New York City,  the Hamilton Grange  National Memorial-a man.sion  built  by  Alexa.nder Hamilton-is  rapidly  decaying,  with a leaking roof, fa.lling plaster and weak ened fioors.  Oamping has been curtailed in ma.ny areas,  and  restoration of  a  nationa.l  reservation  system has been h1ldilpered by a shortage of  funds.  Bicentennial activities have been hard hit.  Although the parks stlll hope to provide a  wide range of historical programs in 1976,  the effort is suffering from a staff shortage,  because the Park Service was unable to re tain top Bicentennial planners whose tem porary appointments expired.  Congressionaa sources say the main diffi culty is that the Ford Administration is un willing to spend enough money to main ta.in  the parks  properly  or  develop  new  ones  e3tal>lished in recent years.  Since 1960, visits to the parks have tripled,  and  99  new  areas--containLng  7 million  acres-have been added. In 1960, there was 1  employe for each 27,000 visitors. Now it's 1  for each 44,000.  Observes Gary Everhardt, Director of the  National Park Service: ""I'm sure that some  of our perennial park visitors noticed this  summer that the standard of service was not  quite what it used to be. With a budget that  is almost constant and a system and visita tion that keep growing, the only way to cope  to spread ourselves a  little thinner and  to ask visitors to 'do it yourself' a little more  often.""  Park officials say  their budget has been  badly outpaced by  inflation and  increa.sed  acreage approved by Congress and the Presi dent. The Service is asking for 347 million  dolla4""s  for  the fiscal year starting July 1,  1976-but estimates are that about 600 mil lion actually is needed just to keep mainte nance from slipping further backward.  Mr. Everhardt says it would take almost 3  billion  dollars  to  restore  parks  properly.  Tha""t figure does not include funds for pos sible development of more  than 40  acres  which Congress is considering as future addi tions. Nor is any money in the works for 32  million  acres  proposed  for  new parks  in  Alaska----which would double the size of the  system.  Requests for more money by park officials  have been turned down by the Interior De partment, which ma.intains that other prior ities--such as developing new techniques for  strip mining-rank higher.  The President's Office of Management and  Budget, which prepares the Administration's  budget proposals  for  submission  to Con gress, also has turned a deaf ear to pleas  for more funds because of a general effort to  hold down Government spending.  Some conservationists contend that con tinued neglect of the parks at a  time when  m:e is growing will lead to even more serious  is  ",1975
379,,94,0.496,1234,28,Mr. ARCHER.," Mr. Speaker, I placed in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the first part  of Murray Weidenbaum's comments on  OSHA in his book ""Government ManEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dated Price Increases."" His concluding  remarks on the cost of Government con trols should be of particular interest to  every Member of Congress. I hope all of  my colleagues will take the time to read  the following:  COST OF GOVERNMENT CONTROLS  Estimates of current industry expenditures  to meet government safety or other require ments are often no more  than reasonable  guesses. Survey results are not easy to in terpret. It ~s often difficult for a company to  separate clearly investment to meet federal  requiTements and investment in production  equipment which would be purchased in the  absence  of  the  governmental  restriction.  Thus, the data in Table 10 should be taken  mainly as illustrative of the substantial costs  involved in meeting federally mandated re quirements. In some cases, safety and health  investment  is reported  to be a  significant  part of an industry's total capital spending.  In 1972, 8 percent of the textile industry's  investments and 12 percent of steel's were  so related.23  According to McGraw-Htll Department of  Economics, already planned  industrial  in vestments in health and safety equipment  are estimated to rise from $2.5 billion in 1972  to $3.4 billion in 1977. To some unspecified  extent-that is, to the extent that these cap ital outlays succeed in reducing job-related  injuries and illnesses-they can be consid ered as a  form of investment in employee  productivity.  A recent study commissioned by the Occu pational Safety and Health Administration  estimates that it wtll cost American industry  an aggregate of $13.5 billion to bring exist ing facllities into compliance with the cur rent OSHA noise standard of 90 A scale deci bels  (dbA). If the more stringent standard  of 85 dbA is adopted-and this is the recom mendation of the U.S. National Institute for'  Occupational Safety and Health-the com pliance cost is expected to increase to $31.6  billion  (see Table  11) . Hearings on  the  NIOSH proposal have been scheduled. The  more stringent standard is supported by the  Environmental Protection Agency.u  TABLE  10.-ESTIMATED COMPLIANCE  COSTS OF OSHA  SAFETY STANDARDS, BY  INDUSTRY  [Dollar amounts in millions!

In evaluating the merits of such an invest ment, an economist  is concerned not only  with  the magnitude of  the  resources  in volved, but also with  the alternative uses  to which those resources could be put (the  ""opportunity cost""). As Paul McCracken has  stated the matter:  ""resources used  in one  direction are then not available to be us~d  elsewhere. Whether they should be so used,  therefore, depends not only on whether the  intended use is 'good,' but on whether it is  better than the uses to which the resources  would otherwise be put."" 25 In that spirit it  should be noted  that for many  industries  the time lost due to illnesses and injuries off  the job far exceeds that due to on-the-job  hazards. The medical director of Exxon, for  example, states that non-job-related diseases  and  injuries account for about 96 percent  of the time lost due to disabllity.2e Assuming  these figures are typical for industry in gen eral,  the expensive OSHA-mandated efforts  apply to approximately 4 percent of disabil ity-caused absenteeism.  ANNOUNCEMENT EFFECT  One unmeasureable impact of federal reg ulation  is  the ""announcement effect."" For  many years economists have noted the exist ence of this effect in the field of government  spending or  taxation. Thus, potential gov ernment contractors may start preparing to  bid on a project before Congress has appro priated the funds, or consumers may increase  their expenditures as soon as a  tax cut is  voted on or even while it is being considered.  Anticipated  changes  in  governmental  regulatory programs may stimulate some what similar responses. In Illinois, the very  rumor  that  the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration might  impose more  stringent  standards  for migrant worker  housing caused  strawberry  farmers  to re duce their production. Lester Pitchford, the  largest grower  in  the Centralia area, was  quoted as saying, ""We don't know if OSHA is  coming  or  not,  but when  it was  even  rumored, it put it [strawberry production]  out."" 21 The basis for  the concern was  the  u ""OSHA Noise Standard Compliance Could  Cost Industry $13.5 Billion,"" Washington Be port, February 11, 1974,-p. 4; ""The Expensive  Sound of Silence,"" Business Week, July 20,  1974, p. 28.  25 McCracken, ""Will There Be Economics in  2024?""
