1,2,2010-01-13,Mr. KUCINICH.," Yesterday, I  introduced H.R. 4414, a bill that imposes a 75  percent  tax on  the outside bonuses  bankers are paying themselves  from  windfall profits earned  from massive  Federal Government support.  This bill is necessary because bankers are about to pay out some of the  largest bonuses in history. All banking  corporations, whether they received direct assistance or not, received substantial benefits from government bailouts. Bankers’ failures to self-regulate,  let us remember, were the direct result  of the crisis we’re in today. They need  to be told that the money they’re making is a public trust, not something  they’ve earned for good behavior.  Bank profits are the result of a deliberate Federal Government policy to restore banking capital and ultimately  investment  in American  prosperity.  Banking bonuses have nothing to do  with these objectives, and payouts to  bankers are a form of appropriation of  public wealth.  Banks could be using their profits to  do many things to improve the prospects of economic recovery, including  strengthening their capital base, recognizing and writing off their real estate  losses, reducing fees charged to customers,  especially  for  seniors  and  struggling consumers, and  increasing  lending  to  small  and medium-sized  companies.  Support H.R. 1414.  f  PEOPLE MAKING A DIFFERENCE  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. In  South Carolina last week, I met with  people making a difference promoting  jobs by visiting the OneStop employment centers across the district. I visited the directors and staff, desk to  desk, in Columbia, Lexington, Aiken,  Barnwell,  Orangeburg,  Hampton,  Ridgeland, and Beaufort.  I want  to  thank the energetic, optimistic, and  talented employees and commissioners  of the Employment Security Commission for their dedication to helping put  people back to work.  Another  economic  development  is  being announced  for South Carolina  today. The Estill Correctional Facility  is adding 50 more jobs with a biomass  contract with Ameresco. We welcome  the recent economic commitments to  our State from Four Star Industries,  Boeing, DHL,  Scotsman  Ice, Dixie  Narco, Ameresco at SRS, and now Estill Correctional Facility. The combination of low taxes, worker training,  right-to-work protections, and less regulatory redtape is a sound recipe to attract business. This commonsense approach should be applied at the national level.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th in the global war on terrorism.  f  HONORING BOBBY SALCEDO  (Ms. CHU asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2010
2,2,2010-01-13,Ms. CHU.," I rise today to speak of a  shocking murder and a tragic loss to  my California district. On New Year’s  eve, Bobby Salcedo was in a restaurant  with  family and  friends  in Durango,  Mexico when gunmen burst in, took six  of the men away, and shot each one to  death execution style. Bobby was only  33 years old.  With Bobby, they murdered an exemplary U.S. citizen. He was an elected  member of the El Monte City School  District Board. He returned to his alma  mater, Mountain View High School, to  become its assistant principal. He was  studying for his doctorate in education  at UCLA. He dedicated his life to helping youth and was a rising star in our  community.  Bobby’s death shows that the violence done by Mexican drug cartels is  not in some faraway land; its tentacles  affect us in the U.S. all too closely. For  the sake of Bobby Salcedo, we must  end the violence of the Mexican drug  cartels. My heart goes out to the family.  f  THE NEW ORLEANS SAINTS  (Mr. CAO asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2010
3,2,2010-01-13,Mr. CAO.," Madam Speaker, the New  Orleans Saints are having a historic  season. This success has benefited our  city tremendously. And with their first  playoff game kicking off this Saturday,  I wanted to give constituents a chance  to honor them. Today’s statement is  from Jewelyn Wellborn.  Jewelyn writes: ‘‘The reason we are  proud of the Saints, the reason we rally  behind them, has less to do with the  scoreboard and more to do with the  heart, soul, and fire of the city. Your  average New Orleanian is characterized  by different concepts that seem so opposite of one another. There are those  who have always called New Orleans  home and some who came for only a  few years and fell in love.  ‘‘Watching the Saints helps us escape  from rebuilding, yet reminds us of why  we came home. The Saints are an exact  reflection of us, our city, our home,  and that’s why the Saints are my home  team.’’  HEALTH CARE AND THE ECONOMY  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2010
4,2,2010-01-13,Mr. BUTTERFIELD.," Madam Speaker, the American people continue to  struggle in this difficult economy. One  of the counties in my North Carolina  district  is  now  suffering with  the  State’s highest unemployment  rate.  Yes, people are hurting and need to be  put back to work. The transformation  of our Nation’s health care system represents an enormous opportunity to  create jobs and fuel economic growth.  Each year, our health care reform  plan will create 250,000 to 400,000 jobs.  These reforms will also allow small  business  to add an estimated  80,000  jobs. Without these reforms, the health  care premiums paid by businesses in  coming years will more than double.  Money needlessly spent on health care  premiums by small businesses is really  needed to hire workers, increase salaries, and refuel the economy.  Madam Speaker, Americans cannot  afford the status quo. Doing nothing is  not an option. I urge my colleagues to  join us in improving the health care delivery system.  f  AMERICAN CONSERVATION AND  CLEAN ENERGY ACT  (Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)  ",2010
5,2,2010-01-13,Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania.,"  Madam Speaker, the U.S. is $800 billion  in debt to China, and yet Congress continues to spend, having to raise the  debt limit time and time again.  We do not grow America’s jobs by  borrowing hundreds of billions  from  China, sending hundreds of billions of  dollars to OPEC for oil, or taking hundreds of billions more from Americans  in new taxes.  What we can do, however, is by using  some of our oil off our coast, we can  use it to create jobs, restore our environment, use  conservation and new  technologies to cut waste and improve  energy efficiency, develop innovative,  efficient, and clean energy generation  in all sectors, and rebuild America’s inefficient transportation and energy infrastructure.  By putting our resources to work, we  put millions of Americans to work here  at home, and all this can be done without raising taxes. I encourage my colleagues to join the effort by supporting  and being cosponsors of H.R. 2227, the  American Conservation and Clean Energy Independence Act. It’s about new  jobs for a new, clean America.  f  HEALTH CARE REFORM  (Mr. BACA asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2010

7,9,2010-01-13,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 981,  supporting continued political and economic  development in Ukraine.  It has been 18 years since Ukraine joined  the  family of  free and  independent nations,  much of that due to the commitment shown by  the  people  of  Ukrainian  heritage  living  throughout the world including those in Southeast Michigan.  And today, Ukraine is a great friend and ally  of the United States and a model for nations  who made the transformation from tyranny to  freedom. They have been stalwart partners in  the War on Terror—sending troops to support  International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The U.S.-based  human  rights watchdog  Freedom House designated Ukraine as a free  country for the fourth consecutive year in its  2010 Freedom in the World survey. It is all the  more encouraging because according to Freedom House, 2009 marked the fourth consecutive year in which global freedom suffered a  decline.  It is time that we gave the people of Ukraine  the recognition  they deserve  for  their exemplary economic progress and continued democratic ambitions, especially as  their presidential elections approach next week.  The Ukrainian people bravely demonstrated  their desire for a free, democratic, and prosperous country through nonviolent protest during  the 2004 Orange Revolution and  this  year’s election is a testament to the enduring  strength of the Ukrainian democracy. It is my  sincere hope that the elections are conducted  in a fair, free and transparent manner.  The  Ukrainian  population  in  Southeast  Michigan is one of the largest—if not the largest, in the nation. These Ukrainian Americans  are great citizens and great Patriots, and for  years Ukrainians fought against Soviet oppression on behalf of freedom, so it is my honor  to serve the 10th Congressional District and  the Ukrainian-Americans who live there; and  this Nation is proud to call Ukraine and her  people friends and allies.  A strong, sovereign,  independent, democratic, and economically prosperous Ukraine is  important to the interests of the United States  and  to achieving peace, prosperity and stability in Europe, so I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.  ",2010
8,9,2010-01-13,Mr. GERLACH.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today in strong support of H. Res. 981, which  supports the continued political and economic  development in Ukraine. This important resolution represents another step in our continued  efforts to support the Ukrainian people in their  efforts to fully integrate into the Euro-Atlantic  community of democratic nations.  On January 17th, Ukraine will hold its presidential election with a subsequent run-off held  on February 7th. This election represents a  critical moment not only for Ukraine, but for  the region as a whole. As Ukraine continues  along the path of economic and political integration,  it  is my hope  that  the presidential  election will be conducted in a free, fair, and  transparent manner.  As a co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, I believe it is important to encourage closer ties between the United States and  Ukraine. This relationship must be one that is  continually  fostered and strengthened, both  politically and economically. By expressing our  support  for  free and democratic elections,  Congress can assist the Ukrainian people in  their efforts  to  join  the  larger Euro-Atlantic  community of democratic nations.  I would  like  to  thank  the Chairman and  Ranking Member for their continued support of  legislation aimed at strengthening the ties of  the United States with a key ally in Eastern  Europe and encouraging fair and democratic  elections.  In  light of  the  recent economic  struggles of Ukraine, our support and continued friendship is critical.  Madam Speaker,  I urge my colleagues  to  vote in favor of H. Res. 981 and in favor of  continued friendship and support for Ukraine  and  the Ukrainian people  in  their efforts  to  fully integrate into the Euro-Atlantic community  of democratic nations.  b1100  ",2010

Res. 981.  The question was taken; and (two-  thirds being  in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.  A motion to reconsider was laid on  the table.  f  CONGRATULATING MARK  INGRAM  ON WINNING THE 2009 HEISMAN  TROPHY  ",2010
11,9,2010-01-13,Mr. KILDEE.," Madam  Speaker,  I  move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 970) congratulating Flint native, University of Alabama  sophomore, and  running back  Mark  Ingram  on winning  the  2009  Heisman Trophy and honoring both his  athletic and academic achievements.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 970  Whereas Mark Ingram was raised in Flint,  Michigan;  Whereas Mark  Ingram  attended Grand  Blanc Community High School and Flint  Southwestern Academy, where he distinguished himself as a running back and cornerback;  Whereas Mark Ingram was a 4-year starter  in high school, and rushed for 4,926 yards and  58 touchdowns in his final 2 seasons;  Whereas, during his high school football  career, Mark Ingram was honored with the  Saginaw Valley MVP Award, named Area  Player of the Year, and was an All-State selection;  Whereas, in 2009, Mark Ingram led the University of Alabama to the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Championship and rushed 113  yards and scored 3 touchdowns in the championship game;  Whereas, in 2009, Mark Ingram broke the  University of Alabama single-season rushing  record with 1,542 yards, was named the SEC  offensive player of the year, scored 18 total  touchdowns, and finished the season with 322  receiving yards;  Whereas, in 2009, Mark Ingram was named  an All SEC First Team Selection, a Walter  Camp 1st team All-American, and an American Football Coaches Association All-American;  Whereas Mark Ingram is the first Heisman  Trophy winner from the University of Alabama;  Whereas Mark Ingram is only the third  sophomore in history to win the Heisman  Trophy;  Whereas Mark Ingram has made the Dean’s  List at the University of Alabama;  Whereas Mark  Ingram’s Heisman win  brings tremendous pride to his hometown of  Flint, Michigan;  Whereas, December 12, 2009, has been declared Mark Ingram Day in the City of Flint;  Whereas the sport of football is an important national  pastime  that helps  foster  teamwork, leadership skills, sportsmanship,  and camaraderie; and  Whereas football can help build self-esteem  and promote exercise and a more active and  healthy lifestyle: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives congratulates Flint native and running  back Mark  Ingram on winning  the  2009  Heisman Trophy and honors both his athletic and academic achievements.

15,9,2010-01-13,Mr. KILDEE.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of House Resolution 970, honoring Mark Ingram, 2009  Heisman Trophy winner and pride of  my hometown, Flint, Michigan.  Madam Speaker, with an unemployment rate of close to 30 percent, Flint  has been going through some tough  times. Our young people need a role  model they can look up to, someone  who can show them that through hard  work and perseverance their dreams  are within reach and that greatness  can be achieved.  Madam Speaker, Mark  Ingram  is  that  inspiration  for our community.  Since he began his football career in  Grand Blanc Community High School  and  Flint  Southwestern  Academy  where he was a 4-year starter and distinguished himself as a running back  and a cornerback, he has continuously  excelled.  This season, Mark broke the University of Alabama single season rushing  record with 1,542 yards, was named the  Southeastern  Conference  offensive  player of the year, scored 18 touchdowns and finished one season with 322  receiving yards. He led his team to the  SEC  championship,  rushing  for  113  yards and scoring three touchdowns in  the championship game.

I am honored to join with  the  gentlemen  from Michigan  and  Georgia, and I am certainly delighted  and honored to associate myself with  the remarks of the gentleman  from  California and his work in establishing  the Martin Luther King, Jr. Federal  holiday. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.  ",2010
18,16,2010-01-13,Mr. HONDA.," Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1002, honoring  the  life and  work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and encouraging the continued commitment to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a national day of service.  Through the Martin Luther King, Jr. National  Day of Service, we honor Dr. King’s noble vision of equality and message of compassion.  Dr. King preached peace  in  the  fight  for  equality, shaking the foundations of segregation with  love  for others, even  those who  sought  to oppose his vision. His unyielding  commitment  to  non-violent  resistance  anchored his messages, and his  ‘‘I Have a  Dream’’  speech  changed  America  and  sparked  a movement  that  embraced  civil  rights, justice, equality and human dignity for  all. This is a movement that we must continue  to fight for and protect.  We have celebrated considerable successes  due  to Dr. King’s Dream. Housing, schools  and transportation are now accessible by all  Americans.  Indeed,  in 2008 Americans  took  another great step toward realizing Dr. King’s  vision by electing America’s first African-American  President,  Barack  Obama.  These  achievements were not easily won, but Dr.  King’s Dream has proven resilient and it has  persevered.  As a Representative of Silicon Valley, one  of  the most ethnically diverse areas of  the  country,  I appreciate Dr. King’s message of  equality. As Chair of the Congressional Asian  Pacific American Caucus, CAPAC, I recognize  the great strides that have been made since  Dr. King sparked the historic civil rights movement, and CAPAC has continued to vigilantly  ensure equal opportunity remains accessible  to all. For his vision and sacrifices, we owe Dr.  King a great debt of gratitude for his service  and leadership to our Nation, and there is no  better way  to express  that gratitude  than  through our own personal service to the Nation.  The Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service  will serve to remind Americans that we should  all take the time to contribute to our communities. This day continues to pay tribute to the  life and actions of a great man, as we continue  to  foster  brotherhood  and  service  amongst our friends, neighbors, and communities. Since its designation as a federal holiday in 1994, Americans have Dr. King’s birthday to act on his ideals. It has been a day to  improve  lives,  bridge  social  barriers,  and  change our Nation into the ‘‘Beloved Community’’ that Dr. King had hoped to see during his  life. Thanks  in part  to  the commitment we  have shown  to honor Dr. King,  the Day of  Service continues to grow in popularity as a  chance  for citizens, business  leaders, and  public officials alike to contribute to their communities.  In 2009 alone, over 13,000 Martin  Luther King, Jr. Day of Service projects occurred  throughout  the Nation, honoring  the  Dream of Dr. King.  I am pleased that the constituents of California’s 15th District have answered this call to  service as a tribute to Dr. King’s life. Constituents of all backgrounds volunteer to remove  graffiti, pick up litter, improve parks, and engage in other activities that aim to selflessly  improve the world around them. Though each  individual’s effort may be small, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service provides the medium to combine an individual’s energies with  those of his or her neighbors. The resulting  collaboration is an impactful and tangible celebration of Dr. King’s messages.  As we near  the day of remembrance, we  must  recognize  that  the  fight goes on. Dr.  King’s Dream embodies an ideal for our Nation  to pursue—Americans of all ethnicities  and creeds,  living  together with dignity and  hope. To admire Dr. King’s life requires us to  follow his  legacy. Let us honor his  life by  working together to continue to build an America where every child enjoys all the privileges  of equal opportunity and freedom.

23,23,2010-01-13,Mr. LYNCH.," I yield my such time as  I may consume.  Madam Speaker, on behalf of  the  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I present Senate bill 692  for consideration.  This legislation will facilitate the donation of the Grace Tully Archive to  the National Archives and Records Administration. Senate bill 692 is the Senate companion to H.R. 1506, which was  introduced by Representative LOUISE  SLAUGHTER. H.R. 1506 passed the House  by voice vote on November 16, 2009,  after  it was approved by  the Committee on Oversight and Government  Reform by voice vote on October 29,  2009. Senate bill 692 is identical to H.R.  1506, and was  introduced by Senator  CHUCKSCHUMERon March 25, 2009. The  legislation was reported out of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security  and  Governmental  Affairs  without  amendment on October 5, 2009, and was  passed by the United States Senate on  October 14, 2009, by unanimous consent.  Madam Speaker, Ms. Grace Tully  served as  the personal  secretary of  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  from June of 1941 to April of 1945. In  her capacity as personal secretary to  the President, Ms. Tully preserved an  assortment  of  personal  papers  and  other historical items related to President Roosevelt that have come to form  a historically  significant  collection.  While the private owner of the Grace  Tully Collection would like to donate  the materials to the Franklin Delano  Roosevelt Presidential Library, the National Archives and Records Administration, which administers the Roosevelt Library, has asserted a claim to  a portion of the collection. The claim  asserted by the National Archives impacts whether the private owner may  claim a tax deduction for the donation.  In order to facilitate the donation of  the Grace Tully Archive, Senate bill  692 waives the government’s claim to  the records and will thereby allow the  collection to be gifted to the Roosevelt  Library.  Madam Speaker, the Grace Tully Archive represents an important part of  American history. Through the passage  of Senate bill 692, we will ensure that  this collection will be properly preserved  and made  publicly  available  through the Roosevelt Library.  I’d also like to note that this legislation enjoys the support of the National  Archives. As noted by former Acting  Archivist Adrienne Thomas in a letter  sent to the Oversight Committee in October of 2009, ‘‘I write to express my  strong support for the ongoing legislative effort to facilitate the donation to  the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential  Library of  the Tully Archive.’’ Ms.  Thomas went on to say that,  ‘‘It is  very  important to the National Archives  and Records Administration,  and for future historians that might  want to study these papers,  for the  Tully Archive to be kept intact and  made fully accessible to the American  people  in  a  public  government  archives.’’  Madam Speaker,  I  urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting Senate bill 692.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010
24,23,2010-01-13,Mr. LUETKEMEYER.," Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  S. 692 is identical to House Resolution 1506, which passed the House on  November 16. Therefore, I want to reiterate the points made previously during debate on the House bill. This bill  will waive certain claims of the United  States to specific documents, known as  the  Tully  Collection,  relating  to  Franklin  Delano  Roosevelt.  Grace  Tully served in Franklin Roosevelt’s  secretarial staff  for several decades,  and in 1941, became his personal secretary. After her death, her collection  of papers passed through a number of  hands and finally to the current owners, Sun Times Media, who bought the  collection for $8 million in 2001.  In 2004, the National Archives asserted a claim to a portion of the documents. Sun Times Media wishes to donate the collection to President Roosevelt’s Presidential Library in Hyde  Park, New York, and take a tax deduction. Due to the Archives claim, Sun  Times Media is prevented from receiving a tax deduction on the donation.  This bill waives the legal claims of the  United States and the Archives, thereby clearing the way for the tax deduction and the donation.  I understand the Archives has offered  to support this legislation in a letter to  the committee. Nevertheless, I want to  again highlight two points: The majority moved this bill without a hearing.  We should have had a better understanding of  legislation  relinquishing  the Federal Government’s claims while  benefiting  certain  private  entities  through tax breaks. Given the multiple, ongoing instances of mismanagement of the Archives, we should have  the opportunity on the committee to  review all legislation relating to this  agency.  ",2010

29,65,2010-01-13,Mr. MCKEON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate  the  life  of  Paula  T.  Nowakowski, who tragically and unexpectedly  passed away Saturday, January 9, 2010. As a  trusted  aide  to Republican  Leader  BOEHNER, she was there for each and every  Member of the Republican Conference. Before  I served as Chairman and Ranking Member of  the  Education  and Workforce Committee,  Paula effectively led the staff as Staff Director  for nearly six years, helping to enact legislation  that were major  initiatives of President  Bush’s administration. Paula held a deep love  and respect for the institution of Congress and  the people who are elected and chosen  to  serve our nation. She was extraordinarily talented,  loyal, and  to-the-point. She will be  greatly missed.  ",2010
30,65,2010-01-13,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor  the  life  and  memory  of  Paula  Nowakowski, and  to express my deep sadness over her passing.  Paula, the dedicated chief of staff to House  Republican Leader JOHNBOEHNER, died unexpectedly  last Saturday evening, January 9,  2010, at the young age of 46.  Her death leaves a void on Capitol Hill that  can never be filled. Paula was a true professional and a devoted patriot on behalf of her  country.  During  twenty-five years of public service,  Paula spent fifteen years as a faithful aide to  Leader BOEHNERand proved herself to be a  woman of integrity and compassion.  And as we all know, it is difficult to overstate  the love she held for her home in Michigan.  Paula will not only be remembered for her  work on the Hill, but for her tireless efforts off  the Hill as well.  Paula  worked  extensively,  on  Leader  BOEHNER’s behalf,  in developing an annual  gala  to benefit Catholic schools  in Washington, D.C. Over the last six years, this gala  has offered more than $5 million in support for  local Catholic schools struggling to keep their  doors open.  If further proof was needed of Paula’s impact in the lives of so many, look no further  than a Facebook page that in just a few days  has signed up over 650 individuals to honor  Paula’s memory.  This past weekend, Congress lost a talented  public servant and House Republicans lost a  dear friend.  As one  leadership aide noted, Paula  manded excellence.’’  May we continue our work on behalf of the  American people the way Paula would have  wanted us to—in a manner that promotes excellence.  On behalf of my family and staff, I extend  my sincere  thoughts and prayers  to Paula’s  family, friends and to the entire staff at the Republican Leader’s office, as they cope with this  incalculable loss.  May God comfort them during this difficult  time.  ‘‘deANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2010

34,79,2010-01-13,Ms. LEE of California.," Thank you  very much, Congressman PAYNE. Let  me thank you  for that presentation  and also for putting Haiti in a historical context. It is important that we  recognize and remember the history of  how our foreign policy and our relations with Haiti have been so important  in  the  past, which  now  has  brought us to this day.  So, today, we are talking about how  we can respond in an emergency way  and in a manner that will help the Haitian people take care of the sick and  that will help with these search and  LEE JACKSON rescue efforts. I also thank you for reminding us that we have to help Haiti  to move forward and to rebuild and recover.  Now I would like to ask Congresswoman SHEILAJACKSONLEE to speak.  Congresswoman  is  a  member  of  the Homeland Security  Committee, but also she was very instrumental  in the Katrina response.  She provided many, many ways and vehicles for Katrina survivors to live and  to have a decent place to stay until  they could return home, and she ensured that FEMA was responsive to  their needs. She really took on many,  many issues as it relates to hurricane  survivors. Now she  is working very  hard as it relates to the earthquake in  Haiti.  So thank you again, Congresswoman  JACKSONLEE. Let me just remind you,  and  I was  listening to Congressman  PAYNE, that I come from an area that  is earthquake-prone. It is hard to imagine what a 7.0 or a 7.1 earthquake is on  the Richter scale given our experience  with, maybe, a 4 or a 5 or a 6. So this  is really an earthquake of enormous  magnitude that those of us who come  from earthquake-prone regions recognize and understand.  Thank you, Congresswoman JACKSON  LEE.  ",2010
35,79,2010-01-13,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Let me  thank Congresswoman BARBARALEE,  our chairperson, who raised the red  flag and who let out the siren and gathered us together, and I want to respond  to what she just said about the earthquake.  It rocks you in your soul; 7.0 on the  Richter scale is hair-raising. I would  also argue that it puts your hair on  fire. I still have a sense that I am trembling because it’s unimaginable. As you  have just indicated, we look to California, and we get very nervous about  our friends and family who are there  when we hear of a 2, of a 3 or of a 4. I  recall in the northern California area  when there was an earthquake that impacted the baseball game and the baseball stadium, and it was all over the  news. It was not a 7.0.  So I would just simply say that we  rise here with all solemnness. We are  not speechless, but we are trembling  for those who are now in the eye of  devastation.  I, too, rise to thank the Congressional Black Caucus, of which I am a  member, to thank all of those who  have been in meetings, as we have been  throughout this morning and yesterday, and on a conference call that occurred. Work is going on as we speak  and the concern that we have for those  who we have been able to see only  through, to a certain extent, still pictures, though I know many of our cable  networks in particular have been making their way there, and other networks, to be able to deliver the devastation to us.  I  express my appreciation  to  the  President of the United States, who  moved swiftly. There was no hesitation  on  the  commitment  that President  Barack Obama had. In fact, he quickly  offered his prayers, but he acknowledged the devastation, making note of  the fact that he had seen collapsed hospitals,  crumbled  homes, men  and  women carrying their  injured neighbors to the streets. He acknowledged  that it was truly heart-wrenching, sufficient to make you tremble. So, moving swiftly, he directed his administration  to coordinate  in an aggressive  manner to save lives.  The people of Haiti will have the full  support of the United States in the urgent efforts to rescue those trapped beneath the rubble and to deliver the humanitarian relief—the food, the water,  and  the medicine—the Haitians will  need. He has authorized that USAID  and the Departments of State and Defense work closely together, and he has  mobilized large numbers of individuals,  including our military efforts.  I also want to take note that the Secretary of Homeland Security has indicated that our resources, including the  United States Coast Guard and FEMA,  will be there, which we have jurisdiction over—my committee has jurisdiction  over—and Chairman THOMPSON  will be intimately involved in pushing  the efforts of making sure that FEMA  and the U.S. Coast Guard are there.  Google ‘‘7.0’’ and get a sense of how  deeply devastating that is and that it  hit one of the most populated areas,  Port-au-Prince. It damaged buildings  extensively. We saw the palace collapse, not riddled by bullet holes, but  literally collapse. How  fortunate we  can say we were, the fact that this  came at 6 o’clock when we understand  that many of the workers in the palace  and the government were already gone,  but we know that government officials  may have lost their lives. It is said  that many of the United Nations personnel and peacekeeping troops have  lost their lives, and so we can’t put  this at a level of seriousness by just  our voices and our words.  Let me  thank  the U.S. Southern  Command that is deploying a team of  30 people to Haiti to support U.S. relief  efforts in the aftermath of yesterday’s  devastating earthquake. Let me also  mention that the team will  include  U.S. military  engineers, operational  planners,  a  command-and-control  group, and communications specialists.  They will arrive in Haiti on two C–130  Hercules aircraft. For those who don’t  know or who can’t imagine, those are  huge,  boat-like  aircraft which  can  carry an enormous amount of equipment.  Chairman LEE, I think one of the important  issues that  I am very concerned about and would like to get a  report on is how many aircraft—let me  just use the right terminology—large  ships can carry heavy equipment. We  know in the war zones that there are  large aircraft that can carry heavy  equipment, and the equipment I am  thinking of in particular would be the  Earth-moving machines, the machines  that can assist in finding the loss.

36,86,2010-01-13,Mr. NEUGEBAUER.," Well, I thank the  gentleman for pointing out the taxes  that are in this bill. I think the bad  news is that they’re going to have to be  higher tax because they are disguising,  as you know, what this bill actually  costs. Now the stated cost that the  Speaker of the House says is this bill  costs $891 billion. But if you add the  mandated cost of the employer-mandating tax,  it’s another $135 billion.  And if you add the cost of individual  mandate tax for individuals that are  going to be penalized under this plan,  it’s another $33 billion. So the total  cost, the CBO score is $1.06 billion.  You don’t hear the Speaker or the  leadership or  the President  talking  about this number. Now the other piece  is that in the House bill, there is no  provision for what is being called the  ‘‘doc fix.’’ Today we have reimbursement levels that are being projected to  be  reduced  by  a  substantial  level,  which is going to cause more and more  doctors not to see Medicare and Medicaid patients. So this leadership team  has promised and made a deal with the  docs that they will bring a separate  bill. They don’t want to bring it in this  one because, why? It cost $209 billion.  So now instead of $1.06, you have got a  nearly a $1.2 trillion bill.  Now the other piece is that Medicaid  is being transferred to—part of this  cost is going to be Medicaid which is  going to be transferred to States, unless you’re from Nebraska. What is the  cost of that? That’s $34 billion. Now  here is the real sleeper. I hope that the  American people are watching C–SPAN  and the like because the lights are on  here, and the lights are on this chart.  And guess what, this little bill collects  taxes that the gentleman was talking  about for 10 years, but it only has expenses for 7 years.  Now think about all of the businesses  and families all across America that if  you could collect 10 years’ worth of salary but you only had to pay 7 years’  worth of expenses, that’s like the first  3 years you don’t have to make your  house payment, you don’t have to buy  your gasoline, you don’t have to make  your car payment. You just get your  paycheck. Nothing taken out of it, no  Social Security, no withholding. What  a great deal that would be. Well, that’s  the way this bill has been put together  in order to disguise the real cost of  this.  So once  the  3-year period passes,  then on an annualized basis, this bill  costs another $727 billion more than  what is being represented to the American people. So what does that total?  $2.1 trillion. So a bill that this leadership says is $891 billion—it’s not $891  billion. It’s $2.1 trillion. And at a time  in which, as the gentleman was talking  about, small businesses are struggling  to keep their doors open—in my district—and I think the gentleman’s district as well—small businesses play a  huge part  in creating  jobs. Who  is  going to pay this $2.1 trillion? Because  the taxes that they’re talking about  collecting only pay for a bill that costs  $891 billion, but this bill costs $2.1 trillion.  Now here’s the other thing that people have looked at: this bill mandates,  as both of my friends know, mandates  that every American have health insurance. And in fact, if you don’t, there is  a penalty for it. So one of the things,  people say that if the government is requiring to you do something to pay for  health care or to have health care, and  there is a penalty for doing it, it becomes a tax or a cost. Some people who  have kind  of  calculated what  that  means for the economy, GDP and overall, said maybe that’s a $4 trillion number. So possibly what we are looking  at, if we shed light on this bill, as we  should, that really the impact of this is  that it’s a $6 trillion piece of legislation.  Now I don’t know about you, but I  think the American people think that  whether it’s $2 trillion or $6 trillion or  even $891 billion that we should have  had more debate than we did on this  bill. As my colleagues will remember  on the day that we passed this bill,  very  little debate was—I  think one  amendment—there was one amendment  to a $2 trillion—to a $6 trillion bill was  allowed.  These are the kinds of things that  cause me to say, Mr. President, we  have to hit the pause button here because we’re talking about something  that impacts families all across America. We have some numbers here that  are big. We are now spending money  that we don’t have. Every dollar that  the government spends, they have to  go out and borrow nearly 40 cents of  that  from people,  like  in China and  Japan; and  it  is not a  sustainable  thing. Yet now we’re talking about  more taxes and I think potentially bigger deficits because we’ve not had good  discussions on this bill.  Now I will yield some additional time  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania to  reflect on these important issues again.  ",2010
37,86,2010-01-13,Mr. THOMPSON  of Pennsylvania.,"  Well, I thank my good friend for yielding. I just want to come back. You hit  on such an incredible point about the  individual mandate to purchase health  insurance. Now I wouldn’t consider myself in any way a constitutional scholar. I’m just an American and a citizen.  But my good friend here has a copy of  the Constitution. And as I’ve read in  the version of the Constitution that I  carry around, which is about 28 pages,  I think that was put together by some  really smart people a long time ago  that has withstood the test of time.  And really our Constitution has become a model for other countries and  emerging countries to base their governing principles on. But to the best of  my knowledge, I can’t recall that there  is anything in that Constitution that  provides a basis  for Congress mandating that every individual American  in this country purchase health insurance.  I will yield to the gentleman with the  pocket Constitution there to just see  what his thoughts are on that.  ",2010

41,100,2010-01-13,Ms. SCHWARTZ.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor and congratulate the Honorable  Hyland R. Johns on the occasion of his retirement after 36 years of faithful service to the  borough of Bryn Athyn, a close-knit community  northeast of Philadelphia. I am honored to represent Mayor Johns and the entire Bryn Athyn  community in Congress.  Before being elected to Bryn Athyn borough  council in 1971, Mr. Johns served both as a  volunteer with the Bryn Athyn Fire Company  and as borough zoning officer. He was elected  to the borough council in 1971 and one year  later became vice president. Mr. Johns held  the position of vice president until 1975 when  he became borough council president. His  service as president lasted for nine years until  he was elected mayor. During his tenure as  mayor, the borough of Bryn Athyn prospered.  Bryn Athyn is home to the Bryn Athyn Cathedral, Cairnwood, and Glencairn Museum.  Under Mr. Johns’ leadership, the historic district of Bryn Athyn—which contains these local  landmarks—was officially designated a National Historic Landmark. As Mayor, Mr. Johns  served as a charming, enthusiastic, informed  ambassador to neighboring residents, communities, businesses, organizations, and leaders  in the region, sharing the unique significance  of Bryn Athyn’s architecture and religious heritage.  Before his career as a  local official, Mr.  Johns faithfully served his country during the  Second World War in the Navy’s Construction  Battalion. Mr. Johns went on to earn a graduate degree in Urban Forestry from Michigan  State University. He is an active member of  his church, has served on  the board of  the  Academy of the New Church, and serves on  the board of the Pennypack Ecological Restoration Trust. Under Mayor Johns’ leadership,  the Academy of the New Church has continued  to expand, with  the Mitchell Performing  Arts Center opening in 2002.  Madam Speaker,  once  again  I  applaud  Mayor Johns  for his dedication, service and  accomplishments as an elected official  for  nearly four decades. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to him on the momentous occasion of his retirement from public office.  f  IN HONOR OF CAPTAIN LUTHER H.  SMITH,  JR.,  U.S.  ARMY  AIR  FORCES  HON. JOE SESTAK  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 13, 2010  ",2010
42,100,2010-01-13,Mr. SESTAK.," Madam Speaker, I would like  to honor today the memory of a great American hero, Captain Luther H. Smith, Jr., U.S.  Army Air Forces, who will be buried with full  military honors in Arlington National Cemetery  on Friday, 15 January. Captain Smith was one  of  the original Tuskegee Airmen, a highly  decorated World War II prisoner of war, a recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal, the  first  African-American  aerospace  engineer  hired by General Electric  in  its Missile and  Space Operations  in Philadelphia, a  loving  husband and father, and a longtime resident  of Villanova, PA.  Captain Smith was born  in Des Moines,  Iowa  on September  27,  1920. His  early  dreams to serve as a military aviator were fulfilled when he joined the U.S. Army Air Forces  and began  training at Alabama’s Tuskegee  Army Air Field and Tuskegee Institute. One of  the  first African Americans  to become a  licensed pilot, Captain Smith began his military  career in 1943. He flew 133 combat missions  with  the 332nd Fighter Group as a combat  fighter pilot over Europe. He was severely  wounded on his last mission on Friday, 13 October 1944, and spent the next seven months  in enemy hospitals and prison camps before  being  liberated  in May 1945 by  the Allied  forces. During his distinguished military career,  Captain Smith destroyed 2 German aircraft in  aerial conflicts and 10 aircraft in ground strafing attacks. Captain Smith was awarded the  Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with  6 Oak Leaf Clusters,  the Purple Heart,  the  Prisoner of War Medal, and 8 European Theater Campaign Ribbons.  After retiring from the U.S. Army Air Forces,  Captain Smith completed his engineering education at the University of Iowa, earning a B.S.  in mechanical engineering. He was hired by  General Electric where he was  involved  in  projects for the Air Force, the Navy Submarine  Command, and NASA. His work included missile and jet engine design and he published  numerous papers and was awarded two patents.  Following his retirement from GE in 1988,  Captain Smith was active in support of local  civic causes, serving as the vice-chairman of  the Radnor Township (PA) School Board and  on  the Board of  the Delaware County (PA)  Community College.  He also was  instrumental  in capturing  the  history  of  the  Tuskegee Airmen—so  that  present and future generations of Americans  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

43,107,2010-01-13,Mr. CARSON of Indiana.," Madam Speaker, I  rise  today  to honor Mr. Rod Morgan, a remarkable  jurist  from  Indiana’s 7th Congressional District, who recently became the first  African American to serve as president of the  Indiana State Bar Association. I applaud Mr.  Morgan for this monumental achievement.  Currently a partner at Bingham McHale LLP  in Indianapolis, Mr. Rod Morgan’s legal career  has been vast and varied. His career has  touched upon nearly every aspect of jurisprudence from serving as an Army Judge Advocate General, to acting as a legal advisor to  numerous military and political  leaders,  to  teaching law and writing scholarly papers. Mr.  Morgan is also an active member of the community, serving on numerous boards and associations, recently serving as president of the  Indianapolis Black Chamber of Commerce and  chairman of  the Partnership  for Affordable  Housing. His election as president of the Indiana State Bar Association marks yet another  milestone in an exemplary career.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Mr. Rod Morgan and wishing him the  best of luck in his latest endeavor.  f  IN HONOR AND REMEMBRANCE OF  ELIZABETH JOYCE COSSER  HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 13, 2010  ",2010
44,107,2010-01-13,Mr. KUCINICH.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today in honor and remembrance of Elizabeth  Joyce Cosser, lovingly known as ‘‘Nan’’ treasured grandmother of my wife, Elizabeth, and  dearest mother and matriarch.  Mrs. Cosser was born  in 1923 and spent  her childhood in the beautiful, rolling farmlands  of Nottinghamshire and  later South Downs,  England. Nan’s unyielding love for the natural  world, great joy of learning, deep commitment  to family and sense of service to others was  deeply rooted in her childhood. Moreover, Nan  was raised to believe that girls were just as  worthy as boys, and her fierce independence,  courage and outspokenness shone throughout  her life—and began during an era when women’s rights and opportunities were still non-existent. A  trailblazer  in so many ways—Nan  was a  feminist and environmentalist before  those words existed in the world’s consciousness.  As a young woman, Nan ventured out on  her own, eventually leaving home to become  a nurse. During WWII, Nan’s  family homestead, Blackcap Farm, was destroyed by Canadian Troops who  leveled  the countryside  with rounds and mortars during training maneuvers. At that same time, Nan worked as a  nurse, tending to wounded soldiers amidst air  raids and heaving bombing,  in Brighton and  the East End. After  the war, Nan continued  her chosen vocation of nursing, specializing in  delivering babies. She became a community  midwife, and delivered 1,265 babies, including  Elizabeth, her namesake and granddaughter.  Nan coveted nature, and was on the forefront of the green movement and animal rights  causes.  In  her  spare  time, Nan  planted  trees—thousands of trees. To this day, thick  groves of chestnut, oak, buckeye and hazelnut  trees grow along the country paths in Belhus  Woods in Essex—all planted by Nan.  Nan taught by example, instilling in her children and grandchild a true love and respect  for the earth and for each other. Beyond her  love of gardening, Nan spent time with family  on numerous outdoor adventures. She guided  her grandchildren  through  the  countryside,  gathering berries which she later transformed  into pies, jams, wine and even vodka. Her artistic talents and interests were extensive and  varied; Nan excelled at painting, embroidery,  knitting and pottery, and her adventurous spirit  led  her  to  journey  to  places  around  the  world—researching  the history of  the culture  wherever she went.  Nan combined her love of history and art,  creating beautiful works depicting momentous  eras and  individuals  in world history. Nan’s  keen  interest  in England’s royal  lineage  led  her  to embark on an extensive project  in  which she researched every king and queen in  England, dating back 1,000 years. Her  research then inspired her to create an incredible series of pottery busts reflecting, in detail,  the likeness and aura of royalty dating back  one thousand years!  Madam Speaker and Colleagues, please  join me in honor and recognition of Elizabeth  Joyce  ‘‘Nan’’ Cosser, whose kind and generous  heart  drew  others  to  her.  Nan’s  strength, integrity, and love for the world and  its  inhabitants, will  forever  live within  the  hearts of all us who knew and loved her well,  and will forever reflect from the branches and  leaves of the towering oak and chestnut trees  along  the English countryside—forever connecting us all in the cycle of life.

45,107,2010-01-13,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Madam Speaker,  Our nation is faced with more major issues,  and is more divided over how we should handle  those  issues,  than at any  time  I have  served in Congress.  These issues include matters of national security,  financial security, economic security,  and the future of our health care system. Last  November, I asked residents of the 10th Congressional District I have the privilege to represent  to share  their  thoughts with me on  these and many other pressing  issues. To  date, more than 31,500 have responded to my  survey which included 26 questions on a wide  range of legislative matters. In addition, almost  half of those who responded provided some  very helpful additional comments about other  matters of interest to them. In order to certify  the accuracy of the results, I had an outside  firm  tabulate  the  surveys before  returning  them to me to review the comments.  Madam Speaker,  following my  remarks,  I  will  include  for  the benefit of my colleagues  the complete results of my Town Hall by Mail  survey. As we return for the Second Session  of this 111th Congress and begin debate on  these many difficult  issues,  I  think  they will  find these results of special interest.

The Blue  Ridge Council celebrated its 86th year of serving the youth of Upstate South Carolina and  the national Boy Scouts of America organization celebrated its centennial. The Boy Scouts  of America organization was founded on principals set forth to shape and mold boys into  young men. Learning  to become mentally  awake, physically strong and morally straight  are key to the development of loyal patriots  and  the Boy Scouts of America have  long  since been instrumental in the lives of many  young men.  f  TRIBUTE TO SALLY WINSHIP,  R.D.H., M.S., ED.D.  HON. DENNIS MOORE  OFKANSAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 13, 2010  ",2010
47,114,2010-01-13,Mr. MOORE of Kansas.," Madam Speaker,  before my election to the House of Representatives, I served for several years as an elected member of  the board of  trustees  for  the  Johnson County Community College in Overland Park, Kansas. This excellent community  college is the crown jewel of my home community, and I was very proud to be associated  with this outstanding institution of higher education.  During my board service, I got to know Dr.  Sally Winship who served as dean of the College’s Continuing Education and Community  Services. This month, Dr. Winship is retiring  after working as a community college educator  and administrator for 37 years. She retires as  vice president of  the College’s Workforce,  Community and Economic Development Department, and has also served as president of  the JCCC Center  for Business and Technology.  Sally was originally trained as a dental hygienist and became coordinator of the JCCC  program before becoming assistant dean of  the Science, Health Care and Math Division in  1987. She received her B.S. degree from Armstrong State College, and then obtained her  M.S. degree  from Columbia University, and  her doctorate in education from the University  of Kansas.  During Sally’s time at the college, the outstanding Regnier Center for Technology and  Business was designed, built, and opened.  Her responsibilities included managing over 60  full-time staff and 550 part-time faculty, as well  as managing programs serving over 155,000  participants and 480 area businesses.  Sally worked hard  to make  the Johnson  County Community College this area’s workforce development  resource  for  the greater  Kansas City business community. During her  time at the college, it grew in student population,  course  offerings,  campus  buildings,  prestige and reputation.  Madam Speaker, I join Sally’s many friends  and colleagues in wishing her health, happiness, and prosperity  for  the next chapter of  her life, and in thanking her for her many, important contributions to our community.  f  IN MEMORY OF JAMES TERRELL  JORDAN  HON. MIKE ROSS  OFARKANSAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 13, 2010  ",2010
48,114,2010-01-13,Mr. ROSS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  honor the memory of James Terrell Jordan of  Monticello, Arkansas, who passed away on  December 27, 2009, at the age of 84. Having  fought  for  freedom  in World War  II, James  then committed his life to the people of Arkansas through public office for over five decades.  James was born in Drew County, Arkansas,  to his  late parents Alvin and Linnie Jordan,  and attended schools in Monticello and California. He was a member of  the 101st Airborne Division in World War II, serving as a  paratrooper  and  receiving  a Purple Heart  Medal.  Following  active  duty  on  the  frontlines,  James returned to serve his community beginning as Drew Country treasurer in 1956. He  then served as county judge for eight years  before becoming mayor of Monticello  for 17  years. Having also given his time and energy  to numerous agencies, councils and committees, James was awarded  the  ‘‘Man of  the  Year’’ award in 1985 from the Drew County  Chamber of Commerce.  James was elected to the Arkansas House  of Representatives in 1986 and served for 12  years. Representing District 92, he served on  the Committee on City, County and Local Affairs and the Committee on Public Transportation. His lifetime love of education led to his  eventual appointment to the University of Arkansas Board of Visitors by Governor Mike  Huckabee.  I had  the distinct privilege of serving with  James during my time in the Arkansas state  legislature and he was someone I respected  and trusted for sincere advice and counsel. As  an  admired  and  respected  public  officer,  James worked tirelessly to better the lives of  those around him.  James was well known  for  far more  than  being a member of the Greatest Generation  who committed himself to the state he loved  so much; he was also known to many as a  good friend and role model.  My thoughts and prayers and those of every  Arkansan are with his wife, Bonnie; two sons,  Terrell and Jerry; daughter, Cindy; his nine  grandchildren, eight great grandchildren and  the rest of his family and friends during this  difficult time. James will be profoundly missed  and the people of Arkansas are deeply grateful to his lifetime of exemplary effort and legacy of community service and leadership.  f  TRIBUTE TO MARIE LOUISE  ANDERSON GREENWOOD  HON. DIANA DeGETTE  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 13, 2010  ",2010
49,114,2010-01-13,Ms. DEGETTE.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor the extraordinary life and exceptional accomplishments of Mrs. Marie Louise Anderson Greenwood. On January 15,  2010, Mrs. Greenwood will be honored by the  Denver business community at  the 25th annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Business Social  Responsibility Awards where she will receive  the ‘‘Trailblazer Award’’ in recognition of her  tireless commitment to education, community  and moving beyond racial barriers.  She was born in Los Angeles, California on  November 24, 1912, the only daughter of Joseph and Sarah Anderson. In search for better  opportunities, her  family moved  to Denver,  Colorado, where Marie attended Denver West  High School. Marie graduated  third  in her  class in 1931 and received an honorary four-  year state scholarship which she used to attend the Colorado Teachers College, now The  University of Northern Colorado. As an African  American student, Marie  faced  racism and  was prevented from living on campus or joining  student  organizations.  However,  she  sought membership in the Alpha Kappa chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, the first national sorority founded for college educated African American women, and  solidified her  commitment to education.  Marie excelled at  the Colorado Teachers  College. She was recruited to teach in Denver  Public Schools in 1934, a year before she was  slated to graduate. Despite the opportunity to  be the first African-American teacher in Denver Public Schools, Marie chose instead to finish her studies and graduate with the class of  1935. With a Bachelor of Arts degree in Elementary Education in hand, Marie was hired  as the first to receive a probationary contract  as a first grade teacher in the school system.  In 1938, she accepted the offer of permanent  tenure at Whittier Elementary School as  the  first  teacher of color  in  the Denver Public  Schools.

This  amendment would achieve all of the  same objectives of the Conrad-Gregg  amendment but with one exception,  and this is an important exception. In  the amendment I just offered, there are  no fast-track procedures for consideration  of  the  commission’s  recommendation. Thus, for Senators who  want to have a commission consider  our fiscal situation and report back to  us, this is your alternative. But this alternative would protect the rules of the  Senate and the prerogatives of the Senators. I urge my colleagues to support  this alternative.  I yield the floor.  ",2010

58,12,2010-01-25,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President,  I  want to speak for a few minutes about  the upcoming  confirmation vote on  Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve Board. I should begin by stating  very clearly that there is no way to  overestimate the severity of the economic downturn  that began  in  this  country in 2007. To date, our Nation  has lost 7.2 million jobs. In my home  State of New Mexico, unemployment is  now 7.8 percent. That  is more than  twice the rate it was 2 years ago. But  even at that it is considerably lower  than the unemployment rate in many  States—in fact, in a majority of States.  American households have  lost $12.6  trillion in wealth; more than 5 million  American  families  have  seen  their  homes foreclosed, many have lost their  businesses, and many have lost their  farms. In short, there are millions of  families across our country who are  and have been experiencing severe economic pain and dislocation. While indicators suggest the recession has officially ended, our economy is hardly out  of the woods.  In the face of such pain, it is tempting to grasp for ways to demonstrate  disapproval of the economic downturn  or to put distance between ourselves as  elected officials and the policies  involved with the economic downturn. It  is tempting, particularly in this political climate, to want to seize on a particular individual to take the brunt of  the criticism.  I rise today to urge my colleagues  not to use Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke’s renomination for any  such exercise. I rise to offer my strong  support  for his reconfirmation. With  the benefit of hindsight, it now seems  the Fed might have done more to prevent  the  economic downturn. Some  have pointed to  financial  institution  bailouts and have argued that the Fed  should not have provided financial support or guarantees to vulnerable financial  institutions. Some have argued  that  the Fed’s  support  should have  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:52 Mar 31, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\S25JA0.REC S25JA0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010
59,19,2010-01-25,Ms. CANTWELL.," Mr. President,  I  rise today along with my colleagues,  Senator LEAHY and Senator MURRAY,  to express support for the confirmation  of Professor Rosanna Peterson.  Professor Peterson has been nominated to be a U.S. District Judge for  the Eastern District of Washington. I  have no doubt that she will be an excellent Federal judge.  It  is  important to ensure that all  branches of our government, including  the judiciary, reflect diversity. If confirmed, Professor Peterson would be  the first woman to serve on the U.S.  District Court for the Eastern District  of Washington.  Rosanna Peterson is currently an Assistant Professor of Law at Gonzaga  University. She teaches Evidence, Federal Jurisdiction, and Trial Advocacy.  She  also  runs  the  law  school’s  externship  program. Previously,  she  worked as an attorney in private practice at a number of Spokane law firms.  She also clerked for U.S. District Court  Judge Fred Van Sickle, whom she will  now replace.  Professor Peterson has long been recognized by her peers for her intellect,  dedication to the law, and commitment  to equal justice.  She has been an active member of  Washington State’s legal community,  having served as President of the Federal Bar Association for Eastern Washington,  President  of  Washington  Women Lawyers State Bar Association  and President of the Spokane County  Washington Women Lawyers Bar Association.  I urge the Senate to confirm Professor Peterson this afternoon.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2010

I congratulate our distinguished colleague, Senator SPECTER,  as he is about to cast his 10,000th vote  as a Senator. He is only the 30th Senator to reach this number of five digits.  I have known Senator SPECTER for  more than a quarter of a century. I  have read his book. The book on his  life is a remarkably impressive travel  through his political career. He was a  crime fighter as a district attorney. As  far as lawyers go, the Specter genes are  pretty good. The largest judgment in  the history of the State of Nevada was  a judgment his son received. His son is  a  prominent  trial  lawyer.  Nevada  knows the Specter name  from more  than Arlen.  Arlen has always been a man of  honor and integrity and a tremendous  public servant. The State of Pennsylvania, of course, is home to some of our  Nation’s most significant political history—the Declaration of Independence  and the Constitution were drafted in  Senator SPECTER’s hometown of Philadelphia. No one has served that State  longer than Senator SPECTER.  I  congratulate my  friend ARLEN  SPECTERon making this historic milestone.  It  will make  Pennsylvania  proud. No one with whom I have served  in the Senate has a better legal mind  than ARLENSPECTER. We always look  to him when there is a complex legal  issue to give one of his renown statements.

69,26,2010-01-25,Mrs. LINCOLN.," Mr. President, today  I recognize Boone and Newton Counties, in my home State of Arkansas, for  their  efforts  to  create  communities  where children and their families have  access to healthy, affordable foods and  safe places to play and exercise. These  counties, through the North Arkansas  Partnership  for  Health  Education,  NAPHE,  recently  received a  $360,000  grant from the Robert Wood Johnson  Foundation’s  ‘‘Healthy Kids: Healthy  Communities’’ program.  The funding will help local officials  and organizations create policies that  encourage active lifestyles for children  and healthier eating habits for all residents in Boone and Newton Counties.  The project will create a walking path  to connect the south side of Lake Harrison to the schools and grocery stores  to the north and will develop a system  to deliver healthy foods to underserved  neighborhoods and more remote parts  of the counties.  According  to  Rick  Hinterthuer,  NAPHE executive director, ‘‘our community model  is extremely efficient  and effective. If we can do it in Harrison, it can be done in other places.  We reach our community best through  the Home Town Health Coalitions of  Boone and Newton Counties.’’  I have had the pleasure of visiting  the Boone County Hometown Health  Improvement Coalition. The program  is a model for the rest of the country  and illustrates how a community can  leverage its resources to address community health  issues  through  local,  State, regional and national partnerships.  As  chairman of  the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and  Forestry,  I have  fought  to  include  funding to provide meals to needy children during summer months, to secure  grants for States to modernize their  school lunch delivery systems, to improve health outcomes for infants participating in the WIC Program, and to  promote the health of young children  in early childhood settings.  I salute the good work going on in  Harrison and North Arkansas to help  keep our youngest citizens healthy.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO JAMES WILSON  ∑",2010
70,26,2010-01-25,Mr.  SANDERS.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to take a moment today to  recognize an armchair explorer who  never left the Northeast but brought  the world to the United States. In 1809–  1810 in the town of Bradford, VT, Mr.  James Wilson fashioned the first terrestrial and celestial globes made in  the United States. In doing so Mr. Wilson gave to all Americans an invaluable tool that would be used for centuries to come.  A self-taught and passionate cartographer, James Wilson started the first  geographic globe factory in Bradford.  He achieved such great success that  soon after he and his sons opened a second  factory  in Albany, NY. Wilson  Globes set the standard by which all  other globes were measured, achieving  such perfection that in 1827 he argued  to Congress there was no longer a need  to import them from abroad.  The accomplishments of James Wilson and his sons are treasured in the  picturesque town of Bradford. So much  so that the Bradford Historical Society  commissioned  the Williamstown Art  Conservator to repair the historical society’s Wilson globe—one of the few remaining in the world. Funds for this  project were received from across the  Nation.  Understandably,  the  town  takes great pride in this small piece of  history that they can call their own.  Although Mr. Wilson only ever saw a  few hundred miles of this great country, he was responsible for bringing the  world to most Americans. We applaud  James Wilson for the legacy he left us.  Furthermore, we applaud the Historical Society and town of Bradford for  recognizing Mr. Wilson’s  remarkable  gift and their dedication to preserving  the past for our future.∑  f  EXECUTIVE AND OTHER  COMMUNICATIONS  The following communications were  laid before the Senate, together with  accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as indicated:  EC–4312.

72,4,2010-01-29,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, following  leader remarks, the Senate will proceed to a period for the transaction of  morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes  each. There will be no rollcall votes  today. The next vote will occur at 5:30  p.m. on Monday, February 1. The vote  will be on the motion to invoke cloture  on the nomination of Patricia Smith to  be Solicitor  at  the Department  of  Labor.  I advise Senators  that  they  should be here to vote. We are not  going to extend the vote on Monday.  We must finish the vote about 10 to 6.  There will be a strict enforcement of  that time. We have to finish for obvious reasons because the 30 hours starts  running when we complete the vote. If  we go past 6 o’clock, it is past midnight. We want to make sure the vote  is over at 10 to 6. Everyone is forewarned that if they are late, they will  not be counted as voting.  f  SUCCESSFUL LEGISLATIVE WEEK  ",2010
73,4,2010-01-29,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, we had a  very successful week legislatively. I extend my appreciation to Senators on  both sides of the aisle, especially my  friends on the Republican side. There  were no 30 hours used. It worked out  extremely well. There was ample time  for debate, and there were issues that  were of concern to both parties. Of  course, the issues are important to the  country.  Without  belaboring  the  issues  on  which we voted, I wish to spend just a  minute on two issues—first, the pay-go  rules we passed.  The Presiding Officer has been a  great asset  to  the Senate. He has  worked with the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator CONRAD, and  others to focus on finances of our country. The Presiding Officer was a very  successful Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia and noted for what  he did with budgetary matters in Virginia.  Pay-go rules are so important. We  have rules now,  like people have  in  their individual homes. We are working  to do what people who work for a living  do, and that is spend money we have. It  is not as if we are inventing something  new. During the Clinton years, we had  pay-go rules. As a result of that, we  were able to spend less money than we  were taking in. For the first time in  decades, in the last 3 years of the Clinton administration, we paid down the  national debt by hundreds of billions of  dollars. So I hope, looking into the future, we can continue doing that; that  is, do it again. It is so important.  I extend my appreciation to Members  of the House of Representatives, especially the Speaker and the majority  leader, STENYHOYER. They have been  focused on this pay-go for more than a  year.  We were finally able to get it done  over here. It is going to be good for the  country. I think the things we did will  continue to focus on the money that  we do not have and the way we have to  get our budget in order. I am especially  happy we were able to give the doctors  5 years’ reprieve from the Draconian  rules  that were  facing doctors who  take Medicare patients.  The other issue I wish to spend a  minute on is last evening, again with  the cooperation of all Senators, we  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

76,1,2010-02-11,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, one  of the most gratifying things about  spending a good deal of time in the  Senate, as I have, is the optimism that  comes from seeing talent renew itself  year after year. I have had the good  fortune of having many talented staffers over the years, and the staff I have  now is an incredible group. But every  one of them will tell you that when  Kyle Simmons gets up from his tidy  desk and walks out of his office this  Friday, the office they return to on  Monday will be a very different place.  It has been said that no one is indispensable, and that may be true. But  few of us can imagine S–229 without  Kyle Simmons in it. So it will take  some adjusting. And part of that adjustment involves doing something this  week that Kyle never did. We are going  to speak well of him. We are going to  talk about his many virtues. We are  going to make him a little uncomfortable. Because every single person on  my staff knows what it’s like to be singled out for a good piece of work, or for  going above and beyond the call of  duty; everybody, that  is, except our  chief of staff. Now it is our turn.  The first thing to say about Kyle is  that he is humble. And that is really  saying something in this town. Most  people in Washington look in the mirror in the morning and think they see  a  future President. Not Kyle.  If he  looks in the mirror at all in the morning, I would imagine that what he sees  is the son of a Baptist minister who  was blessed with a privilege he didn’t  seek and who has tried to earn that  privilege every single day, regardless of  how well he did the day before. As he  used to tell his father, ‘‘Dad, I’m always just one mistake away from looking for a job.’’  He had a modest upbringing. But he  excelled at everything. One day when  Kyle was about 10 years old, he made  his way over to the Tate’s Creek public  golf course and picked up a club. Soon  The Senate met at 2:30 p.m. and was  called to order by the Honorable AL  FRANKEN, a Senator from the State of  Minnesota.  PRAYER  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:  Let us pray.  Eternal God, You are present with us  in light and shadows. Keep our Senators responsive to Your light as they  seek to please You in all they say and  do. Lord, remind them that You are  available to support and sustain them  in all situations. Give them the ability  to grasp sufficient truth to fulfill Your  purposes on Earth and to glorify Your  name. Fill  them with Your power,  transforming them into instruments of  Your love and grace.  We pray in Your holy Name. Amen.  f  PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE  The Honorable ALFRANKEN led the  Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:  I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the  United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God,  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  f  APPOINTMENT OF ACTING  PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE  ",2010

79,8,2010-02-11,Mr. DURBIN.," Madam President, it is  so interesting to notice the change of  approach. When President Bush was in  office and we were fighting terrorism,  Democrats would come to the floor and  question interrogation and prosecution  and be reminded over and over again by  the Republican side of the aisle that we  were literally interfering with national  security and the authority of the Commander  in Chief. I took those criticisms lightly because we do have a responsibility in Congress to speak out  as a separate branch of government if  we disagree with the Executive. Now to  hear the other side, they have completely switched their position. Now  they believe it is fair game to question  the decisions that are being made on a  daily basis by this President of the  United States relative to our national  security.  What my friend from Missouri, who  has every right to come to the floor  and speak his mind representing his  State, has  failed to mention  is one  basic  fact: Since  9/11,  195  terrorists  have  been  convicted  in  article  III  courts in the United States of America.  Decisions were made by Republican  President George W. Bush to prosecute  suspected  terrorists  in  article  III  courts, and, yes, that would  involve  Miranda warnings because  they believed  that was  the most  effective  place to try them.  There was an alternative, so-called  law-of-war approach, to use military  commissions. How many of these suspected terrorists were actually tried  before military commissions since 9/11?  Three. Madam President, 3 have been  convicted before military commissions,  195 in the courts of our land.  Now come the Republicans to say: We  want to stop any conviction  in any  criminal court in America. We believe  the people should only be convicted by  military commission.  I take a different view. I believe this  President, this Attorney General, and  all of the people involved in national  security should have the options before  them: Use the best forum available to  bring out the facts and to result in a  conviction.  Do I fear our court system will be  used by these alleged terrorists? They  may try. They have not had much  luck. When Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-  called 19th 9/11 terrorist, was tried in  Virginia,  I  don’t  think  it  changed  America  one  bit.  I  don’t  think  it  changed the way we live and the security we have. Incidentally, he was convicted and is serving a life sentence in  a supermax prison, one of our Federal  penitentiaries.  Those who argue  that we  should  never consider it ignore the obvious.  Look at the list of terrorists convicted  in Federal courts aside from Zacarias  Moussaoui: Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center  bombing; Omar Abdel Rahman, the so-  called Blind Sheik; the al-Qaida sleeper  agent Ali Al-Marri from my State of Illinois, where he was  arrested; Ted  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:15 Feb 12, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A11FE6.013 S11FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2010

84,15,2010-02-11,Mr. REID., That is true.  ,2010
85,15,2010-02-11,Mr. MCCONNELL.,"  I would suggest  another way to resolve the  issue.  I  would ask that with respect to the  House message on the CJS appropriations bill, that the motion to concur  with an amendment be the Baucus-  Grassley amendment which was filed  earlier today.  I know my friend and colleague is  going  to  offer  some  scaled-down  version of that shortly. But if we offered  instead  the  Grassley-Baucus  amendment which was  filed  earlier  today, that would include the unemployment extension. That was one of  the features of that Baucus-Grassley  amendment.  So if this consent were granted, it  would allow us to work on that package rather than the version that the  leader of the majority is going to offer  here shortly that includes only four of  those provisions.

The Energy Star Program is jointly  managed by the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Energy to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas  emissions. This program encourages many  facets of energy efficiency. In order to  attain the Energy Star Rating, schools  must score in the top 25 percent under  EPA’s national rating performance system.  At a time when the United States  leads the world in energy consumption  and  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases,  South Union Elementary is serving as  a role model for schools across the Nation. Under the guidance of the Des  Moines School District, South Union  became an Energy Star Partner in May  2008. South Union has reduced its energy consumption, operating costs, and  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Simple  measures such as turning off  lights,  computers, and convenience appliances  have made a big difference.  It is important that we recognize the  accomplishments of  schools  such as  South Union Elementary. Along with  helping the environment, South Union  is  also  saving  the  school  district  money. During these tough economic  times, with school budgets under extreme pressure, this is more important  than ever. Just as important, these energy conservation actions by the South  Union Elementary community instill a  strong sense of environmental and natural resource stewardship. South Union  Elementary’s students, teachers, and  staff are fostering excellent habits of  conscientious citizenship.  South Union Elementary has proven  that simple changes in daily practices  can make a big difference. By setting  attainable goals and being persistent,  this  school community was able  to  make significant improvements.

101,22,2010-02-11,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I would  like to take a moment to congratulate  Windsor Elementary School  in Des  Moines, IA, which was granted the Energy Star Rating in recognition of its  achievements and practices in energy  conservation.  The Energy Star Program is jointly  managed by the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Energy to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas  emissions. This program encourages many  facets of energy efficiency. In order to  attain the Energy Star Rating, schools  must score in the top 25 percent under  EPA’s national rating performance system.  At a time when the United States  leads the world in energy consumption  and  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases,  Windsor Elementary  is serving as a  role model for schools across the Nation. Under the guidance of the Des  Moines School District, Windsor became an Energy Star Partner in May  2008. Windsor has reduced its energy  consumption,  operating  costs,  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Simple  measures such as turning off  lights,  computers, and convenience appliances  have made a big difference.  It is important that we recognize the  accomplishments of  schools  such as  Windsor Elementary. Along with helping the environment, Windsor is also  saving the school district money. During these tough economic times, with  school budgets under extreme pressure,  this is more important than ever. Just  as important, these energy conservation actions by the Windsor Elementary community instill a strong sense  of environmental and natural resource  stewardship.  Windsor  Elementary’s  students, teachers, and staff are fostering excellent habits of conscientious  citizenship.  Windsor Elementary has proven that  simple changes in daily practices can  make a big difference. By setting attainable goals and being persistent,  this  school community was able  to  make significant improvements. I offer  my sincere congratulations to everyone at Windsor Elementary School for  their commitment to energy efficiency  and conservation.

The  Intelligence Committee unanimously  approved the nomination by voice vote  on December 10, 2009.  The Under Secretary of Intelligence  and Analysis leads the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security, which is  among the youngest elements of the  U.S. intelligence community. The main  responsibilities of the Office are to ensure that information related to homeland security threats is (1) collected,  analyzed, and disseminated to homeland security customers in the Department, at the State, local, and tribal  levels; (2) shared as appropriate with  private sector entities; and (3) provided  to other intelligence community agencies.

111,4,2010-02-24,Mr. PENCE.," Well,  tomorrow  the  White House will convene a so-called  summit on health care reform. It’s supposedly an effort  to  find bipartisan  agreement and consensus on reform.  And frankly, if the administration and  Democrats in Congress were willing to  scrap the bill and start over with a  clean sheet of paper, I would be all for  it.  The American people long for health  care reform that will lower the cost of  health care insurance without growing  the size of government. But that is not  what’s  happening  here.  Instead  of  scrapping the bill, the President’s actually produced his own bigger, worse  version of the bills that passed the  House and Senate and then were summarily rejected by the American people: more spending, more taxes, more  government, and coverage for abortion.  Instead of starting over, Democrats  in Congress continue to threaten to  abuse the very rules of this institution  by passing some version of their health  care reform bill by a simple majority  in  the Senate—known  as  reconciliation.  Tomorrow’s summit is looking more  and more like a taxpayer-funded media  event designed to set up passage of  ObamaCare 2.0. The American people  deserve to know it.  f  b1030  THE PRESIDENT’S PROPOSAL ON  HEALTH CARE REFORM  (Mr. PIERLUISI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2010
112,4,2010-02-24,Mr. PIERLUISI.," Mr. Speaker, I support health care reform, but I do not  support the proposal put  forward by  the White House, because it mistreats  4.4 million Americans living in Puerto  Rico and the other U.S. territories.  They are treated like second-class citizens.  My loyalty to my party and to our  President is beyond question, but my  principles and my people come first.  This proposal violates my principles,  and it mistreats my people.  In Puerto Rico, the Federal Government pays less than 25 percent of the  cost of providing Medicaid  services.  That is a national travesty. The House  took important steps to mitigate this  disparity  in  funding. Yet the White  House proposal does not make a good-  faith effort to address this inequality.  Moreover, the proposal excludes Puerto  Rico from the exchange but allows noncitizen residents of the States to participate. This is discrimination, and it  is no way to treat one’s fellow Americans.  I do not believe this proposal reflects  the President’s thinking, and I cannot  believe my colleagues will allow it to  stand. The people of Puerto Rico and  the other territories fight proudly for  their country. Their country should  fight for them, too.  WHERE ARE THE JOBS?  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2010
113,4,2010-02-24,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, this administration and Democrats  in Congress  don’t seem to have an answer to the  single most important question workers across  the  country are asking:  ‘‘Where are the jobs?’’ The American  people don’t want more political pandering on the economy and health care;  they want action now that will control  runaway Federal spending and create  jobs.  The third time is not the charm, Mr.  President.  When  government-controlled health care was introduced in  the House, the American people rejected  it. Strike one. When government-controlled health care was introduced in the Senate, the American people rejected it. Strike two. And when  the President puts his government control of health care on the table before  a bipartisan handful on Thursday, the  American people will reject that, too.  Strike three.  The Democrats need to scrap their  job-killing policies, like a government  takeover of health care and national  energy tax, and begin working with Republicans on commonsense solutions to  create jobs and reduce out-of-control  spending. It’s time we work together to  get this economy moving again and to  help put people back to work.  f  RECOVERY ACT IS WORKING  (Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  ",2010
114,4,2010-02-24,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, let me tell you, here are the  jobs.  I believe  if you polled across  America you would understand that  the investment that this Democratic  Congress made, along with its President, created or saved 3.5 million jobs,  gave 95 percent of American workers a  tax cut, and began to build our crumbling rail and water and a variety of infrastructure.  Where are the jobs? I will tell you, 2.4  million jobs were created according to  the Congressional Budget Office, nonpartisan, $120 billion in tax cuts to 95  percent of our working families and to  businesses, loaned nearly $20 billion to  our small businesses creating or saving  a job.  What I like most of all is the 300,000  jobs in education and the 400,000 jobs in  corrections officers and public health  personnel. Let’s ask all the firefighters  and  police  officers  across America  whether or not there were jobs.  Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that we  have invested in America. We had an  economy that wasn’t growing when we  came in, down some 6 percent. Now it’s  up. We have the jobs, and we are going  to do health care reform this morning  as well.  We are working  people.  for the American  f  ENACT TORT REFORM NOW  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2010
115,4,2010-02-24,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  the administration’s health care bill  fails to include a Republican solution  that could actually achieve savings for  patients—lawsuit abuse reform.  Forty percent of medical malpractice  suits against doctors and hospitals are  without merit, according to a study by  the Harvard School of Public Health.  And excess damages add $70 billion to  $126 billion annually to health care  costs, the Department of Health and  Human  Services  has  found.  These  costs, of course, are passed on to patients.  The administration has only  suggested a pilot program for tort reform.  But some States, including my home  State of Texas, have already enacted  tort reform. These States have seen insurance premiums fall and access to  medical care expand.  We don’t need a pilot program. We  need to enact medical malpractice lawsuit abuse reform.  f  HIGH-SPEED RAIL  (Mrs. HALVORSON asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2010
116,4,2010-02-24,Mrs. HALVORSON.," Where are  the  jobs? I think we can answer that every  time we speak. In my district it is happening quite literally.  Recently  I was very proud to announce $1.2 billion  in Recovery Act  funding being invested in Illinois for  high-speed rail lines from Chicago to  St. Louis. Two of the towns in my district happen to be stops along the rail  line—Joliet and Normal.  There are those who have said, and  continue  to  say,  that projects  like  these will not put people to work, that  the stimulus isn’t working. But here is  the reality: These high-speed rail lines  in Illinois alone are going to put 6,000  people to work. This wouldn’t have  been possible without the investment  in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  I am proud that the Recovery Act is  putting these people to work and putting our  communities back on  the  track to recovery. We must continue to  invest  in  American  infrastructure,  build upon the work of the Recovery  Act is doing, and continue working to  create jobs.

118,11,2010-02-24,Mr. DEFAZIO.," I thank the gentlelady  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, during this health care  debate over the last 6 months, we have  heard we should listen to our constituents. And you know, I did. I did 14 town  halls  in August, and they were attended by over 8,000 people. And there  was one item of agreement between the  extremes in the debate, between the  folks representing the tea party and  those representing single payer, and  that was consensus that this industry,  the health insurance industry, should  not enjoy a special exemption under  the law. They should not be able to  collude to drive up prices, limit competition, price gouge consumers. They  should play by the same rules as every  other industry in America. And this archaic exemption  from antitrust  law  passed in the 1940s should go to the  dustbin of history. There was  consensus on that.  Now come the Republicans, oh, wait  a minute, we are not protecting the industry, we don’t want to allow them to  still have antitrust exemption,  it  is  about  the  little guys.  It  is always  about the little guys, isn’t it? So let’s  give the little guys a loophole. And  oops, wait a minute, the big guys can  use the same loophole.  Now, the other thing I have heard is  let’s be bipartisan. Well, there is nothing much more bipartisan than the report of the Antitrust Modernization  Commission from April 2007. This was a  commission created by the Republican  Congress when  they controlled both  the House and  the Senate and  the  White House, with the members named  by President George Bush and the Republican leadership of Congress. They  came to the conclusion that this loophole  that  they are advocating here  today should not exist.  I will quote briefly from the conclusions of the bipartisan Republican-created commission. They said,  ‘‘A proposed exemption should be recognized  as a decision  to  sacrifice  competition’’—oops, I thought they were for  competition—‘‘and  consumer  welfare’’—I thought they were for the consumers—‘‘and should be allowed only if  Congress determines that a substantial  and significant countervailing societal  value outweighs  the presumption  in  favor of competition and  the widespread benefits it provides.’’  They go on to address their arguments and they say there are those  who will argue the small companies  that need aggregate data and all this,  they will need the safe harbor. They  say, no, actually not. This again is the  Republican-created commission. ‘‘Like  all potentially beneficial competitor  collaboration generally, however, such  data sharing would be assessed by antitrust enforcers and the courts under a  rule of reason analysis that would fully  consider the potential procompetitive  effects of such conduct and condemn it  only if, on balance, it was anticompetitive. Insurance companies would bear  no greater  risk  than  companies  in  other industries engaged in data sharing  and  other  collaborative  undertakings. To the extent that insurance  companies engage  in anticompetitive  collusion, however, they would then be  appropriately subject to antitrust liability.’’  They want to give a safe harbor that  is so big that the Justice Department  could never review it. They are objecting to the fact that the Justice Department might look at, investigate, the  activities surrounding data sharing and  potential  collusion  by  the  industry  that  continues  to  price-gouge  consumers and benefit unreasonably and  profit unreasonably. They want to create that loophole. That loophole is unnecessary.  If you adopt that loophole, we might  as well just not pretend that we care  about  consumers,  consumer welfare,  and that we are going to meaningfully  address this industry playing by the  same rules as every other  industry.  This industry should play by the same  rules as all others, plain and simple.  Americans  get  that. They  are not  happy with seeing their health insurance double every 10 years, or now it is  more on a doubling rate of 3 to 5 years.  They know that they are being taken  to the cleaners. They know the industry  is  trying  to  cherry-pick. They  know there is anticompetitive activity  going on. It is time for that to change.  No loopholes.  ",2010

121,11,2010-02-24,Mr. DOGGETT.," Mr. Speaker, for 65  years health insurance companies have  enjoyed a special  interest exemption  from laws prohibiting price fixing, bid  rigging, and carving up the insurance  market. Consumers’ health insurance  premiums go up, while coverage gets  worse and worse. In the past six years,  health  insurance premiums have  increased at a rate four times the increase in the average American worker’s wages.  Twenty-seven years ago, as a young  Texas State Senator, I authored the  Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust  Act. But one  industry, one  industry  among all others, was exempted because of this Federal law. So no action  could  be  taken  against  the  anticompetitive practices of one industry,  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:00 Feb 27, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\H24FE0.REC H24FE0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010
122,18,2010-02-24,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," I yield myself 1  minute.  Madam Speaker, let me say that I always appreciate what my colleagues  state on the House floor, and I appreciate their good comments during debate. To the extent that they want to  increase competition among insurance  companies and want to reduce insurance  premiums,  I  completely  agree  with them, but we should not think  that any of those comments or any of  those desires or any of those goals have  anything to do with the bill that we  are considering here today.  Once again, in case some of my colleagues missed it, let me read what the  Congressional Budget Office said about  this legislation. They said,  ‘‘Whether  premiums would increase or decrease  as a result (of this legislation) is difficult to determine, but in either case,  the magnitude of the effects is likely  to be quite small.’’ So this bill has no  point.  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman  from Wisconsin,  the  former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, ",2010
123,18,2010-02-24,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.,  ,2010
124,18,2010-02-24,Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.,"  Madam  Speaker,  listening to the arguments  that have been advanced by the proponents of the bill, all I can say is what  you hear is not what you are going to  get if this bill is enacted into law.  There is a reason this antitrust exemption has survived now for 65 years,  which is that it actually has encouraged  competition  because  it  allows  smaller insurers to use the actuarial  data that larger insurers are able to  amass. If the smaller insurers can’t get  this actuarial data, which is what will  happen if this bill is enacted into law,  then they will either be gobbled up by  the larger insurers, which get the data  in-house, or they will go out of business. As a result, there will be less  competition rather than more. So what  you hear today about competition is  not what you are going to get if this  exemption is repealed.  Now, repealing the  limited exemption  that health  insurance  carriers  have under the McCarran-Ferguson Act  is, at best, going to change little and,  at worst,  is  going  to  be  counterproductive. As the CBO concluded in  October,  repealing  the  exemption  would have little or no effect on insurance premiums because State laws already bar the activities that would be  prohibited under Federal  law should  the bill be enacted. Instead, additional  regulatory burdens on  insurers will  likely be passed on to the policyholders  in the form of higher premiums.  This, my friends, is the majority’s  higher health insurance premium bill  in the name of competition. It’s not  going to happen. The bill would subject  to new Federal enforcement a variety  of  ongoing  collaborative  practices  among health insurers which are currently permitted by the States because  they allow the small insurers to compete.  Now, shouldn’t we be for small insurers? Shouldn’t we be for having new  companies enter the market? This bill  will prohibit that.  Small insurance companies rely on  the data collected  from their  larger  competitors, and share it industrywide  in order to accurately set their rates.  However, this would be forbidden under  the bill. If small insurers can’t get the  data,  further consolidation  is  likely.  Small insurance will either merge to  gain a competitive edge or get swallowed up by the big insurance giants.  Again, the majority is putting together  an  insurance company consolidation  bill—less  competition  rather  than  more. Worse, a repeal could result in  the small insurers’ going out of business altogether. Meanwhile, for the big  insurance companies, the big, bad insurance companies with the means to  collect and analyze this data in-house,  it would simply be business as usual.  ",2010
125,18,2010-02-24,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  time of the gentleman has expired.  ,2010
126,18,2010-02-24,Mr. SMITH of Texas., I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.  ,2010
127,18,2010-02-24,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," This legislation attempts to solve a problem that  doesn’t exist.  First, there is no evidence that the  exemption has increased health insurance prices or profits or that it has  contributed  to  higher market  concentration. Second, the effort to repeal  McCarran-Ferguson is based on the belief that it allows individual insurers  to collude on prices and policy coverage.  State  laws prohibit  insurers  from  bid-rigging, price-fixing and market allocation to restrain competition. State  insurance regulators actively enforce  the prohibition in these areas, and this  legislation would  only  add  another  layer of Federal regulation and litigation to an industry that operates under  a  robust and well-established State  regulatory regime.  There are ways, however, to promote  competition  in the health  insurance  market. One change Congress should  consider is permitting individuals and  businesses to buy their health insurance policies from any willing provider  in any State. Under current law, an insurance firm registered in one State  may not cover individuals in another  without registering in the second State  and being subject to all its taxes and  laws. This raises the cost of doing business across State lines, and it prevents  many smaller or mid-sized companies  from entering the markets to compete.

129,18,2010-02-24,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," I thank  the chairman for yielding.  Madam Speaker,  last week  I was  shocked to learn that in the middle of  the great recession, which was caused  by the deregulation, hands-off policies  of the prior administration, and during  this time when families across my district and across the Nation are struggling with rising unemployment and  while health insurance companies have  recently announced that last year was  their best year on record as far as profits are concerned, $12 billion last year  in profits for the insurance industry,  and while that’s the case, they are announcing plans to raise insurance premiums by 40 percent in some markets.  During this time of hurt and pain and  also making money by the insurance  industry off these people who are hurting and  in pain, we are considering  today removing the antitrust exemption that insurance companies have enjoyed for over 60 years. And it’s time  for this protection and immunity from  antitrust law and this anticompetitive  behavior, it’s time for it to come to an  end.  This insurance industry which delivers health care to the people has been  broken for a long time. We all know it,  and it’s time to change it. And this is  a good place to change it. It will help  with competition if we pass this law  today. That will happen only  if we  start applying anticompetitive, antitrust legislation to the insurance industry. There’s simply no reason why  they should continue to benefit from  it.  Don’t listen as the health insurance  industry tries to tell you that they  can’t  live under the antitrust  laws.  Every other  industry does. It’s high  time that they do too. Consumers will  benefit, the economy will benefit, and  health insurance insurers who want to  compete honestly will too.  Let’s give struggling American families an honest health insurance market  by enacting this important bill.  ",2010

I would like to thank Chairman CONYERS, Congressman TOMPERRIELLOof  Virginia, Congresswoman BETSYMARKEYof Colorado, and others for their  leadership in bringing to the floor this  important bill aimed at creating greater competition in the health insurance  marketplace in order to promote greater affordability, improve quality, and  greater consumer choice.  In particular, I appreciate that the  bill is narrowly tailored to repeal the  McCarran-Ferguson antitrust  exemption only for the business of health insurance. But despite the clear wording  of the bill, I have heard concerns from  some that courts might somehow interpret the bill broadly to include nonhealth lines of insurance such as life  insurance,  long-term care  insurance,  disability income insurance, even property/casualty insurance.  As one of only two former State insurance  commissioners  in  the U.S.  House  of  Representatives,  I  know  health insurance is different than these  other insurance lines. I would appreciate, Mr. Chairman, your confirmation of my understanding that the bill  we are now debating does not apply to  any insurance except for health insurance, and your expectation that courts  will interpret it properly to not include  nonhealth lines of insurance.  Is the gentleman’s understanding of  my expectation correct?  ",2010

147,32,2010-02-24,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  support this motion to recommit on  H.R. 4626, the Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act. As I stated  in my earlier comments, this legislation does little, if anything. However,  if you are going to do nothing, you  might as well do it better.  This motion corrects three drafting  errors that create problems with the  bill. First,  it adds a definition  for  health insurers that was absent from  the base bill. If we are going to eliminate McCarran-Ferguson for a limited  subset of insurers, then we should clarify who those insurers are.  Second, this motion to recommit includes the exchange of data provision  that Mr. LUNGRENadded at the Judiciary Committee markup of a similar  bill.  It  is necessary  to ensure  that  small and medium health insurers can  in fact compete in the marketplace.  Third, the motion to recommit includes language that protects the rate  gathering and rate setting activities of  State insurance commissions. The majority assumes this will be protected by  the State action doctrine. But if Congress is going to repeal a 65-year-old  law, shouldn’t we make clear that we  do not want this to undermine State  insurance commissions?  Finally, the motion to recommit includes a GAO study on the impact of  this legislation on competition in the  health insurance market. Specifically,  the GAO must report on whether or not  this legislation has enhanced competition, resulting in lower prices and new  competitors in the market. Let’s put  political rhetoric aside and see what  the bill really does. We shouldn’t be  afraid of the truth.  In short, this motion to recommit includes  definitions  and  clarifications  that the majority has already included  in earlier versions of this legislation  that either were reported favorably by  the  Judiciary  Committee  or  were  passed by the  full House. This  isn’t  much of a bill, but let’s try to improve  what little there is.  I yield to the gentleman from California, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.  ",2010
148,32,2010-02-24,Mr. DANIEL E.," LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to  refer to that part of the motion to recommit that deals with the amendment that I offered and that was contained in the bill that passed out of the  Judiciary Committee. It simply allows  historical data to be utilized by insurance companies large and small. This is  something  that  is  requested by  the  small  insurance  companies,  this  is  something supported by the American  Bar Association. Their representative  who testified before our subcommittee  on behalf of or in support of the underlying legislation supported this amendment so that  in  fact small  insurers  would not be disadvantaged.  Let’s get this right. There are some  who have told me on the other side  that, well, we don’t need this because  it will be allowed by the U.S. Justice  Department or by the courts. We ought  not to wait for that. We ought to give  some real solid certainty to insurance  companies, particularly the small insurance carriers. So if we wish to permit the collection of historical data,  let’s make  it clear what we  intend.  Just because we haven’t brought forward on this floor some answer to the  medical malpractice litigation issue is  no reason for us to commit legislative  malpractice here. We ought to do our  job. We ought to not pass it on.  Now,  there are a  few people who  don’t think that historical data should  even be allowed. If that is the way they  feel, I understand it. Most Members I  have spoken to believe it ought to be  allowed. They understand the absolute  essence of it in terms of the continued  existence of small insurers across the  country.  Let’s get it right. I have the language  virtually the same that was contained  in the majority’s health care bill that  passed just a couple of months ago. It  is the same as contained in the bipartisan bill that came out of our committee. And most importantly, it is the  same language contained in the various  bills presented to this House by the  late great Jack Brooks, chairman at  that time of the House Judiciary Committee, about whom Members on the  other side have waxed eloquently. And  in tribute to him, I would hope they  would support the gentleman’s motion  to recommit that contains my amendment.  ",2010

152,32,2010-02-24,Mr. DEFAZIO.," I thank the Speaker.  Simple question before  the House  today. Should the health insurance industry live under the same antitrust  rules and have the same consumer protections as are provided for every other  major  industry  in America without  special exception, without carve-outs,  without loopholes? No more collusion  to get together, to conspire to limit  markets, coverage, and drive up rates.  The American people want and they  need this protection.  Now,  they  say  there  is  a  study  throughout that says this won’t save  money. That study was actually based  on the language they are offering. Yes,  if we provide these loopholes it well  may not bring down rates. But if we  don’t vote for their loopholes, we will  bring down rates. The Consumer Federation of America says we will save  $10 billion in ratepayer premiums next  year  if we  adopt  this  amendment  straight up without their loopholes.  With that, I yield to the gentleman  from California.  ",2010
153,32,2010-02-24,Mr. GARAMENDI.," Thank you.  Mr. Speaker, directly to Mr. LUNGREN’s proposed amendments, actually  there are three major elements. If you  look at those major elements, they do  in fact give the insurance industry the  opportunity to collude, because that is  the data that sets future prices for consumers as well as payments for doctors.  I know this business. I was the Insurance Commissioner in California for 8  years. And I know that if an insurance  company  is able  to collude  in collecting, compiling, classifying, or disseminating historic data and determining a loss development factor, and  finally, using actuarial services, they  have the power to collude. This is an  incredible loophole. It should never be  allowed.  And the final point having to do with  the insurance commissioners collecting  data, nowhere in any antitrust laws are  States precluded from any collection of  data. This ought not be put forth. I ask  for a ‘‘no’’ vote.  ",2010

157,39,2010-02-24,Mr. MORAN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker,  I am on the floor tonight to request  that President Obama include in tomorrow’s discussion at the health care  summit  the  issue  of medical malpractice  reform and defensive medicine—the kind of reform that will relieve Kansan  families  and  business  owners from facing higher health insurance premiums. We have to reduce  health care costs, and this is a commonsense way to do so. If we do not  control those costs, then any reform effort will fail, as the cost of health care  and, therefore, the cost of insurance  will increase.  Defensive medicine, where doctors  order every possible test under the sun  for fear of being sued, costs us more  than $650 billion each year, or 26 percent of our annual health care spending. These costs increase insurance premiums for doctors, and health care expenses simply get shifted to the patients.  Mr. President,  if you are  serious  about  improving  patient  care  and  about reducing costs, add medical malpractice reform to the agenda at your  health care summit tomorrow.  f  b1630  SPECIAL ORDERS  ",2010

161,39,2010-02-24,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  United States is reaching a bleak milestone in Afghanistan. The death toll  for our troops is now 996, or it was  when this paper was written. It is inevitable  that we will  reach  the  1,000  mark. How much further are we going  to go in this?  Under these circumstances the American people have the right to demand  that the Afghan Government do everything it can to stop violent extremism  in their country and to keep our troops  safe. So  far the Afghan Government  has not lived up to its responsibilities.  Our Ambassador in Afghanistan, Karl  Eikenberry, wrote a cable to the State  Department in November in which he  said that President Karzai ‘‘is not an  adequate strategic partner’’ and ‘‘continues to shun responsibility for any  sovereign  burden,  whether  defense,  governance, or development.’’ He also  wrote that when it comes to corruption, Karzai has a record of ‘‘inaction  and grudging compliance.’’  This is outrageous, Mr. Speaker, because this government corruption undermines our very efforts in Afghanistan and puts our troops at risk.  When the Afghan people see the corruption in their government, they ask,  and they should ask, Why should we  help the Americans defeat the Taliban  when our government isn’t any better  than the Taliban?  The Washington Post just recently,  well, yesterday, I think, revealed a deplorable example of the Afghan Government’s shady dealings. It was Monday that the article came out. It was  written by Andrew Higgins and entitled ‘‘Kabul Bank’s Sherkhan Farnood  Feeds Crony Capitalism  in Afghanistan.’’ The article described the cozy  relationship between the Afghan political elite and the Kabul Bank. The Afghan Government has poured tens of  millions of dollars of public money into  that bank. At the same time, the bank  has made  shady multimillion dollar  loans to members of President Karzai’s  family, his government, and his supporters to buy luxury villas in Dubai.  The article calls this  ‘‘a crony capitalism that enriches politically connected insiders and dismays the Afghan  people.’’  President Karzai’s older brother and  his former Vice President both have  Dubai villas, but  they’re  registered  under the name of Sherkhan Farnood,  the chairman of the bank. Presumably  this is done to hide the goodies that  the political big shots have gotten. The  bank has plenty of money, including  more than $1 billion in deposits from  Afghans. But ‘‘the vast majority of this  money flows into the hands of a tiny  minority, some of it through kickbacks  and insider deals’’—that’s from the article—for the country’s political, security, and business elites.  The bank also helped pay for President Karzai’s recent reelection campaign, which was filled with charges of  fraud. The bank’s support for Karzai  wasn’t surprising. Why should it be?  The bank is partly owned by Karzai’s  older brother and the brother of his  vice presidential running mate.  And at a time when most Afghans are  desperately poor, the Kabul Bank  is  spending $30 million to build a fancy  new headquarters.  Mr. Speaker, the American people  have a right to ask, Is this what our  soldiers are dying  for? Is this what  we’re spending tens of billions of our  tax dollars for? So that well-connected  elites in Afghanistan can enjoy luxury  villas in Dubai?  We cannot allow this to continue. I  have been demanding that we change  our mission in Afghanistan to focus on  SMART Security for a long time now.  One of the cornerstones of SMART Security is an emphasis on better governance. Improving governance in Afghanistan is just as important, Mr. Speaker,  as any military operation. Actually,  it’s more important.  That’s why President Obama must  insist that President Karzai and his  cronies clean up their act and do it  quickly. Without honest government,  we will never defeat violent extremism  in Afghanistan and the death toll for  our troops will not stop.  f  RECOGNIZING KANSAS STATE  UNIVERSITY’S PROUD CAMPAIGN  ",2010

163,39,2010-02-24,Mr. MORAN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise this evening to recognize Kansas  State University’s Proud campaign. K-  State Proud was founded in the fall of  2006 as an effort for students to help  other students. This year’s event will  be celebrated this Saturday, February  27, during the Missouri-Kansas State  men’s basketball game. This is a great  concept that reflects our Kansas values  of  family, community, and  stewardship.  There are many people who take college experience  for granted. Leaving  home to pursue an education is not a  given  for many  families.  Certain  amounts of financial, emotional, and  spiritual support are needed to ensure  a  student’s  success. Sometimes bad  things happen and students’ families  fall on hard  times. And  it’s heartbreaking to see a student’s dreams and  hard work  jeopardized by events beyond their control.  The K-State Proud  campaign was  started in an effort to keep these struggling students in school. It was started  by  students,  for  students. Students  continue to organize, plan, and execute  K-State Proud’s activities. This year’s  co-chairs  are  Anna  Zeiger,  Reed  Pankratz, and Robert Swift. That is  what makes  this  effort  so unique.  There are no benefactors or trust funds  paying an annuity that funds the tuition or living expenses for a struggling  student. This program allows  these  kids to collect money from their peers  and to distribute to those most in need.  As a society, we should take a step  back and look at what K-State Proud  has accomplished. They have had a  genuine  compassion  for  complete  strangers. They do more than pay lip  service to the concept of charity. They  put their money where their mouth is.  For a $10 donation, the donor receives a K-State Proud t-shirt to be  worn for the designated K-State basketball game.

165,46,2010-02-24,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, this  is a  very human  institution, and  it’s affected very much by our personal relationships  with  one  another.  Very  frankly, for the first 20 years that Jack  and  I  served on  the Appropriations  Committee, we were often adversaries.  There were some issues that we differed on. He was, as has already been  said, very much old school, and I was  more of a reformer.  In fact, when I ran for the chairmanship of the committee against a senior  member of the committee, Jack managed the campaign of my opponent and,  unfortunately, he did a pretty good job.  After  I was elected, we had pretty  much an arm’s-length relationship for  a couple of years.  But if you care about your country,  and you care about this  institution,  you swallow your differences and you  learn to work with everybody. Jack  and I soon had developed a solid working relationship, and we became allies  on a host of issues. One of our most important was our view of the war in Iraq  and how to get out of it; and another  was our concern about the dubiousness  of our continued  involvement  in Afghanistan if we didn’t have a better  ally in that government to rely upon.  We often talked together, and we  traveled together. We went to the Middle East together. We shared something special as well  in a different  place on this globe. A few years ago, he  and I and Dave Hobson and our staffs  became concerned about the visitors  center at Normandy. It was really pretty much of a cracker box affair, and it  was not at all fitting to the history of  that place. So we determined  that  there ought to be a new visitors’ center  at Normandy. With the three of us  working together with our staffs, that  visitors center was built.  Today, if you visit it—and it’s truly  beautiful—there is a little plaque behind that visitors center in front of a  small tree with the names of Murtha,  OBEYand Hobson on it. I know I am  proud of that, and I know Jack was  proud of that. I think it symbolizes  what happens in this place. Two people  who started out as adversaries became  reasonably good  friends, never  fully  agreeing, because no two people in this  place ever agree on everything, but we  had a solid working relationship.  I learned one thing about Jack a long  time ago. He had the courage of his  convictions, and he fought hard every  way he knew how  for those convictions, and he cared deeply about the  welfare of the men and women who  served in the Armed Forces and defend  this country’s freedom.  I am proud that at Normandy there is  that little note of the three of us having gotten together, all for one purpose, to honor the people who did so  much on those beaches to build and  preserve America’s  freedom and  the  freedom of the world.

167,46,2010-02-24,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I would like to take a bit different  tack because I met Chairman Murtha  for the first time in 1977 when I was an  associate staff on Appropriations. My  Member and my mentor, Adam Benjamin, Jr., was a member of the Appropriations Committee  that year. Mr.  Murtha, Mr. CARNEY, Mr. Benjamin and  others were instrumental in that year,  not only in that appropriations process, but in also establishing the Steel  Caucus, because they were very concerned about people who worked  in  their district.  What I took away as a staffer from  that relationship with Mr. Murtha is  the fact that he always treated me and  every other staff he came into contact  with with respect. He always heard  what I had to say and what other staff  had to say, whether, as Mr. OBEY implied, he always agreed with you or  not, and he always treated you very  professionally.  I had no conception during those 6  years working as a staff member that  the time would come that I would serve  as a colleague on the committee with  Mr. Murtha, would serve on the subcommittee,  and  would  be  blessed  enough to call him a friend. He was a  friend to every person he encountered.  He was a good friend to the people he  represented, because he was most concerned with those who worked hard,  who needed a job or who needed a hand  up.  Our country is much richer because  of that attitude that Mr. Murtha carried with him every day, and the world  is certainly a much better place than it  would have been had he not walked  among us.  The fact is, as far as his activities on  the Defense  subcommittee, and my  Member was a former marine as well, I  was always struck that while some  people are very  focused on weapons  systems, Mr. Murtha, while never losing sight of the big picture, was most  concerned about that individual man  or woman who was in the field, who  was risking their life and who was serving our country. As he would suggest,  operation and maintenance, how you  train, how you provide for their safety,  how you equip that person and their  family and those children was the most  important thing for him.  He taught me many valuable life lessons. I am a better person, and we are  all better people because of Mr. Murtha. He will be greatly missed, and I  deeply appreciate the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for this opportunity.  b1745  ",2010

170,53,2010-02-24,Ms. PELOSI.," Madam Speaker, I rise  to  join my  colleagues  to  sing  the  praises of a great man, Jack Murtha.  Many of us had the honor of calling  him colleague  in this Chamber, and  some of us here had the privilege of  calling him friend. And when he was  your friend, you had a true friend.  Last week, many of us traveled to  Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to see Jack  put to rest. It was wonderful to hear  the stories of the thousands of people  who showed up to pay their last respects to him in Johnstown, the people  he knew so well, cared about so much,  fought for in this Chamber. His family  was gathered and surrounded by their  loved ones and people. The  former  President of the United States, Bill  Clinton, was there, the Secretary of  Defense was there, the chairman of the  National Security Council was there,  representatives of the President’s cabinet, and planeloads of his colleagues  who came from Washington or drove  from home.  At  that  time we  laughed and we  cried, and we tried to understand why  this had happened. Jack’s wife Joyce,  who is very strong, said to me, ‘‘Jack  would have wanted  it this way. He  went out at the top of his game.’’  Joyce is very strong. We went there to  console, and we came back consoled by  Jack’s strong family.  I told them  in my remarks about  Jack holding court in the Pennsylvania  Corner in this Chamber. There isn’t another corner that I know of that has its  own name and its own presiding officer.  But Jack held court there, and Members  from  across  the  country  and  across the aisle came to visit him, to  ask his blessing on their endeavors,  and to just be encouraged, and sometimes supported by him. The cluster  around him were Pennsylvanians and  others, but he was never alone. He was  a magnet, a personal magnet. People  were drawn to him. He had this wonderful smile and cheerful, twinkling  eyes.  To see him operate in the Appropriations Committee, many of us served  there, was to see a master at work. But  really to understand his character, it  was more important to see him with  our troops, whether it was just off the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:00 Feb 27, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\H24FE0.REC H24FE0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010

172,60,2010-02-24,Mr. COHEN.," Madam Speaker, many  speakers have preceded me today  in  speaking about Mr. Murtha—and I will  always call him Mr. Murtha because  that’s how I referred to him here in the  House and that’s how I will refer to  him in memory.  I only had the opportunity to serve  with him for 3 years, and I feel certainly inadequate in being the last person to speak, but this man was my  friend. He was like a father figure to  me.  When I was thinking about running  for Congress, I came up here to view  Congress and think about it. I wasn’t  sure if I was going to run or not. I went  up in that gallery and I sat on this left  side of the aisle, Madam Speaker. I  looked at the floor and all the people  down here and I thought about whether  or not I wanted to run. But coming up  here, I was in Rayburn, and I walked up  by the train that comes from Rayburn  to the Capitol. And this man came up  to me, this gentleman—I didn’t know  him—and he put his arm around me  and we  talked on  the way up and  walked all the way down the path. And  he said, Young man, this is going to be  like 1974. It’s going to be a great year  for Democrats.  We got up the elevator—and I was so  proud to be in this building—and we  got to the top and he went to the left  where you enter the Speaker’s lobby  and come onto this floor and I went  around the way to this gallery where  visitors go. He said, Next time you  come up here, I hope you can come in  here with me. And it was the next time  I got to come in here with him.  I was so proud every time I got to go  over—I read about ‘‘Murtha’s Corner’’  in The New York Times, and then I  find myself over  there with mostly  folks from Pennsylvania, but also the  different people that were fond of Mr.  Murtha. I was standing there and I  thought,  I  remember  reading about  Murtha’s Corner, now I’m in Murtha’s  Corner. And I was in his corner and he  was in mine. When I needed help for my  community and learning about appropriations, defense appropriations and  how they could benefit this country  and my community and my universities, he helped me. He always helped  me. And I helped him when he was in  need in his last election.  I made the trip to Johnstown for his  funeral, and I am so happy I did and I  am happy to be here. I could not let  this opportunity pass to speak about  this great American. It has been talked  about he was a marine and he was the  first from Vietnam to be elected—he  was part of that class—and he stood up  and received the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award. All is true. But  the bottom  line  is he was a good  human being.  ‘‘Avuncular’’  is a word  I  learned  when I was in high school, uncle-like  figure, and I guess he was an uncle-like  figure. He was  just  a  grand,  good  human being. I will miss him. This  House will miss him. And I am just fortunate that I passed this way at the  same time he did and got to change  time with him in life.  Thank you, Jack Murtha.  f  FURTHER MESSAGE FROM THE  SENATE  A further message from the Senate  by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed  with amendments in which the concurrence of the House is requested, a bill  of the House of the following title:  H.R. 3961. An act to amend title XVIII of  the Social Security Act to reform the Medicare SGR payment system for physicians and  to reinstitute and update the Pay-As-You-Go  requirement of budget neutrality on new tax  and mandatory  spending  legislation,  enforced by the threat of annual, automatic sequestration.  f  IN HONOR OF SERGEANT  JEREMIAH WITTMAN  ",2010
173,60,2010-02-24,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. INGLIS) is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2010
174,60,2010-02-24,Mr. INGLIS.," Madam Speaker, I am  here to honor one of America’s heroes.  U.S.  Army  Sergeant  Jeremiah  Wittman, age 26, was killed in Afghanistan on Saturday, February 13, 2010.  Sergeant Wittman was from Montana.  His wife, Karyn, is from the Chesnee/  Boiling Springs area of Spartanburg  County, South Carolina.  Sergeant Wittman and Karyn have a  beautiful  3-year-old daughter named  Miah. I got to play in Miah’s doll house  when I visited her grandparents’ home  recently. More on that in a minute.  Sergeant Wittman was doing what  Americans best do—he was protecting  freedom, protecting us, when an improvised explosive device was detonated  near him as he was on foot patrol in  Zhari province in Afghanistan.  I wonder what it means to a 3-year-  old, Madam Speaker, to hear that her  daddy is one of our heroes. I said that  to Miah the other night at her house. I  know she heard it from others because  we are very patriotic people in the upstate of South Carolina, Madam Speaker. Still, I wonder what it means to a 3-  year-old.  Miah’s mom, Karyn, knows what it  means. She knew what it meant when  representatives  of  the  U.S.  Army  showed up at her parents’ front door  dressed in ‘‘Class A’s.’’ She knows that  this Saturday an Army officer will  kneel beside her and  say  that  the  President of the United States and a  grateful Nation stand in appreciation  of the honorable and faithful service of  her husband, Jeremy.  Devoted spouses like Karyn and self-  sacrificing  parents  like  Sergeant  Wittman’s know that service means  the possibility of not coming home safe  and sound, the possibility that the last  full measure of devotion will be given  on a battlefield far from home.  The people of the upstate of South  Carolina and Montana know what it  means. It means that we must live our  lives in gratitude to America’s best;  the ones who come home unscathed,  the ones who come home with scars,  and the ones who come home in solemn  honor.  But what does it mean to Miah? Well,  Madam Speaker,  if you will  indulge  me, I will try to say what it means in  a letter to Miah.  Dear Miah, that’s an awesome dollhouse you have in the living room at  your grandma and grandpa’s house.  Thank you for letting me see the cool  things you’ve got in there. I like the  computer a lot, and the lights over the  door to your doll tent are awesome.  Thank you for showing me the pictures  of you and your daddy.  I guess you’ve noticed by now that  grown-ups like us cry sometimes when  we hear you say that your daddy is in  heaven. It’s not that we’re not happy  for him. You know better  than us  grown-ups that your daddy can trust  God to dry every tear. It’s just that  we’re overwhelmed by the gift you’ve  given. You and your mom and your  grandparents have given the rest of us  the gift of your dad’s life.  He was  in Afghanistan protecting  you and your mom mostly, but he was  also there protecting me and my family and all American families. So if you  see a lot of people crying, it’s the only  way we know to show how much we  care, how much your dad’s sacrifice,  how much your sacrifice means to us.  A sergeant like your dad told me recently,  ‘‘When  I see good things at  risk, I’m inclined to fight for it. I guess  that’s why I’m in the Army.’’ That’s  Sergeant Mennell from Texas. I don’t  know if Sergeant Mennell knew your  dad, but I bet that’s what your dad  thought too. Your dad saw your future  at risk, Miah, so he went to fight for  you and for me and for all of us.  When I was leaving your house the  other night,  there was  a  beautiful  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:00 Feb 27, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\H24FE0.REC H24FE0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010
175,67,2010-02-24,Mr. KINGSTON.," You know, the town  meetings that you and I had, the town  meetings where you did not have to  have an invitation, the town meetings  where you invited Democrats, Republicans, Tea Party members, independents,  out-of-towners,  nonregistered  voters, the kind of town meeting where  you had open mikes and anybody could  stand up and say anything they wanted——  ",2010
176,67,2010-02-24,Mr. AKIN., Those meetings seemed to  have been pretty exciting  this  last  year.  ,2010
177,67,2010-02-24,Mr. KINGSTON.," Well, you know what  I found though? The people were reading the bill. And I’ve got to say this to  the people who supported the bill, they  found some good stuff in there and said  to me, you ought to support that. And  there were some things in there that I  think are worthy of supporting.  But I still think it’s very difficult to  make a bad bill a better bill. I think it  would be better to start all over, pick  and choose some  ideas  from Republicans. You don’t have  to  start at  Ground Zero as if you’ve never heard of  health  care  reform  ideas,  but  you  should start all over in this legislation.  What if this was the Pelosi-Boehner-  Reid-McConnell bill? What a different  thing. And I think that’s what we want  to do. We want to work with the Democrats.  We were shut out of the stimulus bill.  We were shut out of the omnibus bill.  We’ve been shut out of health care.  Maybe  tomorrow  isn’t  just  theater.  Maybe it’s the turning point. I hope  that it is. You know, I’d like to see  something get done. But a lot of times,  you know, these things are just positioning.  ",2010
178,67,2010-02-24,Mr. AKIN.," Let me just respond to  what you’re saying because maybe I’m  being too pessimistic about this. But  let’s take a look at the format. The  format is we’re going to huddle behind  closed doors. We’re going to produce a  bill. You get 24 hours to look at it, and  then we want you to come and tell us  how much you like it. That doesn’t  seem to me to be sort of an open the  kimono and let’s work together as a  team. It’s more like, if you don’t support me, then my way or the highway.  ",2010
179,67,2010-02-24,Mr. KINGSTON.," Well, let me ask you  this now. Who gets to look at it in 24  hours and when? Who is this group of  people and when?  ",2010
180,67,2010-02-24,Mr. AKIN.," Well, I’m not exactly sure  of that. My understanding was the bill  was supposed to be released 24 hours  from  the  day  that  they’re  talking  about it, and the only thing I’d seen  earlier this morning was outlines, and  the outlines, of course, the Congressional Budget Office can’t score it. And  it appears to be very much the same  thing as the Senate health care bill is  everything we can tell. We’ve been told  that there aren’t special deals in it,  and yet as we take a look at it, we find  that there are. Somebody managed to  take a look at the ones that were there  before and a lot of them are still there.  The Louisiana Purchase is still in it, as  I understand.  ",2010
181,67,2010-02-24,Mr. KINGSTON.," I understand there’s  some special interests for Louisiana,  Connecticut, Michigan, and those are  the deals we know about because those  were a little bit more visible. But you  can imagine all the other oddball stuff  in there, the hospital wings that will  be built here and there.  ",2010
182,67,2010-02-24,Mr. AKIN.," Hospital’s in—my understanding  is  the hospital  is  in Connecticut; Medicaid dollars, Vermont,  Massachusetts, New Jersey; drug companies; extra cash for union health care  plans. I have a list of some of these.  Montana coal miners. Florida seniors  don’t have to pay that Medicare Advantage. You know, Medicare’s being  cut, but you don’t if you’re a Florida  senior. It’s not cut there, but in other  States it is. If you’re a union guy, it’s  not. But if you aren’t, you know. And  then there’s North Dakota Medicare  payments. Hawaii hospitals are exempt  from the cuts. And  longshoremen.  I  didn’t know about longshoremen. But  there are, of course a bunch of these  special deals in the program.  ",2010
183,67,2010-02-24,Mr. KINGSTON., So special interest  groups have clearly been on the inside  of this and their fingerprints are all  over the health care bill.  ,2010
184,67,2010-02-24,Mr. AKIN.," Yeah, exactly. That’s the  situation.  And  I guess the other thing  is,  I  think the American public is worried  about this  job thing. Excessive taxation is a big deal, because if you own  a small business and you tax that guy  really  heavily,  the  small  business  owner is not going to have any money  to  invest  in new equipment or new  plants and things, so heavy taxation on  a small business owner is going to be a  job killer. And yet, this bill on medicine puts a heavy, heavy tax on small  business owners. So, in that sense, it’s  a job-killing bill.  ",2010
185,67,2010-02-24,Mr. KINGSTON.," And, you know, not  to mention there will be a new tax on  individuals because, you know, when  you’re forced to buy something, that is  a  tax. And  so  there would be  less  money  for customers of small businesses on a discretionary basis. Whether  they’re  buying  hamburgers  or  clothes or tires or whatever, they’ll  have less of it in their pocket.  ",2010
186,67,2010-02-24,Mr. AKIN., Did you know that there  are supposedly 36—I know Missouri is  one of them. That’s my home State.  There are 36 States that have legislation moving exempting the States from  having  to  be  required  to  purchase  health care when the government demands that everybody has to buy federally approved health care? There are 36  separate States moving legislation to  stop that. That doesn’t say something’s  popular.  ,2010
187,67,2010-02-24,Mr. KINGSTON.," Well,  again,  the  American people do understand this  Pelosi-Obama-Reid health care package. And, you know, I think one of the  great  examples  of  government  efficiency we  saw  in August, Cash  for  Clunkers. It was a program, actually  pretty simple program. You turn  in  your old gas guzzler, you trade it in for  a more fuel-efficient car. We give you a  tax credit. They take your old car, put  it out to pasture and put it down. And,  you know, it’s kind of an easy thing to  follow. Stimulates the car dealerships.  Well, that program was supposed to  last from August to November. It was a  $1 billion program. I think they hired  100 employees, came back a week later  and said they needed 1,100 employees  and $3 billion. And even doing that,  Cash for Clunkers was dead and defunct  within a matter of weeks.  So you now feel that that same government  that  brought us Cash  for  Clunkers, a $3 billion program, is going  to be able to run a $2 trillion health  care bill.  ",2010
188,67,2010-02-24,Mr. AKIN.," Well, I thank you, gentleman, for joining me today. And the  question at the beginning was is this  going to be a credible theatrical performance tomorrow or are people just  going to tune in to the Olympics. I  guess we’ll see tomorrow what’s going  to  really happen, but  I’m not  sure  there’s much new, from what we can  see about what’s being proposed from  the White House.  f  b2045  HEALTH CARE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  OWENS).  Under  the  Speaker’s  announced policy of January 6, 2009, the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee  of the minority leader.  ",2010
189,67,2010-02-24,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the privilege to address you  here on the floor, and I appreciate the  dialogue that came from my colleagues  the  previous  hour  discussing  this  health care issue that has so consumed  this Nation.  And we are here now on the eve of  the 6-hour meeting that is scheduled at  Blair House that the President has invited both Democrats and Republican  leadership to join. And Mr. Speaker, I  came to the floor to talk about this  issue and help to put it in a perspective  so that as the American people watch  what’s going to happen tomorrow, they  understand it in perhaps a better perspective than they might otherwise.  Now, I would lay it out this way. I  think there are two points, Mr. Speaker, that need to be addressed by Democrats. And these are significant points  of vulnerability where there has been a  persistent criticism  from the public.  They have made the point that of all of  the agonizing national debate that’s  taken place on health care, that the  Democrats have first of all shut Republicans out. They shut Republican out of  the room, shut them out of the negotiations, shut them out of the office.  And the second thing is, the Democrats  haven’t  had  transparency.  They’ve been cooking up these health  care deals in secret. And as this thing  unfolded,  some  time  in  early September was the last time that I am  aware of that a Republican senator or  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:00 Feb 27, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\H24FE0.REC H24FE0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010
190,74,2010-02-24,Mr. KING of Iowa.," In briefly reclaiming my time, to the gentleman from  Georgia, I’d make the point that, as to  what’s going on tomorrow that you referred to as a dog-and-pony show, I  don’t take issue with that statement.  I just think that the American people  need to know that this isn’t a negotiation taking place tomorrow. This  is  about putting up the  front and the  show that there will be C–SPAN discussions taking place and that there will  be Republicans in the room.  By the way, there hasn’t been any  dialogue on our part about the dynamics of what happens with the faces of  the Democrats who will be in the room  or whose job it will be to enhance the  image of the President of the United  States. This is the President’s image.  He has lost his mojo, and he cannot get  it back by simply continuing to work  in  the  backroom with Democrats.  That’s how he lost it in the first place.  So the President can’t get his juice  back. He can’t get his mojo back unless  he gets Republicans in the room—and  he has got to have some of them either  looking silly or nodding their heads,  one of the two—and I’m going to suggest going  cheek-to-cheek with  the  President of the United States after  we’ve come all of this way.  The American people have won the  debate, and we are with them. We’ve  now recovered the fumble in Massachusetts. We’ve got the ball. We’re playing  offense. They’re playing defense. This  is the best that they can come up  with—allowing  the President of  the  United States to set conditions on the  negotiations by which we are going to  consider his defeated bill, to which 47  percent of the people say scrap it and  start over, to which 23 percent of the  people say just throw it out and do  nothing—don’t  start  over—and  to  which about a quarter of the people  say, We’ll pass  the President’s bill.  Well, that’s how far down he is when 25  percent of the American people think  that might be a good idea.  So I think that we need to understand that this is about the show. It’s  not about getting anything negotiated.  But if it were, I’d do tort reform.  The gentleman from Missouri.  ",2010
191,74,2010-02-24,Mr. AKIN.," That’s what we called it  during the last hour. We called it ‘‘Political Drama.’’  You know, there isn’t anything, first  of all, that the Republicans can do that  could block his bill. The problem he  has got is he doesn’t even have enough  Democrats who want to do this thing,  so he is trying to drum up, as you say,  support for this thing to make it look  like  there are people who are  supporting it. Yet he goes behind closed  doors, puts some deal together, comes  out, and says, Now are you going to  agree with it?  There  is nothing bipartisan about  that. It’s just a scam. I just don’t think  the American people are going to buy  it.  ",2010
192,74,2010-02-24,Mr. KING of Iowa.," In reclaiming my  time, in addition to this reconciliation  package is the, figuratively, gun to the  head  of Republicans. They’ve  been  cleaning their gun all weekend and  spinning the cylinder. They’ll put it to  our heads tomorrow, and they’ll say,  We have cooked up this reconciliation  package. We’ve got our deal.  They’re going to think we believe  they have the votes.  They’ll put that gun to our heads,  and they’ll say, Now, you can either  accept the terms we’re going to offer at  the Blair House  tomorrow or we’re  going to drop the hammer and go with  the nuclear option and try to push this  thing through the Senate.  I don’t think they’ve got the votes in  the House  to do  it.  I don’t  think  they’ve got the votes in the Senate to  do it. I will say, Mr. Speaker, if they  try to move that, they’re going to be  looking at a whole stack of amendments in the Senate that will take an  awful long time, with more exposure on  the Senate votes than there will be at  the Blair House tomorrow.  The gentleman from Georgia.  ",2010

194,81,2010-02-24,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, I believe  the first obligation of a government—  or one of the obligations, especially of  Congress—is to live by its own words  and live by its own rules. With great  fanfare a couple weeks ago, the Democratic leadership and its membership  passed a pay-go piece of  legislation  which says that when you bring spending legislation to the floor, it should be  paid for. There was great breast-beating on the other side of the aisle about  how this would discipline the government and make us fiscally responsible.  Now we see, as the first piece of legislation to come forward since the pay-  go resolution passed, a bill which violates that pay-go resolution. This bill  spends $12 billion that is not paid for  under the pay-go rules over the next 5  years. It is in violation of the concepts  and the rules which were put forward  by the other side as the way we would  discipline spending.  I understand—and I think most of us  understand—the issue of the economy  is critical, getting people back to work  is critical, but I don’t think we get people back to work by loading more and  more debt onto the next generation.  Probably we  create  an  atmosphere  where folks who are willing to go out  and invest and create jobs are a little  reticent to do so because they don’t  know how all that debt the Federal  Government is putting on the books  will be paid for. I presume that is one  of the reasons the pay-go legislation  was brought forward a couple of weeks  ago, to try to give some certainty to  the markets and to the American people who were upset with all the deficit  and debt, that we would discipline ourselves.  Now the first bill that comes forward  violates the rules of the Senate by adding $12 billion of spending which is not  paid for, which will be deficit spending,  and which will be added to the debt. I  am not sure how you vote for this bill  when it violates that rule which you  just voted for 2 weeks ago. It seems a  bit of inconsistency that is hard even  for a political institution to justify.  On top of that, this bill has massive  gamesmanship in the outyears. It is a  bill of $15 to $18 billion in spending, but  actually, because of the games played  in the highway accounts, it adds $140  billion of spending that is not paid for  which will be added to the debt if this  bill is passed. That is a hard number.  That is a big number. That is a real  number.  The simple fact is, this bill, in the  classic gamesmanship we see from the  highway committee, spends money we  don’t have and then claims we have the  money. In the end, all that money has  to be borrowed because there are no  revenues to cover it.  If this bill is passed, there will be $140  billion in new debt put on our kids’  backs as a result of this alleged small  number. I forgot what the number is  they claim is actually in the bill. How  does that happen? This bit of gamesmanship ought to be explained because  it keeps being undertaken by the highway committee in the most egregious  way relative to proper fiscal management. In fact, if this were done in an  accounting cycle that was subject to  accounting rules, the people who claim  this sort of sleight of hand would go to  jail. It is that simple. They would go to  jail because this is such a fraud on the  American taxpayer.  What they are claiming is that the  highway fund, on which they have committed  to  spend much more money  than is coming in, and they knew they  would  spend more money  than was  coming  in because  they wanted  to  spend more money than was coming in,  what they are claiming is that highway  fund lent the general fund money 10  years ago and that money should have  had interest paid on it. Of course, at  the time, they actually waived the interest, assuming interest should have  been paid on that. That interest has  been recouped a couple of times now,  allegedly, even  if  it were owed. But  what they claim is that because the  money is coming out of the general  fund to fund the highway fund, they  are calling that an offset so it won’t  score.  Unfortunately,  under  the  present  rules with which we budget around  here, it doesn’t score because it is built  into the baseline. It adds up to $140 billion over the next 10 years, approximately, that is going to come out of  the general fund to fund the highway  fund because the people who run the  highway fund don’t have the courage to  fund what they want to spend. So they  are going to take it out of the general  fund. Where does the general fund get  its money? It borrows it from our children and grandchildren.  It  runs up  debt. That is why, under any scenario,  no matter what gamesmanship you  play around here on naming this event,  it turns out to be the same thing: debt  added to our children’s burden.  Our  children  already have  a  fair  amount of debt coming at them as a result  of  this  Congress’s  profligacy.  Under the President’s budget, the deficit will double in the next 5 years and  triple in the next 10 years. We will add  $11 trillion of new debt to the backs of  our children over the next 10 years  under the President’s initiatives, every  year for the next 10 years. We will average deficits of $1 trillion.  The American people intuitively understand that cannot continue; it can’t  keep up. We are on an unsustainable  course. We are running this Nation  into a ditch on the fiscal side of the  ledger. We are putting this Nation into  financial bankruptcy because of the  fact that we are running up deficits  and debt far beyond our capacity to  repay. In fact, if you look at these deficits and debt just in the context of  what other industrialized nations do—  for example, the European Union—they  don’t allow their states to exceed deficits of 3 percent or a public debt to  GDP ratio of 60 percent. The way this  works out, we are going to run deficits  of about 5 percent every year for the  next 10 years, we will have a public  debt situation of well over 60 percent  next year, and we will get to 80 percent  before the next 10 years are up. Those  are numbers which lead to one conclusion—that we are in deep trouble. We  are in deep, deep trouble. Yet we come  here today with a bill which aggravates  that situation relative to the pay-go  rules by $12 billion and relative to the  highway fund by $140 billion.  ",2010

224,88,2010-02-24,Mr. REED.," Madam President, we  have today taken a very strong, positive step forward in terms of responding to the No. 1 crisis in our economy,  and that is jobs for all of our people.  Under Leader REID’s  leadership, we  were able to get a bill through, with a  huge majority, and it signals, I hope,  not only attention to jobs but also the  willingness and the ability to find common ground to serve the people of our  country.  We are now on the travel promotion  bill, which is another piece of legislation designed to encourage job creation  in the travel industry. All of this is  good news. The legislation we propose  this morning combines elements of tax  breaks for small businesses so they can  expense  their  items,  increase  their  cashflow, and hire more people with  credits for hiring people. There is a  huge investment in our infrastructure,  which will put people to work in the  building  industry  and  in  industries  that  supply all  these  infrastructure  projects, and there is also a significant  commitment to Build America Bonds.  These are good programs, and they are  fully paid for.  We are now taking up the challenge  to put people to work, to do it in a responsible way, and to do so in a way  that we can attract bipartisan support.  But there is much more to do. There is  the recognition that we have to not  only create jobs but for the foreseeable  future deal with those people who have  been  looking unsuccessfully  for  jobs  and who are unemployed. In my home  State of Rhode Island, the unemployment rate is 12.9 percent. That is the  official rate. Unofficially, it is much  higher, as many people have dropped  out of the workforce. If you look at  sectors in terms of ethnicity or age,  the numbers are even more startling.  The bill we passed this morning is a  good first step forward, but we have to  do much more.  I think one of the first jobs we have  to address is the extension of unemployment benefits. They will expire  this Sunday. We have  to  recognize  that, despite many efforts here, there  are millions of Americans who are  looking  every  day  and not  finding  work. They need support.  All  of  the  economists who  have  looked at  these programs  indicated  that not only do they support individuals and families, they provide a tremendous multiplier of economic activity for every dollar we commit to the  program. There is, as they say, a big  bang  for  the buck. People who are  without a job will take their benefits  and invariably they will have to support themselves in terms of going to  the grocery  store—doing  the  things  you have to do just to get by day by  day. They are not typically saving this  money. That helps in the sense of increasing demand in the economy overall, increasing our economic growth.  If Congress fails to act swiftly, 1,200  Rhode Islanders will start losing their  benefits each week. It is a small State  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:10 May 18, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S24FE0.REC S24FE0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010

226,123,2010-02-24,Mr. PETERS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise here today  to honor Congressman DALEKILDEE on  the  occasion of his twenty thousandth vote.  Congressman  has  proudly  represented Flint area  residents  in Michigan’s  State House, State Senate and U.S. Congress  for over 46 years.  Only missing twenty seven votes during his  thirty  three years  in Congress, with a  large  portion of those during a hospital stay, ConKILDEE gressman KILDEE has been nicknamed  the  ‘‘Cal Ripken of Congress’’. His strong work  ethic demonstrated  in his exceptional voting  record has also translated into many legislative victories.  Throughout his career, Congressman KILDEEhas been a champion for children, from  serving as a  local high school  teacher,  to  Chairman of  the House Page Program,  to  working to establish child protection measures  and additional development programs for children as a Member of Congress.  As a senior member of the Education and  Labor Committee, and as  the Democratic  Chairman of the Congressional Auto Caucus,  Congressman KILDEEhas been a tireless supporter of auto workers in Michigan and around  the nation, helping to establish worker retraining  programs  and  new  job  opportunities.  Through these efforts, Dale was able to establish a Job Corps Center in Flint to provide vocational and academic training for young people with the goal of helping them to improve  their own quality of life.  I am proud  to serve alongside my good  friend DALEKILDEE, who has been a fighter for  the people of Michigan; from his avid protection of our Great Lakes,  to his support  for  worker protection  laws and support of children’s education. DALEhas served as a mentor to me throughout my career in Michigan  public office and  I am proud  to call him a  friend, and happy to be able to congratulate  him on the occasion of his 20,000th vote here  in the House of Representatives.  f  HONORING CONGRESSMAN  CHARLIE WILSON  HON. MIKE QUIGLEY  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 24, 2010  ",2010
227,123,2010-02-24,Mr. QUIGLEY.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in honor of Congressman Charles Wilson, who  passed away on February 10th, 2010. Representative Wilson was a great statesman who  served the 2nd Congressional District in Texas  from 1972–1996.  Charles was born in a small town in Texas,  where he developed a deep sense of pride as  a Texan and a strong dedication to the American way. As a young man he served in the  United States Navy where he rose through the  ranks and was given the privilege to serve as  part of a Soviet Union nuclear intelligence unit  based out of the Pentagon. While serving in  the military, 27-year-old Charles was able to  effectively run for and win the office of State  Representative  in  his  native  Texas.  This  began a 12-year political career in Texas that  earned him the nickname ‘‘liberal from Lufkin’’.  In 1972, Wilson was elected  to  the U.S.  House of Representatives, where he became  most recognized for his role in the dismantling  of the communist Soviet Union’s occupation of  Afghanistan. He deeply believed  in  the sovereignty of the Afghani people and was able to  use his influence on the House Appropriations  Subcommittee on Defense to help provide the  funding for their liberation. Although the media  has primarily focused on his accomplishments  abroad, Charles always maintained Lufkin,  Texas as one of his number one priorities.  Some of his greatest domestic accomplishments include the creation of the 100,000-acre  Big Thicket National Preserve and the Lufkin  VA Hospital.  Madam Speaker, Charles Wilson was a political giant who brought his Texas-sized gusto  for democracy and his passion for serving the  American people  to our Nation’s capitol. He  will be greatly missed not only by his wife and  sister, but by the American people.  f  HONORING  CHRISTINA  CAPUTO  FOR WINNING  THE  HONORING  OUR  FUTURE  LEADERS  COMPETITION  HON.

Ms. Reffett began her career in 1979 as an  operator  for Ameritech  in Canton,  IL. After  working for Ameritech for twenty years, Kelly  joined  the American Red Cross of Greater  Chicago as Director of Partner Relations and  AFL–CIO Labor Participation. For  ten years,  Kelly worked  to expand preparedness education opportunities  to diverse populations,  served  disaster  stricken  communities,  and  broadened partnerships with corporations and  community organizations.  In this position, she directed teams of nearly  100 people at 23 locations, providing executive guidance and program assistance to onsite supervisors and Volunteer  in Service  to  America members. She also served as Partner Services Manager/Officer and Labor Liaison on 25 national relief operations including  Hurricane Katrina and World Trade Center 9/  11 operations. She co-developed  the AFL–  CIO’s 2009 handbook outlining guidelines and  policies for volunteer disaster relief operations.  These accomplishments are only a small sampling of Kelly’s impressive career.  In addition to her national service, Kelly was  also selected to serve at the state and county  level. Since 2003, Kelly has served as a commissioner on the Illinois State Commission on  Volunteerism  and  Community  Service.  In  2008, she was appointed to serve on the LaSalle County Board. Shortly  thereafter, she  was elected to that office.  Throughout her long career, Ms. Reffett has  also remained dedicated to the cause of working families. Serving as President of the Illinois  Valley Federation of Labor for over two decades, she always put the best interests of Illinois Valley workers first.  Ms. Kelly Reffett has had a long and proud  career, one that is not ending as she retires  from the presidency of the Illinois Valley Federation of Labor. Having worked with her over  the years, I am sure she will continue to work  to improve her community, as she has done  over and throughout her long and successful  career.  f  CONGRATULATING  THE  TRANSPORTATION  TRADES  DEPARTMENT  ON  ITS  20TH ANNIVERSARY  HON.

230,130,2010-02-24,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Madam Speaker, it is my  great pleasure  to congratulate  the Transportation Trades Department, AFL–CIO as  this  strong voice for transportation workers marks  its 20th anniversary.  Transportation  is at  the core of our daily  lives and our economy. From ancient civilization  through  the present day,  the quality of  transportation serves as a true measure of a  society. How well do people  live  their daily  lives? How quickly and efficiently can people  and goods get  from one place  to another?  Does the quality of transportation strengthen  or weaken an economy?  As we map  the vision  for our  future, we  must keep asking  these questions. Are we  doing all we can  to  invest  in modern, safe,  and efficient transportation? Are the workers in  this industry as well-trained, experienced, and  prepared as possible? Are  they  treated with  respect and dignity? Are they trusted and empowered? Do their wages and working conditions help—or hurt—the ability to attract and  retain good men and women for these jobs?  The work of the Transportation Trades Department (TTD), of  the AFL–CIO  lies at  the  heart of these questions. In every major transportation policy debate in Washington over the  past 20 years, TTD has been front and center,  providing  an  honest,  substantive,  and  respected voice on behalf of millions of transportation workers. TTD brings  their voices  to  those in public office, helping forge far better  policy and decision-making than if the organization did not exist.  TTD has always had the courage and conviction to demand accountability, to make sure  that public and private sector  transportation  leaders are  truly placing safety and our national  transportation  network’s  true  needs  ahead of ideology and profit. In an industry—  and world—that has been so turbulent in recent years, the value of TTD’s vigilant watchdog role is priceless.  As the Chairman of the House Committee  on Transportation and  Infrastructure,  I can  count on TTD  to bring  integrity,  intellectual  depth, and refreshing clarity to my Committee  and the entire Congress. I have long valued  TTD as a trusted friend and ally, and its substantive, bipartisan approach has often been  helpful in bringing about consensus on important issues.  As my committee has engaged in enacting  critical legislation—from the surface transportation bill to the FAA reauthorization bill, from  the Coast Guard  reauthorization  to Amtrak  and rail safety reauthorization—TTD has been  a comprehensive and credible  resource.  Its  member unions are on the front lines of our  transportation  network—whether  on  the  ground, in the air or at sea.

However,  moving forward on another version of  these massive health care bills is not  progress. Raising hundreds of millions  of dollars in new taxes is not progress.  Cutting half a  trillion dollars  from  Medicare is not progress. Putting the  government in charge of health care in  this country is not progress.  We all know how flawed the Senate  health care bill is, how it is full of  backroom deals  like the Cornhusker  Kickback and the Louisiana Purchase  and many others. Some say the American people will appreciate this bill  after it becomes law.  Let’s not pretend that the American  people just don’t know enough about  this bill to make an informed decision.  They are informed, and they reject it.  Let’s scrap this massive bill and start  over,  just  like the American people  would like us to.  f  WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)  ",2010
232,4,2010-03-03,Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California.," Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to  recognize Women’s  History Month.  This month we will be celebrating not  only the accomplishments of women,  but will also be raising the awareness  of  the various challenges  that  still  exist and face women today.  Today, women make up about 12 percent of our 1.2 million active U.S. servicemembers.  Today, women like Tran Khai Thanh  Thuy are sacrificing their rights to  fight  for democracy and  freedom  in  Vietnam.  Today,  the United States Government  is  led by more women  leaders  than ever before.  But unfortunately, women today also  continue to be challenged by discrimination, sexual assault, and violence.  Despite all of the progress we have  made, women and girls continue to be  trafficked across international borders  on a daily basis.  This month, I encourage all of my  colleagues to not only recognize the  progress women have made, but also to  take action to expand the rights of  women today and  for  future generations.  f  SCHOOL DISTRICTS FINANCIALLY  STRAPPED  (Mr. WITTMAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2010
233,4,2010-03-03,Mr. WITTMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  recently during my district work period,  I met with officials  from Matthews  County  Public  Schools.  Matthews  County is representative of many of  the communities  in my district and  around  the Commonwealth  that are  dealing with  difficult  budget  challenges.  The Matthews County school system  is projected to lose $1.2 million in the  2010–2011  budget year. For  a  small  school district, this  is a significant  number. Unfortunately, in these cases,  usually the only place left to trim the  budget is personnel. This would mean  less services and programs for children.  Over the years, the Federal Government has expanded its involvement in  funding and has added requirements on  public education. In some cases, Federal  requirements  leave  school  districts strapped for funding. The Federal requirements and mandates are  not joined with Federal assistance. In  my district, I have  formed an Education Advisory Council  to  look at  these tough issues.  Congress  should  carefully  review  these important programs and implement commonsense reforms to ensure  that we are helping, not hurting, the  education of our children. There are  many counties  like Matthews across  Virginia’s First Congressional District.  We must be mindful of the impacts we  have on their budgets.  f  RECOVERY ACT WORKING  (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  ",2010
234,4,2010-03-03,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise this morning to share  some success stories from the 20th Congressional District  in Florida  that  show that the evidence is clear that  the Recovery Act is working to cushion  the greatest economic crisis since the  Great Depression and lay a new foundation for economic growth.  In my State of Florida, we are creating jobs and investing in the infrastructure of our community. Indeed, in  my district alone, there have been 130  Recovery Act grants that have been  awarded. Even more  importantly,  in  my  congressional  district,  61  small  businesses have received more than $21  million in loans. These loans to small  businesses have allowed companies to  stay open, keep people employed, and  prevented an  even deeper  economic  downturn.  Experts agree that the Recovery Act  is already responsible for saving or creating 2 million jobs, and we remain on  track to create and save at least an additional 31⁄2million jobs by the end of  the year.  The Recovery Act, to be clear, was  never meant to replace dollar for dollar  or job for job what we have lost. But 1  year in, experts ranging from private  forecasters to Governors on both sides  of the aisle say the Recovery Act has  helped pull us back from the brink of  economic disaster and is helping us lay  a firm foundation for our economic recovery.  f  b1030  SCRAP CURRENT HEALTH CARE  BILL  (Mr. FLEMING asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2010
235,4,2010-03-03,Mr. FLEMING.," Mr. Speaker,  last  year,  I  introduced House Resolution  615, a resolution that simply says, if  you vote for a government-run health  care  system, you  should be willing  to be subject to it. As of today, over  3 million Americans have  gone  to  fleming.house.gov  in support of this  resolution.  This message continues to resonate  across America for one simple reason:  The people of this country are sick and  tired of being the victims of bad laws  while their elected representatives exempt themselves from the very same  laws. If Congress feels increased taxes,  higher premiums, and government-run  health care are good enough for American families, then it should be good  enough for them as well.  I urge the President and Democrat  leadership  to  listen  to  this  overwhelming uproar  from the American  public. Scrap the current  legislation  and go back to the drawing board to  craft a true bipartisan bill that  increases access and quality of health  care while  driving  down  costs  for  American families.  f  LEGISLATION TO HELP SMALL  BUSINESSES  (Mr. SCHAUER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2010
236,4,2010-03-03,Mr. SCHAUER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  announce new  legislation  I’m  introducing to help small businesses grow  and make it easier for them to put people to work. New jobs mean less government  spending on unemployment  and health care. New employees spend  much of what they earn, also boosting  our local economies.

238,11,2010-03-03,Mr. CARDOZA., I would be happy to  yield to the gentleman from California  for questions.  ,2010
239,11,2010-03-03,Mr. DREIER.," I thank my friend for  yielding.  Let me first say that, as the gentleman knows, in my remarks that I  made from this well just moments ago,  I recognized that this is a process that  has been utilized under both political  parties. So I completely concur with  that, and I said that that happened.  The important distinction to make is  that the five instances that my friend  mentioned when we were in the majority, this was all done in the September-  to-December  timeframe, basically  in  the waning days of a Congress, or at  least a session of Congress. And that  played a big role, recognizing that that  needed to happen.  ",2010
240,11,2010-03-03,Mr. CARDOZA.," Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, in response to the  statement of the gentleman, I would  just say that, yes, these are used for  extraordinary  situations,  like when  200,000 people are put out of work because of a Senate filibuster for no particularly good reason.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010
241,11,2010-03-03,Ms. FOXX.," Madam Speaker, I yield  such time as he may consume to the  distinguished  gentleman  from  California (Mr. DREIER).  ",2010
242,11,2010-03-03,Mr. DREIER.,"  I  thank  the gentlewoman for yielding time to me.  Let me say I’d like to engage in a  colloquy with my friend, if I might.  And I’ll be more than happy to yield to  him whatever time he needs under our  time, because I know he has to deal  with these time constraints.  Let me say, Madam Speaker, at the  outset, the notion of saying 200,000 people have been thrown out of work because of the actions taking place in the  Senate is not right. This had to do with  an issue of spending. But let’s not get  into that. Let’s focus on what it is the  American people want us to do.  Madam Speaker, the gentleman  is  absolutely right: Job creation and economic growth is what the American  people are talking about. I, too, last  night held a telephone town hall meeting and was listening and talking with  thousands of people in southern California. Our unemployment rate is not  quite as high as the gentleman faces in  the San Joaquin Valley. The part of  the area I represent, the Inland Empire, just in suburban Los Angeles, has  a 14.2 percent unemployment rate. It’s  a very serious issue.  We need to work together in a bipartisan way. And I consistently stood in  this well saying that what we should be  doing in a bipartisan way is utilizing  the John F. Kennedy, a great Democratic President, and Ronald Reagan  model to get our economy back on  track. We know what it will take. It’s  not a dramatic  increase  in Federal  spending. It is encouraging, through incentives, private-sector  job  creation  and economic growth.  This procedure is virtually unprecedented at this early point in the Congress. And I will say, Madam Speaker,  that last week, last week, I would have  thought that the majority would have  learned its lesson as it imposed martial  law rule at the end of last week, and  then had to come back, and my friend  was in fact managing in what was a  very unfortunate circumstance for the  institution, the idea of pulling back on  the McDermott amendment that was  considered that clearly, Democrats and  Republicans alike,  recognized would  have  jeopardized the security of the  courageous men and women who serve  in our  intelligence  field around the  world.  So I’d be happy to yield to my friend  if he’d like to respond to any of my  comments.  ",2010
243,11,2010-03-03,Mr. CARDOZA.," Well,  in  response,  Madam Speaker, I would just raise that  it’s my belief that the Senate voted 78  to some teen number.  I’m not sure  what the final tally was.  ",2010
244,11,2010-03-03,Mr. DREIER., It was 19.  ,2010
245,11,2010-03-03,Mr. CARDOZA.," Nineteen, on behalf  of the package, the jobs bill that we’re  contemplating bringing up tomorrow.  Now, this  illustrates the point that  we’ve been frustrated for a long time.  The gentleman is correct that both his  district and my district are suffering  from lack of jobs, too high unemployment. But when you get a constant  slowing down of the process in the Senate to the point where we can’t accomplish what the American people want  us to accomplish in this Congress, then  you will have this kind of situation  where we get into a situation where  200,000 people have been put out of  work because of lack of action by the  other body.  ",2010
246,11,2010-03-03,Mr. DREIER.," Madam Speaker, if I  can reclaim my time, the gentleman is  not talking about people being put out  of work; what he’s talking about  is  people who are not receiving these benefits.  Madam Speaker, let me just say that  everyone acknowledges that we want  to make  sure  that people who are  struggling to find a job today and are  unable to find a job are able to receive  those benefits. No one wants to deny  that. Our colleague in the other body  who was  raising concern about  the  spending issue and offsets and pay-as-  you-go, which  is  something  that  I  know my friend has regularly championed, is what led to this issue.  The question is: What is it that we do  to get the economy back on track?  We’ve seen a massive increase in spending in a wide range of areas. And guess  what? We still have an unemployment  rate at right around just under 10 percent  nationally,  20  percent  in my  friend’s district, and 14 percent-plus in  part of the area that I represent. That’s  why I believe we should be utilizing  this bipartisan John F. Kennedy-Ronald Reagan model. That’s what we  should do to address the shared concern that we have. But in saying this,  Madam Speaker, I point to the fact  that we should not be imposing martial  law, undermining the ability for us to  do what my friend said should be done,  and that is working together in a bipartisan way. Because when you at this  early point in the Congress, in this session of Congress, impose martial law  rule, you undermine the ability for us  to work together in a bipartisan way.  ",2010
247,11,2010-03-03,Mr. CARDOZA.," I will just respond by  saying that I’d love to work in a bipartisan way. But you need partners in a  bipartisan process. Frankly, we’ve seen  more push-back and diversion and obfuscation of the details and the merits  of this legislation. A bill that passes  78–19, as the gentleman indicated, is  one where there is significant agreement. Yet, the rules of the Senate  often times allow there to be significant delays in very needed legislation  to come to the aid of our constituents.  And so I would say that, yes, today  or tomorrow we need to bring up a bill  that deals with the unemployment benefit  for my  constituents  and Mr.  DREIER’s and the rest of the Nation’s as  well. We need  to put  those  transit  workers back to work. We need to take  care of the business before us. And  when we constantly see the generally  unfeeling situation where we’re  just  going to have a filibuster in the Senate  while folks will no longer get their unemployment benefits and suffer in the  process, I don’t think that’s what the  American people sent us here to do.  I believe that we must pass this rule.  We must move the jobs bill as soon as  humanly possible. And we need to also  deal with the education bill that we  brought up before the House and is the  main purpose for why we’re here today.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010
248,11,2010-03-03,Ms. FOXX.," I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, the reason that the  folks on the other side of the aisle are  pushing through this martial law rule,  same-day rule,  is because they have  problems in their own caucus.

252,18,2010-03-03,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1126, I call up the bill (H.R. 4247)  to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraint and seclusion in schools,  and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  ",2010
253,18,2010-03-03,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Pursuant to House Resolution 1126, the bill is  considered read. The amendment in the  nature of a substitute printed in the  bill is adopted.  The text of the bill, as amended, is as  follows:  H.R. 4247  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the  ‘‘Preventing  Harmful Restraint and Seclusion  in Schools  Act’’.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  Congress finds the following:  (1) Physical restraint and seclusion have resulted in physical injury, psychological trauma,  and death to children  in public and private  schools. National research shows students have  been subjected to physical restraint and seclusion in schools as a means of discipline, to force  compliance, or as a substitute for appropriate  educational support.  (2) Behavioral interventions for children must  promote the right of all children to be treated  with dignity. All children have the right to be  free from physical or mental abuse, aversive behavioral interventions that compromise health  and safety, and any physical restraint or seclusion imposed solely for purposes of discipline or  convenience.  (3) Safe, effective, evidence-based strategies  are available to support children who display  challenging behaviors in school settings. Staff  training focused on the dangers of physical restraint and seclusion as well as training in evidence-based positive behavior supports, de-escalation techniques, and physical restraint and seclusion prevention, can reduce the incidence of  injury, trauma, and death.  (4) School personnel have the right to work in  a  safe environment and  should be provided  training and  support  to prevent  injury and  trauma to themselves and others.  (5) Despite  the widely  recognized  risks of  physical restraint and seclusion, a substantial  disparity exists among many States and localities with regard to the protection and oversight  of the rights of children and school personnel to  a safe learning environment.  (6) Children are subjected to physical restraint  and seclusion at higher rates than adults. Physical restraint which restricts breathing or causes  other body trauma, as well as seclusion in the  absence of continuous face-to-face monitoring,  have  resulted  in  the deaths of  children  in  schools.  (7) Children are protected from inappropriate  physical restraint and seclusion in other settings, such as hospitals, health facilities, and  non-medical community-based facilities. Similar  protections are needed in schools, yet such protections must acknowledge the differences of the  school environment.  (8) Research confirms that physical restraint  and seclusion are not therapeutic, nor are these  practices effective means to calm or teach children, and may have an opposite effect while simultaneously decreasing a  child’s ability  to  learn.  (9) The effective  implementation of school-  wide positive behavior  supports  is  linked  to  greater  academic  achievement,  significantly  fewer disciplinary problems, increased instruction time, and staff perception of a safer teaching environment.  SEC. 3. PURPOSES.  The purposes of this Act are to—  (1) prevent and reduce the use of physical restraint and seclusion in schools;  (2) ensure  the  safety of all  students and  school personnel in schools and promote a positive school culture and climate;  (3) protect students from—  (A) physical or mental abuse;  (B) aversive  behavioral  interventions  compromise health and safety; and  (C) any physical restraint or seclusion  imposed solely for purposes of discipline or convenience;  (4) ensure that physical restraint and seclusion are imposed in school only when a student’s behavior poses an  imminent danger of  physical injury to the student, school personnel,  or others; and  (5) assist States, local educational agencies,  and schools in—  (A) establishing policies and procedures  to  keep all students, including students with the  most complex and intensive behavioral needs,  and school personnel safe;  (B) providing school personnel with the necessary tools, training, and support to ensure the  safety of all students and school personnel;  (C) collecting and analyzing data on physical  restraint and seclusion in schools; and  (D)  identifying and  implementing  effective  evidence-based models to prevent and reduce  physical restraint and seclusion in schools.

254,25,2010-03-03,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  I yield 2 minutes to a member of the  committee, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY).  ",2010
255,25,2010-03-03,Mr. COURTNEY.," First of all, I want  to thank the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, Mr. MILLER, for his leadership on this legislation.  The hearing which was held at the  Education and Labor Committee was  one of the most stunning, amazing,  eye-opening events,  I think, of this  Congress. The  bipartisanship which  came together after that hearing to  craft this legislation, again, I think is  a testament to your leadership and the  bipartisanship that you have created  on that committee.  Mr. Speaker, back in 1998, The Hartford Courant won a Pulitzer Prize for a  four-part investigation of seclusion and  restraint all across the country. The  name of the series was ‘‘A Nationwide  Pattern of Death,’’ which I’d like to  offer a copy of for the RECORD, and  which, again, in chapter and verse, laid  out the shocking, uneven application of  this type of  force against America’s  schoolchildren. In Connecticut, it actually resulted in action in terms of legislation which was  put  into  place.  Many of the minimum standards which  are included in the legislation we’re  voting on today were incorporated into  that measure. But, clearly, as a Nation, we have much more work to be  done.  [From the Hartford Courant, Oct. 11, 1998]  A NATIONWIDEPATTERNOFDEATH  (By Eric Weiss)  Roshelle Clayborne pleaded for her life.  Slammed  face-down  on  the  floor,  Clayborne’s arms were yanked across her  chest, her wrists gripped from behind by a  mental health aide.  I can’t breathe, the 16-year-old gasped.  Her last words were ignored.  A  syringe  delivered  50 milligrams  of  Thorazine  into her body and, with eight  staffers watching, Clayborne became, suddenly, still. Blood trickled from the corner  of her mouth as she lost control of her bodily  functions. Her limp body was rolled into a  blanket and dumped in an 8-by-10-foot room  used to seclude dangerous patients at the  Laurel Ridge Residential Treatment Center  in San Antonio, Texas.  The door clicked behind her.  No one watched her die.  But Roshelle Clayborne  is  not  alone.  Across the country, hundreds of patients  have died after being  restrained  in psychiatric and mental retardation  facilities,  many of  them  in  strikingly  similar circumstances, a Courant  investigation has  found.  Those who died were disproportionately  young. They entered our health care system  as troubled children. They left in coffins.  All of them died at the hands of those who  are supposed to protect, in places intended to  give sanctuary.  If Roshelle Clayborne’s death last summer  was not an isolated incident, neither were  the recent deaths of Connecticut’s Andrew  McClain or Robert Rollins.  A 50-state survey by The Courant, the first  of its kind ever conducted, has confirmed 142  deaths during or shortly after restraint or  seclusion in the past decade. The survey focused on mental health and mental retardation facilities and group homes nationwide.  But because many of these cases go unreported, the actual number of deaths during  or after restraint is many times higher.  Between 50 and 150 such deaths occur every  year across the country, according to a statistical estimate commissioned by The Courant and conducted by a research specialist  at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis.  That’s one to three deaths every week, 500  to 1,500 in the past decade, the study shows.  ‘‘It’s going on all around the country,’’  said Dr. Jack Zusman, a psychiatrist and author of a book on restraint policy.  The nationwide trail of death leads from a  6-year-old boy in California to a 45-year-old  mother of four in Utah, from a private treatment center in the deserts of Arizona to a  public psychiatric hospital in the pastures of  Wisconsin.  In some cases, patients died in ways and  for reasons that defy common sense: a towel  wrapped around the mouth of a 16-year-old  boy; a 15-year-old girl wrestled to the ground  after she wouldn’t give up a family photograph.  Many of the actions would land a parent in  jail, yet staffers and facilities were rarely  punished.  ‘‘I raised my child for 17 years and I never  had to restrain her, so I don’t know what  gave them the right to do it,’’ said Barbara  Young, whose daughter Kelly died  in the  Brisbane Child Treatment Center  in New  Jersey.  The pattern revealed by The Courant has  gone either unobserved or willfully ignored  by regulators, by health officials, by the  legal system.  The  federal  government—which  closely  monitors the size of eggs—does not collect  data on how many patients are killed by a  procedure that  is used every day  in psyfacilities  retardation  chiatric and mental  across the country.  Neither do state regulators, academics or  accreditation agencies.  ‘‘Right now we don’t have those numbers,’’  said Ken August of the California Department of Health Services, ‘‘and we don’t have  a way to get at them.’’  The regulators don’t ask, and the hospitals  don’t tell.  As more patients with mental disabilities  are moved  from public  institutions  into  smaller, mostly private facilities, the need  for stronger oversight and uniform standards  is greater than ever.  ‘‘Patients increasingly are not in hospitals  but in contract facilities where no one has  the vaguest idea of what is going on,’’ said  Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a nationally prominent  psychiatrist, author and critic of the mental  health care system.  Because nobody is tracking these tragedies, many restraint-related deaths go unreported not only  to  the government, but  sometimes to the families themselves.  ‘‘There is always some reticence on reporting problems because of the litigious nature  of society,’’ acknowledged Dr. Donald M.  Nielsen, a senior vice president of the American Hospital Association. ‘‘I think the question is not one of reporting, but making sure  there are systems in place to prevent these  deaths.’’  Typically,  though, hospitals dismiss  restraint-related deaths as unfortunate flukes,  not as a systemic issue. After all, they say,  these patients are troubled, ill and sometimes violent.  The facility where Roshelle Clayborne died  insists her death had nothing to do with the  restraint. Officials there say it was a heart  condition that killed the 16-year-old on Aug.  18, 1997.  Bexar County Medical Examiner Vincent  DiMaio ruled that Clayborne died of natural  causes, saying that restraint use was a separate ‘‘clinical issue.’’  But that, too, is typical in restraint cases.  Medical examiners rarely connect the circumstances of the restraint to the physical  cause of death, making these cases impossible to track through death certificates.  The  explanations  don’t  wash  with  Clayborne’s grandmother.  ‘‘I’ll picture her lying on that floor until  the  day  I  die,’’  Charlene Miles  said.  ‘‘Roshelle had her share of problems, but  good God, no one deserves to die like that.’’  With nobody tracking, nobody telling, nobody watching, the same deadly errors are  allowed to occur again and again.  Of the 142 restraint-related deaths confirmed by The Courant’s investigation:  Twenty-three people died after being restrained in face-down floor holds.  Another 20 died after they were tied up in  leather wrist and ankle cuffs or vests, and ignored for hours.  Causes of death could be confirmed in 125  cases. Of those patients, 33 percent died of  asphyxia, another 26 percent died of cardiac-  related causes.  Ages could be confirmed in 114 cases. More  than 26 percent of those were children—nearly twice the proportion they constitute in  mental health institutions.  Many of the victims were so mentally or  physically impaired they could not fend for  themselves. Others had to be restrained after  they erupted violently, without warning and  for little reason.  Caring for these patients is a difficult and  dangerous  job,  even  for  the best-trained  workers. Staffers can suddenly find themselves the target of a thrown chair, a punch,  a bite from an HIV-positive patient.  Yet the great tragedy is that many of the  deaths could have been prevented by setting  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:46 Mar 04, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K03MR7.043 H03MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2010
256,32,2010-03-03,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  commend Chairman MILLER and Congressfor  their work  and dedication on this issue. We all want our  children to have the highest quality education  and educational experience available. That  cannot happen in an environment where students, paraprofessionals, teachers and administrators are not safe.  This bill establishes standards that will ensure that those in classroom settings are safe  and will prevent and reduce inappropriate restraint and seclusion by establishing minimum  safety standards in schools, similar to protections already  in place  in hospitals and non-  medical community-based facilities. By establishing minimum standards for situations that  require the seclusion of students, this bill offers support to the nineteen states that have  no standards set for such situations.  Special education students are at a higher  risk of being harmfully restrained. Because minority children are disproportionately placed in  special education, this bill will offer them protection against harmful actions such as being  denied food in order to punish or preempt behaviors. By setting minimum standards  that  apply to the whole student body, H.R. 4247  protects students without singling out anyone  or placing a stigma on a child or a group of  children.  I am sensitive to the concerns of those who  worry that they may lose the ability to implement certain behavioral interventions. I wish to  continue  this discussion with an eye  toward  further improvements in safety. This bill’s parent notification provision is a positive step towards  a  continual  dialogue  between  educational stakeholders that we in Congress can  participate in. To those who have expressed  concern over this bill, I want you to know that  this bill is part of the on going conversation  about students’ safety in school and does not  signal  the end of our efforts  to protect students.

270,32,2010-03-03,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This amendment is noncontroversial  in nature. Section 7 of the bill would  create a new discretionary grant program to assist State education agencies in meeting the regulations established in the bill, collecting and analyzing  data,  and  implementing  the  schoolwide positive behavior support  approach. This grant program is to be  funded out of the authorization provided in the bill for such sums as necessary.  While State agencies will have to  apply for these grants, it is unclear if  the grants will be awarded on a competitive basis or a merit-based approach.  We have seen in the past, unfortunately, when  these  grant  programs  have been established, even if it is stipulated that they should be competitive  or merit based, oftentimes later Members of Congress will come in and earmark funds directly, and some of these  accounts we have for competitive grant  programs, merit-based grant programs  are completely earmarked just a few  years later, so organizations and individuals, nonprofit agencies or State  agencies can’t even compete for them  because all of that money has been earmarked.  We need  to  look no  further  than  FEMA’s National Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program.  It was a competitive  grant program designed to ‘‘save lives  and reduce property damage by providing for hazard mitigation planning,  acquisition, and relocation of structures out of the  floodplain.’’ Again,  this was going to be a competitive  grant program. The fiscal 2010 Homeland Security appropriation bill appropriated $100 million for this program.  Almost $25 million of that was earmarked for projects in Members’ home  districts, leaving fewer funds available  for  localities  that wished  to  legitimately apply for the funding.

Again, as he articulated eloquently a  few minutes ago, the two things that  this bill really does is it helps American consumers by increasing competition in the marketplace—that is really  what we need as we deal with the very  topical issue of insurance. And it provides the American people, the American consumer, with choice. So competition and choice are certainly the  great beneficiaries of this legislation.  I might add that our act has garnered  support from both sides of the aisle. We  have both Democrats and Republicans  working together on this. Forty-eight  of us are sponsors to this bill, and 27 of  us belong to the Financial Services  Committee, where we have done work  on it.  b1745  This bill has the support of NAIC, as  I said earlier. It shows that the State  insurance regulators, themselves, believe that this type of legislation has  needed reform.

The  National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, the Property Casualty  Insurance Association of America, the  Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers, as well as a number of individual  insurance companies, all are in support  of this bill.

As  Chair of  the House Armed Services  Subcommittee on Military Personnel  and as co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus  Task Force on Women in the Military  and Veterans, I am privileged to recognize their service.  We are all familiar with the icon of  Rosie the Riveter, working in war factories during World War II. Her motto  was, ‘‘We can do it.’’  Well, the Women Airforce Service Pilots did it, too. Almost 70 years ago,  they  became  pioneers  for women’s  equality in the armed services. As civilian pilots under the direction of the  U.S. Army Air Forces, flying noncombat missions from 1942 to 1944, they  bravely stepped into service while their  male counterparts were sent to combat.  The Women Airforce Service Pilots  are referred to as the ‘‘WASP.’’ Unlike  many acronyms used in the military,  this is an apt name. For like WASP,  their work demanded a unique combination of feistiness and strength, underlined by  loyalty  to  their  fellow  WASP and their country. They  flew  every type of military aircraft in every  kind of mission except combat. They  ferried aircraft from factories to military installations. They towed aerial  targets, transported cargo, and served  in training exercises.  There were 38 of the, roughly, 1,100  women who lost their lives during the  war. There are only about 300 surviving  WASP. I am astounded by their tenacity and by their bravery.

We had the Secretary in front of  our committee this afternoon. But one  of the things that is right is the higher  education system in America. And I  will tell you that without a system  like California’s, I wouldn’t be standing here today. I was given an opportunity to succeed. And I know so many  students in California that don’t have  the opportunity because of cost to attend a private university, get a great  education in that system. And not only  is the State of California better, America is better because of this. I would  urge my colleagues to support this. I  once again congratulate the CSU system.

With 23 campuses, 430,000 students,  and 44,000 faculty and staff, it is the  largest and most diverse university  system in the Nation.  In fact, California State University  Los Angeles is located right in my district and has been educating students  for over 50 years. I once taught there,  and I know firsthand that this is one of  the most affordable and diverse Cal  State universities in the state, if not  the Nation.  Since most Cal State LA students  come from families with incomes under  $50,000, this university plays a critical  role in making it possible for every  student to attain their dream of a college education. Many of these students  go on to successful careers in high demand fields such as nursing, IT, and  the life sciences, and help make up the  backbone of the workforce in Los Angeles County.

291,53,2010-03-03,Ms. LEE of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of House Resolution 1117 to applaud  and honor the California State University system on the occasion of its 50th anniversary.  Achieving equal access to education has always been one of my top legislative priorities  and  I am proud  to  recognize  the California  State University’s leadership in providing high-  quality,  accessible,  student-focused  higher  education to the people of California and our  nation.  The growth of the California State University  System over  the past 50 years provides an  extraordinary example of  the great success  that can come to institutions that prioritize equity and excellence. With 23 campuses, over  430,000  students, and 44,000  faculty and  staff, the California State University System is  the largest, the most diverse, and one of the  most  affordable  university  systems  in  the  country.  The California State University has a significant  impact not only on  the  regions  immediately surrounding CSU’s 23 campuses, but  on the state as a whole. Because many CSU  students remain in-state after graduation, California greatly benefits  from  the  skills and  knowledge of CSU alumni. With 91,000 annual  graduates,  the California State University  is  California’s highest producer of bachelor’s degrees and helps drive California’s economy in  fields such as  information  technology, business, and education.  Additionally, CSU students perform 32 million hours of  community  service annually,  equating to an economic impact of $624 million. CSU’s community service efforts have not  gone unnoticed, as 16 CSU campuses were  rightly named to the 2008 President’s Higher  Education Community Service Honor  roll  in  recognition  for  their  innovative and effective  community service and service-learning programs.  As  the Chair of  the Congressional Black  Caucus,  I am particularly proud  to say  that  CSU provides more  than half of all undergraduate  degrees  granted  to  California’s  Latino, African American and Native American  students. Additionally, as part of  its African  American  Initiative, CSU has partnered with  churches throughout California to bring awareness to students, parents and families about  the importance of early preparation for college.  Clearly, CSU is committed to providing an excellent education to all of California’s students.  In this challenging economic climate, the relevancy of the California State University is becoming ever more apparent. The CSU deserves continued support in its vital role in the  growth and development of California’s communities and economy. The California State  University offers unlimited opportunities to help  students  of  all  backgrounds  achieve  their  goals, and I am proud to join my colleagues  in celebrating  the achievements of  this extraordinary institution.

292,53,2010-03-03,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues  from  the California congressional delegation  today to recognize the 50th anniversary of the  California State University system.  The state’s  individual State Colleges were  incorporated into what is today known as the  California State University  system  by  the  Donahoe Higher Education Act of 1960, designed as part of the California Master Plan  for Higher Education to meet the future needs  of a growing state. That bill was authored by  my father, George Miller, Jr., who served in  the State Senate for many years.  Today, the campuses of the Cal State system can be found throughout California, and  they make up the country’s largest and most  diverse  university  system.  In my  district’s  backyard, CSU East Bay is providing opportunities for young people from around the Bay  Area, preparing them for the future.  I am pleased to recognize the 50th anniversary of the California State University system,  and I look forward to working with the CSU  system and others in California and across the  country to make college more affordable and  accessible for students today and for generations to come.  ",2010
293,53,2010-03-03,Mr. HONDA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  congratulate the California State University on  its 50th anniversary. I am a proud alumnus of  the CSU system—I earned my bachelor’s degrees in biological sciences and Spanish, and  my master’s degree  in education  from San  Jose State University. The California State  University, the largest state university system  in the nation, plays a significant role in California’s success, with graduates numbering one  in every  ten members of California’s workforce. The California State University is also  on the forefront of ensuring the opportunity to  receive a quality college education  for  the  state’s  increasingly diverse population. With  23 distinct campuses, from my alma mater in  San Jose to CSU Long Beach and the California Maritime Academy in Vallejo, the CSU  system brings higher education  to a diverse  student body of nearly 400,000 students every  year. In 2002–03, more than half of all undergraduate degrees granted  to Latino, African  American and Native American students  in  California were awarded by the CSU.

294,60,2010-03-03,Mr. BISHOP of Utah.," I appreciate  being able to join the gentleman from  Missouri here, and I appreciate his efforts  so  far  in  explaining  the  differences in these particular bills.  I want to echo that I agree with you  that we are in a precarious situation.  There are those who would tell us that  the most important thing we could do  right now is to pass something. A lot of  bad pieces of  legislation and policy  changes have happened when we have  simply  passed  something  that was  there. Our goal on this particular issue  should be to pass the right type of reform, not just something. Until we get  the right type of reform, we should  never actually quit looking to form a  way that is best in providing options  and choices to the American people.  I am assuming, when you started,  that you talked about some of the four  supposed,  alleged,  Republican  proposals  that were added  today. You  know, when I first saw that, I thought  somebody was pulling my leg. It was a  joke. I find it ludicrous and somewhat  insulting to the American people that  there are actually those who believe, if  you take a $1 trillion program which  transfers power  from  the American  people to bureaucrats in Washington,  by adding more spending  for a  few  studies and  for a  few  small,  little  tweaks here and there, that that’s actually better and that that’s going to  buy people’s support.  I think one of the things, maybe, we  have done too long in both Houses of  this Chamber, perhaps with both parties, is we’ve spoken too long about it.  We’ve been giving speech after speech  as if that’s going to convince Americans to go along with this program.  What we should do now is listen to the  reasons Americans  have  complaints  about the core program that is before  us.  I appreciate what you’re doing up  there. You’re going through some of  the core problems  in this particular  bill—that a few little add-ons, which  cost even more money, are not going to  sell this core problem issue.  If I could say just one more thing—go  ahead.  ",2010
295,60,2010-03-03,Mr. AKIN.," It sounds like what you’re  saying is that you can chrome-plate a  pig, but it’s still a pig when you’re  done. Go ahead. Yes.  ",2010
296,60,2010-03-03,Mr. BISHOP of Utah.," I’ve actually  been trying to think of a lot of metaphors here, and I don’t think any of  them really work terribly well.  Except I do remember one time when  my oldest kid was about 3 or 4. He had  been given a candy bar and was supposed to participate in a program, and  he didn’t want to go up and join the  other kids in the program. So I took  his candy bar away. I said, If you go up  there and perform, I’ll give you a candy  bar. Of course, he was dumb enough to  accept that, and he waddled right up  there and did the program, and I gave  him his candy bar back.  I hope that people don’t think, just  by giving me my candy bar back, I’m  going to buy this program, because the  program hasn’t changed. It is still fundamentally flawed.  A reporter just asked me, Don’t you  think these bills should have an up-  down vote? Well, here in the House, everything is an up-down vote.  Also, the bills that have been introduced by Representative SHADEGGand  by Representative PRICE have a different approach to solving the problem  and to reforming our system, which is  based on giving power to the people so  that people can make choices. Representative AKIN, I think they deserve  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:40 Mar 04, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K03MR7.110 H03MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2010
297,67,2010-03-03,Mr. AKIN.," So what you are really  talking about is a mandate, isn’t it?  This  is  a mandate  that  says  that  you’ve got  to buy  the government  product.  ",2010
298,67,2010-03-03,Mr. GOHMERT.," That’s exactly right.  And I know the President before us  mentioned—well, you know, States require you to buy car insurance. The  fact is, you buy insurance for the privilege, as the  law has determined, to  drive on the road. You don’t have to  drive just to live in America. If this  bill passes, you will have to buy insurance just to live in America, or you  will be fined; you will be hammered  with the extra amount of money you  will have to pay.  And let me finish one other thing  about that insurance. There is no State  in the United States of America that  requires anyone to insure their car for  damages to their own car or damages  physically to themselves. The only requirement in any State is for insurance  to cover against the damage you may  do to someone else. So once again, this  will be breaking brand-new ground,  never done in history, not envisioned  by the Constitution, not anywhere in  the enumerated powers. You have to  buy insurance on yourself just to live.  So I yield to my friend.  ",2010
299,67,2010-03-03,Mr. AKIN.," Well, actually, you got to  the point that I was going to ask. I  know that you are not only an attorney, but you have also served as a  judge, as well as a Congressman that  we’ve come to respect. And so what I  was going to ask is, is it constitutional  for  the Federal Government  to  tell  somebody that they have to buy insurance this way? And what I’m thinking  I’m hearing you say is that this would  be something,  if the Supreme Court  would look at it—and I know you don’t  know exactly how they think or what  they’re going to rule, but if you use the  basis of the Constitution, this would be  marginally and maybe not constitutional. Is that what I’m hearing you  saying?  ",2010
300,67,2010-03-03,Mr. GOHMERT.," If the Supreme Court  takes a fair and literal look at the Constitution, they will know this was not  an enumerated power reserved to the  Federal Government. Therefore, under  the 10th Amendment, it’s reserved to  the States and the people.  I would like to point out one other  thing. In this article that was already  out, that came out so quickly after the  President’s  speech  today—it’s  from  CNN. It can be found on the CNN Web  site. But they point out that the President is proposing four different things.  First of all, combating waste,  fraud  and abuse, and I will come back to  that. But this article says: ‘‘Obama is  also  considering  a  Republican-supported idea to appropriate $50 million  to help States find alternative resolutions to medical malpractice disputes,  including health costs.’’  Well, when  this  information came  out  today  during  the  President’s  speech, I was in a meeting with about  50 other Republican Members of Congress, and I couldn’t believe that statement. He said this was a Republican  idea, and he said, You know, we’re embracing this Republican idea.  I want to know which one of my moronic Republican friends proposed such  a ridiculous program as that. Nobody  knew of any Republican who proposed  that. I know the President wouldn’t  lie, but I’m sure there is a Republican  somewhere  in  the  country—maybe  somebody that deems themselves half  socialist, half Republican  that proposed this. I can’t find anybody who  knows of a Member in Congress who  has proposed this bill because we don’t  need to give the Secretary of Health  and Human Services $50 million, $50  billion or one red dime to come up with  a way to help States find alternative  resolutions  for medical malpractice  disputes. That’s already in the House  bill, and what this provides is a fund  for the Secretary of Health and Human  Services  to bribe States—that’s my  word. Any State that has a cap on attorneys’ fees or a cap on noneconomic  damages, the Secretary is authorized  to pay whatever sums are necessary, in  her  opinion,  basically  to  reward  a  State that gets rid of any caps like  that. That’s what it boils down to.  ",2010
301,67,2010-03-03,Mr. AKIN.," That’s the punitive damages, right?  ",2010
302,67,2010-03-03,Mr. GOHMERT.," No. Actually, pain  and suffering is noneconomic damages.  So attorneys’ fees and things like pain  and suffering, which is hard to put a  figure on.  ",2010
303,67,2010-03-03,Mr. AKIN.," So we have got not tort  reform but reverse tort reform, where  the States that have enacted tort reform and have  reduced  the cost of  health care accordingly are now going  to be told that they’re going to have to  reverse that legislation so there is a  tort reform. Isn’t this the reverse?  ",2010
304,67,2010-03-03,Mr. GOHMERT.," Well, the gentleman  is accurate. It is the reverse, but the  States are not going to be told, You  have to get rid of your caps. We have  already seen in Texas and California  medical malpractice  insurance  rates  come plummeting down.  ",2010
305,67,2010-03-03,Mr. AKIN., Missouri has enacted the  same thing. We’ve had the same experience. It’s dropped the cost of health  care.  ,2010
306,67,2010-03-03,Mr. GOHMERT.,"  I’m sure the gentleman then would agree there is no  need for further study or to try to look  for ways to have alternative resolutions to medical malpractice disputes.  We’ve seen what works, and yet it’s not  going to force States to get rid of their  caps on pain and suffering or attorneys’ fees. It merely will allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to generously reward any State that  will get rid of their caps on damages  and attorneys’ fees.  Let me also mention this, that  is  only one of the proposals. Another is  that health care exchange plans are  what  is being proposed  in this supposedly cut-down bill. The health care  exchange plan is the skeletal structure  that allows the government to take  over health care. So to say it’s scaled  back, you know, the snake is still in  there. It’s just going to have to go a  little further to bite you. So this is not  a good proposal. It’s not a fair proposal.  And one other thing  in the President’s speech that I thought was very  unfair, he says, On the other end of the  spectrum, there are those—and this includes most Republicans in Congress.  Now I prefer to speak for myself and  not have somebody who profoundly disagrees with me tell me what I believe.  But according to this, the President’s  speech, this includes most Republicans  in Congress who believe the answer is  to loosen regulations on the insurance  industry.  The gentleman from Missouri and I  have been on this floor many times,  and in the last 5 years—particularly  that I’ve been here, I know the gentleman’s been here longer than I have—  but repeatedly I know we have all said,  I don’t want the government between  me and my doctor, and I want the insurance company restricted so they’re  not between me and my doctor. I don’t  want the insurance company to just  run amok and run wild. I want us to  get back to a doctor-patient relationship.  So when somebody speaks for us and  in the next paragraph, the President  says, I don’t believe—as opposed to the  crazy Republicans he mentioned  in  paragraph  four—I  don’t  believe we  should give government bureaucrats or  insurance company bureaucrats more  control over health care in America,  we’ve been saying that same thing for  years. We agree on that. We don’t want  the government, we don’t want insurance companies to have more control  over our health than we do. It’s time to  put the patients back in charge.  ",2010
307,67,2010-03-03,Mr. AKIN., Didn’t you start by saying  that there is this sort of fallacious line  of reasoning where you create a straw  horse; is that correct?  ,2010
308,67,2010-03-03,Mr. GOHMERT.," Yeah, I called it a  straw dog. A straw horse, I have heard  that used as well.  ",2010
309,67,2010-03-03,Mr. AKIN.," A straw dog or a straw  horse. And you say that your opponents think this, and then you beat it  up. Yet you and I have been here. I  have been a Republican now—this is  my 10th year. I have never heard Republicans say, We want to reduce or  relax what health insurance companies  are doing. We’ve been railing on the  fact that we don’t want them to get  somebody who is not a medical person  between a doctor and a patient. We’ve  been trying to defend that point, and  certainly we wouldn’t do what this bill  does, which allows an insurance company to get between a doctor and a patient, make a medical decision in practice and then not be held accountable  for that decision.

407,81,2010-03-03,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. President, the  amendment I want to speak on is No.  3353. This  amendment  is  extremely  simple and  it  is extremely straightforward.  At a time when millions of senior  citizens, veterans, and persons with  disabilities have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty; at a time  when the cost of prescription drugs,  medical care, and heating oil have gone  through the roof in many parts of our  country; at a time when millions of  seniors have seen the values of their  pensions, their homes, and their life  savings plummet; at a time—and here  is the important point—for the first  time in 36 years, seniors will not be receiving a COLA in their Social Security benefits.  The amendment I am offering today  with Senators DODD, LEAHY, SCHUMER,  KERRY,  WHITEHOUSE,  MIKULSKI,  GILLIBRAND, LAUTENBERG, and BEGICH  will provide over 55 million senior citizens, veterans, and persons with disabilities $250  in much needed emergency relief. This $250 emergency payment is equivalent to a 2-percent increase in benefits for the average Social Security retiree, and it is, as you  will recall, the same amount seniors  received last year as part of the Recovery Act. In other words, what we are  doing now is exactly the same as we  did last year with the Recovery Act.  I do not know about New Mexico, but  I do know that in Vermont, a lot of  senior citizens and disabled veterans  are wondering this year why they are  not receiving a COLA. They have written to my office and they are saying to  me: Hey, I don’t know what you are  talking about because my costs have  increased over the last year. That is  because, in fact, while inflation may  not have gone up  in general, those  areas elderly people and people who  have health problems utilize—prescription drugs, health care, other health-  related issues—those costs have gone  up very substantially. I think there is  an awareness all over this country that  we cannot, in the midst of this recession, turn our backs on disabled veterans and seniors.  This amendment has widespread support  from organizations representing  tens of millions of Americans. Among  the organizations that are supporting  this amendment are the AARP, the  largest senior group in America; the  American Legion, the largest veterans  group in America; the Veterans of Foreign Wars; the National Committee to  Preserve Social Security and Medicare;  the  Disabled  American  Veterans;  AMVETS and OWL and many other organizations.  Money directed to this population  will go almost immediately into the  economy. So when we talk about stimulus, I don’t know of a better way to  get money out into the economy than  passing this amendment.  I am also very happy and delighted  that President Obama is very strongly  supportive of a $250 emergency payment to seniors. As you know, the  President has spoken out on this issue,  he has also included it in his budget,  and he has also recommended that it be  included in the underlying legislation  we are debating today.  Here is what President Obama has  said about this issue:  Even as we seek to bring about recovery,  we must act on behalf of those hardest hit by  this recession. That is why I am announcing  my support for an additional $250 in emergency recovery assistance for seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities to help  them make it through these difficult times.  These payments will provide aid to more  than 50 million people in the coming year,  relief that will not only make a difference  for them, but for our economy as a whole,  complementing the tax cuts we’ve provided  working  families  and  small  businesses  through the Recovery Act. This additional  assistance will be especially important in  the coming months as countless seniors and  others have seen their retirement accounts  and home values decline as a result of this  economic crisis.  That is the end of the quote by President Obama. I very much appreciate  the President speaking out and fighting for senior citizens and the disabled  with regard to this issue.  I can tell you that just on Monday I  had a meeting with senior citizens and  senior  citizens organizations  in  the  State of Vermont. It was a very distressing meeting. When we talked, for  example, about nutrition programs, the  Meals on Wheels program or the congregate meals programs by which seniors come to senior citizens centers to  get a decent lunch, what people are  telling me is that for the first time in  many years, when seniors are asked to  put money into an envelope—and very  carefully, the senior centers don’t want  to know what people contribute. They  ask for, say, $2 or $3, but people can  contribute whatever they want. What  they are noticing now is that more and  more seniors are putting nothing into  the envelope or maybe just $1. They are  seeing the same process when people  get out in their cars and they deliver  Meals on Wheels to very fragile and  frail people, often in rural areas, and  people don’t even have the money, now,  to even pay $2 for a lunch.  All over this country, seniors are  hurting. I think they are upset and distressed that they are not getting a  COLA this year. Essentially, what this  payment is about is a substitute for a  COLA. It is a 1-year payment, and it is  the equivalent of about a  2-percent  COLA.  Let me mention the response of some  of  the  veterans  organizations. This  amendment, importantly, will be helping our disabled veterans. Here is what  the VFW said in support of this amendment:  This year, veterans and seniors will not receive a COLA. This could not come at a  worse time. Your legislation would provide a  one-time check of $250 to 1.4 million veterans, 48.9 million Social Security recipients, and 5.1 million SSI recipients. We believe that this will provide some relief to  those veterans and seniors living on fixed incomes who rely on a COLA to keep up with  daily living expenses. The VFW commends  you for concentrating on changes that can  positively  impact the  lives of others and  looks forward to working with you and your  staff to ensure passage of this legislation.  I thank the Veterans of Foreign Wars  for the great work they do and for supporting this amendment. We appreciate  their support.  Let me quote a letter I recently received from another organization that  has been very strong for many years in  fighting for senior citizen rights; that  is, the National Committee to Preserve  Social Security and Medicare. This is  what the national committee says:  The National Committee strongly urges  you to pass legislation to provide a $250 payment to our Nation’s seniors who did not receive a COLA this year. It is vitally important that we provide help for seniors of modest means who have been adversely affected  by the economic recession and rapidly rising  health care costs. Seniors have been especially hard hit by the 20 percent to 30 percent decline in the value of employer pensions, IRAs and 401(k)s, as well as the steep  drop in housing values. And, unlike younger  Americans, the elderly are much less likely  to recover their savings losses due to their  shorter economic horizon.  That is from the National Committee  to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. We very much appreciate their  support for this amendment.  Here  is a quote  from  the AARP,  which represents over 40 million Americans, and we very much appreciate  their support. This is what the AARP  says:  For over three decades, millions of Americans have counted on annual increases to  help make ends meet. In this economy, having this protection is even more critical for  the financial security of all older Americans.  AARP applauds  the President  for urging  Congress to extend for 2010 the $250 economic  relief provided to older Americans last year.  The 65-plus population is facing extreme financial hardship. Older Americans are paying more out of pocket for medical care,  have experienced a real decline in their retirement accounts and  in housing values,  face  longer periods of unemployment  for  those who need work, and low returns on interest bearing accounts. Without relief, millions of older Americans will be unable to afford skyrocketing health care and prescription drug costs as well as other basic necessities. AARP will continue to work with  Members of Congress from both sides of the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:53 Mar 04, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G03MR6.007 S03MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2010

409,88,2010-03-03,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, first, I  wish to thank Senator THUNE. He gave  me permission to speak before him. I  will be brief in my strong support for  the Murray amendment to provide $1.5  billion  for  youth  jobs  programs  through the Workforce Investment Act  for summer and year-round employment.  This amendment will help create up  to 500,000 temporary  jobs  for young  people.  We know the youth  jobs program  works. Funds included in the Recovery  Act for youth jobs provided over 300,000  young adults with employment opportunities last summer, stimulating local  economies  all  across  the  country.  Young adults who work not only help  supplement family incomes, they also  spend the money they earn in their  communities. According to the Northeastern University Center  for Labor  Market Studies, every dollar earned by  a young adult returns $3 to the local  economy.  Youth jobs programs also help disadvantaged young adults become active members of their communities.  The many  local workforce  investment groups in my State of California  not only provide disadvantaged young  adults with  short-term employment,  they also offer job training and mentoring programs, help them advance  their careers with educational opportunities, and teach critical life skills.  We also know right now there are not  enough work opportunities  for teens  and young adults. The unemployment  rate for 16- to 19-year-olds is above 25  percent. For 16 to 19-year-old African  Americans, the unemployment rate is  VerDate Nov 24 2008  00:09 Mar 04, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G03MR6.016 S03MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2010

420,102,2010-03-03,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, I wish  to discuss  two amendments, one of  which I have filed and one of which I  will file shortly. Before I do that, I  have spoken with Senator INOUYE, Senator FEINSTEIN, and some others about  something that is very important. It is  the settlement of the Cobell lawsuit.  The Cobell lawsuit has been in the Federal courts for 13 years. After a long  period of negotiation between the Secretary of the Interior, other parts of  our  Federal  Government,  and  the  plaintiffs in lawsuit, there is finally an  agreement that has been reached. The  agreement would provide $3.4 billion to  settle outstanding claims and address  issues going back well over 100 years in  which  the Federal Government was  supposed to be taking care of the trust  accounts of American Indians. Some of  those trust accounts were fleeced, stolen, and mismanaged.  This lawsuit has been going on for a  long period. The agreement settles the  claims of American Indians who lost  their money, lost their assets, and lost  their income. Many American Indians  have died during the process of this  lawsuit.  Now  that  a  settlement has  been  reached, there is an April 16 deadline.  The parties to the settlement agreement set an end date by which the Congress must act, or the parties may return to litigation. My hope is that the  Congress will be able to meet that  deadline. We really do need to put this  issue behind us. It is a sorry chapter in  this country’s history. For over a century we have mismanaged the property, income, and royalties of American Indians. All of this resulted in the  filing of a lawsuit.  I commend the Secretary of the Interior,  Secretary  Salazar,  who  has  worked so hard to reach this agreement.  Having said that, let me describe two  amendments I wish to offer to this legislation. One is an amendment I have  offered on a number of occasions over  the years. It is important to offer it  again this year and get it done.  President Obama mentioned during  his State of the Union Address that he  wanted this legislation passed by the  Congress. It  is painfully simple. My  amendment  says when an American  business shuts down its manufacturing  plant in this country, locks the doors,  fires the workers, and then moves the  jobs overseas someplace for the purpose  of selling the product they produce  overseas back into our country, they  should not get a tax break. Yet, under  today’s Tax Code, they, in fact, are rewarded with a tax break.  This amendment would end that ill-  advised tax break and say: You are not  going to be rewarded anymore in our  Tax Code by shipping jobs overseas and  then selling the product back into our  marketplace. This  should have been  corrected long ago. It should be corrected now.  The amendment I filed is amendment  No. 3375. My hope is we will be able to  debate and vote on this amendment.  I described the other day this issue  we have of trying to find new jobs and  seeing how we can incentivize the creation of new jobs in our country. About  17 million people woke up this morning  in this country without work, without  a job, and wanting a job and are going  to spend today looking for work and  not be able to find it. We are trying to  find ways to incentivize the creation of  jobs. That bill is the faucet, trying to  put more jobs in this economy.  What about the drain? What about  all these jobs leaking out of this economy to China and elsewhere? Let me  describe  some of  them,  if  I might.  These are well known. I have told other  stories on the floor many times.  Levis, the product of America. America invented Levis. People wear Levis  all around the world, except Levis are  made virtually everywhere in the world  except the United States. They are all  gone. We do not make one pair of Levis  in  the United States. Fruit of  the  Loom underwear; gone to Mexico; gone  to Asia. Samsonite went to Mexico,  then  to China. Maytag now makes  their appliances in Mexico and Korea.  Hershey’s chocolate. You know, Hershey’s chocolate advertises York Peppermint Patties and  they  say: The  cool, refreshing taste of mint dipped in  dark chocolate will  take you miles  away. Well, apparently so many miles  it ends up in Mexico—Mexico.  I have mentioned often the cookies  made by  the Nabisco Company—Fig  Newtons. If somebody says to you: How  about going to have a Mexican dinner,  just buy a package of Fig Newtons.  They left New Jersey and went to Mexico. I don’t know if it is cheaper to  shovel fig paste in Mexico than it is in  New Jersey, but it is made by a company called Nabisco. You know what  that stands for? The National Biscuit  Company. Except the national biscuit,  in this case, is made in Mexico.  Well, the list goes on and on and on.  Hallmark Cards. Hallmark Cards was  here  for a century—a privately held  Kansas City, MO, company, founded by  a high school dropout who started the  company in 1910 with a shoebox full of  postcards. He made a living by selling  them while working out of a YMCA in  Kansas City, and it became an unbelievably successful greeting card company. All of us know that. Under its  current management, despite annual  revenues, I understand, of over $4 billion, they started to move jobs from  Kansas City to three plants in China.  You know,  the company who cares  enough to send you the very best? In  this case, it sends you the very best  from China.  My point is that I understand there  are a whole lot of companies going to  search for people who work for 50 cents  an hour and whom they can work 7  days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day, and  that is better for their bottom line. It  enhances their profit when they can do  that. But when they leave America, deciding they are going to produce Etch  A Sketch in Shenzhen, China, and then  ship it back to a Walmart here in the  United States to sell—when that happens, and that town in Ohio that was  known for producing Etch A Sketch,  the little toy that all of us have used  as a child—we ought not be saying  good for you, we will give you a tax  break.

426,109,2010-03-03,Mr. BURR.," Mr. President, there is an  amendment pending by Senator SANDERS to offer a $250 stipend to seniors,  veterans, and those disabled to replace  the lack of a cost-of-living increase, a  COLA increase. As we are all aware,  the formulas that drive the cost-of-living  increase  are  predominantly  affected by inflation. With the lack of inflation, seniors, veterans, and the disabled did not receive a cost-of-living  increase for this year.  Senator SANDERS’ amendment is very  clear. He wants to provide a $250 stipend. That has broad-based  support  within the Senate body, but I think it  is responsible to say that to do this, we  should pay for it. To do this, we should  not print more money, borrow that  money just to provide a $250 check. I  think most of our Nation’s seniors, veterans, and disabled would agree with  that statement.  To ignore the fact that we are not  paying for it would be to say that we  are going to pass this stipend on to our  children and our grandchildren; that  we are going to take the money we are  going to borrow and the debt and the  obligation  for that debt and we are  going to pass it generationally down.  As a parent of a 25-year-old and a 24-  year-old, I do not think they deserve it.  At some point, I hope they are both  going to have children, and I do not  think their children deserve for me to  shove this down. And  I think most  Members of the Senate probably agree  that it is time we start paying for it.  How does  this get back? Senator  SANDERSmakes this an emergency declaration to spend. We have a lot of priorities, and there is probably not a priority that does not deserve us to pay  for  it, to  find somewhere where we  have prioritized and decided, here is  how we are going to pay for it, versus  to continue to go out and borrow.  Let me remind my colleagues, we  have the largest debt we have ever had.  It continues to climb every day. Of  every dollar we spend, we borrow 43  cents. Over the next 10 years, right now  our country is obligated at $5 trillion  in interest payments. That is trillion  with a  ‘‘t.’’ I am reminded that the  most popular bumper sticker in Washington today is  ‘‘Don’t tell Congress  what comes after a trillion.’’ I am not  sure we know yet. At the rate we are  going, we are going to find out. Do you  know who is going to be saddled with  that debt? It is going to be our children  and our grandchildren. Nobody wants  to leave our seniors, our veterans, and  the disabled without the means they  need to live. But I think even the people who are the recipients of these  checks would look at us and say: Pay  for it; don’t put it on my grandchildren  or my great grandchildren.  My amendment No. 3390 is very simple. It says this: Pay for the $250 stipend and use the unobligated stimulus  money, the money we have already appropriated. We cannot borrow it twice;  we can only borrow it once. Use the unobligated stimulus money, a little over  $14 billion—I think it is about $14.4 billion—to pay for the stipend. Let’s do  the COLA, but let’s, in fact, make sure  that COLA is paid for. The amendment  is almost identical to Senator SANDERS’ amendment which provides the  emergency benefit; it just pays for it. I  don’t think there is anything unreasonable on  that. The Congressional  Budget Office estimates the cost of the  Sanders amendment to be at 12.7 billion. I understand the Sanders amendment was modified, so that might be  slightly higher. Millions of seniors and  veterans are struggling on  fixed  incomes in this troubled economy. This  amendment also provides  them  the  ability  to get  through  those  tough  times but it also gives them the comfort of looking at their grandchildren  and their great-grandchildren and saying: I am not a burden on you because  this was paid for. We accounted for it.  Senator BUNNING came to the floor  yesterday—I  think we were  talking  about  $10 billion yesterday—and he  said: How can a country this great not  find a way to pay for $10 billion? Well,  we didn’t. And as that makes its way  through, we are going to borrow that  $10 billion, and that $10 billion is going  to equate to $10 billion of interest payments over the next 10 years. Let me  say that again. What we did yesterday  is going to compute to $10 billion worth  of interest payments over the next 10  years. No payment down of principal,  just an obligation of interest on the  debt.  Maybe some are smart enough here  to tell me exactly what the interest  rates are going to be in the open marketplace as we finance our debt 3 years,  5 years, 10 years down the road. I don’t  think  it  is going to be where  it  is  today. There is every indication it is  going higher. So when I state the number $5 trillion over the next 10 years,  you have to understand that is a static  interest rate that we have applied to it.  It is 3.45, is the projection of the Congressional Budget Office.

427,116,2010-03-03,Mr. BEGICH.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to have  filed an amendment  that would give Alaska Native corporations, ANCs, parity for an important  tax incentive encouraging the permanent protection of  land through the  charitable donation of a conservation  easement.  America’s wildlife, waters, and land  are an invaluable part of our Nation’s  heritage. It is imperative to preserve  these natural treasures for future generations. Congress long ago concluded  that it was good public policy to encourage the charitable contribution of  conservation easements  to organizations dedicated to maintaining natural  habitats or open spaces help protect  the Nation’s heritage. A conservation  easement creates a legally enforceable  land preservation agreement between a  willing landowner and another organization. The purpose of a conservation  easement  is  to protect permanently  land  from certain  forms of development or use. The property that is the  subject to the easement remains the  private property of the landowner. The  organization  holding  the  easement  must monitor future uses of the land to  ensure compliance with the terms of  the easement and to enforce the terms  if a violation occurs.  In 2006, Congress enhanced the charitable tax deduction  for conservation  easements in order to encourage such  gifts. With the 2006 legislation, Congress temporarily increased the maximum deduction limit for individuals  donating qualified conservation easements from 30 percent to 50 percent of  the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income.  Congress also created an exception for  qualified  farmers or ranchers, which  are nonpublicly traded corporations or  individuals whose gross income from  the trade or business of  farming  is  greater than 50 percent of the taxpayer’s gross income. In the case of a  qualified farmer or rancher, the limitation increased from 30 percent to 100  percent. The 2008  farm bill extended  the temporary rules for 2 additional  years to charitable contributions made  before December 31, 2009.  Unfortunately, the way the law was  crafted has disadvantaged a number of  important  landowners  in my  home  State.  Alaska  Native  corporations,  ANCs, own nearly 90 percent of the private land in Alaska, including some of  the most  scenic and  resource  rich.  However, although they are very similar  to  the  small  communal  family  farms that are eligible, subsistence-  based Alaskan Native communities are  ineligible for these important new tax  incentives. For  thousands  of years,  Alaska has been home to Native communities, whose  rich heritages,  languages, and traditions have thrived in  the region’s unique  landscape. Members of Alaska Native  communities  continue to have a deeply symbiotic relationship with the land even today.  Much like their ancestors, many Native Alaskan communities engage  in  traditional subsistence activities, with  nearly 70 percent of their food coming  from the land or adjacent waters. For  many communities, subsistence is an  economic necessity considering both  the lack of economic development and  the cost and difficulty involved in purchasing food. For example, in Kotzebue  a community in northwestern Alaska,  milk costs nearly $10 per gallon. In  Buckland, a village home to approximately 400 people, a pound of hamburger—when it is actually available—  costs $14.  In Alaska, the Native corporations  have an important role to be stewards  of  the  land. Their  shareholders  see  themselves as the caretakers of the  land and water as their ancestors have  for thousands of years. Nonetheless, in  Alaska today this means they have to  balance the need for resource development and the need to cultivate the  land for subsistence activities. The traditional lifestyles of Native Alaskans  are under increasing stress from outside influences. Population growth and  the pressure to pursue cash-generating  activities have increased the desire for  substantial development, significantly  adding to the ecological stress on already fragile ecosystems. Without permanent protection, their lands could be  developed in a manner that would destroy its ability to support the traditional ways and subsistence lifestyles  crucial  to Alaskan Native  communities. Making use of tax  incentives  available  to  other Americans will  make it easier for Native communities  to make the right decisions for their  shareholders.  Today, Alaska Native communities  are not eligible for the 50 percent deduction available  to  individuals because they are federally chartered as C  corporations under the Alaska Native  Claims Settlement Act of 1971, ANCSA.  This leaves Alaska Natives without the  ability to convert to an eligible entity  as other landowners can. In addition,  most Alaska Native corporations do  not have sufficient gross income from  the trade or business of what is considered traditional farming to be eligible  for the 100 percent deduction available  to qualified farmers or ranchers. This  is in spite of the fact that as a group  the Alaska Native  shareholders  of  Alaska Native corporations receive far  more in subsistence benefits than they  receive in income from the Alaska Native Corporation. As a result, Alaska  Native corporations do not have the  same ability to offset the cost to permanently  protect  their  properties,  which contain important wildlife, fish,  and other habitats, through donations  of qualified conservation easements.  This amendment will allow Alaska  Native corporations to protect these  important wildlife habitats, many used  for subsistence, by providing an enhanced deduction  for qualified  conservation easements. The amendment  modifies section 170(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code by creating a new  subsection that provides Alaska Native  corporations with a deduction for donations of certain qualified conservation  easements. In order to be eligible, a  qualified charitable conservation contribution must:  (1) otherwise qualify  under section 170(h)(1); (2) be made by a  Native corporation; and (3) be land that  was conveyed by ANCSA. The corporations would be limited to 10 percent of  their  land allotment under ANCSA.  Under section 170(b)(2)(iii)(I),  ‘‘Native  Corporation’’ is defined by ANCSA, section 3(m). Under section 170(b)(2)(i), the  maximum deduction limit would be set  at 100 percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. If the taxpayer  has deductions in excess of the applicable  percentage-of-income  limitation,  section  170(b)(2)(ii) would allow  the  taxpayer to carry-forward the deduction for up to 15 years.  Congress must act to assist Alaska  Native  communities  in permanently  protecting  their  culturally,  historically, and ecologically significant land,  preserving the communities and their  rich traditions in the process. I urge  my colleagues to support this important amendment.  f  MORNING BUSINESS  ",2010

431,123,2010-03-03,Mr. REID.," Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased to introduce bipartisan legislation that will protect the unique ecosystems of the American West from the  harmful effects of invasive, non-native  species. I am joined by my cosponsors  Senators BEGICH, BENNETof Colorado,  BENNETTof Utah, FEINSTEIN, MERKLEY,  MURKOWSKI, and WYDEN.  The Invasive Species Emergency Response Fund provides resources to prevent the  introduction and spread of  harmful invasive species; protect susceptible habitats; and establish early  detection and rapid response capabilities to combat incipient invasive species populations.  As global climate change patterns  shift, particular habitats in the West  will be especially vulnerable to the impacts  of new  species  introductions.  Hence, the new paradigms in invasive  species management provided via this  legislation are critically needed. When  it comes to invasive species management, history is replete with examples  illustrating the adage that ‘‘an ounce  of prevention  is worth a pound of  cure.’’  The impact of invasive species in the  U.S. is now widespread. More than 6,500  non-native, invasive species have become established populations throughout the U.S. Studies show that the  damage caused by these pests and their  associated  control  costs  total more  than $100 billion annually. The unique  ecologies of the West are particularly  vulnerable to their harmful effects.  My home State of Nevada is at the  center of this ecological storm. Non-  native species decrease rangeland capacity;  lower water  tables;  reduce  water quality; increase fuel loads; and  displace  native  plants  and wildlife  habitats. Some in the environmental  community have identified the Great  Basin as the third most endangered  ecosystem in the U.S. due, in part, to  the dominance of invasive species.  Moreover, once invasive species have  gained a foothold in Western States,  they exacerbate other critical issues,  including water quantity and quality,  and wildfire. Zebra mussels  in Lake  Mead are poised to wreak havoc on the  lake’s water quality. Tamarisk’s long  tap roots infiltrate deep water tables,  exploiting up to 200 gallons of water  per tree per day. Millions of acres of  cheatgrass  and  beetle-killed  trees  stand ready to burn if sparked. In fact,  the fire cycle in the Great Basin has  shortened from 25–50 years to only 3–5  years as a direct result of the take-over  of invasive weeds.  These few examples underscore the  need for this long overdue legislation.  State and local agencies and organizations that fight invasive species need  access to resources when a new threat  is identified, not when funds are available  based  on  bureaucratic  budget  cycle.  The revolving  loan program established with this bill will provide qualified organizations with the resources  they need to tackle  invasive species  threats within 90 days. The Secretary  of the Interior will ensure that these  funds are being used for appropriate  projects based on vetted review criteria.  Bark beetles, quagga mussels, and  Medusahead have no respect for budget  cycles or State lines. Hence, I urge my  colleagues to support this critical legislation. It is paramount if we want to  protect our unique Western landscape.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 3063  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of the United States of America  in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

Each year, millions of animals, mostly  cats and dogs, are euthanized due to over–  population and  the  lack of people willing  to  adopt them, at the same time that many animals are bred for the sole purpose of being  bought and sold at pet stores.  Lauren, originally from Texas, went to college in West Virginia. She graduated with a  degree in Public Relations. It was there that  she met her Great Dane, Harley. Now 6, Harley is her traveling companion on this cross  country journey.  Beginning on March 1st  in New Jersey,  Lauren, who resigned from her job at a Fortune 10 company in order to pursue her commitment to rescue dogs, will visit over 56 cities  in her travels across the country, organizing  events and benefits to raise money and educate people about Great Danes and rescue  dogs. All of the proceeds that are raised will  be donated  to rescues and shelters around  the country.  She is able to take on this worthy cause because of  the  kindness or her  family and  friends. In addition, complete strangers have  been able to follow Lauren on her adventures  through her Web site and her Twitter account.  Madam Speaker, Lauren O’Connor is venturing on an experience of a lifetime. Her trip  across  the country  to  raise awareness and  money for rescue dogs is inspiring to us all  and I would like to commend Lauren on her  commitment to this very worthy cause.  f  IN TRIBUTE TO REPRESENTATIVE  JOHN P.

He won respect for the honest, plainspoken,  compassionate way he played all of  these  roles.  But  to me, he played  brother.  He spoke often of the strong women in his  family being essential to his success in life.  His great-grandmother, he once  recalled,  told him at age 6, ‘‘You’re put on this Earth to  make a difference.’’  Boy, did he ever.  like a  those  roles  in  the  first  He volunteered as a Marine,  1950s during the Korean war.  He re-enlisted at age 34 and served in Vietnam—earning  the Bronze Star,  two Purple  Hearts, and  the Vietnamese Cross  for Gallantry.  He became the first Vietnam veteran to be  elected to Congress, in a February 1974 special election, starting a legendary Washington  career as a member of  the Appropriations  Committee.  When I came to this chamber for the first  time,  the  ‘‘Pennsylvania Corner’’ was  in  full  flower. We grew close and even though we  didn’t agree on everything, we worked  together often—on  issues ranging  from breast  cancer research  funding  to  the  Intrepid Museum on the Hudson.  When he decided  that  the  Iraq war was  unwinnable in 2005, he earned his stripes all  over again, providing leadership on this crucial  issue. He visited my district, and so many others, explaining how he came to his decision.  Madam Speaker, as a Congressman, Jack  Murtha won respect in these halls and on this  floor . . . but as a man, he earned our love.  We will miss him.  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife  Joyce, and the entire Murtha family.  f  RECOGNIZING DAVE ANDERSON  HON.

434,228,2010-03-03,Mr. PAULSEN.," Madam Speaker,  this past  August, Dave Anderson of Minnetonka was  selected  into  the Multiple Sclerosis Society  Volunteer Hall of Fame  for Programs and  Services. He has been serving as vice president of MSWorld, an organization whose goal  is to be a national source of support and information  for  those  living with MS.  In addition,  Dave founded the Brainerd Lakes Chapter of  ‘‘Fishing Has No Boundaries,’’ which provides  people with MS a weekend of fishing and socializing. I would like to recognize Dave Anderson for his commitment to improving communication between those in the MS community, as well as  for  integrating social networking into the lives of people with multiple  sclerosis.  f  HON. LYNN C. WOOLSEY  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 3, 2010  ",2010
435,228,2010-03-03,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor former Mann County counsel  Douglas Maloney who passed away on February 17, 2010 at his home  in San Rafael,  California. Serving on  the  legal  frontlines of  county government for more than three decades, Marin has greatly benefited from his unwavering dedication and skilled advocacy of  the public’s best interest.  Born  in  San  Francisco  in  1933, Mr.  Maloney, a 50–year member of the California  Bar Association, received his bachelor’s degree from the California Maritime Academy in  Vallejo, California, and his  law degree  from  the University of San Francisco. A world traveler,  voracious  reader,  exceptional  public  speaker, and a prolific writer, Doug Maloney  loved life!  It was Doug Maloney who led the county’s  legal defense of the ‘‘Marin-only’’ provision in  Ross philanthropist Beryl Buck’s multi-million-  dollar bequest. Maloney took on the San Francisco Foundation’s challenge to spend the millions on needs beyond  the county borders.  With an outstanding legal team, he presented  strong arguments upholding the Buck bequest  and proving  that, despite Marin’s affluence,  there were plenty of needs right in the county  that could use financial assistance. The 1986  court-approved  settlement  transferred  the  Buck Trust to newly formed Marin Community  Foundation  to  focus  funds on  research  into  aging, advocacy against alcohol abuse and research into educational issues. Had that battle  been lost, Marin would be a far different place.  The legal engineer of land-use restrictions  that saved West Marin from suburban sprawl,  Maloney successfully defended  the county’s  1972 zoning restrictions designed to preserve  and protect West Marin  farmland and  the  ranching  lifestyle.  Challenged  in  1989,  Maloney won a federal court decision upholding the zoning restrictions and turning back a  lawsuit by a Chicago  landowner wanting  to  carve up his 561-acre Nicasio ranch. While we  may take our open space and ranch lands for  granted, we owe a huge debt of gratitude to  the vision, political courage and legal skill of  Douglas Maloney.  A man of great personal integrity and not  one to back away from a rousing legal argument, Doug was good humored and a passionate follower of film and stage. He enjoyed  rewriting  fashionable Broadway  shows and  stage musicals, putting on a Marin spin and  political satire  to benefit  local causes, complete with titles like, ‘‘As the Candidate Turns,’’  ‘‘Damn Yuppies’’ and ‘‘Caucus Line.’’ A popular  op-ed  columnist  for  the Marin  Independent Journal, readers enjoyed his musings  and appreciated his skill at weaving literature,  history, politics, opinion and  the proverbial  Marin angle into his biweekly essays.  Doug Maloney was a devoted husband and  father. In addition to his sister, Marion Berger  of Redding, California, Mr. Maloney is survived  by his wife of twenty-two years, Ellen Caulfield  of San Rafael, Marin County, six children, ten  grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, Douglas Maloney will be  missed by so many who shared in his work  and vision. A man of letters and the law, he  practiced what he preached. It is fitting to recognize his extraordinary efforts on behalf of  Marin County and its residents. I join the many  people who will miss Doug Maloney’s inspiration, friendship, bright spirit, and clever quotes  delivered with perfect timing and meaning.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

As a graduate of LSU medical school, I can  attest to the excellence and professionalism of  the faculty and to the spirited campus atmosphere that is rivaled by few in the world.  LSU continues capturing  the hearts of  its  students just as it was since it first opened its  doors in 1860. It is a place with a unique culture,  rich  in  tradition and quality. Originally  serving as a war college, LSU has grown into  the flagship university of Louisiana.  Through  its  seven  institutions  of  higher  learning, as well as its distinguished faculty,  LSU prepares countless students for the careers of distinction  in Louisiana and around  the world. LSU also celebrates a number of  athletic achievements, including football, basetrack and  field national championball, and  ships.  In addition to its academic and athletic successes, the LSU system goes above and beyond to serve the people of Louisiana. From  its tireless efforts in the aftermath of the 2005  hurricanes to its various community outreach  programs, LSU makes a great deal of difference in the many communities it serves.  Throughout the years, LSU has persevered  to become one of the leading educational institutions in the country. It continues to uphold  excellence at every level and sets a very worthy goal of reaching the upper level of national  prominence by the end of 2010.  It  is my pleasure  to  recognize Louisiana  State University and join with the thousands of  current students and alumni to celebrate 150  years of excellence.

439,235,2010-03-03,Mr. COHEN.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor  the  life of physician Linkwood Williams, a famed Tuskegee Flight instructor and  Memphis physician. He was born to Mr. and  Mrs. Elbert and Bessie McNeal Williams on  August 29, 1918 in Bonita, Louisiana. At the  age of  three, he and his  family moved  to  Madison,  Illinois where he attended school  through  the  twelfth grade,  then worked with  his father at a local steel mill.  Having encouragement  from his  father  to  pursue higher education, Dr. Williams applied  and was accepted to study industrial arts at  Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, which was one  of six colleges where pilot training was offered  and the only facility in the country for training  black military pilots. After two years of studying, he decided to pursue full-time training in  the Civilian Pilots Training Program, a program that would prepare him to quickly adapt  to military aviation in the event of a national  emergency. Successfully progressing through  all Civilian Pilots Training courses, Dr. Williams became part of  the Tuskegee Experience and went on to train many of the 450 pilots who served in the 332nd Fighter Group.  The Tuskegee Airmen were the first combat  group of African American pilots and flew with  distinction during World War II.  At the end of the war, Dr. Williams married  Katie Whitney, moved to Cleveland, Ohio, and  became the third African-American to join the  carpenters union. He later enrolled at Western  Reserve University  to complete  the required  pre-med courses for acceptance into medical  school. Afterwards, he applied to and was accepted to Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. During the third year of his  residency, he was hired as a part-time instructor to teach Air Force ROTC cadets at Tennessee State University.  After completing his residency, Dr. Linkwood  Williams moved to Memphis, Tennessee and  began his OB–GYN practice, becoming  the  first African American OB–GYN in the city. He  worked  for 31 years until his  retirement  in  1995.  Dr. Linkwood Williams was a member of  Mississippi Boulevard Christian Center, where  he served in the Community Outreach Group,  the American Medical Association, The Memphians,  Kappa  Alpha  Psi  Fraternity,  and  Sigma Pi Phi (Delta). Dr. Linkwood Williams  passed away surrounded by his family on Saturday, February 20, 2010 and was laid to rest  on Saturday, February 27, 2010. He was 91  years old. Dr. Williams truly left his mark on  the world through his service to the citizens of  Memphis, Tennessee. We are grateful to have  had the pleasure of his dedication and perseverance in the community.  f  REMEMBERING FRANK SARRIS  HON. TIM MURPHY  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 3, 2010  ",2010
440,235,2010-03-03,Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania.," Madam  Speaker, the people of Southwestern Pennsylvania lost an icon when Frank Sarris, founder  of Sarris Candies, passed away Monday. A  half century ago when Frank presented his  sweetheart Athena with a box of chocolates, a  loving Greek-American family and a chocolate  empire were born.  After giving Athena  the chocolates, Frank  kept thinking he could make a tastier product.  He went  to work  in  the basement of his  Canonsburg home cooking up sweet desserts  for friends and family. Word quickly spread of  Frank’s delicious concoctions. To keep up with  the demand, Frank had to quit his day job as  a forklift operator.  Once the people of Southwestern Pennsylvania  tasted Sarris Candies,  their collective  sweet  tooth  could not be  satisfied. Frank  moved out of his basement and opened a  shop next  to his home. Eventually, he  tore  down his home, built a bigger chocolate factory, and moved into an apartment above it.  As his chocolate delectables grew  in popularity, Frank soon became known as ‘‘Candy  Man’’ throughout Canonsburg and beyond.  The only son of Greek  immigrants, Frank  used his success to give back to the community.  If  there was  a  charitable  event  in  Canonsburg, Frank could be counted on  to  donate chocolate or financial support. Children  all across Pennsylvania sell Sarris Candies to  raise money for school, sports, and clubs. And  one does not have  to  travel  far  to  find evidence of Frank’s philanthropy. His legacy includes  the Frank Sarris Outpatient Clinic  to  care for organ transplant patients, the Sarris  Clinical Endowment to fund science research,  and  the Frank Sarris Public Library.  In one  way or another, Frank has touched the life of  every person in Canonsburg.  Generations  of Southwestern Pennsylvanians have tasted and loved Sarris Candies.  Today,  parents who  grew  up  on  Sarris  Candies take their children to the Sarris Chocolate Factory and Ice Cream Parlour. You can  see the eyes of each child light up when the  homemade ice cream covered with Sarris toppings is placed before them. At that moment,  each parent remembers what it is like to be a  kid again.  Frank will be missed, but his memory will  live on every time a person takes a bite from  a Sarris candy bar or a small child walks in to  the  Ice Cream Parlour  for  the  first  time  to  order a sundae. Sweet dreams, Frank.

And I would like to recognize  her family who is sitting in the gallery  with us this morning.  Madam Speaker, at the young age of  21, Geraldine was one  of  the  first  women in history trained to fly American military aircraft. Her call to serve  did not end after her military career.  Geraldine also prevailed in her second  battle, the one to achieve full veteran  status for her WASP sisters.  Today, I also honor Geraldine as the  mother of nine wonderful children and  a community leader who advocated on  behalf of several worthy causes.  Madam Speaker, later today, Geraldine and other WASP pioneers will be  awarded the Congressional Gold Medal  for their invaluable service more than  60 years ago. Unfortunately, Geraldine  passed away in 2001 and cannot be here  to receive the award in person, but I  am very happy that her family will  proudly represent her at the ceremony.  Madam Speaker, Geraldine is a true  American hero and a great source of  pride for the 17th Congressional District of Illinois, and I can think of no  better recognition of her services to  this country than the Congressional  Gold Medal.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  CUELLAR).

445,8,2010-03-10,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 1  minute to the majority leader, the gentleman  from Maryland  (Mr. HOYER),  who joined us on this civil rights pilgrimage. I was so proud to be with him.  He  is  one  of  the most  constant  attendees, and it reflects on his character that he goes and participates.  ",2010
446,8,2010-03-10,Mr. HOYER.," I thank my friend for  yielding, and I thank the ranking Republican for his comments. I thank Mr.  COHEN for his leadership on this issue.  ‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,  that they are endowed by their Creator  with certain unalienable Rights, that  among these are Life, Liberty and the  pursuit of Happiness.’’  So spoke our Founding Fathers. Our  Founding  Fathers  spoke,  however,  without a clear understanding of the  impact of their words. Even as great as  our Founding Fathers were, they did  not live out the promise of those words  in this land. Some were slave owners.  Clearly, the contradiction between our  words and the actions of our day-to-  day lives were a contradiction from our  stated values to our practices.  Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.,  called  America’s attention to that paradox,  to that contradiction, to that schizophrenic life that we had led. Martin  Luther King, Jr., had a lieutenant who  was a giant of a leader in his own right,  and we are honored to serve with him;  in my view, the most historic figure  that serves among the 535 of us who  have been given the privilege to represent our people and defend the Constitution and protect and preserve our  democracy. JOHN is  a  giant  among us; a quiet, self-effacing, humble giant, but a giant nonetheless.  Forty-five years ago, civil rights activists attempted to march from Selma  to Montgomery to demand that their  Governor honor their right to vote and  their God-given equality. Remember  Jefferson’s words, that our rights are  not given by the majority. They are  not given by Congress. They are not  even given by the Constitution. They  are given to us by a power higher than  us. That is the glory of America, that  every individual is an important being,  endowed by their Creator with certain  unalienable rights.  The world knows what happened to  those marchers; how they were stopped  by State  troopers  at  the Edmund  Pettus Bridge in Selma, how they were  savagely beaten with nightsticks, and  how this 23-year-old giant, whose name  was then not known, this young man  from Troy, Alabama, JOHNLEWIS, who  was helping to lead the march from the  front with Hosea Williams, was beaten  to the ground and took life-threatening  injuries.  Today, as a Member of Congress,  JOHNLEWISstill bears those scars, but  he does not bear resentment. What a  lesson  for all of us who suffer the  verbal slings and arrows almost daily  in this public profession which we pursue.  But JOHNLEWIStook more than rhetorical slings and arrows. He was beatLEWIS en, subjected to hate, spit upon, subjected to prejudice and division and  segregation and  rejection. But  still,  Christ-like,  following  Gandhi’s example,  turned  the other  cheek and said, I seek justice, and I  will continue to seek justice for myself  and for others, no matter the opposition.  LEWIS,  JOHN b1100  I will not do so violently. I will not  do so by assaulting those who assault  me. But I will appeal to the conscience  of the Nation.  I will appeal to the  promise in our declaration, in our Constitution, and  in  the principles  for  which this Nation stands. And it was a  powerful appeal.  This weekend, I and others—Mr. CAO  was with us—were privileged to walk  with that giant of a man, JOHNLEWIS,  across that bridge. It is a bridge across  a river, but it is also a bridge to brotherhood; a bridge to a realization of  America’s promise; a bridge to a better  America; a bridge to a better country;  a bridge, as my friend and brother JOHN  LEWISwould say, to the beloved community; a bridge, then, over troubled  waters, who have to some degree been  stilled, but not silenced.  There is still prejudice in this land.  There  is still division  in this  land.  There  is still not the reconciliation  that America still strives for. And that  is why I return almost every year with  my  friend JOHNLEWIS to walk over  that bridge, to remind myself—and I  have taken my granddaughter to remind her as well—that although the  mission of Martin Luther King, Jr.,  was extraordinarily successful, and the  mission of JOHN LEWIS, which continues to this day, has been successful,  it is not over. The mission and the  commitment must continue. That  is  what we must remember on this anniversary of March 7, 1965, when a group  of our fellow citizens peacefully walked  to register to vote. Is there any more  sacred  right  in  a  democracy  than  that—the ability to express your opinion, unbowed by government or unbowed or dissuaded by threats? That  was JOHNLEWIS’s mission then. He was  so successful. But the mission is not  over. And as we vote on this resolution,  we ought to all commit ourselves to  walking with the wind of justice, of  which JOHNLEWIS spoke, of which he  has written. But, much more importantly, the life that he has led teaches  us the power of conscience, the power  of peacefully standing up for the rights  of  which  Jefferson  spoke:  the  unalienable rights of life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness.  God has blessed America through the  life of JOHNLEWISand so many others  whose courage and convictions have  made us better. Support this resolution. But, more than that, live out its  promise for all of our citizens.  ",2010

448,8,2010-03-10,Mr. CAO.," Mr. Speaker, today, I rise  in support of House Concurrent Resolution 249 to commemorate the 45th anniversary of Bloody Sunday and the role  that it played in ensuring the passage  of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Today, we remember a momentous  occasion in our history. On March 7,  1965, 600 marchers, led by my esteemed  colleague from Georgia, Congressman  JOHNLEWIS, were savagely attacked by  State and  local police as  they attempted to cross the Edmund Pettus  Bridge  into Selma, Alabama. These  brave marchers used the power of nonviolence to demand that most basic of  democratic  rights of a  citizen:  the  right to vote. In return, the marchers  were met with billy clubs and tear gas.  But  the marchers confronted  terror  with courage. Their dignity in the face  of brutality moved this House to pass  the Voting Rights Act, which  reaffirmed  this Nation’s  commitment  that every citizen has the right to participate fully in the political life of the  Nation.  This past weekend, my family and I  traveled to Selma to honor the 45th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. Kate, my  wife, our two daughters, Betsy and Sophia, and I marched from Brown Chapel  to the top of Edmund Pettus Bridge.  Along the way, not only did we learn of  the significance of the march, but also  the love and admiration that the people still have for the historical marchers. Among those was JOHNLEWIS. I  commented  then and  firmly believe  today that I owe so much of my personal  and  political  success  to  the  struggles of the African American community. Because of their perseverance  and sacrifice, doors have been opened  permanently to every minority community in America.  Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to have  been a part of this momentous commemoration, to work with dedicated  public servants  like my good  friend  from Georgia, and I ask my colleagues  to support this important resolution.

We  left Brown  Chapel AME  Church that afternoon on a sacred mission, prepared to defy the dictates of  man to demonstrate the truth of a  higher law.

451,15,2010-03-10,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of this  legislation, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, additional permanent  bankruptcy judgeships have not been  authorized  since  1992. The  Judicial  Conference has requested more judgeships several times and the House has  passed legislation to add them; however, the Senate has not acted on these  requests.  Since Congress last authorized additional permanent  judgeships,  judicial  workloads  have  increased  substantially. The important bankruptcy reforms Congress passed in 2005, for example, called on judges to do more to  prevent abuse.  Congress compensated  for some of  the court’s increasing burden in recent  years  by  creating  temporary  bankruptcy  judgeships. Many  of  those  judgeships are near  their expiration  dates.  The time has come for Congress to  address bankruptcy  judgeships needs  on  a  permanent  basis. Bankruptcy  judges are essential to the bankruptcy  process. They make certain that the  process is fair and impartial to those  who  come  before  the  bankruptcy  courts. It is also their job to ensure  that the bankruptcy courts effectively  adjudicate parties’ rights and responsibilities.  This bill is based on a comprehensive  study done by the Judicial Conference.  The conference has assured us that its  request comes only after taking steps  to maximize all other alternatives to  reduce judicial workloads.  There are currently 352 bankruptcy  judges, including 36 temporary judges.  This legislation creates 13 new permanent bankruptcy judgeships and converts  22  of  the  existing  temporary  judgeships to permanent status. It also  provides a  5-year extension  for  two  temporary judgeships.  Finally, this bill will not present any  new cost  for the taxpayers. The  increased cost of these  judgeships are  paid by an increase in chapter 7, chapter 11, and chapter 13 bankruptcy filing  fees. Those who do business  in the  courts will be paying the extra burdens, not the taxpayers.  We need a bankruptcy system that  has a sufficient number of judges to  manage the system’s caseload in a just,  economical, and timely manner. This  bill helps ensure that we have such a  system. I urge my colleagues to adopt  this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, we have no other speakers, and I yield back the balance of my  time.  ",2010
452,15,2010-03-10,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the bipartisanship under which  we have worked on this bill. I thank  Mr. POE and  the minority  ranking  member, Mr. SMITH,  and Chairman  CONYERSand the staff who worked on  this bill, and the Judicial Conference. I  hope that we pass this bill. I call on  Members to vote  ‘‘aye’’ on H.R. 4506  and pass the bill.  ",2010
453,15,2010-03-10,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  today  to support H.R. 4506 an act  to  amend the federal judicial code to authorize  the appointment of additional permanent bankruptcy judges in various states. This legislation  was introduced by Representative COHEN, my  colleague from Tennessee. As a member of  the judiciary committee, I urge my colleagues  to support this important legislation.  As Chair of the Courts and Competition Policy subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, I have long championed the increase  in federal judgeships across the United States.  In this Congress, I introduced H.R. 3663, The  Federal Judgeship Act of 2009, which would  have done exactly this: increase the number  of federal judges.  The U.S. is also in need of more bankruptcy  judges. According to Michael J. Melloy, Chair  of the Judicial Conference Committee on the  Administration of the Bankruptcy System, ‘‘Additional judgeships are critical to ensure that  the bankruptcy courts have sufficient  judicial  resources  to effectively and efficiently adjudicate the rights and responsibilities of parties  in bankruptcy cases and proceedings’’. New  bankruptcy judgeships have not been authorized by Congress since 1992, yet case filings  have increased by 61 percent.  The current recession has had an adverse  effect on  the Bankruptcy Court system. The  courts are now faced with much more complex  and time-consuming bankruptcy cases, not to  mention an increase in volume of cases. This  has led to more cases per judge than they are  able to handle. It is therefore necessary that  we act and authorize additional bankruptcy  judges.  In addition to authorizing new judges, H.R.  4506 would also convert certain temporary offices of bankruptcy  judges  to permanent offices,  extend  certain  temporary  offices  of  bankruptcy  judges,  reduce  the  amount  of  bankruptcy fees to be deposited as offsetting  VerDate Nov 24 2008  03:55 Mar 11, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K10MR7.029 H10MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2010

Mr.  LINCOLN  DIAZ-BALART  of  Florida. I thank my dear friend Mr.  ROSKAM for the time, and I simply rise  to join my voice in praise and commendation for all those who have made  possible that this resolution come to  the floor. I think it speaks very highly  of this Congress.  Mr. Speaker, there is no more generous nation  in the world than the  American Nation, the American people.  One sees that generosity time and time  again. As Mr. BLUMENAUERmentioned,  we  just  saw  an  extraordinary  outpouring of generosity toward the people of Haiti, and then we have seen another tragedy, and the American people, with regard to Chile, are demonstrating once again  that extraordinary generosity.  So I think it is so appropriate, and  that is why I rise to commend all of  those that have made this resolution  possible, to accelerate the deduction  for the donations that Americans have  made, extend that policy with regard  to Haiti and to make it possible with  regard to the donations that are being  made or have been made or will be  made for those who have suffered in  Chile. Our hearts and our prayers go  out to those who suffer in both of those  neighbor,  friendly nations. They are  wonderful people, great friends of the  United States.  Remembering the victims,  I think  the Congress, by this action today, not  only takes a step that is consistent  with the generosity of the American  people, but I think makes a very commendable act. So I simply wanted to  join my voice of commendation for all  of those who have made this possible.  ",2010

456,22,2010-03-10,Mr. ROSKAM.," Mr. Speaker, in a nutshell, this bill does three things then:  It extends the time period for contributions to Haiti for attribution to a 2009  tax return; it extends the contribution  until April 15th for contributions to  Chile for relief efforts for the 2009 tax  return; and, as the gentleman from Oregon mentioned, it cleans up this ambiguity as it relates to contributions on  cell phones. It is well thought out, it is  timely, there is an urgency to it, and I  urge its passage.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2010
457,22,2010-03-10,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, I  would conclude by just saying that I do  appreciate the rapid response of the  committee, the bipartisan support, to  honor the generosity of Americans in  both these tragedies, to clean up the  legislation and move it forward. But I  hope, Mr. Speaker, that this is a symbol of a longer-term commitment on  the part of  this Congress,  that we  match the generosity of spirit of Americans and of our partners overseas. We  have seen other countries step forward,  along with charities and other nongovernmental organizations.  I am hopeful that we will exhibit a  commitment to  follow through after  the initial dust has settled to be full  partners with other countries, with the  people in Chile and Haiti, to deal with  the long and difficult recovery. Lives  have been traumatized. There are still  people at risk from disease. I am hopeful that we in Congress will have the  support  and  the  follow  through  to  make sure that the United States Government is a full partner with these  other critical areas to make sure that  we make life hopefully return to normal as quickly as possible for the people who have suffered this devastation.

458,22,2010-03-10,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of H.R. 4783, I rise in support  of this bipartisan legislation and urge its immediate enactment to support the ongoing recovery efforts in Chile and Haiti.  This bill does two simple things. First, it allows anybody making a cash contribution for  earthquake  relief  in Chile before April 15,  2010, to receive a charitable deduction for the  qualifying contribution on their 2009 tax return.  And second, it provides the same tax benefit  to  those wishing  to support  relief efforts  in  Haiti, by extending the original March 1, 2010,  deadline  for Haiti contributions  to April 15,  2010, as well.  These simple steps are consistent with our  nation’s  tradition of  responding  to  those  in  need and will provide an extra  incentive  for  generous Americans to make timely contributions to these crises when the assistance is  needed most.

459,22,2010-03-10,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support of H.R. 4783—a bill that will  accelerate the income tax benefits for charitable cash contributions for the relief of victims  of the earthquake in Chile.  As you know, on Saturday, February 27,  2010, a massive, 8.8 magnitude earthquake,  one of the largest ever recorded, struck off of  the coast of Chile. An estimated 2,000,000  people,  including upwards of 1,500,000 displaced persons, have been directly affected by  the earthquake, the tsunami, and its aftermath.  As the casualties continue to grow, there is a  great deal of extensive damage to highways,  bridges, apartments, and infrastructure, have  led the government of Chile to declare a ‘state  of catastrophe.’ Since  the  initial earthquake,  there have been over 100 aftershocks, which  include 8 aftershocks registering above a 6.0  magnitude. These aftershocks continue to affect the coast and the rest of the country.

The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  CAPUANO). Pursuant to House Resolution 1146, the concurrent resolution is  considered read.  The text of the concurrent resolution  is as follows:  H. CON. RES. 248  Resolved by the House of Representatives (the  Senate concurring),  SECTION 1. REMOVAL OF UNITED STATES ARMED  FORCES FROM AFGHANISTAN.  Pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers  Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)), Congress directs the President to remove the United  States Armed Forces from Afghanistan—  (1) by no later than the end of the period of  30 days beginning on the day on which this  concurrent resolution is adopted; or  (2) if the President determines that it is  not safe to remove the United States Armed  Forces before the end of that period, by no  later than December 31, 2010, or such earlier  date as the President determines that the  Armed Forces can safely be removed.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Ohio.  ",2010
462,29,2010-03-10,Mr. KUCINICH.," I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  in  2001  I  joined  the  House in voting for the Authorization  for Use of Military Force. In the past  81⁄2years, it has become clear that the  Authorization  for Use  of Military  Force  is being  interpreted as carte  blanche  for circumventing Congress’  role as a coequal branch of government.  My legislation invokes the War Powers Resolution of 1973. If enacted, it  would require the President to withdraw U.S. Armed Forces from Afghanistan by December 31, 2010.  The debate today will be the first opportunity we have had to revisit the  2001 Authorization for Use of Military  Force, which the House supported following the worst terrorist attack in  our country’s history. Regardless of  your support or opposition to the war  in Afghanistan, this is going to be the  first opportunity to evaluate critically  where  the Authorization  for Use of  Military Force has taken us in the last  81⁄2years.  This 2001 resolution allowed military  action ‘‘to prevent any future acts of  international  terrorism  against  the  United States.’’ Those of us who support the withdrawal from Afghanistan  may or may not agree on a timeline for  troop withdrawal, but I think we agree  that this debate is timely.  The rest of the world is beginning to  see the folly of trying to occupy Afghanistan: The Dutch Government recently came to a halt over the commitment of more troops from their country. In Britain public outcry over the  war is growing. A recent BBC poll indicated that 63 percent of the British  public is demanding that their troops  come home by Christmas. In Germany  opposition to the war has risen to 69  percent. Russia has lost billions of dollars in the 9 years it spent attempting  to control Afghanistan.  Our supposed nation-building in Afghanistan has come at the destruction  of our own. The military escalation cements the path of the United States  down the road of previous occupiers  that earned Afghanistan its nickname  as the ‘‘graveyard of empires.’’  b1415  One year ago last month, a report by  the Carnegie Endowment  concluded  ‘‘the only meaningful way to halt the  insurgency’s momentum  is  to  start  withdrawing troops. The presence of  foreign troops is the most important  element driving the resurgence of the  Taliban.’’  So with  this  debate  today, Mr.  Speaker, we will have a chance for the  first time to reflect on our responsibility for troop casualties that are now  reaching 1,000; to look at our responsibility for the costs of the war, which  approaches $250 billion; our responsibility for the civilian casualties and  the human costs of the war; our responsibility for challenging the corruption  that takes place in Afghanistan; our  responsibility for having a real understanding of the role of the pipeline in  this war; our responsibility for debating  the  role  of  counterinsurgency  strategies, as opposed to counterterrorism; our responsibility for being able to  make a case for the logistics of withdrawal.  After 81⁄2years, it is time that we  have this debate.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010
463,29,2010-03-10,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition  to  the  resolution, and  I  yield myself 4 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to  say I have quite enjoyed working with  the gentleman from Ohio on this issue  and a number of the issues we have had  dealings with  since  I have become  chairman, and I fundamentally agree  with him and other supporters of the  resolution that it is right for the House  to have an open, honest debate on the  merits of our ongoing military operations  in Afghanistan, and outside,  outside, the context of a defense spending bill or a supplemental appropriations bill. This is a good thing to be  doing.  By vesting the power to declare war  with the Congress, the Founders  intended the United States would go to  war only when absolutely necessary,  and it is incumbent on this body to  consider as thoroughly as possible the  purpose and ongoing necessity of committing U.S. forces to battle.  Now, as a procedural matter, I take  issue with the  invocation of section  5(c) of the War Powers Resolution as  the basis for this debate, because that  section authorizes a privileged resolution, like the one before us today, to  require  the withdrawal  of  combat  forces when Congress has not authorized the use of military force.  There really can’t be any doubt that  Congress authorized U.S. military action in Afghanistan. The authorization  for the use of military force passed by  Congress in late September 2001 explicitly empowers  the President  to use  force against the terrorists responsible  for the 9/11 attacks and those who harbored them. President Obama is doing  just that.  But putting aside procedure, the notion that at this particular moment we  would demand a complete withdrawal  of our troops from Afghanistan by the  end of the year, without regard to the  consequence of our withdrawal, without  regard  to  the  situation on  the  ground,  including efforts to promote  economic development, expand the rule  of law, and without any measurement  of whether the  ‘‘hold’’ strategy now  being implemented is indeed working, I  don’t think is the responsible thing to  do.  Our troops are  fighting a complex  nexus  of  terrorist  organizations—al  Qaeda,  the  Taliban—all  of  which  threaten the stability of the Afghan  Government,  and  they  have  demonstrated their ability to strike our  homeland.  If we withdraw  from Afghanistan before the government there  is capable of providing a basic level of  security for its own people, we face the  prospect that the Taliban once again  will take the reins of power in Kabul  and provide safe haven to al Qaeda.  That would be a national security disaster.

464,36,2010-03-10,Mr. FORTENBERRY.,"  I  thank  the  gentlewoman from Florida for her leadership on Foreign Affairs and for the  time.  Madam Speaker, the situation in Afghanistan is complex, and it has been  difficult. And it has serious ramifications for regional and global stability.  Congress understood this in the aftermath of September 11 and authorized  the use of force in Afghanistan. The  situation is no less serious today.  We would all like to see our troops  come home as quickly as possible, leaving Afghanistan a stronger and better  place. And we all deeply care about our  troops, particularly those who are now  wounded, who have fought so valiantly.  But, Madam Speaker, decisions regarding the disposition of our forces in  Afghanistan should be made in concert  with our commanders in the field who  take seriously their responsibility for  our troops and the success of that mission. I have confidence that General  McChrystal,  after  a  thorough  and  painstaking calculus, has provided a  clear plan to increase stability in Afghanistan and allow our troops to withdraw as quickly and as responsibly as  possible. Moreover, now is not the time  to  leave  fledgling civil  society programs more vulnerable to intimidation  and attack.  So, Madam Speaker, I respectfully  submit that we cannot afford to risk  compromising the future of that region  at this most difficult time, and I urge  my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution.

466,36,2010-03-10,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Madam  Speaker, I was one of those Members  who understood the horror of 9/11 and  joined with the then-President of the  United States to respond to an attack  on the United States. Subsequently in  the Iraq war, I voted against that war  knowing that it had nothing to do with  the attack on the United States on 9/11.  So I do not stand on this floor with a  heart that is not heavy-laden and an  understanding of  the  importance of  this  resolution.  This  resolution  is  grounded in the Constitution and it has  merit; for the question is, when we responded to 9/11, it was a war on terror.  Today, we find that this is a war of  insurgents. There  is no  real  documentation that al Qaeda still lingers in  Afghanistan. But we do understand  that we have lost 1,000 Americans to  date—70 in 2010 and 316 in 2009—soldiers  that we honor and respect. Never will  there be one soldier that we don’t call  for an honor and respect of the United  States. In fact, I filed legislation to  have a day of honor for all of our returning soldiers. None of them should  come home to silence. We should always provide great honor for them.  But here is where we are as it relates  to the situation in Afghanistan. Today,  although he has the right to do so,  President Karzai is greeting the President of Iran. I hope they work together  for peace. But the questions are: What  are our soldiers doing to help impact  the governance of Afghanistan? The  governance that requires the fighting  of corruption; the governance to fight  for freedom and for human rights and  the right to worship; governance to establish schools for the girls and boys  and allow girls and boys to go.  Yes, we need nation building, but not  with our soldiers out walking step by  step trying to bypass IEDs, many times  missing it and losing arms and legs and  eyes. This is the time to give the President, who did do the right thing, who  deliberated and who took time and responded to his generals—we salute him  for that. But now is the time for the  United States Congress and the constitutional separation of the branches  of government to be able to assess  whether or not this particular conflict  must continue and whether there is a  benefit to the American people.  I would make the argument there is  much to do. There is much to do in  cleaning  up Afghanistan.  There  is  much to do in providing for the opportunity of governance. We can do that  in a way that will support the State  Department with support staff  from  the military. And if there is a need to  defend the United States, I have no  doubt that the brave men and women  of  the United States military will  stand at attention and will rise to the  occasion.

",2010
471,43,2010-03-10,Mr. DENT.," Madam Speaker, I rise in  strong opposition to this House Concurrent Resolution 248 that directs the  President to remove U.S. Armed Forces  from Afghanistan within 30 days of  adoption of this resolution unless the  President determines that it is not safe  to remove U.S. forces before the end of  the 30-day timeline. But even if there is  an identified danger, U.S. forces would  still have to be removed by December  31.  Really, here is the catch: There is a  clear and present danger in removing  our men and women  from the  field  while they are engaged  in the  first  major assault of President Obama’s reaffirmed counterinsurgency strategy in  Afghanistan.  But here is another danger: damaging  the morale of the troops who sacrifice  their safety and well-being to fight to  protect our homeland, our freedoms, by  not providing them with the support  and resources they need to complete  their mission.  This  is a very dangerous business,  moving troops out of a country. I have  sat with Secretary Gates on more than  one occasion over the years talking  about withdrawing troops, in this case  from Iraq, and how complex a situation  this is and how dangerous it is and the  logistical  realities  of moving  this  many people safely.  But don’t take my word  for  it.  I  think we  should also  listen  to  the  words of our Commander  in Chief,  President Barack Obama, who, on December 1 in his address to the Nation,  said, ‘‘I am convinced that our security  is at stake in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent  extremism practiced by al Qaeda. It is  from here that we were attacked on  9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak.’’  President Barack Obama’s words.  He goes on. ‘‘This is no idle danger.  No hypothetical threat. In the last few  months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were  sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new  acts of terror, and this danger will only  grow if the region slides backwards and  al Qaeda can operate with impunity.  We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda,  and to do that we must increase the  stability and capacity of our partners  in the region.’’ Again, that was President Obama.  He goes on  in another address on  March 27 of 2009, where he made another statement. He says, ‘‘And if the  Afghan  Government  falls  to  the  Taliban or allows al Qaeda to go unchallenged, that country will again be  a base for terrorists who want to kill  as many of our people as they possibly  can.’’  Secretary Gates, a very  fine Secretary of Defense, and I am pleased  President Obama has kept him on, said  on February 5 of this year, ‘‘This is a  critical moment in Afghanistan. I am  confident that we can achieve our objectives, but only if the coalition continues to muster the resolve for this  difficult and dangerous mission.’’  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,  on September 23, said, ‘‘Some people  say, well, al Qaeda is no longer in Afghanistan. If Afghanistan were taken  over by the Taliban, I can’t tell you  how fast al Qaeda would be back in Afghanistan.’’ Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton.  I also want to mention what General  Petraeus has said.  ",2010

He  said,  on  January  25,  ‘‘It was  in  Kandahar  that  9/11  attacks  were  planned. It was in training camps in  eastern Afghanistan where the initial  preparation of the attackers was carried out before they went to Hamburg  and flight schools in the U.S. It is important to recall the seriousness of the  mission and why it is that we are in Afghanistan in the first place and why we  are still there after years and years of  hard work  and  sacrifice  that have  passed.’’  Again, I strongly urge that we defeat  this  resolution.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to join  my colleagues in speaking out against  the war  in Afghanistan. How much  death must we bear, how much pain  must we suffer, how much blood should  we  spill  before we  say  enough  is  enough? Can we lay down the burden of  war and lift up the power of peace?  Now is the time for the elected representatives of the people to give peace  a chance. Now is the time for those of  us who believe in peace, and not war,  to speak up, to speak out, and to find  a way to get in the way.  Madam Speaker, war is bloody, war  is messy. It tends not just to hide the  truth, but to sacrifice the truth, to  bury the truth. It destroys the hopes,  the dreams, and the aspirations of a  people.  As one great general and President of  the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, once said, ‘‘Every gun that is  made, every warship launched, every  rocket fired, signifies in the final sense  a theft from those who hunger and are  not fed, those who are cold and not  clothed.’’  As I said some time ago, I urge to  heed the words of the spiritual: ‘‘I’m  going to lay my burden down, down by  the riverside. I ain’t gonna study war  no more.’’ We should follow the wisdom  of that song.  Madam Speaker, this war has gone  on long enough. Enough is enough. It is  time to bring this war to an end.

485,71,2010-03-10,Mr. PAYNE.," Let me begin by commending Mr. MEEKS from New York  and Ms. WATERS from California  for  this very important legislation, H.R.  4573, Debt Relief for Earthquake Recovery in Haiti.  I also would like to acknowledge Mr.  for  his  very  impassioned  speech. Yet I am not surprised.  Mr. BACHUS, you may recall, when we  were fighting the brutal Government of  Sudan, we tried to get capital market  sanctions. You supported our legislation that brought Mr. Greenspan to the  Senate to say, Defeat the Payne-Bachus legislation because it would disrupt  the stock market. So I commend you  again for the great work that you have  done.  Madam Speaker, as we have mentioned, Haiti has had such a tremendous history. Since we know what is in  the bill, I might also mention that it  was during the Revolutionary War that  Haitian soldiers fought in one of the  key battles, the Battle of Savannah,  where just recently a statue was completed  in Savannah.  I spoke at the  dedication a year or so ago. It turned  the tide of the war.  Haitian soldiers fought in a number  of battles to help the original colonies  of  the United States become  independent  from Britain. So they shed  blood for our independence. Many people didn’t know that.  Then, as you know, with the defeat of  Napoleon’s  army  by Haiti,  as was  talked about, the reparations that had  to be paid back caused France to be  cash poor and land rich. It therefore  forced them to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States because it  had lost the cash that Haiti had produced. Over 50 percent of all the commodities of tea and coffee and sugar in  Europe came from Haiti. France lost  that and  therefore needed  the cash  from the Louisiana sale to have  its  treasury  boosted. As  a  result,  the  Lewis and Clark expedition began in  St. Louis, and the United States was  able then to take the rest of this Nation. Once again, Haiti had a tremendous part of this.  ",2010

Charlie Wilson was a remarkable Congressman, and  in his  time  in  the U.S. House of  Representatives, he worked diligently  for his  constituents in East Texas. During his tenure  in the House, he gained a seat on the House  Appropriations Committee and through his position on  the Subcommittee on Defense, he  helped to fund the Afghan Mujahideen during  the Soviet War in Afghanistan. Additionally, his  support for progressive politics led him to be  an advocate for the Equal Rights Amendment,  a minimum wage bill, and Medicaid.  All of  these actions have garnered Congressman Wilson a place in the history books,  but it was his personality that earned him a  place in the hearts of so many people across  Texas. When everything was said and done,  we all knew that his deepest concern was for  the people of his district in East Texas, and as  a fellow Texas Democrat, I am privileged to  have served with him. His love for life will reverberate  through  the halls of Congress  for  years to come, and he will be truly missed by  his fellow Texans, and especially me.  Mr. Speaker, Texas has lost a great leader  and legislator with the passing of Congressman Wilson, and I ask my fellow colleagues to  join me today in honoring his memory.  f  ECONOMIC RECOVERY  ",2010

494,85,2010-03-10,Mr. AKIN.," That is interesting. What  I think I am hearing you say is, as  much as you want to knock the insurance companies, the fact that people  have insurance and the insurance pays  claims, in a way they are the ones that  are helping to balance out the cost of  health  care,  because Medicare  and  Medicaid are underpaying the actual  cost of what it takes.  That gets to a point, and I would like  to ask you, I am going to go to my  good friend from Texas too, Congressman GOHMERT, but sometimes we get  into the weeds a little bit too much. So  let’s say you get way up on an airplane  and take a  look at the health care  question.  What someone told me is, he said,  Look, look at health care in America  as two parts. The front end is the medical service we provide to the people  who are sick in America. They said  that is the best health care anywhere  in the world. If you are a millionaire  sheikh  from Bahrain, you want  to  come over here to get some of that  health care. So we have the best health  care service, in terms of providers.  What the problem is is how we pay  for it that has gotten messed up, and I  think that is a little bit to your question.  My good friend from Texas, Congressman GOHMERT.  ",2010
495,85,2010-03-10,Mr. GOHMERT.," Well, looking at the  chart you have  there  that has  the  quote on  it about  reconciliation,  it  brings us back to what is being discussed. The reporters all out here in  the hall have been there for much of  the night, and they are starting to go  away because apparently they think  there is not going to be any agreement.  But what people need to understand is  what is being pushed here called reconciliation. What a misnomer. Reconcile? That is not what happens.  The Senate has passed a bill, and  they are not going to get 60 votes to do  a new bill, so they are trying to push  the House into passing exactly what  the Senate did. But we have got fine,  upstanding pro-lifers like BARTSTUPAK  and a dozen others, and they say if you  are going to have a bill that pries tax  money out of the hands of people who  believe with all their heart, as I do,  that it is immoral to kill unborn children, and you are going to take their  money and use it to do that, then we  can’t vote for this bill.  So what we hear being discussed is,  Well, if you will just vote for the Senate bill that allows the government to  take away taxpayer money and use it  for abortions, then we may be able to  get you an amendment to come back.  It has to be signed into law, has to become law before you can amend it, but  then we may be able to amend that to  then put in the Stupak language that  prevents tax dollars from being used  for abortion.  But the thing that our colleagues  have to understand is please don’t get  roped into that. The Speaker knows  how the process works. But if it becomes law and the bill provides for the  funding of abortion, you may or may  not get the amendment passed. It may  pass through the House, but then the  Senate has to pass it, and there is no  way anyone  in the House can guarantee what the Senate will do. Then  the people who everybody, well-intentioned, no  intention to deceive, but  anyway, the bottom line is they end up  not getting what they are promised,  not  because  of  deception.  It  just  doesn’t happen.  ",2010
496,85,2010-03-10,Mr. AKIN.," I would like to just run  over to our good friend from Pennsylvania, Congressman THOMPSON, and I  just wanted to get your perspective on  what you are seeing. It has been almost  9 months, and people have been looking  more and more into the details of the  bill. The more they see it, the more  they don’t like it. Yet the majority  seems to be determined, they have the  pedal to the metal, they have the battleship at ramming speed, and they are  going to just try and drive this thing  through.  What is your impression of where we  are?  ",2010
497,85,2010-03-10,Mr. THOMPSON  of Pennsylvania.,"  Well, first of all, I want to thank my  good friend from Missouri for providing  the leadership for this evening. It is  just so important.  The American people, I have to tell  you, I am very proud of the American  people on this issue. During this past 15  months, I think they fulfilled the responsibility  that  our Founders  intended. Our Founders have to be smiling right now, because the American  people have woken up and are paying  attention and engaging on this issue.  When it comes to health care, I think  the large majority of Americans share  the same perspective I do, and it is a  perspective I developed as a health care  professional. I started out as a therapist over 30 years ago, and for 28 years  I was a health care manager, licensed  as  a  nursing  home  administrator,  worked in all areas of health care, in  nonprofit community health care.  The four principles I have always led  my professional life by have been the  same four principles that have guided  me in my role working for the people  as a Member of Congress, and it is the  same principles that I see the people  agreeing with when it comes to health  care. They want to improve our health  care system, not throw it out, not create some government-run system.  My principles that I have always led  my life by, and I think they are principles that are important in this debate, let’s do what we can to make sure  that we lower the cost of health care  for all Americans. The bill that is coming at us at light speed from the Senate raises costs for most Americans. It  doesn’t address real cost reduction.  The second principle for me is increasing access, improving quality, and  making sure that we strengthen that  decisionmaking  relationship  between  the physician and patient. We don’t  need the government or a bureaucrat  making those decisions.  The bill that is coming at us, in particular I will just talk about one aspect. I started at that last principle of  strengthening the decisionmaking relationship between the physician and the  patient. This bill creates a health care  czar, and this czar is going to have the  ability to impose not just health care  prices and controls, but that czar is  going to dictate what kind of benefits  we should get and not get. And just as  my good friend from Texas was talking  about, we will wind up paying for procedures, such as abortions, something  that we would never use, that we certainly, based on my faith, would be  very much in objection to.  So that type of imposition of a czar  making decisions, inserting themselves  between the patient and physician, is  just absolutely wrong.  b2130  ",2010
498,85,2010-03-10,Mr. AKIN.," I appreciate your perspective on that. I bet you that has got to,  even after all these months, has got to  really bother those of you who are doctors. I mean you invested I don’t know  how many years  in med  school.  I  flunked fetal pig. I would never have  made it. Part of the reason was because  you wanted to treat patients. And to  have some insurance person sticking  their nose in that relationship has got  to really rub you the wrong way. But  what happens if—at least if it’s the insurance company, you can get rid of  the insurance company. But what happens if it’s the Federal Government?  That would drive me crazy.  Congressman BROUN, please.  ",2010
499,85,2010-03-10,Mr. BROUN of Georgia.," The Federal  Government already sticks its nose in  the  doctor-patient  relationship  in  Medicare-Medicaid.  The  insurance  company  executives do  in managed  care. But in my medical practice for  the last 5 years prior to being elected  to Congress, I saw Medicare patients,  Medicaid patients, managed care patients, but they just paid me at the  time of service. If they couldn’t pay  me, that was all right too. I’ve given  away hundreds of thousands of dollars  worth of my services over my medical  career.  We hear from Democrats, the President particularly, that the doctors are  all in favor of this Obama care bill. I’ve  got a letter here from the Medical Association of Georgia that was just sent  to me and other members of the Georgia delegation that says, We oppose the  Senate-passed health care bill.

500,92,2010-03-10,Mr. CAO.," Thank you very much,  PETE.  I know that the NASA program is extremely  important  to your district,  and I know that it is very integral in  providing good jobs to your people in  your district. It is also the same with  mine. I have a NASA facility plant in  New Orleans East, a facility that is  called Michoud.  Earlier this year, President Obama  released his 2011 budget. To my surprise and to the surprise of many other  Members—I’m pretty sure you’re  included—the  President  recommended  canceling NASA’s Constellation human  spaceflight program. During a  time  when our  space  shuttle program  is  phasing out, I am very concerned that  this decision will leave our Nation with  no means of transporting our astronauts to and  from the  international  space station.  It could set the U.S.  space program back decades.  Nearly 50 years ago, President John  F. Kennedy showed remarkable vision  when he directed NASA to launch the  Apollo program to the Moon. America  remains the only country in the world  to have landed a person on the Moon  and to have brought him back to Earth  safely. We have achieved what people  once thought to be impossible because  we pushed ourselves and because we  challenged  our  understanding  of  science and the universe. To this day,  we still enjoy the countless benefits  reaped from the first spaceflight.  Technologically, NASA is regularly  commercialized, and it can be found in  countless products,  like  in  improved  medical devices, in household smoke  detectors, in barcode scanners, and in  every computer.  b2230  So we see that the technology from  spaceflight is incorporated into our everyday lives.  It has also allowed us to  improve  weather  forecasting,  which  is  extremely important in Louisiana, given  the threats of hurricanes and tornadoes  and what have you in the region. If you  were to listen to the former NASA Administrator,  Dr. Mike  Griffin,  he  wrote, ‘‘I believe that this budget request advocates a  strategy  that  is,  frankly, disastrous for the U.S. human  spaceflight program.’’  Harrison Schmitt, former U.S. Senator and Apollo 17 astronaut, said, ‘‘It  is simply bad for the country.’’  With the loss of our manufacturing  base, many jobs have been moved to  other countries. The manufacturing of  the space vehicle is among the very few  areas where we still enjoy a technical  advantage, and I think it is extremely  unwise to give it up.  Like you said, the Chinese are pushing to bring a person to the Moon. The  Russians are continuing  their  space  program, and I am pretty sure that  they are catching up with us in the  technical field to put a person on the  Moon and beyond. And we, as one of  the most powerful countries  in  the  world, the most advanced country in  the world, we are scaling back on our  space program, one of the few areas  where we still have a technical advantage beyond other countries.  The Michoud facility in my own district was slated to build components of  the Orion crew module and the Ares 1  and Ares  5 cargo  rockets. Michoud  faces the prospect of losing thousands  of high-skilled jobs. In a time in which  we are trying to preserve jobs, trying  to create jobs, this cut will destroy  jobs. With the Michoud facility facing  a reduced workforce of 1,000 employees,  that is 1,000 good-paying jobs that we  can preserve and we can retain.  We have this world-class manufacturing facility in New Orleans which  has been used to build the Saturn rockets  for the Apollo program and the  main fuel tanks for the space shuttle,  among many other notable achievements, and we will lose all of the experience and all of the manufacturing  jobs, along with $9 billion of taxpayer  money that could have been spent on  the Constellation Program.  Some have made the argument that  the  future of manned spaceflight  is  best outsourced to the private sector,  as  indicated  in the budget proposal.  But  I  think,  though,  commercial  spaceflight is a promising and exciting  endeavor, and we need to keep those  programs in our country, in our districts,  to provide  those good-paying  jobs to our people. If we are trying to  preserve jobs in the United States, I  think it is unwise to outsource those  good-paying jobs to other countries. Institutional knowledge of over 40 years  of human  spaceflight would be  lost  under the current budget proposal.  Just to close, I just want to quote a  statement given by Charlie Duke, an  Apollo 16 astronaut. He said, ‘‘We cannot afford to  lose our  leadership  in  space. The Constellation Program must  be continued.’’  You know what, PETE? I cannot agree  with him more. I am pretty sure you  can also agree with me on that assertion. Thank you very much for your  hard work  and  dedication  to  this  project.  ",2010
501,92,2010-03-10,Mr. OLSON.," Thank you  for those  very kind comments, and I couldn’t  agree with you more. One of the problems I have with this decision is how it  was sprung upon all of us.  I am the ranking member on the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over  NASA, and I found out, like probably  all of you, everybody here in the Chamber, by reading the newspaper.

506,106,2010-03-10,Mr. JOHANNS.," Mr. President, I rise  to speak to the Senate health care bill  and to talk a little bit about some of  the issues related to that bill, in terms  of financing and scoring and, to be very  candid, about some of the accounting  gimmicks that try to hold this bill together.  I will be  joined by Senator  WICKERand Senator BARRASSO in this  colloquy. Let me get started.  If you start to study the bill, and for  many of us who have served in other  capacities—myself as Governor and as  a mayor—the first thing you want to  do is ask yourself: Does it work? Is the  financing of  this bill  such  that  it  makes sense? Is it an honest portrayal  of the income you expect and the expenses you expect? Certainly, that is  where I start and, I suggest, many of  my colleagues start.  The one thing about this health care  bill that struck me immediately and  struck others is, first of all, there are  10 years of tax increases. They total  over $1⁄2trillion—a massive amount of  tax increases.  The second thing you see is, there are  10 years of Medicare cuts, again about  $1⁄2 trillion total. You do those things  and some other things and it pays for 6  years of spending because even though  some of  the  issues  relative  to  this  health care bill kick in initially, the  vast majority of it does not kick in for  3 or 4 years.  When you put that all back together,  you begin to realize what you have is a  health care bill that costs about $2.5  trillion over a 10-year score.  Then you start working through a  whole bunch of other issues. You have  a Senate bill that takes $52 billion in  higher Social Security taxes and revenues and counts them as offsets. That  would be money normally reserved for  the Social Security trust  fund. You  look at the CLASS Act. One Member of  this body—a Member who is very respected for what he has done relative  to  budgeting—called  this  a  Ponzi  scheme.  The CLASS Act was initially opposed  by our friends on the other side or by  leading Democrats. But  it  is  back  alive. It is included in the Senate bill.  It is another Federal entitlement that  is going to create an insolvency problem very quickly. It takes money from  premiums that are supposed to go for  benefits and uses them as offsets and  pay-fors.  CMS experts have looked at this, and  they reached a conclusion that is reliable. They said the CLASS Act faces ‘‘a  significant risk of failure,’’ and then  said, and may lead to ‘‘an insurance  death spiral.’’  Our friends on the other side claim  the bill will simultaneously extend the  solvency of Medicare and then magically decrease the deficit. But the reality of that, again, comes from CMS  actuaries who say: Well, wait a second  here,  that  is  double-counting. You  can’t use the same dollar twice. You  can’t count it twice. CMS concludes  that the Medicare cuts in the legislation cannot be simultaneously used to  finance other Federal outlays, such as  coverage expansions under this bill or  to extend the trust fund.  So when you cut all the way through  this and see what is happening here, it  doesn’t hold together. This is a financial plan that is built upon sand, and  you can almost guarantee it is going to  collapse.  So let me, if I might, ask my colleague,  Senator WICKER,  what  he  thinks of all of this. Can he offer some  thoughts as to where this bill is headed  and the financial mechanisms of this  bill?  ",2010
507,106,2010-03-10,Mr. WICKER.," I appreciate my colleague from Nebraska getting into the  weeds because it is important that we  know the details of the numbers here.  I think there is also a sort of big-picture aspect to this. There are a lot of  Americans out there who may not have  read the details the Senator from Nebraska just outlined, but they instinctively know you can’t do all this to  one-sixth of our economy and  save  money for the Federal Government at  the  same  time. They  instinctively  know this is going to turn out, as big  entitlement programs always do, to be  more expensive  than has been estimated and it is going to cost the American taxpayer and future generations  in terms of the national debt.  I would like to pivot and talk about  what this is going to do to State governments because that is an additional  aspect over and above  the gigantic  numbers the Senator  from Nebraska  mentioned.  Really, almost half of the additional  coverage in this Senate bill, which the  House is being asked to adopt lock,  stock, and barrel without even changing so much as a semicolon, half of the  coverage is going to be under Medicaid.  We all know Medicaid requires a huge  Federal investment, but Medicaid also  always requires a State match. Under  the provisions of this bill, if it is enacted, States will be told that the magnificent Federal Government has  increased coverage, and now, Mr. State  Legislator, Mr. State Governor, you  figure out a way to pay your part of it.  I know this much: In my State of  Mississippi,  our  legislators  and  our  Governor have had to stay up late 2  years in a row figuring out a way to  pay for the Medicaid match they are  already being asked to pay, much less  this new mandate of additional persons  who would be covered under this Senate  language. There  is no way  the  State of Mississippi can stand this new  Medicaid coverage without an increase  in our taxes at the State level. I don’t  think we can cut teachers enough, although teachers might have to be cut  to pay this Federal mandate. I don’t  think we can cut local law enforcement  enough, although that might have to  be cut too. It is just a huge, unfunded  burden on the States. Quite frankly,  even if all of the promises that are  being made on the Senate side come  true—that we will clean this up in reconciliation, which I frankly doubt can  possibly happen—the States are going  to be faced with this huge unfunded  mandate.  You don’t have to take our word for  it on this side of the aisle. Democratic  Governor after Democratic Governor  has had press conferences, they have  sent letters, they have sent messages,  they have made themselves available  to the press. Governor Bredesen of the  State of Tennessee said this bill is the  ‘‘mother of all unfunded mandates’’  and has urged, even at this late date,  that we not go down this road.  So I appreciate my friend from Nebraska pointing out what this is going  to do to the Federal budget, and  I  would simply commend the bipartisan  State officials who have been talking  to anyone within the sound of their  voices saying that State governments  cannot  afford  this mandate  at  the  State level, and it will inevitably result  in an  increase  in taxes at the  State  level—something we  certainly  don’t need at this time of economic  hardship.

513,120,2010-03-10,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, the Senate can take an important step today  in alleviating  the  incredible  strains  this continuing economic crisis is having on thousands of  families  in my  State, and millions of families across  America. In approving the American  Workers, State, and Business Relief  Act of 2010, we can end what has been  an agonizing procession of will-we-or-  won’t-we votes on extending unemployment benefits and COBRA  insurance  subsidies for those who have lost their  jobs. And we can ensure that, by extending enhanced Federal payments to  State  Medicaid  programs,  crucial  health coverage and other vital State  services are not cut.  Those who doubt the wisdom of extending  unemployment  and  COBRA  benefits until  the end of  this year  should hear the phone calls and read  the letters that have come into my office over the past few weeks. As the  Congress has debated, and delayed, on  the question of whether to pass another  short-term  extension,  these  Americans, left jobless by a crisis not  of their own making, wondered if the  economic lifeline that keeps food on  their  tables and  shelter over  their  heads would be severed. By approving  this  legislation, we will ensure that  these families are not left in limbo by  delays in Congress. Giving them some  measure of certainty, at a time when  the economic crisis has turned so much  upside-down, is the right thing to do.  What’s more, continuing these benefits  is one of the most important steps we  can take to nurture the fragile recovery of our economy. These payments  benefit not just families coping with  unemployment, but provide an immediate stimulus to local economies that  have been devastated by the recession.  Likewise, the decision to extend enhanced Federal Medicaid  assistance  percentages,  or FMAP,  funding  to  States,  boosts  the  entire  economy  while helping  those  in  the greatest  need. Michigan and other States have  made clear that without this extension, we would  leave giant holes  in  their budget.  In the absence of enhanced funding, the steps the States  would have to take balance their budgets could mean devastating cuts  to  vital programs that serve the victims  of this crisis. Such cuts would also  dampen the recovery, removing a pillar  that has kept economic activity from  collapsing during the crisis. Extending  these payments gives States, and the  citizens they serve, much-needed certainty.  This legislation also would continue  tax provisions that can provide additional support to economic recovery  and job creation. In extending the research and development tax credit and  other measures, we give our businesses  another tool they can use as they seek  to regain ground, begin growing again  and start putting people back to work.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this important legislation.  ",2010
514,120,2010-03-10,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, today,  the Senate is passing the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act,  STELA. This  legislation modernizes  and extends  important provisions of  the Satellite Home Viewer Act, which  contains statutory copyright licenses  and Communications Act authorizations that allow for the retransmission  of broadcast television signals by satellite and cable providers.  Ensuring that Americans have access  to broadcast television content is important, and it is particularly relevant  for consumers in rural areas who might  not otherwise be able to receive these  signals over the air. The  legislation  that the Senate is passing today will  ensure that nobody will be left in the  dark for the foreseeable future.  The Satellite Home Viewer Act provides  cable and  satellite  companies  with statutory licenses to allow them  to retransmit the content of broadcast  television stations. It also contains important authorizations in the Communications Act that facilitate these retransmissions.  Broadcast  television  plays a critical role in cities and towns  across the country, and remains the  primary way in which consumers are  able to access local content such as  news, weather, and sports.  Cable and satellite providers help to  expand the footprint of broadcast stations by allowing them to reach viewers who are unable to receive signals  over the air. Vermont is an example of  how cable and satellite companies can  provide service to consumers in rural  areas who might not otherwise receive  these signals.  Vermonters will see improved service  when this legislation is enacted. As the  act has been  reauthorized over  the  years, I have worked to improve the  service that Vermonters receive from  cable and  satellite companies. Residents in southern Vermont have seen  improvements.  Windham  and  Bennington Counties are not considered part of the Burlington television  market that encompasses the rest of  the State, and for many years those  residents  were  unable  to  receive  Vermont broadcast  stations by  satellite. Congress changed this in 2004,  and DirecTV has been providing these  Vermonters with access to Vermont  stations ever since.  I am also pleased that under this legislation, DISH Network will be able to  provide their subscribers in southern  Vermont with the same service. As  soon as the DISH Network uses this authority,  virtually  everyone  in  the  State will be able to access the news  and information that is truly important to Vermonters, whether it is the  debate over relicensing the Vermont  Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon  or the UVM basketball team’s quest to  make the NCAA Tournament.  One  other  important  way  that  STELA will preserve and improve existing service for consumers is by correcting a flaw in the statutory copyright license for the cable industry. An  unintended  result of current  law  is  that  the  cable  license  requires  the  cable industry to pay copyright holders  for signals that many of their subscribers do not actually receive. This is  often referred to as the phantom signal  problem. The effect of this anomaly in  the law is that Comcast is required to  pay copyright royalties based on their  subscriber base across the northeast  for  the Canadian  television content  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:27 Mar 11, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10MR6.023 S10MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2010
515,127,2010-03-10,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, I withhold that suggestion.  I did want to make one additional  point. I did not do this when I talked  about the issue of the Colgan tragedy.  The larger question is not addressed directly in this legislation. We address  many of these issues, but we do not address  the  larger  question  of  commuting.  I want to show, if I might, something  Senator ROCKEFELLERand I and others  have  used  in  the Commerce Committee. This map describes where the  Colgan pilots commute from. But do  you know what. This chart could probably have been describing almost any  regional airline or any trunk airline or  major airline, for that matter.  Pilots live in one part of the country  and work out of another part of the  country. The fact is, with respect to  this tragedy, the Colgan crash, I am  convinced that mattered.  I am convinced  that  flying  through difficult  nighttime icy conditions—with two pilots, neither of whom had slept in a bed  the night previous—I am  convinced  this kind of commuting has caused significant difficulties.  There was a Wall Street Journal  piece that pretty much says it all. This  was an veteran pilot describing the  routine of commuter flights with short  layovers in the middle of the night,  which is pretty typical. He said:  Take a shower, brush your teeth, pretend  you slept.  That is something we have to pay  some attention to. I am not suggesting  today that you cannot commute. We do  not in this legislation prohibit commutes. But I think these are instructive pieces.  As shown in this picture, this is what  is called a crash pad. I was completely  unaware of a crash pad until we began  to hold these hearings. But this is a  pilot watching a movie on his computer at a crash house  in Sterling  Park, VA. They can have up to 20 to 24  occupants at a time.

In the State of the Union Address,  the President spoke about jobs and said  one of the things we ought to do to try  to preserve and keep and create jobs in  our country is to shut down or eliminate  the  tax  loophole  that  rewards  companies  for moving  jobs overseas.  The President specifically asked in his  State of the Union Address for the Congress to eliminate that tax loophole. I  have tried to eliminate that loophole I  think on  four different occasions on  the floor of the Senate. We have had  four votes. On each occasion, I have  failed.  One might ask, well, how on Earth  can you fail on an amendment such as  that? Well, there are a lot of big companies and groups  in this town—the  Chamber of Commerce is an example—  that like that loophole and want it retained, and they  fight very hard to  keep the loophole.  Here is what we have. We actually do  have a circumstance where if you are  on one side of a street corner and you  have a competitor on the other side of  the street making the identical product you do, earning the identical income you earn, and you decide you are  going to move your plant to China, fire  your workers, put a padlock on the  front door of your manufacturing plant  and move to China, the only difference  between you and the person across the  street that you used to compete with  and still do is that you now have lower  labor costs but you also have a tax  break given to you by the Federal Government. It is astounding that exists,  but regrettably it does. The President’s  call to eliminate the tax break is very  important, and we ought to heed that  call.  I filed an amendment on the last bill,  the one that passed today. I did not get  a vote on it. I intend to file it again on  other pieces of legislation because this  Congress, at a time when so many millions of people get up in the morning  and put on their clothes and go out  looking for work and cannot find work,  this Congress has a responsibility to  deal with this issue.  Think of this issue of trying to find  jobs that are necessary to put 17 million people back to work as trying to  fill a bathtub. We are working on a faucet to incentivize and create new jobs,  but the drain is wide open, the drain of  existing jobs going overseas; in fact,  going overseas in search of cheap labor  because this country actually rewards  you if you move your jobs overseas.  This  is Hershey’s chocolate. Many  people have eaten York Peppermint  Patties. York Peppermint Patties were  made in a Pennsylvania plant but no  longer. It is now Mexican food.  This is a newly built plant in Monterey, Mexico, now making York Peppermint Patties. On its Web site, Hershey’s says:  That cool refreshing taste of mint, dipped  in dark chocolate will take you miles away.  Apparently meaning even Mexico. So  an American brand goes south. That is  not terribly unusual.  Hallmark Cards:  ‘‘When you  care  enough to send the very best.’’ It is a  privately held Kansas City company. It  has been around  100 years.  It was  founded by a high school dropout who  started the company in 1910 with a shoe  box of postcards he sold while living  out of a YMCA. It is an unbelievable  success  story, Hallmark Cards. The  company became  far and away  the  most successful greeting card company  in America, with a reputation of treating  its workers  fairly—a very good  company.  But under current management, with  annual revenues over $4 billion, they  started to move jobs from Kansas City  to three plants  in China.  It moved  thousands of jobs overseas, though it is  not required to disclose the specific  numbers.  What kind of a card do you send to a  Hallmark worker whose job is now in  China? The very best? We have a right  in this country to be concerned about  that.  I have talked at length about Radio  Flyer, the little red wagon, gone from  Illinois to China; Huffy bicycle gone  from Ohio  to China.  I  spoke about  those at length. But there are new ones  as well.  Whirlpool. At a time when we are losing so many jobs because of the deep  recession, Whirlpool  announced  last  year it was shutting down a 1,100-worker factory in Evansville, IN, and moving the work to a factory in Mexico.  Whirlpool made  this  decision  even  though the company accepted a $19.3  million grant by the U.S. Department  of Energy as part of the Recovery Act  to develop ‘‘smart appliances.’’  By the way, this is a picture of a  Whirlpool worker walking out of his  place of employment, the last walk on  the last day. One can wonder what was  going through his mind as he understood he was going to have to tell his  family he is now out of work. His job  still exists, but it exists in a foreign  country.  This is Natalie. Natalie worked for  Whirlpool. She  is 42 years old. She  worked  at  the Whirlpool  appliance  plant in Evansville for 19 years and in  November of last year was told her job  is moving to Mexico; $17 an hour was  too much to pay, and you can get  cheaper labor elsewhere. She described  that plant closing ‘‘like a punch in the  gut.’’ You can imagine what it is like.  I am told local workers and local officials did everything they could to try  to keep that Whirlpool plant in Evansville, IN, but they were unsuccessful.  We do see a lot of people wearing  football jerseys. This is a Reebok Peyton Manning jersey. My guess is they  sell a lot of those things. There is not  a better quarterback  in professional  football. He is quite an extraordinary  football player.  Reebok makes this jersey. This jersey is made in El Salvador by a Chinese-owned company. This  jersey  is  sold for $80 in the United States and  workers are paid 10 cents for the work  they do in El Salvador to make it.  Let me say that again. The workers  get 10 cents, one thin dime, and the  customers pay $80 for the Peyton Manning Reebok football jersey.  Here is a photograph that shows the  conditions of a sweatshop in El Salvador owned by the Chinese.

547,197,2010-03-10,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker, keeping  our oceans productive and healthy is of vital  interest  to coastal and  inland communities  across  the world. As a Member who  represents one of the biologically richest coastal  Congressional Districts  in  the county,  I  rise  today  in support of H.R. 3650,  the Harmful  Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act, which will  take necessary steps toward maintaining the oceans’  ecological health.  Harmful algal bloom (HAB) produces toxins  harmful to shellfish, fish, and biomass, which  affect other organisms along  the  food chain  and pose  real dangers  to  the vitality of all  coastal areas. HAB can also decrease  the  sunlight entering the water and use up available oxygen, creating hypoxia or oxygen depletion.  In  extremely  low  oxygen  environments, sedentary species perish, mobile species migrate, and spawning areas are jeopardized. If these conditions continue, the hypoxia  may become permanent as coastal areas become lined with dead zones in which little marine life can exist.  Although algal blooms occur naturally, they  are exacerbated by human activities, including  the runoff from lawns and livestock feedlots,  point-source discharge  from sewage plants,  and emissions from vehicles. All of these activities lead to elevated levels of nutrients and  an increase of algal growth. HAB and hypoxia  are growing more severe and more prevalent  in our oceans.  The Marin and Sonoma coastline in my District is one of the most biologically productive  regions  in  the world. This coastline  includes  one of only four coastal upwelling zones on  the planet, which make up only 1 percent of  the ocean but produce 20 percent of its fish.  Unfortunately, even this biological hot spot has  been impacted by algal blooms. As recently as  last October, northward  currents  carried a  large HAB from Point Reyes up the coast to  Bodega Bay, harming marine life and irritating  swimmers and divers.  Increasing our understanding of these events and undertaking new  efforts to monitor, control, prevent, and mitigate them must be a priority.  H.R. 3650 would establish a National Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Program to develop and coordinate a comprehensive strategy to address HABs and hypoxia.  Additionally this legislation will implement regional action plans to reduce HABs and hypoxia.  Madam Speaker, as a cosponsor of H.R.  3650,  I  commend my  colleagues  on  the  Science and Technology Committee for their  hard work on this issue, and I look forward to  this legislation becoming law. The increasing  type, frequency, location, duration, and severity of  these dangerous events demonstrate  how urgently we need to implement solutions  to these problems.  RECOGNIZING THE 189TH ANNIVERSARY OF GREEK INDEPENDENCE  SPEECHOF  HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 9, 2010  ",2010
548,197,2010-03-10,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Madam Speaker, As a  lead sponsor of this resolution, I am proud to  stand with my colleagues to commemorate the  189th anniversary of Greek independence. We  gather here  today not only  in recognition of  Greece’s proud history, and in appreciation of  the warm friendship our two countries share,  but also to thank the Greek people for standing by our side  in good  times and bad,  in  peace and in war.  The U.S. connection  to Greece  reaches  back to the days before the United States was  even a country.  It  is well known  that  the  Founding Fathers were well versed in Greek  political philosophy and drew on  that knowledge in their efforts to lay the political foundation of  this Nation. Thomas Jefferson once  said of Greece that it was ‘‘the first of civilized  nations,  (and) presented examples of what  man should be.’’ Indeed, many of the political  ideas attributed  to  the United States  today,  such as freedom of speech and the respect  for democratic governance can trace their origins back to ancient Greece.  On  this 189th anniversary of Greek  independence,  let us all  reflect on what we as  Americans owe  to Greece  for our historical  ties, for the role ancient Greece played in the  shaping of our democracy and for the enduring  friendship between  the peoples of  the  United States and Greece.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF  CLARENCE FAULK  HON.

Mr. Faulk was born on January 9, 1909 in  West Monroe, La., and recently celebrated the  occasion of his 100th birthday.  In 2003, Mr. Faulk lost his beloved wife of  72 years, Louise Benson Page. The couple is  survived by their two sons and daughter, as  well as their 10 grandchildren and seven great  grandchildren.  Having been raised by a family with deep  roots in publishing, Mr. Faulk was well suited  for a career path loaded with journalism and  broadcasting endeavors. Mr. Faulk was  the  publisher of  the Ruston Daily Leader  from  1931  to 1962,  the owner of  radio station  KRUS,  the  first radio station  in Ruston, La.  from 1947  to 1968.  In addition, he served  many years as the president of the Louisiana  Press Association and  the Louisiana Broadcasters Association.  Outside of this field, Mr. Faulk owned numerous rent homes and commercial buildings  in Ruston, and even received the Russ Award  from  the Ruston-Lincoln Parish Chamber of  Commerce  for his efforts  in support of his  treasured Ruston community.  Mr. Faulk was  a  friend  to many,  and  deemed a gracious and hardworking person  by all who knew him.  It  is my privilege  to  honor Mr. Faulk as a man emblematic of the  true spirit of North Louisiana. He will surely be  remembered by all as a loving husband and  father, a successful businessman and an important part of the Ruston community.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me in honoring the late Clarence Faulk.  f  RECOGNIZING THE  2010 AIMPACT  DAY HELD BY THE NATIONAL  ASSOCIATION  OF  CHAIN  DRUG  STORES  HON. PETER J.

Throughout its  history, NACDS and its 150 chains and 39,000  individual pharmacy members have worked to  adapt  to  the changing needs of consumers.  @IMPACT Day allows community pharmacies  to share the numerous benefits of their industry.  I am delighted to recognize the chain drug  stores nationwide that have a significant presence in my district. Not only do they provide  thousands of quality  jobs, but  these pharmacies also provide a vital service as part of  the healthcare delivery system of my district.

552,204,2010-03-10,Mr. TOWNS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to acknowledge  that March  is Red Cross  Month. This is a time for us to officially recognize the essential role that the American Red  Cross plays in our communities helping to ensure our communities are more ready and resilient  in  the  face of  future disasters. March  has been celebrated as ‘‘Red Cross Month’’  since 1943 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt called the wartime fundraising campaign  the ‘‘greatest single crusade of mercy in all of  history.’’ As we celebrate this American Red  Cross Month,  I encourage all  individuals  to  commit  themselves  to strengthen  their own  communities  through service and volunteer  opportunities with the Red Cross. Volunteers  help make our country stronger, and no where  is this more evident than in communities coming together to support each other in times of  need.  From  rebuilding  former adversaries after  World War II, to saving lives after the tragic  earthquake in Haiti, the American people have  an unmatched tradition of responding to challenges at home and abroad with compassion  and generosity. In just over one month since  the earthquake, the Red Cross has provided  assistance to more than 1.3 million people and  will continue  to aid hundreds of  thousands  more in the months ahead. In Chile, the American Red Cross is prepared to mobilize support, including relief supplies and trained personnel. The American Red Cross is also assisting  the Chilean Red Cross,  through  the  International Federation of the Red Cross and  Red Crescent appeal, to assist 75,000 people  for six months in the areas of shelter, water  health  and  telecommuniand  sanitation,  cations.  At home and abroad, one in five Americans  is  touched by  the Red Cross every single  year. The American Red Cross  in Greater  New York responds to an average of 7 emergencies  a  day—fires,  floods,  building  collapses—and provides immediate humanitarian  aid to as many as 100,000 people affected by  these emergencies each year.  In my district  alone in 2009, the Greater New York Chapter  responded  to 264 disasters and  registered  1,337 people for Red Cross assistance.  Whether it is an earthquake or a single family home fire; a call for blood or a call for help,  the American Red Cross is there. I ask that  you and my distinguished colleagues join me  in applauding the hard work of the American  Red Cross volunteers and celebrating March  as American Red Cross Month.  f  MEGAN HELT  HON.

Megan is a  very special young woman who has exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership by  taking an active part  in  the Girl  Scouts of the USA and earning the high honor  of the Gold Award.  Megan’s outstanding achievement  reflects  her hard work and dedication. Megan has exhibited unique and creative examples of service that have made a difference in her community. I am confident that she will continue to  hold herself to the highest standards in the future. This  is an accomplishment  for which  Megan can take pride in for the rest of her life.  Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join  me in commending Megan Helt for her accomplishments with  the Girl Scouts of  the USA  and for her efforts put forth in achieving the  highest distinction of the Gold Award.  f  CENSUS AWARENESS MONTH  SPEECHOF  HON. DANNY K. DAVIS  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 3, 2010  ",2010
554,204,2010-03-10,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, the beginning of March marks the one-month process of one of the most important collective actions that our country partakes in, the national  Census. Thus I want to express my support to  House Resolution 1096, deeming this month  designated as Census Awareness Month. The  Census provides an opportunity  to not only  count how many people live in our great nation, but to also collect valuable data that will  help to provide services to millions of Americans. According to information collected from  the Census, over $400 billion per year in federal funding is distributed to State and local  governments. As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, I want to ensure that all  African Americans are counted as the Census  has significant importance in the black community. The implementation and evaluation of  programs like the Equal Employment Opportunity Act,  the Civil Rights Act and  the Fair  Housing Act are based on Census data.  In  2007 the Black community grew to 40.7 million  from 33.5 million in the year 2000. Underrepresentation of minorities is the leading cause  of underfunding programs that these communities utilize  the most, such as education,  health care, housing and  transportation programs.  The myths  that  further discourage people  from participating in the Census must be dispelled. The Census  is not a  long process;  there are merely 10 questions to answer, making it the shortest Census form in history. By  law  the Census Bureau cannot share  individual  responses with anyone;  that  includes  immigration authorities, IRS, FBI, CIA or any  other government agency. The U.S. Census  preferred method of participation  is  through  forms sent through mail and returned through  mail and Census workers will only visit households that do not return their forms. This snapshot of our nation also effects Congress itself;  the distribution of U.S. House of Representative seats are based on the Census. In order  to have proportional representation as well as  programs and funding that directly serve the  American people, everyone must participate in  the 2010 United States Census. Underrepresentation of our population must be avoided;  thus from March to April, I urge everyone to  go  to www.census.gov  to  find out more on  how you can be  involved  in  the 2010 U.S.  Census.  f  TRIBUTE TO JAMES D. MACPHEE  HON. FRED UPTON  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 10, 2010  ",2010
555,204,2010-03-10,Mr. UPTON.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to  pay  tribute  to  James D. MacPhee  of  Schoolcraft, Michigan, who will become Chairman of the Independent Community Bankers  of America,  ICBA, on Thursday, March 18,  2010.  Mr. MacPhee’s long association and dedication to the ICBA has unquestionably qualified  him for this position. He has served as chairman of the ICBA Membership/Marketing Committee and  is  this  year’s  ICBPAC auction  chairman. He has served as vice-chairman  and an at-large member of the ICBA Executive Committee and represented the State of  Michigan on the ICBA Board of Directors.  Southwest Michigan has greatly benefited  from Mr. MacPhee’s career in the community  banking  industry. He has been with Kalamazoo County State Bank for 35 years, serving as CEO for the past 17, and is a member  of the board of directors of First State Bank in  Decatur, Michigan. Mr. MacPhee has held the  esteemed positions of both director and president in the Michigan Association of Community Bankers and currently serves as chairman  and a member of the board of directors of the  Michigan Association of Community Bankers  Service Company.  Throughout his  impressive career, James  MacPhee has continually given back  to  the  community. He was a charter member and  chairman of the Village of Schoolcraft Downtown Development Authority, and a charter  member of the Schoolcraft Community Association, and has served on the board of directors of  the Bronson Health Foundation.

556,4,2010-03-18,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, as we  contemplate a historic vote to reform  health care, I would like to emphasize  how critically important this bill is to  the women of this country. According  to a report prepared by the Joint Economic Committee, which I chair, an estimated 64 million women in this country  lack adequate health care; over  one-quarter of our daughters between  the ages of 19 and 24 lack health care,  and women between the ages of 55 and  64 are particularly vulnerable. That’s  because  so many women depend on  their spouse’s employer-based health  care, and, all too often, they discover  they are not age eligible for Medicare  when their older husbands retire. A  staggering 39 percent of all low-income  women lack health care.  Ultimately, this is a vote about who  we will be as a country. For our sisters,  our daughters, and our mothers, yes,  vote ‘‘yes’’ for them.  f  HEALTH CARE REFORM  (",2010

558,4,2010-03-18,Mr. DANIEL E.," LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, it occurs to me  that one of the strangest things that  happens on this floor is when you bring  the gavel down and say, The time has  expired, and then people keep on talking and then turn to you and they say,  I yield back the balance of my time.  That is sort of a metaphor for the problem here  in Congress. When we announce a tax cut, we say we are giving  something back to you as if we had the  call on your money  in the  first  instance.  It’s just one of the fictions we deal  with, such as the fiction that this bill  isn’t going to cost us any money, or  the fiction that the American people  don’t know what’s in the bill, or the  fiction that the American people will  love it once we pass it.  Let’s remember August. It did occur.  It’s something that is a manifestation  of the American people and how they  feel. Let’s not  ignore the American  people. Let’s be  the House of Representatives.  f  MOURNING THE PASSING OF ALEX  CHILTON  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2010
559,4,2010-03-18,Mr. COHEN.," Madam Speaker, today I  come before you with a heavy heart,  for a friend of mine and a great friend  of music in the world, and particularly  from my hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, passed away last night. Alex  Chilton, who was a  rock-and-roller,  who was an  indie music alternative  producer,  songwriter,  and  guitarist,  passed away. Alex Chilton, at age 16,  had a number one hit with a group  called the Box Tops, a song called ‘‘The  Letter.’’  Gotta get a ticket for an airplane.  Ain’t got time to catch a fast train.  Lonely days are gone. I’m a-going  home.  My baby just wrote me a letter.  That was number one when he was 16.  He went on with the Box Tops to do  other songs.  And then he had a group called Big  Star. Big Star wasn’t well known. They  did three albums. But ‘‘Rolling Stone’’  put all three albums in the top 500 albums ever produced in America, and  two of his singles were among the top  500 singles ever done in America.  Alex Chilton was  like so much  in  Memphis. He grew up at a time when  Elvis Presley was our emissary to the  world. He wanted to play music, and he  did it, and he did it in his own way:  independent, iconoclastic, innovative.  He never cared  for the critics. He  didn’t have that much acclaim at the  box office or in record sales, but he did  with others. REM was a group that he  influenced greatly, and the Replacements  did  a  song  called  ‘‘Alex  Chilton.’’  He was supposed to play at South By  Southwest this week in Austin. They  are mourning him. He was supposed to  play in Memphis on May 15 with the reunion of Big Star at the Overton Park  Shell. He won’t do that.  His music will live on forever. He is  an  embodiment  of Memphis music:  hard, different, independent, brilliant,  and beautiful. We are lucky he came  our way.  He leaves a wife and a daughter.  f  b1030  HEALTH CARE REFORM  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2010
560,4,2010-03-18,Ms. FOXX.," Madam Speaker, the people of this country like to have simple  truth; and the simple truth about the  bill that we are probably going to vote  on this week is that Americans are opposed to the health care bill. But the  Democrats in charge of the Congress  think they are smarter than the average American and are going to cram  through this bill with tricks, and the  people do not want it. It takes away individual freedom and puts the government in charge.  Even the President admitted at the  Republican retreat that you would not  be able to keep your health insurance  if you like it, despite the fact that he  had been saying that for months.  Even some Democrats don’t like the  Senate bill or didn’t like the Senate  bill that is what is going to be voted  on. And the chair of the House Rules  Committee said last year the Senate  should,  ‘‘go  back  to  the  drawing  board,’’ and that the Senate bill, ‘‘will  do almost nothing to reform health  care but will be a windfall for insurance companies.’’  Vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill.  f  PROVIDING  FOR  CONSIDERATION  OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE  RULES  ",2010

568,11,2010-03-18,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," For those who  can afford it, they have some of the  best health care  in  the world. But  Americans, overall, by any objective  measure of performance, like life expectancy, or how soon babies die, we  don’t perform very well.  And  increasingly,  the pressure on  small business to deal with the failing  system, what’s happening on families  who are having more and more insurance  bureaucrats  trying  to  prevent  them from getting coverage, is a prescription for disaster. That’s why this  year there will be more than 1,000 people that I represent who will go bankrupt from medical costs, and most of  them have insurance.  Madam Speaker, that doesn’t happen  anywhere else  in the world. And  if  we’re able to move forward with this  health care reform, it will no longer  happen in the United States.  ",2010
569,11,2010-03-18,Ms. FOXX.," Madam Speaker, I reserve  the balance of my time.  ",2010
570,11,2010-03-18,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Madam Speaker, at  this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO).  ",2010
571,11,2010-03-18,Mr. TONKO.," Madam Speaker, I think  it is so important for us to move forward and not be derailed in our efforts  to reform what is important policy in  this country. Health care, obviously, is  something that needs to be provided in  terms of insurance to our working families out there. We know the impact of  delay and the impact of no reforms.  Status quo simply does not cut it. We  cannot afford to allow our families to  continue with such gross injustice.  Obviously,  the  increase  projected,  $1,800 per year for family plans, is a  train wreck waiting to happen. Today  the average of some $13,000 for family  plans would grow in the next decade to  some $31,000. Which small business out  there could afford to pay that or even  a fraction of that for its employees?  We know that what we’re trying to  maintain here  is an employee-based  health care insurance system. Well, the  employer-based  system  needs  some  sort of relief. We need to know that  there are assurances  for  containing  those costs, for making certain that  into the future we’ll have a safety net  for our working families and for our  business community. In the measure  we’re advancing there is assistance for  small businesses. It’s providing them  the opportunity to make this sharing  affordable.  We know that the benefits that come  with reducing the deficit with our bill,  having been scored by CBO, is looking  at $130 billion for the first 10 years and  some  $1.2  trillion  into  the next  10  years. This is progress. This is a step in  the right direction.  We also know of the reforms where  those who are denied,  for whatever  bias—for gender, for preexisting conditions, for acne, almost a laughable concept, but used to deny people. Toddlers  who are denied because of overweight,  individuals who have perhaps been violated, sexually violated, or domestic  violence, have been denied. These reforms are essential, and let’s do them  now.  ",2010
572,11,2010-03-18,Ms. FOXX.," Madam Speaker, I’d like  to yield 1 minute to my colleague from  Arizona (Mr. FLAKE).  ",2010
573,11,2010-03-18,Mr. FLAKE.," Madam Speaker, you  know, it’s often said around this place  that nobody cares about process. It’s  only the substance of the policy. But  the process  lends  itself to the substance. And bad process equals bad policy, especially when it’s done over and  over again.  Now we’ve seen over the past couple  of years a shrinking of the ability of  the minority party to actually come to  the  floor, offer  the amendments  it  would like to offer, actually have an  impact on  the policy debate. Now,  that’s process. But it has an impact on  the policy.  Over time, if a majority simply asserts its rights under the House rules  to minimize debate or to have a vote  without having a vote, to deem something through, if you do that kind of  thing continually, you’re going to get a  bad product. And I would suggest that  the health care reform bill that we will  vote on, maybe, or we will deem later  this weekend, is a bad product, and it’s  partly because of a flawed process.  ",2010
574,11,2010-03-18,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Madam Speaker, I  yield myself 10 seconds. You want to  talk about process? Over the past year  and a half the House held nearly 100  hours of hearings. In 83 hours of committee markups we heard from 181 witnesses, both Democrat and Republican.  Two hundred thirty-nine amendments  were considered, and 121 were adopted.  I think that’s a pretty good process.  I reserve my time.  ",2010
575,11,2010-03-18,Ms. FOXX.," Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve.  ",2010
576,11,2010-03-18,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Madam Speaker,  I’m the final speaker, so I would yield  to the gentlelady to give her closing,  and I’ll reserve my time.  ",2010
577,11,2010-03-18,Ms. FOXX.," Madam Speaker, I want  to say that what my colleague from  Massachusetts just said about all those  hours of hearings, it was a totally different bill. No hearings have been held  on this bill; a totally different bill.  That  isn’t the way we work around  here.  What they’re asking people not to  vote on is a bill that came from the  Senate. It isn’t the House bill. So let’s,  again, get  real here and  let’s  talk  about what we should be talking about.  You know, my colleagues across the  aisle were against the Senate bill before they were for the bill, and I would  like to quote my distinguished colleague who is the Chair of the Rules  Committee when she said on December  23, 2009, ‘‘Under the Senate bill, millions of Americans will be forced into  private insurance plans which will be  subsidized by taxpayers. That alternative will do almost nothing to reform health care, but will be a windfall  for insurance companies.’’ She went on  to then say ‘‘The Senate has ended up  with a bill that isn’t worthy of its support. Supporters of the weak Senate  bill say, just pass it. Any bill is better  than no bill. I strongly disagree.’’  b1130  Now that very same person has done  everything possible  to get  this bill  passed in this House so that it will become law. It is no wonder that the majority is considering procedural tricks  and sleight of hand, because the bill  that they are proposing to pass doesn’t  provide true health care reform. And  the process doesn’t pass the sniff test.  Republicans will never accept  the  status quo for health care. We can do  better. We need to have a bill that will  lower the cost of health care in America. But you do not lower the cost of  health care by creating new government-run programs. We can lower the  cost by putting patients, average, everyday Americans in charge of their  health care, not insurance companies  and not the government. Lower costs  will result  from putting patients  in  charge of their health care through innovations like expanded health savings  accounts and by making sure that trial  lawyers are not driving up the cost of  health care with a blizzard of frivolous  lawsuits.  We should be revitalizing America’s  economy and promoting economic freedom. The nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office estimates that the Republican plan will reduce the deficit by  $68 billion.

This includes  a study of any perchlorate concentration plumes within an aquifer and its  possible contamination of other nearby  aquifers.  BACA b1445  The ground water constitutes about  79 percent of the drinking water supply  in the entire Inland Empire area of  California, and it is, as such, critical to  understand any threats posed by contamination to this supply.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to  support passage of H.R. 4252.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010
582,18,2010-03-18,Mr. MCCLINTOCK.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  this well-intentioned  bill tries to force the administration  into making ground water cleanup in  the Rialto-Colton Basin of California a  priority. Everyone acknowledges that  this bill is a restatement of current  law, and that new funding is not authorized in this bill, but we all understand what the gentleman from California is trying to accomplish and, in  the  spirit of bipartisanship, Republicans supported his efforts in the Natural Resources Committee.  But I need to point out that this bipartisan  gesture  continues  to  go  unreciprocated. We’ve been trying in  vain for months now to get the same  kind of bipartisan cooperation to restore full water deliveries to the Central Valley of California. The valley’s  economy has been devastated by the diversion of 200 billion gallons of water  in order to dump that water into the  Pacific Ocean to serve the left’s pet  cause, the 3-inch Delta Smelt.  Apologists for this policy argue that,  well, it’s the drought. Well, they ignore  the fact that the drought we’ve had is  a relatively minor one by historical  standards, it appears to be over, and  that in far more severe droughts in the  past, far more water has reached the  Central Valley. But that’s before the  environmental left took over our water  policy and diverted 200 billion gallons  of that water into the Pacific Ocean.  It’s unfortunate that the majority  actually rewrote this bill specifically  to keep us from offering amendments  that would address the agony of the  Central Valley.  Time and again, the majority, using  parliamentary  gimmicks,  has  prevented any attempt to restore normal  water deliveries to the San Joaquin  Valley.  By the Obama administration’s own  numbers, it spent about $1.5 billion as  part of the so-called ‘‘stimulus’’ in the  Central Valley’s six Congressional districts to save or create 1,600 jobs.  Well, today Congress has the power  to restore tens of thousands of jobs lost  because of water diversions at no cost  to taxpayers. This House is in possession of a bill to do just that, H.R. 3105,  by my colleague, Congressman NUNES.  But still it studiously avoids exercising  that power because this administration  and this majority  in Congress have  chosen fish over people.  Farmers in the San Joaquin Valley  are now faced with making planning  decisions. Despite near record precipitation in the northern Sierra watershed—NOAA this week reported that  precipitation is now 129 percent of normal—the Department of the Interior  has  just  announced Central Valley  farmers will be guaranteed only 25 percent of their normal allocations. Let  me repeat that so it sinks in. Precipitation is 129 percent of normal; guaranteed water delivery is 25 percent of normal.  Even Senator FEINSTEINtried to give  the farmers a 40 percent water allocation, yet that effort has been opposed  by  the  environmental  left  and  its  friends in Congress.  Perchlorate contamination in the Inland Empire is the indirect result of  Federal policy, and the Federal government has a responsibility to assist the  people of the Inland Empire with cleanup. But the agony of California’s Central Valley is the direct result of policies that Congress could change in this  very bill. It’s disappointing to me that  the majority chooses not to do so. I  think  it makes a mockery of any  claims of bipartisanship, although we  once again extend that offer of bipartisanship by supporting this bill, and invite the majority to join us.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010

584,18,2010-03-18,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in strong support of H.R. 4252, the Inland Empire Perchlorate Ground Water  Plume Assessment Act to direct the  Secretary of the Interior to conduct a  study of water resources in the Rialto-  RAHALL NAPOLITANO,  Colton Basin in the State of California,  and for other purposes.  I would like to also thank Chairman  and Ranking Member DOC  HASTINGS, and my good friend, chairwoman from the Water and Power Subcommittee, GRACE and  the ranking member, my good friend  from  the State  of California, Representative TOMMCCLINTOCK, for their  support of this legislation.  And I want to thank Representative  BORDALLO from Guam for speaking in  support of this much-needed  legislation.  I also want to take the time to thank  my colleagues  in the House of Representatives for their bipartisan support on an important bill, not only the  Inland Empire, but it will also give us  a study in terms of the effects it has on  many cities too as well.  In addition, I want to commend the  city of Rialto and the Perchlorate Task  Force, city Councilman Ed Scott and  Rialto Mayor Pro Tem Joe Baca, Jr.,  for their hard work and dedication in  protecting families.  The city realizes that the water from  over 20 wells was contaminated by perchlorate. I state, 20 wells were contaminated by Perchlorate. Perchlorate  is a rocket fuel additive, an unstable  organic compound that has been found  to be harmful to humans because it  interferes with the thyroid  function.  And you know when it interferes with  the thyroid function it affects many  women and others in that area.  I’m very familiar with the water contamination. My family lives in the city  of Rialto. My children, my friends and  close neighbors know what it’s like to  live with water that is contaminated.  When we first learned that our water  was not safe to drink, we were all very  much scared in terms of the water and  the quality that came out and the  neighbors and the people in that area.  We wondered how long this water was  bad. We worried about  the damage  caused by poor quality water. We were  nervous because we drank the water,  cooked with the water, bathed our children with the water.  Therefore, I drafted this bill to make  sure  that other  families and neighboring cities will not have to suffer or  have that kind of fear.  This bill is requesting that the plume  in the Rialto-Colton basin is studied,  and I state studied. Plumes are underground pockets of water, and some are  pools of water. Some travel like underground rivers.  In Rialto, the plume has perchlorate  in it. We know that the water in this  plume  is moving. The contaminated  water  is  traveling underground. We  don’t know how big it is or how fast  the water is moving. We need to know  more about the plume to permanently  the fix the problem.  The  research  established  by  the  study in H.R. 4252 will guarantee that  the problem will be identified. A study  by the U.S. Geological Survey is not  something done lightly. It is an intense  research endeavor.

587,25,2010-03-18,Mr. BOSWELL.," I do rise in support.  I understand you had the debate, but  I would feel remiss if I didn’t make a  few comments  for my  fellow airmen  that have served and serve with great  distinction.  It has probably been said, but Congress  established  the Distinguished  Flying Cross 80 years ago, and today it  is America’s oldest military aviation  award. The medal was created to symbolize sacrifice and heroism.  I applaud Mr. CALVERT for  introducing this legislation, which will finally give Distinguished Flying Cross  recipients  the  national  recognition  they deserve. Many may know that I  served in the U.S. Army for 20 years,  including a couple tours in Vietnam. I  had  the  opportunity  to  serve with  many great aviators who were also  awarded  the  Distinguished  Flying  Cross.  I was truly honored to not only serve  with these aviators but, in some cases,  to supervise them. I had the opportunity to recommend brave individuals  for  the Distinguished Flying Cross.  Their heroism and valor oftentimes inspired me and kept me going in the  face of adversity.  This bill today honors my fellow aviators I served with during my 20 years,  in addition to the men and women who  now are protecting us in the skies domestically and abroad. My experience  in the Army has a strong influence on  me and added to many positives in the  rest of my life.  When I look back at that time, I remember those I served with who gave  the ultimate sacrifice to our country,  those who served and gave their lives  for our freedom. And I feel honored I  had the opportunity to serve. Because  of this experience, I truly relish what a  tremendous gift and what a privilege it  is to be an American.  Today  I am extremely pleased  to  honor those aviators and all aviators. I  strongly urge my colleagues to join in  supporting H.R. 2788.  ",2010

The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:  H.R. 4395  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. GETTYSBURG NATIONAL MILITARY  PARK BOUNDARY REVISION.  Section 1 of the Act titled ‘‘An Act to revise  the boundary of the Gettysburg National Military Park  in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and for other purposes’’, approved August 17, 1990 (16 U.S.C. 430g–4), is amended by  adding at the end the following:  ‘‘(d) ADDITIONALLAND.—In addition to the  land identified in subsections (a) and (b), the  park shall also  include the following, as depicted on the map titled ‘Gettysburg National  Military Park Proposed Boundary Addition’,  numbered 305/80,045 and dated January 2010:  ‘‘(1) The land and interests in land commonly  known as the ‘Gettysburg Train Station’ and its  immediate surroundings in the Borough of Gettysburg.  ‘‘(2) The land and interests in land located  along Plum Run in Cumberland Township.’’.  SEC. 2. ACQUISITION AND DISPOSAL OF LAND.  Section 2 of that Act (16 U.S.C. 430g–5)  is  amended by adding at the end of subsection (a)  the following: ‘‘The Secretary is also authorized  to acquire publicly owned property within the  area defined in section 1(d)(1) by purchase, from  willing sellers only, if efforts to acquire that  property without cost have been exhausted. The  Secretary may not acquire property within the  area defined  in section 1(d) by eminent domain.’’.  ",2010

593,25,2010-03-18,Ms. BORDALLO.," Madam Speaker,  H.R. 4395, introduced by Representative  of Pennsylvania, would  authorize a boundary change at Gettysburg National Military Park to include the Gettysburg Train Station.  Madam Speaker,  it was  here  that  President Lincoln arrived to honor the  war dead on the field of battle and deliver the address that would forever define the Civil War as a battle for the  freedom and the rights of all Americans.  Under the proposed legislation, the  National Park Service would take over  management of the train station from  the Borough of Gettysburg, and community partners would staff it. The bill  would also expand the park boundaries  to include additional historic lands and  would add protections for the resources  of this hallowed site.  Madam Speaker, H.R. 4395 has broad  bipartisan  support, and we urge  its  adoption by the House today.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010
594,25,2010-03-18,Mr. MCCLINTOCK.," Madam Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  The legislation allows the National  Park Service to accept the donation of  a small parcel of land that will allow it  to better interpret the historic battle  for which the park was created. It also  authorizes the Park Service to purchase the historic train depot where  Abraham Lincoln arrived and departed  from his historic visit in 1863.  I am told that there was a time when  that historic train depot served as a  pizza parlor. Today, it serves a much  more  fitting role as a museum, and  under this measure the Park Service  will take over its operation.  I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman, Mr. PLATTS, the author of the measure.  ",2010
595,25,2010-03-18,Mr. PLATTS.," Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. And I  certainly rise in support today of H.R.  4395, a bill to extend the boundaries of  the  Gettysburg  National  Military  Park.

596,32,2010-03-18,Mr. POE  of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  America is the most generous country  on the face of the earth. Americans  have given more in blood and treasure  worldwide to help others than any nation in the history of the world.  But the Navy Times is reporting that  the United States does not fly our flag  at  its main  installation at Port-au-  Prince  in Haiti. The administration  says flying the flag may give people in  Haiti the wrong  idea. Well, what  is  that supposed to mean? Is our government ashamed of Old Glory?  News reports say that every other nation involved in relief efforts is proudly  flying their flag in Haiti. Americans in  Haiti are a testament to the good intentions of our country. Why should  the administration force the military  to hide our flag as if it’s ashamed of  the red, white, and blue?  The flag represents everything that’s  good and right about America. American troops should be able to fly the  Stars and Stripes wherever they are in  this world serving our Nation. After  all, isn’t that what the flag is about?  But now it sounds like the administration is once again apologizing for  Americans being American.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  HEALTH CARE REFORM  (Mr. INSLEE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2010
597,32,2010-03-18,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, as we head  to our health care reform decision, I  think a story of a fellow I met the  other day, a very unique American,  bears repeating. His name is Gary Hall.  He was in my office yesterday.  Gary Hall won five gold medals, three  silver medals, and two bronze medals  in  swimming,  over  three  separate  Olympics, really an incredible achievement. He got his medical  insurance  through the Olympic Committee for 12  years, but after that he wasn’t eligible.  And guess what happened? No one  would write him insurance because he  has diabetes.  The  insurance companies  said, we  don’t care if you’ve won gold medals,  silver medals, and bronze medals, we  won’t give you insurance.  Now, that has got to change. We have  to pass a health reform bill. Whether  you’ve won a gold medal in swimming  or you’re just an average Joe or Jane,  you ought to be able to buy insurance,  even if you’ve got diabetes.  We are going to have a bill on the  floor shortly that we are going to vote  on. The vote’s going to be transparent.  It’s going to be recorded. Everybody  knows what it’s going to be. It’s going  to be constitutional. It’s going to be  just the way we’ve voted  for years.  We’re going to make sure people get  health insurance in this country.  f  SIMPLE TRUTHS  (Mr. KINGSTON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2010
598,32,2010-03-18,Mr. KINGSTON.," Mr. Speaker, it’s a  simple truth that Republicans in Congress spent too much money. It’s a  simple truth, though, that in 12 years  of Republican deficits, the Democrats  in 1 year spent more money, with a deficit of $1.4 trillion in 1 year.  It’s a simple truth you can’t insure 30  million more people without costing  more to the Federal Government. It’s a  simple truth that if the government rewrites all the health care laws, you  can’t keep the health insurance that  you now have.  It’s a simple truth that with millions  of new bureaucracies, or thousands of  new bureaucracies and billions more  dollars, bureaucrats will come in between you and your doctor.  And it’s a simple truth the government  that  brought you  ‘‘Cash For  Clunkers’’ is not going to deliver good  health care policy.  And it’s a simple truth if the bill was  so good we wouldn’t need the Cornhusker kickback; we wouldn’t need the  Gatorade payoff; we wouldn’t need the  Louisiana purchase, and we would not  have to promise to all Members of Congress all kinds of things that are in  this bill and other bills to come if it  was a good bill.  It’s a simple truth the American people want us to start all over, and that’s  what we should be doing.  f  HEALTH REFORM AND WOMEN  (Ms. SUTTON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2010
599,32,2010-03-18,Ms. SUTTON.," Mr. Speaker, health  care reform is critical to ensure that  women have access to affordable health  care. Currently, women can be charged  higher rates simply because of their  gender.  The Joint Economic Committee has  estimated that 64 million women do  not have adequate health  insurance  coverage today. 1.7 million women have  lost their health  insurance coverage  since the beginning of the economic  downturn, and 39 percent of all low-income women  lack health  insurance  coverage.  Women are also more likely to deplete  their  savings accounts paying  medical bills than men. The health reform  legislation being considered by  Congress will help address all of these  critical issues, and more. It will eliminate insurance coverage discrimination  based on gender, provide access to affordable policies to all Americans, it  will prevent bankruptcies due to medical  costs  by  capping  out-of-pocket  payments, and it will prohibit insurance  companies  from discriminating  based on preexisting conditions, including the despicable practice of calling  domestic violence victims preexisting  conditions.  It’s time to pass this.  f  WHAT THE HECK, AMERICA  (Mr. BURTON of Indiana asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)  ",2010
600,32,2010-03-18,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," You know, I  just love to listen to my colleagues on  the Democrat  side.  I  love  them  so  much. And they  just don’t mention  some of the other things that are going  on, like the budget this year is $3.8 trillion that we don’t have. But the taxpayers are going to have to pay for it.  They’ll have to pay to for it with inflation or higher taxes.  And they don’t mention that there’s  going to be $569.2 billion in new taxes.  What the heck, we can afford that. And  Medicare and Medicare Advantage  is  going to be cut by $520 billion. But  what the heck, the seniors, they don’t  have to worry about that. They can,  you know, ask  their grandkids  for  some of that money.  And of course the total cost is not  $980 billion. It’s going to be about $1.3  or $1.4 trillion, and I really believe it’s  going to be more like $2.5 to $3 trillion.  We don’t have that money, and it’s a  new entitlement, but what the heck,  America. You can handle that. This is  just money, and we can always print  more. Of course it causes inflation and  higher taxes, but who cares. You can  get it done.  f  THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH  CARE REFORM TO WOMEN  (Ms. HIRONO asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2010
601,32,2010-03-18,Ms. HIRONO.," Mr. Speaker, it bears  repeating, few Americans have more at  stake  in  health  care  reform  than  women.  Forty States allow private health insurance companies to gender rate their  premiums. As a result, a 25-year-old  woman may pay between 6 percent and  45 percent more than a 25-year-old man  to get the same coverage.  Fifty-two percent of women reported  postponing or forgoing medical care because of cost. Only 39 percent of men  reported having had those experiences.

602,39,2010-03-18,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. MALONEY)  is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2010
603,39,2010-03-18,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, as we  face what may be one of the most important decisions Congress has made in  our lifetime, I would like to highlight  what a huge, positive impact the passage of health care reform will have on  the lives of American women, on the  health and the economic well-being of  our mothers, daughters, your wives,  and your sisters.  First and foremost, passing reform  will expand dramatically the number  of women and children who have access  to quality health care throughout their  lifetime.  The  Joint  Economic  Committee,  which I chair, has issued a report entitled ‘‘Comprehensive Health Insurance  Reform: An Essential Prescription for  Women,’’ which documents  that,  in  America today, 64 million women lack  adequate health  insurance. Over one  quarter of our daughters between the  ages of 19 and 24 do not have any coverage;  39 percent of all  low-income  women lack health insurance coverage.  Passing health care reform will expand  the availability of care, improve the affordability of care, and will expand the  minimums of care.  Today, due to costs, 1 in 5 women  over age 50 has not had a mammogram  in the past 2 years due to costs. The  health care reform bill will require  coverage of annual mammograms for  women,  including coverage  for those  under 50.  Passing health care reform will bring  badly needed changes to a system that  places a particularly unfair burden on  women who seek to buy insurance in  the individual market.  In a report by the National Women’s  Law Center titled, ‘‘How the Individual  Insurance Market Fails Women,’’ investigators found there are huge and  arbitrary variations in each State and  across the country in the differences in  premiums charged between women and  men.  The report found that insurers who  practice gender rating might charge a  40-year-old woman anywhere  from  4  percent to 48 percent more than a 40-  year-old man. Passing health care reform will put an end to that. Insurance  companies will no longer be allowed to  charge women higher premiums simply  because they are women.  Health care reform will also put an  end to discrimination based solely on  the prospects of motherhood. In most  States today, individual market insurers are allowed to deny health insurance coverage to an applicant simply  because she is pregnant. A previous C-  section can also be the basis for denying coverage.  Passing health care reform will put  an end to discrimination based on preexisting conditions. And they call pregnancy a preexisting condition.  Reform is also urgently needed because, under the status quo, even if you  are not pregnant now but at some point  in the future you may become pregnant  and so you may wish to buy maternity  coverage now, coverage  simply may  not be available.  In the capital cities of four States,  Hawaii, New Mexico, North Dakota,  and South Dakota, the NOW Women’s  Law Center investigators were unable  to find an offer of maternity coverage  in the individual market at any price.  It simply was not available.  Under the status quo, only 14 States  require maternity coverage in policies  that are sold on the individual markets. No wonder then that 79 percent of  women with individual market policies  don’t have any maternity coverage at  all. And if you don’t have maternity  coverage, heaven help you if you have  a problem pregnancy because your insurance company will not be there to  help.  Passing the health care reform will  put an end to all of this and require  that maternity care is a part of an essential benefits package.  And then there is the problem of rescission. Evidence  presented  to  the  House Energy  and Commerce Committee told a story of a Texas woman  who had a policy with WellPoint. After  she received treatment relating to a diagnosis of a lump in her breast, the insurance  company  investigated  her  medical history. They concluded that  she failed to disclose that she had been  diagnosed previously with osteoporosis  and bone density loss, and so they rescinded her policy.  Well, Mr. Speaker,  I believe practically every woman alive has some  form of bone density loss. They refused  to pay for medical care for the lump in  her breast.  According to the Committee’s investigation,  this case was not unusual. Under current  practices, the majority of States do not require  a showing of fraud or intent before insurance  companies may rescind coverage.  A simple mistake, an oversight, a typo can  result in a life altering denial.  Health care reform will put an end to such  cruel and heartless practices.  While  I strongly support  the passage of  health care reform, I must state my opposition  to any restrictions on women’s access to reproductive health services. At a time when we  are making historic changes in the delivery of  health care, we must not deprive women of  the very health care they both need and deserve. We must work against any serious constraints on abortion coverage that could cause  women to lose ground in health reform.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot and we must not  turn our backs on the urgent need, on the call  of history, on the millions of uninsured, on the  tens of millions who cast their votes in the last  election and on the promise the we made loud  and clear: We will pass health care reform—  and we will pass it now.

604,46,2010-03-18,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my colleague  from Louisiana, Dr. FLEMING,  for not only yielding a little time to  me but also for being here on the floor  to control the time. Mr. Speaker, as  you know, each side of the aisle gets a  leadership hour, and  it  seems  that  maybe our Democratic friends who had  the previous hour and only took 35  minutes came to the conclusion that  the  less  said  the better about  this  health care bill. That seems to be the  way  things  have  been  going, Mr.  Speaker, in regard to how much we  know about what is in the bill. We will  be talking about that a good little bit  tonight. I can assure you, Mr. Speaker,  on our side of the aisle, we’ve got a lot  to say. I think the more said the better.  The American people need to know.  They need to be informed. Indeed they  know already a lot, know enough to  say, as 70 percent of them do, that they  don’t want this bill. Not this bill. As  Dr. FLEMING said, Mr. Speaker, I was  doing a tele-town hall meeting to my  constituents  in the 11th of Georgia,  northwest Georgia, the nine counties  that  I  represent,  the  700,000 people,  salt-of-the-earth  folks,  just  as Dr.  FLEMING represents the same kind of  folks in Louisiana. Suffering folks, unemployed folks, struggling folks.  I did a poll question on this tele-town  hall call that probably went out maybe  to 25,000 households. And a lot of them  were on the line and listening and asking questions and staying in the queue  for the whole hour and 30 minutes, I  think we went.  Mr. Speaker, the poll question was, if  your greatest concern about this bill,  the so-called Patient Protection and  Health Accountability Act or whatever  it is called, H.R. 3590, the Senate bill  that is going to be deemed passed if the  Democratic majority has their way,  what’s your greatest concern? If it’s  the economy, the effect that this bill  will have on the economy, push ‘‘1’’ on  your keypad. If your greatest concern  is the effect it will have on your health  or the health of your immediate family, press ‘‘2.’’ If your number one concern about this bill is the devastating  effect that it will have on the Medicare  program and our senior citizens, you,  your parents, your grandparents, press  ‘‘3’’ on the keypad. If your concern is  all of the above, press ‘‘4.’’  Well, I am going to tell you, 65 percent of them, Representative FLEMING,  65  percent  of  them, Mr.  Speaker,  pressed ‘‘4.’’ That is what I would have  pressed, too. It was equal, 10, 12 percent  equally divided among the other three.  People are outraged, Mr. Speaker. It  is just unbelievable to me. Let’s refer  to the first slide, this poster that I  have got to my right, your left. What  Americans Want. I wasn’t surprised at  all by the poll that I took tonight because the American people have been  saying this  for months and months.  The first bullet point on the slide, 73  percent of Americans want Congress to  start over on health care reform, or if  they are unwilling to do that, this is a  situation where it’s better to do nothing. They don’t believe we should do  something even if it’s wrong. No, if it’s  wrong, do nothing. Second bullet point,  56 percent of people want the Congress  to tackle health care reform on a step-  by-step basis, not a wholesale government takeover.  b2030  Mr. Speaker, when Senator LAMAR  ALEXANDERa couple weeks ago at the  Blair House went to the health care  summit, when he could finally get a  word in edgewise after our President  finished  filibustering, said the same  thing. Said, Look, we can solve the  problem. We can actually  lower the  cost of health insurance and, indeed,  the cost of health care if we do it in an  incremental, commonsense way.  And then when COBURNgot to speak,  Senator COBURN, Mr. Speaker, he said,  Mr. President, let me just make it brief  here. I know you’re not going to give  me a lot of time, and you’re controlling  the clock and who gets to speak. And  you took already twice the time that  we did in your opening statement. But  that is okay. You’re the President. But  give me a couple of minutes. I will  make two points. One, let’s eliminate  waste,  fraud,  and  abuse. And Dr.  had  some great  suggestions  about that.

605,53,2010-03-18,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," I wanted  to just point out real quickly before  yielding to my friend from Iowa, when  I think about tea in this country, Mr.  Speaker, I think about the Tea Party  Patriots, God bless them.  Mr. Speaker,  I wanted  to correct  something that I said a few minutes  ago because I misquoted Mom. I said  that Mom  said  that Representative  KINGwas her favorite Member of Congress. That’s not what Mom said. Mom  told me that I was still her favorite  Member of Congress. I think she even  said that I was the best looking. But  what she did say, Mr. Speaker, was  that Representative KINGwas the best  speaker, and I was highly offended by  that, but he is a pretty good speaker.  And Mom, here he comes.  I yield to the gentleman from Iowa,  Representative STEVEKING, my classmate.  ",2010
606,53,2010-03-18,Mr. KING of Iowa.," I thank my good  friend from Georgia (Dr. GINGREY). I  was prepared to correct that, because I  was entirely convinced that you did  misspeak and that Mrs. Gingrey’s favorite Member of Congress has to be  Congressman Dr. PHIL as  every mother’s son should be their favorite if she only has one. If she has  several, then it starts with first favorite, second favorite and on down the  line.  I’m pleased to be here with the Doctors Caucus and the friends that have  done battle with me and others here in  this Congress and across this country  to kill this  idea of taking over our  health care and establishing socialized  medicine. This is an American effort,  an American endeavor to tell the liberals and the progressives in this Congress that we will not have them take  away our liberty.  And Dr. GINGREYmentioned the Tea  Party Patriots. They have come to this  city and packed this Capitol. There are  a number of Tea Party groups that are  out there. A lot of other Patriots out  there in other ways. The 9/12 Project  people that have started, and then we  saw the Patriots show up on April 15  and then again and again throughout  the town hall meetings, and last August, the end of September came to  this city, and 10,000 to 50,000 people  packed this city on November 5 to say,  Take your hands off of my health care.  Two days later, on November 7, they  GINGREY,  filled us up again on the other side of  the Capitol and said, Take your hands  off our health care. Kill the bill.  The message, Mr. Speaker, and consistently for almost a year has been,  Kill the bill. Kill the bill. The American people want this bill killed. Seventy-five percent of the American people do not support the idea that the  government ought to step in and cancel  everybody’s health insurance policy in  America. Not the first day, but over  the course of 2 years, the Federal Government  would  cancel  everybody’s  health insurance policy, and the policy  you would get would be the policy then  that the health choices administration  commissioner decided was available to  you or your employer or subsidized by  some other taxpayer or fined if you  don’t buy it.  The idea that the Federal Government would cancel every health insurance policy and the health choices administration  commissioner, whom  I  call the commi-czar-issioner, would be  the one that would write the rules for  the 1,300 health insurance companies in  America and the 100,000 health insurance policies  that  exist as options  among the 50 States in America today,  and watch that happen where the Federal Government would then decide,  Well, you have a policy that is catastrophic with low premiums. We can’t  have that because it doesn’t have all  the bells and whistles that somebody  else’s  supermandated policy has. So  your health insurance policy for a 25-  year-old man in New Jersey, a healthy  young man, would  cost him  about  $6,000 a year compared to the $1,000 a  year for a similar but not identical policy for a healthy young man in Kentucky the same age.  Why would this country not allow  the young man from New Jersey to buy  a health insurance policy in Kentucky?  New Jersey has the mandates. Kentucky has  significantly  fewer mandates. I believe they have a higher percentage of the insured because when  their premiums go up, if you raise premiums 600 percent, you aren’t going to  have as many people covered, unless  you pay for that with the Federal Government.  Here’s one of the flaws, Mr. Speaker,  that came out this way. Some people  believe that the highest ideal was to  ensure that people could buy insurance  that had preexisting conditions. So if  we pass a law like that and tell insurance companies that you cannot consider  preexisting  health  conditions  when you decide to issue a policy, the  health  insurance  companies  then  wouldn’t be able to look at medical  records or make  that decision. The  buyers would know that, and so they  wouldn’t buy insurance until they got  sick. Then on their way to the emergency room or maybe on the gurney,  they’d fill out an application and buy  that insurance policy—the very same  equivalent to, if you didn’t buy your  property and car casualty insurance for  your house and you waited until your  house was on fire, and while the fire  truck was pulling up, then you would  fill out the insurance policy and buy  the insurance. You could save a lot of  premiums that way, get the same coverage, except somebody has to pay.  And so the liberals—the progressives  in this Congress, the people that are  associating with  the  socialists, and  some of  them actually are—decided  that you can’t have a health insurance  company  that’s denying people coverage because they have preexisting  conditions. So they would impose that  and say, No preexisting conditions can  be considered, but the only way that  you do that that way is you have to  then—because people won’t buy insurance until they get sick, then you have  to mandate that everybody has to buy  insurance. And when you mandate that  you do that, you cross that constitutional line that was much objected to  back in the nineties when Hillary Clinton was putting together HillaryCare.  And then there was a ruling, if I have  it here. I will have to ad lib it. But the  ruling was such that it said back then  that never before  in the history of  America—and  it didn’t happen with  HillaryCare, so it was just poised to be  so—had the Federal Government produced a product or approved a product  and required the American people to  buy that product, whether they chose  to participate or not. That is some authority that does not exist in the Constitution of the United States, and we  have to be able to say ‘‘no.’’ When we  break these principles that drain away  our personal liberty, they drain away  the American vitality at  the  same  time. They diminish all of us, Mr.  Speaker, and that’s the difference.  This side of the aisle over here, the  left, for more than 100 years in this  country, have always driven  to  increase the dependency class in America. They looked around and took a little message off Otto von Bismarck’s  plan, who put together socialized medicine in Germany over 100 years ago.  Bismarck’s approach was to create a  dependency class that knew that they  had to have him in office in order to  get their benefits that would be coming, and he created the idea of a national health care act then.  And  the  philosophy  that’s  flowed  from the non-English-speaking Europe,  the post-Enlightenment, non-English-  speaking Europe, has been a philosophy  that has always created dependencies.  And the expanding dependency class,  the people who have had a nice safety  net to be on for a long time now, now  we’ve cranked that safety net up to  being a hammock, and now this Congress wants to bring them the grapes  and the drinks and the fan. So the safety net that’s become a hammock diminishes our vitality. We don’t get out  of  that  hammock when  it’s  comfortable. We need to have some reward  for us working and taking care of our  families.  Our side of the aisle is about American vitality.

632,67,2010-03-18,Mr. CASEY.," It is an article, so you  will not be able to see it, but the headline  is  ‘‘Health Tops Pennsylvania  Business Woes.’’ The  subheadline  is  ‘‘State’s Small Businesses Also See the  Recession as a Severe Obstacle.’’  If you are a small business owner in  Pennsylvania, this survey shows, you  are worried about two things: the recession—no question about that having  an adverse impact; that is why the recovery bill and jobs bill are so important  to  these  small businesses—but  also health care.  I am reading an excerpt here:  About 71 percent of the 250 businesses that  responded to the survey said health care  costs were their biggest challenge.  Health care costs. This is not a group  of Democrats sitting around a room in  Pennsylvania saying: Let’s pass health  care. These are small business owners  in Pennsylvania. They might be Democratic, Republican,  Independent,  or  they may not have any affiliation.  Their life is running a small business  and raising their families, and 71 percent of those surveyed describe health  insurance as their ‘‘biggest challenge.’’  We do not need any longer to debate  whether this is an issue we have to deal  with.  I want to walk through some of the  basic provisions of what we have put in  place  in  the Senate bill, what  the  House has been wrestling with all these  months, and what President Obama has  been trying to do. Just a couple of  quick highlights.  First of all, if we are successful in  this opportunity to pass major health  care  reform,  other  issues we  have  talked about for years but do not get a  lot of attention are going to be finally  the law of the land. Quality and prevention—the information and research  on this is irrefutable. If you insist on  prevention and you make  it  free or  very low cost, that person is going to  be healthier because they are going to  take steps that are preventive in nature. They are going to be healthier,  their family is going to be healthier,  they are going to be better on the job  and the economy will be stronger. But  also we are going to strengthen our  health care system in terms of costs.  We are going to reduce costs in a lot of  ways, but one of them is prevention  and elevating the quality of our care.  Sometimes people get the best care in  the world, but in some places that can  be very limited.  The second point on cost and deficit.  I mentioned that before. The deficit reduction in the Democratic health care  bill  is $130 billion over the  first 10  years. We will see if the Congressional  Budget Office alters that.  But from what we are hearing today,  some of the preliminary reports, that  number might hold up. Some thought  that because of the passage of time  that number might go down $130 billion  to $100 billion. But it is a tremendous  deficit reduction over 10 and over 20  years.  Protections. I talked about that before.  I  just want  to highlight  that  quickly. Basic protections  for American families who have health insurance coverage now, families going to  work, paying their premiums, and not  protected. They think they are protected because they have a policy, an  agreement, and they are paying their  premiums. They are doing their part.  Then some insurance company bureaucrat or some other player in this marketplace comes to them and says: We  know you are paying your premiums;  that you are holding up your end of the  bargain. But we, the insurance company, do not think you or your child  should have coverage. Sorry. You are  out of luck.  Well, we are dealing with that in a  couple of ways. First of all, it is important for people to understand what will  happen now  and what will happen  later.  If we get  this bill passed,  6  months after the President would sign  it into law, it would be illegal for an  insurance company to deny a child coverage because of a preexisting condition. That is a tremendous change in  the  first  year—literally,  after  6  months.  In that same time period and beyond  that, if you are an adult, technically  you would not have the legal protection because you cannot do all of this  at once. So we had to decide, do we do  nothing in the short term or do we at  least protect  children. We are protecting children  in  the  first couple  months of the bill. But even though  technically an adult would not have  legal protection until 2014, they will  have recourse. They will have an option to say: I am an adult. I have been  denied  coverage  because  of  a  preexisting condition. I can go into a high-  risk pool and get coverage.  So there is recourse in the first—actually, that is in the first 3 months for  the adult. So that is a very important  protection. We can  talk more  later  about that.  Finally, and I will begin to close, on  children’s health  insurance—I talked  about that before—it is important to  note what the bill does on a great successful program, the Children’s Health  Insurance Program.  For example,  in our State this  is  what children’s health insurance has  meant. It has meant that we have been  able to reduce our rate of uninsured  children down to 5 percent. It is still  not good enough; we still want to go  lower. But our uninsured rate among  children in Pennsylvania is 5 percent.  With regard to adults between the ages  of 18 and 64, it is 12 percent, so more  than double  for the adult uninsured  prior to getting to the age of Medicare.  That is more than double the children’s  uninsured rate. That is good for children that we have made progress—we  need to make more—but it is bad for  adults who have not had a strategy to  help them.  That is part of why we are trying to  pass the bill. At long last we are going  to be helping many adults, tens of millions. The Children’s Health Insurance  Program is extended under the bill for  2 years, until September 30, 2015.  What the President wants to do as  part  of  the  so-called  reconciliation  process is to maintain—he proposes to  require States to maintain eligibility  for children’s health insurance to 2019,  not just 2015, 2019. He wants to fund it  through 2016. I think that is a very important change that the President has  proposed and that we have a chance to  ratify in our debate.  There  is a  lot more we can talk  about, but I am running low on time.  But I think the basic question for the  American people is, Are we going to  have an up-or-down vote on health  care?  Some over there who have used this  process before for other measures over  many years seem to not want us to  have an up-or-down vote on health  care.  I think the American people want  that, even if they disagree with parts  of the bill. But the real question for  our Republican friends is, Will they be  responsive to Trisha Urban? Are they  just going to say that preexisting conditions are a problem; I know recisions  are a problem, I know limits on coverage are a problem for you and your  family; I know that denying a child  health care coverage because of a preexisting condition is a problem, but we  are not going to do anything about it;  the  insurance  companies were  too  strong; we could not beat them; we are  just going to go the way that so many  have gone in Washington.  I do not think that is going to be a  good enough answer for Trisha Urban  VerDate Nov 24 2008  23:34 Mar 18, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A18MR6.001 S18MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S B 2 K S D n o l n o o c d         ",2010
633,74,2010-03-18,Mr. PRYOR.," Madam President,  I  wish about 3 minutes to respond to my  colleagues.  I commend both Senator SESSIONS  and Senator MCCASKILL for the work  on their amendment. As I said, I voted  for previous editions of it. I think it  has one major flaw, and that is it only  deals with discretionary  spending.  I  know  it does affect the deficit, and  that is very important. But it focuses  just on the spending.  When we did multiyear discretionary  spending caps—they were a key part of  the 1990, 1993, 1997 deficit reduction  patches—they worked. However, those  deficit reduction patches looked at all  spending—mandatory  and  discretionary—as well as revenues. That is  what our amendment does. It takes the  whole picture.  If we are going to walk the walk on  having our fiscal house in order, we  need to look at the entire picture, and  I think we need to do it in a bipartisan  way, as they did in previous Congresses  when they made serious efforts to get  the deficit under control. It needs to be  bipartisan. One of the problems I have  is, if we fix discretionary spending, it  will be difficult for us to reach a bipartisan agreement on mandatory as well  as the revenue pieces of our budget.  Senator MCCASKILLmentioned this is  a baby step. I don’t know if it is a baby  step. What they are proposing is a very  solid first step to try to get our fiscal  house in order. I am just concerned it  might close the door.  I wish to make this point in closing.  If we look at these purple lines on this  graph, we  see  these years are  the  Obama years. Certainly, he inherited a  lot of things the first year, so the first  year probably is not fair to give to  him.  If you look to these years, to the  President’s credit, he says he wants to  freeze discretionary spending. He says  he wants the purple lines to get shorter. That is good, but it is not enough.  It is not enough. The President’s budget, in his proposal, in my estimation, is  not enough. We need to get this moving  back in the right direction.  If you  look at  just discretionary  spending and throw in the military discretionary spending as well, that  is  about 25 percent of the budget—just  discretionary alone. Domestic discretionary is only about 12 percent. But  put those two together, and let’s say it  is about 25 percent. The real flaw in the  McCaskill-Sessions is that we are using  25 percent of the budget to fix 100 percent of the budget. We need to put 100  percent of everything on the table so  we can then use our good judgment and  make those hard decisions to try to get  us back to a balanced budget.  We are not going to do this in 1 year.  We are probably not going to do it in 5  years. I wish we could do it in 5 years.  But these numbers are not enough, and  we need to move it back in the right direction. My approach actually helps  this picture quite a bit more than their  pictures help.  With that, Madam President, I yield  the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.  AMENDMENTNO. 3475  ",2010
634,74,2010-03-18,Mr. MCCAIN.," Madam President, I rise  in  support of amendment No.  3475,  which  I have  introduced. As  I have  stated  several  times  already,  the  amendment  is very simple. It would  place a moratorium on all earmarks in  years in which there is a deficit. I am  joined in this effort by my good friend  from  Indiana, Senator BAYH, and  I  again thank him for his leadership and  courage on this issue.  Last year, I reminded my colleagues  about the current  fiscal situation. I  think it is important to again review  the facts. The Treasury Department, a  week ago, announced the government  racked up a record-high monthly deficit of $220.9 billion. We now have a deficit of over $1.4 trillion and a debt of  $12.5 trillion, and unemployment remains at close to 10 percent. The list  goes on and on.  On Tuesday, the Senate rejected an  amendment  offered  by  Senator  DEMINT. This amendment called for a  moratorium on all earmarks for fiscal  years 2010 and 2011. There wasn’t anything  earth-shattering  about  that  amendment. It wouldn’t have shaken  the foundations of our democracy. It is  simply the political equivalent of calling a timeout. Yet, sadly, 68 Senators  voted against this modest proposal, including 15 from my own party.  So I have no illusions about the outcome of this amendment. I have been  around here long enough to see what  goes on. But it doesn’t mean I will quit  fighting, nor does it mean the American people will quit fighting to eliminate the waste and abuse of this system, and indeed the corruption that is  part of this earmarking.  I have  listened  to  the arguments  some of my colleagues continue  to  state; that eliminating the earmarks  isn’t necessary because they account  for such a small part of our annual  budget. Is that a reason to continue  this practice?  I am aware that earmarks consume a  small percentage of a budget measured  in the trillions, but given the seriousness of our current situation and the  problems that are confronting American families who wake up every morning wondering if they are going to lose  their job or their house, or if they will  still be able to afford their children’s  education,  it  is deeply offensive  to  them. It is deeply offensive that we in  Congress can’t exercise some fiscal discipline.  It  is all the more offensive  given that we have had in recent times  all the evidence we should require to  understand that earmarks are so closely tied to acts of official corruption.  In a report entitled ‘‘Why Earmarks  Matter,’’  the  Heritage  Foundation  wrote:  They  Invite Corruption: Congress  does  have a proper role in determining the rules,  eligibility and benefit criteria for Federal  grant  programs. However,  allowing  lawmakers to select exactly who receives government grants invites corruption. Instead  of entering a competitive application process  within a Federal agency, grant-seekers now  often have to hire a lobbyist to win the earmark auction. Encouraged by lobbyists who  saw a growth industry in the making, local  governments have become hooked on the  earmark process  for  funding  improvement  projects.  They Encourage Spending: While  there  may not be a causal relationship between the  two, the number of earmarks approved each  year tracks closely with growth in Federal  spending.  They Distort Priorities: Many earmarks do  not add new spending by themselves, but instead redirect  funds already slated to be  spent through competitive grant programs  or by States into specific projects favored by  an individual member. So, for example, if a  member of the Nevada delegation succeeded  in getting a $2 million earmark to build a bicycle trail in Elko in 2005, then that $2 million would be taken out of the $254 million  allocated  to  the Nevada Department  of  Transportation for that year. So if Nevada  had wanted to spend that money fixing a  highway and rapidly expanding Las Vegas,  thanks to the earmark, they would now be  out of luck.

636,81,2010-03-18,Mr. DORGAN.," We are on the FAA reauthorization bill. I want to comment  on the discussion of my colleague from  Arkansas, but I will do that briefly.  I did want to say before that, however, that we really threaten to lose  this bill. We have been on the floor now  5 days. We have a number of amendments. We are going  to vote at  2  o’clock today on a couple of amendments that are properly filed, but they  have nothing to do with the underlying  bill. We have some other amendments  still waiting that have nothing to do  with the underlying bill. And then we  have this issue of slot rules and perimeter rules with National Airport, which  is unbelievably complicated. I think we  have eight amendments, and my hope  is that we can convince people not to  offer those amendments. We will try to  deal with them in conference because  the House has a couple of provisions.  But  if we do not complete this bill  today, after 5 days, then I worry we  will never get back to it and once again  the issues of aviation safety and airport  improvement  funds and all of  those issues will be left at the starting  gate.  We have  extended  this  11  times.  Rather  than  reauthorizing  the FAA  bill, we have extended it 11 times.  Now we finally have legislation that  deals with aviation safety, which is so  unbelievably important, a passengers’  Bill of Rights, AIP improvement funds.  Let’s get this done today. I urge colleagues, if they have amendments to  offer, offer them.  As to the vote at 2 o’clock, Senator  PRYORhas offered an amendment that  one of my colleagues described as a  cover amendment, not very  serious.  That is unfair to Senator PRYOR. His  amendment is not only serious, it is so  much better than an amendment described as a baby step. It is OK to take  baby steps, but we don’t exactly face  baby challenges. We have unbelievable  fiscal policy challenges. It should not  surprise anybody that we  face these  unbelievable challenges. Ten years ago,  we had a budget  surplus. President  George Bush said: I want very large tax  cuts, the bulk of which will go to the  wealthiest Americans. Some of us said  no. I said no. Katy bar the door, it happened. It accounts for about 50 percent  of the current deficit, as a matter of  fact, going forward.  Then we had a recession. Then we  had a 9/11 attack. We had a war against  terrorism, a war in Afghanistan and in  Iraq, and now back  in Afghanistan.  None of that was paid for. All paid for  with emergency money stuck on top of  the Federal debt. This is unsustainable.  There is no question how serious it is.  But when we do address it, let’s address  it in a way that tends to grab this  problem and begins to fix it. My colleague seemed to suggest, let’s clean  house, and we will only do the smallest  room. That doesn’t make any sense to  me. Senator PRYOR has  offered  an  amendment that says: Let’s look at all  areas. I know why it is the smallest  room. Because the minute you talk  about taxes, some people here have an  apoplectic seizure. What about asking  people who aren’t paying  their  fair  share  to do  so. What about asking  those earning the highest incomes in  the land and paying a 15-percent tax  rate to begin paying what the rest of  the American people pay? How about  that? Is that a tax increase? I suppose  for somebody who makes $3.6 billion in  a year, which is $300 million a month  or $10 million a day, and that person,  who incidentally was the highest income earner running a hedge fund in  2008, that person not only got $10 million a day in income but, because of  the generosity of this Chamber and  others, gets to pay a 15-percent rate,  one of the lowest income tax rates.  Warren Buffett wrote an op-ed piece  some while ago. I like Warren Buffett.  I have known him for some years, one  of the world’s richest men. They did a  little survey in his office in Omaha. Of  the people who work in that office, if  you take a look at the taxes paid, income taxes and payroll, the lowest tax  rate paid was by one of the world’s  richest people. A higher tax rate is paid  by his receptionist than by him. Think  of that. Warren Buffett is the first to  say that is not fair. It is not right. You  need  to  straighten  that out. Under  what we are going to vote on proposed  by the Sessions-McCaskill amendment,  you couldn’t do that. They want to  keep that over here because that would  be trouble if you decided to ask those  folks to pay their fair share.  It is not a tax increase to ask others  to pay what most Americans pay. If  you want all the benefits America has  to offer, how about meeting the responsibilities to your country?  That is a lengthy way of saying, Senator PRYORhas offered an amendment  that says: Let’s  look at everything.  Let’s ask those who are not paying  their share to pay. Let’s look at discretionary spending but not only that.  Look at all of  it: Defense, entitlements, do it all, and do it in a serious  way with the seriousness of purpose  that says to the people looking to the  future, we are going to get this under  control. We are going to seize this deficit and debt problem and tame it. We  don’t have a choice. If we don’t reestablish some confidence in the future  among the American people, this economy will not recover.  I briefly taught economics in college.  I used to teach that this is all about  confidence.  If  people  are  confident,  they do things that are expansive to  the economy—buy a  suit, a car, a  home, take a trip. They do things that  expand the economy. When they are  not  confident  about  their  families,  about the future, they do exactly the  opposite. They  delay  the  purchase.  That contracts the economy. We need  to do some things that will give the  American people some confidence that  we are not going to stay on this path.  This path is unsustainable. It requires  us to look at every aspect of fiscal policy and domestic policy and find a way  to tame these deficits.  I strongly support the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas. I  don’t agree it deserves to be called a  cover amendment. It has a much greater seriousness of purpose than the Sessions-McCaskill amendment. I hope the  Senate will  see  fit  to  support  the  amendment offered by Senator PRYOR.  I yield the floor.  ",2010

TRAVELTOCUBA  Mr. President,  I wish  to visit  in  morning  business  about  legislation  that Senator MIKEENZI from Wyoming  and I have worked on now for some  long while. It has 38 cosponsors, 38 Senators  cosponsoring, Republicans and  Democrats. It deals with the question  of travel to Cuba.  As you know, what we have at the  moment and have had since 1962 is a  prohibition on the American people’s  ability  to  travel  to  the country of  Cuba. Cuba rests about 90 miles off our  shore. We have, obviously, had massive  disagreements with the Castro regime  for many years. In order to punish the  Castro regime, we have restricted the  rights of the American people to travel.  We can travel unimpeded to many  other countries. We can travel to Communist China. We can travel to Vietnam, a Communist country. We can  travel to North Korea, if you can get a  visa to get in. No restrictions there.  The American people just cannot travel to Cuba.  Let me describe the absurdity of this  which leads Senator ENZI and me to  offer this legislation. We have not offered it on the underlying bill today,  but we will offer it on an authorization  bill in the near future. With 38 cosponsors, we feel this bill would pass the  Senate with some ease.  Let me point out that the New York  Philharmonic Orchestra is the oldest  symphony orchestra in America, founded in 1842. The New York Philharmonic  Orchestra is one of our most renowned  cultural  ambassadors  around  the  world.  In  1959,  the New York Philharmonic played in the Soviet Union in  Moscow. Last year, the New York Philharmonic has also played music  in  Communist Vietnam. In 2008, the New  York Philharmonic played music  in  North Korea. By the way, if anyone has  a chance to go to YouTube and/or the  Internet and look at the reaction of the  North Koreans to the New York Philharmonic playing music in Pyongyang,  it  is extraordinary—quite a cultural  experience for our country to send this  philharmonic orchestra to those countries.  The only place they were not able to  play was Havana, Cuba, in October 2009.  Plans for those concerts had to be canceled. Think of that: the New York  Philharmonic was able to go and play  music in Moscow at the height of the  Cold War, in North Korea, in Vietnam,  but it wasn’t able to play in Havana,  Cuba.  Why? Well, we have had now, through  10 Presidencies, an embargo in place.  An embargo has been in place that not  only embargoes the movement of goods  to Cuba but also punishes the American people by saying: You can’t travel  to Cuba. That is what Senator ENZIand  I and 37 other Senators wish to say is  inappropriate,  and we want  to  lift  those travel restrictions.  I understand the Castro government  has  restricted  the  freedoms  of  the  Cuban people. I understand this country has no use for the Castro government. I have no use for the Castro government. I want the Cuban people to be  free. I think the most likely approach  to freedom for the Cuban people is to  allow them to hear other voices, other  than  just  the  Castro  government.  Opening up Cuba to travel by Americans, it seems to me, will provide those  other voices.  Mr. President, this chart shows we  have under the current U.S. policy,  criminal penalties for violating sanctions of travel to Cuba: 10 years in prison, $1 million in corporate fines, and  $250,000 for individuals.  Well, let me show a few people who  have run afoul of the law against traveling to Cuba. This is Joni Scott. Joni  Scott went to Cuba. She went to Cuba  with a church group to distribute free  bibles in the rural areas—free bibles,  distributing free bibles to Cuba. She  got back to our country and, guess  what. Our country sent her a letter because she was honest and said she had  been in Cuba distributing bibles. She  got a letter saying: We are fining you  $10,000.  So we  fine  an American  citizen  $10,000 for going to Cuba to distribute  free bibles? That is unbelievable.  But it is not just Joni Scott. Here is  another Joan. This  is Joan Slote. I  have met both these women, by the  way. Joan Slote was in her mid seventies when she went to Cuba. She was a  Senior Olympian. She  is a bicyclist,  and she joined a Canadian cycle group  to go ride a bicycle in Cuba. She came  back and found out that her government was going to levy a $10,000 fine.  Then, by the way, they decided to try  to attach her Social Security payments  because  she  hadn’t  responded. She  hadn’t responded because she had gone  to her son’s side, who was suffering  from brain cancer, and she didn’t get  the mail. So this woman, for cycling in  Cuba, was told she should pay her government $10,000 in fines.  This is Sergeant Lazo—SGT Carlos  Lazo. We actually had a vote about  Carlos Lazo on the floor of the Senate  on an amendment I offered one day. He  fled from Cuba on a raft, joined the  U.S. Army and went to Iraq to fight for  our country. He won a Bronze Star  Medal fighting for America in Iraq. He  ENZI came back to this country and discovered one of his children—he has young  children who, by the way, were still  living in Cuba—one of his children was  sick. Sergeant Lazo wanted to go to  Cuba to visit his sick child. Having  won a Bronze Star Medal on the battlefield in Iraq, he was told by his government: You have no right to see your  sick child in Cuba. Unbelievable.  So that is what we have, this restriction on travel to Cuba. Senator ENZI  and I believe it is past the time, long  past the time to eliminate it; to stop  punishing the American people by restricting their right to travel.  The last chart I have is a photograph  of an airplane that flies around distributing television signals into the country of Cuba. We have spent $1⁄4billion  in our country sending television signals that the Cuban people can’t receive  because  they  are  routinely  blocked by the Cuban Government. We  send television signals to the Cuban  people to tell them how wonderful freedom is, when they know that by listening to Miami radio stations. We have  spent $1⁄4billion doing it, and I have  tried  to  eliminate  that  expenditure  time and time again and have been unsuccessful.  Talk about government waste. Government waste even has cosponsorship  in the United States on this issue.  The point  is very simple. Senator  and I, and many other Republicans and Democrats in the Senate,  believe we ought to stop punishing the  American people for the actions of the  Cuban government.  Many years ago, we also had a complete embargo on all shipments and  goods to Cuba, which  included  food,  which I felt was immoral. So I and  then-Senator Ashcroft sponsored a resolution that passed the Congress and  became law that opened up just a bit in  the embargo to say: You can sell food  into the Cuban marketplace and ship  medicine into the Cuban marketplace.  You can do that, but it has to be paid  for in cash, and you can’t run the cash  through an American bank. So running  these transactions through European  banks for cash, our farmers now have  sold a substantial amount of commodities in the Cuban marketplace, just as  the Canadian  farmers  have  always  done, and just as the European farmers  have always done.  So just that little bit of change in  the embargo, opening up opportunities  to  sell  food and medicine  into  the  Cuban marketplace, was a significant  step. But I think this embargo has been  an unbelievable  failure,  through  10  Presidencies, and I think it is time for  us to decide the best way to promote  freedom in Cuba—and I think 39 of us  believe this in the Senate, having cosponsored the  legislation, and many  more would vote for it—is to stop punishing the American people, to stop restricting travel.  The Castro government will have a  very difficult time if an onslaught of  Americans go to travel in Cuba, and  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:04 Mar 19, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G18MR6.044 S18MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S B 2 K S D n o l n o o c d         ",2010

650,102,2010-03-18,Mr. LEMIEUX.," Madam President, I  have come to the floor to again talk  about the health care bill that is being  worked on over in the House that will  potentially be voted on—we are hearing this weekend—and to talk about  the myths around this bill, what  is  being told to the American people and  what the facts are, so the American  people can know what this Congress is  trying to get them into. In this past  week, I came to the floor and spoke  about 10 myths about this health care  bill. I do not wish to go through in detail all those myths today, but we have  some new information about a couple  of them that I wished to focus on and  go over the list of those myths.  Myth 1 was: You get to keep your  health insurance if you like what you  have. The President has been saying  this all around the country. We know  that is not true because, according to  the Congressional Budget Office, between 9 and 17 million people are going  to  lose their health  insurance  from  their employer when their employer is  going to drop that insurance and make  their employees go into the new public  system. So you are not going to get to  keep it.  We know folks on Medicare Advantage are not necessarily going to get to  keep their Medicare Advantage because  we are going to cut Medicare Advantage by $120 billion. To the more than  1 million people in Florida who have  Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part C,  which offers them wellness benefits,  hearing  benefits,  eyesight  benefits,  programs they like, we know over time  they are not going to get to keep that  in the way they have it now.  We also know health insurance premiums are not going to go down. That  is myth No. 2. The very reason why  this country wanted health care reform, the No.1 reason: to lower the cost  of health insurance. We know health  insurance has gone up more than 130  percent in the last 10 years. Yet this  bill does little or nothing to lower the  cost of health insurance for the 159 million Americans who have health insurance.  Some may see their rates go down 3  percent—that is the best it gets—while  those in the individual market may see  their rates go up 10 to 12 percent in the  next 10 years. We are supposed to be  about the business of health care reform, and we are not going to lower the  cost of health insurance.  We talked about whether this would  just lower the overall cost of health  care itself. That was the third myth we  discussed. But we know that Federal  outlays for health care are going to increase by more than $200 billion in the  next 10 years.  This idea that this health care plan  is going to reduce the deficit, that is  just funny math. We know this bill has  6 years of spending, 6 years of benefits,  if you will, and 10 years of taxes. Only  in Washington could someone try to  say you were going to spend $1 trillion  and save $100 billion.  We know it does not even take into  account the fact that we have to give  doctors more money in the Medicare  system. The Democrats put that in a  separate bill, so we do not score that  $300 billion cost because, if you did,  there would be no deficit reduction. We  also know emergency rooms are not  going to be less burdened. If we look at  the example of Massachusetts that instituted health care reform, they are  seeing just as many people crowd their  emergency  rooms because  the  folks  there tell them it is more convenient  than to wait in line to see their doctor.  See, when you push more people into  the system and do not provide adequate funding for more health care providers, you do not change and make  the system more user friendly, so the  folks still show up at the emergency  room.  Another myth we busted is that this  plan takes on the insurance companies,  when, in fact, it is going to put millions of more people into an insurance  program. That  is why the  insurance  companies like it.  We also busted the myth that this  health care reform is going to improve  the doctor-patient relationship. It  is  not. There is still going to be a third-  party payer. We still  fundamentally  miss the opportunity of getting you,  the patient, back involved in the consumer decision.  If we would have taken a page from  what we proposed on our side of the  aisle and given you a tax credit to let  you go in the market and buy insurance yourself, we know  that would  have driven costs down because you  would have been a consumer.  Right now, my wife and I are about  to have our fourth child any day now.  I remember getting those bills  from  the hospital on our previous boys when  they were born. Similar to most folks,  you do not read it, you just look at the  bottom and see what you owe. You do  not look at all the line-by-line items.  You would have to hire someone to  help make sense of all that. We have to  put consumers back in the health care  game. We have to know what we are  buying and what we are paying for because we know as consumers we will  make a good decision.  We do it in the car insurance market  and guess what.

651,130,2010-03-18,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, as we  prepare to reauthorize the Child Nutrition Act, it is critical that we address  the need  to  invest  in commonsense  ways to improve the health and well  being of our nation’s most precious resource—our children.  Childhood  obesity  threatens  the  healthy future of one-third of American children. Every year we spend $150  billion to treat obesity-related conditions, and that cost is growing. Obesity  rates tripled in the past 30 years, a  trend that means, for the first time in  our history, American children may  face a shorter expected lifespan than  their parents.  Right now, the U.S. Department of  Agriculture, USDA, spends more than  $10 billion a year on school meal programs, but only a small  fraction of  that funding goes to fruits and vegetables.  A recent report by the Institute of  Medicine entitled School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children, found  that increasing the amount and variety  of vegetables and fruits in schools is  one of the best ways to make school  meals healthier, and recommends that  schools increase their offering of fruits  and  vegetables  to  help  keep  kids  healthy.  That is why I am introducing the  Healthy Food in Schools Act, which  would improve school nutrition by providing more fresh fruits and vegetables  in school breakfasts and lunches starting in elementary school, when children  are  developing healthy  eating  habits.  A recent study was conducted by Dr.  Wendy Slusser, director of UCLA’s Fit  for Health Program, and Harvinder  Sareen, Director of Clinical Programs  at WellPoint, a health benefits company that  found children’s consumption of fruit and vegetables increases  dramatically when produce  is made  available  in school meals. The data  also shows that increasing availability  of fruits and vegetables exposes children to new  foods, which can affect  their eating habits for a lifetime.  The Healthy Food in Schools Act instructs USDA to put in place a plan to  promote  the  use  of  salad  bars  in  schools and provide $10 million for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 to help schools  purchase salad bars and fruit and vegetable bars for their cafeterias.  The Healthy Food  in Schools Act  also includes $100 million for overall  cafeteria infrastructure improvements.  Many cafeterias around the country  are looking to move away from processed food and toward kitchens that  can cook healthier meals from scratch,  but they lack the funds to implement  such a plan.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed last year included  $100 million  in grants  for cafeteria  equipment, but the Department of Education received more than $650 million  in requests for infrastructure improvements. This bill will help meet the  needs of the many school districts that  want to improve the meals they serve  their students.  This bill also provides competitive  matching grants and technical assistance for schools to improve access to  local foods. The bill directs $10 million  a year for 5 years toward these farm-  to-school programs.  Farm-to-school programs are a proven, commonsense way to help improve  the health of children while supporting  local  farmers  and  bolstering  local  economies. While many schools would  like to incorporate fresh local food into  their meals,  schools often  lack  the  startup funding and technical expertise  to overcome barriers to making this  change. These  limited  federal grants  will give school districts and small-  and medium-sized farms the help they  need  to develop new  farm-to-school  programs.  With more than 31 million children  participating  in the National School  Lunch Program and more than 11 million  participating  in  the National  School Breakfast Program, good nutrition at school is more important than  ever. That is why I urge my colleagues  to join me in support of including this  commonsense bill in the upcoming reauthorization of the Child Nutrition  Act.  The Healthy Food in Schools Act will  help ensure that our nation’s children  are not just eating, but also learning to  eat healthy. The rise in the rates of  children who are overweight or obese  are a result of poor diets, a lack of  physical activity, and insufficient nutrition education. A healthy school environment can help correct these problems and put our Nation’s youth and  our Nation on the path to a healthier  and more sustainable future.  f  SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS  SENATE  RESOLUTION  461—EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE  SENATE  THAT  CONGRESS  SHOULD REJECT ANY PROPOSAL  FOR THE CREATION OF A SYSTEM OF GLOBAL TAXATION AND  REGULATION  Mr. VITTER submitted the following  resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Finance:  in  S.

I thank the Senator from  Michigan for her leadership in this crucial area.  I listened to the news this morning  on the radio while driving in. The new  figures are out for growth rate. We are  growing now at about—last quarter  was about 5 percent. That is a turnaround from a negative 6 percent 1 year  ago. Also, in unemployment, about 1  year ago we were losing jobs at 750,000  each month.  It came down to only  35,000 jobs we were losing a month in  the last 3 months. Every expectation is  that when we end March, we will actually be in the positive once again. It  shows  that President Obama’s  economic policies and programs and what  we did in the Recovery Act are working.  This is encouraging news. However,  there are still almost 15 million hard-  working people who lost their jobs and  still struggling to find work. For these  people, the recession is still a reality  and recovery seems far out of reach.  There have been 6.1 million people  out of work for more than half a year.  That is the highest number of long-  term unemployed we have had since we  started keeping track in 1948. The families of these  long-term unemployed  are hanging by a thread. Their savings  are exhausted. The unemployment benefits they get are the lifeline that helps  them pay the rent, put food on the  table, and keep their kids in school.  Yet in the face of this unprecedented  crisis and long-term unemployment, a  short-term extension of unemployment  insurance  is being needlessly, needlessly—I would say cruelly—obstructed  in the Senate. In a real case of deja vu,  a few members of the minority party  are yet again stonewalling a piece of  legislation that I think most people in  this room and most of the people in  this country would agree is vitally important.  Indeed, we know for a fact there is  broad support for extending benefits in  the Senate because we already passed a  longer extension earlier this year. That  is what  is most  illogical about this  whole situation. We have already said  we want to continue the Federal extended benefits program through the  end of this year. We are now just waiting for the House to act. But now we  cannot pass a 30-day extension to give  the House the time they need to catch  up. That does not make sense. We have  already passed it for the year. We just  need to fill in a small gap for 1 month.  Those on the minority side are saying  no.  As a result of this political gamesmanship, more than 37,000 unemployed  Americans will be abruptly cut off  from Federal unemployment benefits.  They will lose their subsidized COBRA  health insurance coverage during the  first week of April. In my own State of  Iowa, about 1,200 workers struggling  with joblessness will see their safety  net drop out from underneath them.  Blocking this bill may be a political  game for some in the minority party,  but it is not a game for millions of  Americans who, in a matter of days,  will lose their lifeline. For them, the  obstruction of this bill, by just a few in  this Chamber, is a personal and family  crisis of the first magnitude.  It is interesting, we are going to be  leaving here today. I guess this will be  the last day before the Easter recess.  We are out for 2 weeks. Senators will  be going back to their States, probably  traveling and doing different activities  with their families. They will probably  be having nice Easter dinners with all  their  families. Guess what. Not one  Member of this Senate or the House  will lose their pay or benefits during  this period of time. How about all the  people out there right now who are facing an April 5 cutoff of their unemployment benefits, a cutoff of their COBRA  health benefits? These are not people  who have a big bank vault with a lot of  money on which they can draw. These  are people hanging by a thread. They  have been out of work at least for over  half a year. It almost borders on the  unconscionable  that we would  leave  and not pass this bill.  I know those on the other side say we  have to pay for it. I am all for paying  for things, but I daresay, if a tornado  wiped out a town in Oklahoma or we  had a flood, as some are having in the  Midwest, that wiped out a community  and we needed to rush money in and  rush items in to help people, would we  stand here and say: Oh, no, we can’t  call that an emergency; that is not an  emergency; somehow we have to come  up with the pay-fors right away. No, it  would be an emergency. We would rush  in to help.  For the thousands of Americans who  are going to lose their unemployment  on April 5, it is an emergency. It is as  if a tornado hit their home or a flood  wiped out their community. It is an  emergency, and we respond to emergencies with emergency spending—that  is all we are saying—for 30 days, short  term. This is an emergency. Yet it is  being obstructed by the minority, by  the Republicans. Let’s say it for what  it is. The Republicans are stopping this  legislation. It is simply inexplicable.  There is no reason to put millions of  families through the stress and uncertainty of wondering whether their benefits are disappearing. There is no reason to put States through the trouble  and administrative expense that comes  with a lapse in the program. That is  even going to cost more money.  The  flood  insurance program also  needs to be extended or many people  purchasing a home will not be able to  close on their homes, causing major  economic problems for them and the  home seller.  Extending benefits  is good  for the  families, workers, the States, and our  economy. Economists calculate  that  every $1 invested in the unemployment  insurance safety net generates $1.90 in  economic activity. Unemployed households spend these dollars on immediate  needs—to pay the rent or medical bill,  buy groceries and school supplies, or  repair the family car—all economic activities that quickly inject dollars into  our communities.  I call on my colleagues to stop their  obstruction and do the right thing. Do  the right thing. Just think about those  people out there who are going to lose  these benefits on April 5. I know some  people say we will come back on the  12th and maybe by the 15th of the  month we will be able to take care of it  and we will go retroactive and fill that  in. These are not people who can just  go down to the bank and have a line of  credit. These are people who probably  in desperation—in desperation—will go  down to some  loan shark, get some  kind of payday loan, something like  that, and pay 20 percent interest on it  for a couple weeks because they are  that desperate.  I think it is unconscionable that we  would hold this up because a few say  we have to pay for it. We will pay for  it. They say we cannot put this off on  our children and our grandchildren. I  agree, we have to be careful. We have  to start getting out of the hole we are  in. We are  in a hole economically.  Don’t put it all on the backs of the few  who have been out of work for so long  facing getting their money cut off on  April 5. Let’s have a little heart. Let’s  have a little compassion. Let’s have a  little understanding of what these people are going through every day  in  their lives, the stress they have. Let’s  do the right thing and extend unemployment benefits for 1 month.

658,9,2010-03-26,Mr. REED.," Mr. President, I thank  Senator STABENOW.  We are here to attempt to extend unemployment benefits for a brief period  of time so Americans do not get caught  up in the expiration of these benefits  on April 5. This has been a repeated  struggle. We have had many incidents  over the last several months where we  have had to come down here and, at the  last moment, attempt to project these  benefits further. I hope we do not fail  again today.  In  2009,  when  President  Obama  walked  into  office, we were  losing  700,000 jobs per month. This is a crisis  of epic proportions, rivaling, in some  respect, in some regions of the country,  the Great Depression.  In my home  State of Rhode Island, we have a 12.7-  percent unemployment rate, and it has  been persistent now for almost 2 years.  We are seeing an unfortunate record of  long-term unemployment. We have to  help our colleagues, our neighbors, our  friends, and we have to do it in a way  that does not deny them the basic necessities to hang on in a difficult economy.  But this situation is not just as a result of the last several months or the  last several years. If you  look back  across the past decade—from 2000 to  2010—it has been an extraordinarily unproductive one for working Americans.  There has been zero net job creation  since December 1999. We have had no  decade since the 1940s where job growth  was less than 20 percent. This is the  culmination of a decade in which people could not find the kind of work  they typically found in America. We  saw middle-income households’ earning  power decline. They were making less  in 2008 than they were in 1999. Two-  thirds of  the Nation’s  total  income  from 2002 to 2007 flowed to the top 1  percent.  So middle-income families have been  losing out persistently, and now they  have hit the skids because so many of  them now are seeing their jobs go, seeing their house threatened with foreclosure, seeing the dream of sending  their children to college evaporate. At  least the minimum we can do is provide the kind of assistance they need.  We routinely, when there is a natural  disaster, provide assistance. In the last  20 years, an estimated $336 billion in  disaster assistance and $61.8 billion in  agricultural assistance has flowed to  the States. This is a disaster in the  same respect. It is a disaster to individual families who have lost their employment.  The  irony here  is,  if a  flood had  washed through a State in the Union  and destroyed the work of 12 percent of  the population, we would be here with  disaster relief to get the funds to give  loans, to give support, et cetera. Well,  this is a disaster. We must move.

659,16,2010-03-26,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, when I  have come to the floor over the last  few months,  I have always tried to  focus on ways  to bring parties  together, both sides to work for common  solutions—whether it’s health care, the  new tax reform bill Senator GREGGand  I have introduced, or the Build America Bonds program put  together by  Senator THUNEand I, which has clearly  been a huge success in terms of revolutionizing the system for funding transportation and infrastructure. Senator  CORNYNand I are working on a significant crime bill. So I am always going  to come to this floor and try to be bipartisan and bring both sides together.  On this question of helping folks who  are so desperately hurting today—including so many in my State, where we  have a very high unemployment rate—  I want to suggest a bipartisan path forward that I hope we can look at in the  days ahead. I see my friend from Georgia here, who also wants to work on  these major economic issues in a bipartisan way.  When you listened to colleagues last  night and this morning, it seems to me  there is agreement on two fundamental  principles. One is that it is absolutely  essential to help folks who are hurting  now. We have millions of Americans  walking on an economic tightrope; balancing their food bill against their fuel  bill; trying to pay for essentials; going  to bed every night, whether in Colorado, Oregon, or Georgia, figuring out  if they are going to be able to pay the  bills when they wake up in the morning. So there  is agreement on both  sides that you have to help folks who  are hurting now. There is also agreement that we have to deal with this  deficit, and the spending issue which is  contributing to the deficit for the long  term. So, in effect, we start the possibility of a bipartisan strategy around  agreement in two key areas: We have  to help folks now who are hurting, and  we have to deal with those major deficits, the revenue and spending problems, in the long term.  What there  is disagreement on,  it  seems to me, is the timing of these particular debates. I and others feel very  strongly that it is just not right to  compound the hurt Americans are suffering, even for a few weeks, even for a  few days. That is why we very much  want, before we go home, to have this  worked out and to get this unemployment benefits extension to them.  We also recognize that getting at this  long-term budget  issue quickly  is a  matter of national urgency. I sit on the  Budget Committee.

661,23,2010-03-26,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of  the millions of Americans who know  our Nation is desperately in need of  health care reform. Traveling across  Colorado  this past year, a common  theme surfaced as I spoke with families, health care providers, and businesses alike. They all want a health  care system that tackles costs,  improves quality, and puts their needs  first.  I have heard, as I know the Presiding  Officer has in his home State of Delaware, stories of Coloradans who paid a  lifetime of health care premiums  in  order to provide for their families, all  to have an  insurance company drop  their coverage because a wife or a husband or a child became ill.  Visiting with health care providers, I  heard about the waste and abuse in our  system. They have all pleaded with me  to have commonsense reforms that get  them  back  to  the  business  they  thought they were entering years ago—  the business of caring for their fellow  Americans beset by illness and disease.  I heard from small business owners  who continue to see double-digit  increases  in  insurance costs,  in many  cases for the ninth or the tenth or even  more years in a row. These small business owners want to see relief, not for  themselves but because they do not  want to have to choose between laying  off workers and leaving their workers  vulnerable to medical bankruptcies.  Decade after decade, we see how the  fine print of insurance company policies puts shareholder interests above  those of American  families and how  partisanship has prevented the kind of  progress  everyone  agrees  is  sorely  needed.  I have good news. Despite all the  ugly  rhetoric, distortions, and misrepresentations we have heard, Coloradans and the rest of the country can  finally rest assured that someone has  put their interests first.  This week, I watched as President  Obama signed into law the kind of reforms that will free Americans from  the shackles of never-ending cost increases, dropped coverage, and unfair  practices that put profits above the  provision of care.  Throughout this past fall and winter,  I joined you, Mr. President, and the  rest of our freshman class in the Chamber repeatedly to talk about the urgent  need for health care reform. We shot  down  false  claims,  challenged  the  phony reasoning that was out there,  and pointed out where  the  rhetoric  ends and reality begins.  Over the past few days, many more of  our colleagues from this side of the  aisle have compellingly and eloquently  explained  how  important  the  new  health reform law is to both the American people and the American economy. The fact is that this historic bill  signed by the President saves  lives,  saves money, and it saves Medicare.  Bringing this long debate to a close,  I wish to speak directly to the people  of Colorado. It is important that they  know how these health insurance reforms will benefit their families and  the rest of our great State.  As a result of the President signing  the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act into law, the parents of Colorado’s 1.2 million children can sleep  easy starting this year knowing that  insurance companies no  longer have  the right to deny their kids health care  coverage because of a preexisting condition.  Also starting in 2010, almost half a  million, 500,000 young adults in Colorado who would otherwise be kicked off  their parents’ health care policies can  maintain  that  coverage  through  to  their 27th birthday. This  is particularly welcome to me, as I know it is for  many Coloradans, because I have two  college-age kids who fit into the category I just described.  We have 575,000 seniors in our Medicare Program, and for every single one  of them, this new law will protect—I  want to emphasize that—will protect  their guaranteed benefits and  immediately allow them to get preventive  care with absolutely no copay or out-  of-pocket  costs. This added benefit,  contrary to what we have heard, will  increase  their health  care  coverage  under the Medicare Program so that  our seniors can continue to live happy  and healthy lives.  This new law goes to great lengths to  help slow the growth of health care  costs and, by doing so, it is projected  that these lower costs will allow Colorado’s employers to hire up to 6,500 new  employees  in our State. And  for as  many as 68,000 small businesses, health  reform will begin providing millions of  dollars in tax credits so they can afford  to offer health insurance to their employees.  Yesterday, we sat here and cast 56  votes as Democrats to make final improvements to the Patient Protection  and Affordable Care Act. That  reconciliation measure we passed yesterday will provide prescription drug relief as well for our Colorado seniors.  More  than  100,000 Colorado  seniors,  such as my friend Frank Blakely in  Colorado Springs, will pay less for prescription drugs.  Right now, these seniors hit what we  all know here as the Medicare part D  doughnut hole, which means they have  to pay thousands of dollars directly out  of pocket for their medicines. But beginning this year, every one of these  seniors will receive a $250 check to help  them offset those costs, and we will  begin to close the overall gap in Medicare coverage so that we completely  fill this doughnut hole by the year 2020.  I know this will be welcome relief to  those on fixed incomes all across the  United States, because it will free up  scarce retirement dollars to visit family members, help pay a grandchild’s  college tuition or even to help, in some  cases, put food on the table.  I think one of the overriding features  of health reform is the freedom it will  give to Coloradans and hard-working  Americans—the  freedom  to  change  jobs, to launch a business, to even start  a  family while knowing that health  care coverage will be there for them  when they need it. Americans need to  know their country won’t leave them  to fend for themselves when an insurance company denies or drops their  coverage. They deserve peace of mind  to know that someone is on their side.  Over the last few days we have heard  a lot of the same misleading rhetoric  that we did back in August by those  who were dead set on levying accusations rather than working on real reform. Well, health reform has become  the law of the land and the American  people don’t have to wait any longer  for these important reforms. The legislation we passed will establish a sturdy  foundation upon which we will build,  improve,  and  strengthen  access  to  health care in America. Will there be  mistakes made along the way? I don’t  doubt it.

666,11,2010-04-12,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, it has  been 2 weeks since we last spoke on the  floor on this issue. There has been a lot  written in the press and a lot of things  that have been said. I will reiterate  what I said earlier in that debate before we took an inappropriate spring  break, and that is the fact that everybody thinks those who are unemployed  and are eligible should be getting unemployment checks. That is not a partisan issue. It is a fact we want to support those who need our help right  now.  The real question, however, is what  will we do to make sure that effort is  an effort that has some real meaning  behind it and that these are not hollow  words. The debate around here becomes  partisan and labels get applied, and I  admit that I am partisan—but not from  a party standpoint; I am partisan for  our children.  The question isn’t whether we should  make sure that unemployment benefits  are there. The question isn’t whether  people can get health insurance under  COBRA. The question isn’t whether we  ought to do the right thing for those  who are depending on us. The question  is, where do we get the money?  It is simple. We have two options.  One option says: Time out; this is so  important that it doesn’t matter where  we get the money; we have to supply it.  The other option is—and by the way,  the first option belies the fact that we  have any waste in the Federal Government. I don’t think we can do a poll  that would come so close to unanimity  as a poll on which we would ask the  American people whether the Federal  Government is efficient and effective. I  doubt that we would get anybody on  the ‘‘yes’’ ledger side on that.  The real question, then, becomes do  we have the goodwill and the presence  of mind to do this in a way that doesn’t  jeopardize our children? You see, we  are not just fighting about unemployment benefits. We are not debating the  issue of unemployment benefits. We  are debating the issue of whether we  take from those who come after us and  give to those today.  Many times I have used this poster of  this young lady. Her name is Madeline.  Madeline was caught  in DC wearing  this poster. I have gone over the numbers. When she wore the poster, her  debt was $38,375. Her debt today, without us extending this bill after  last  year, is over $45,000. So the question is  competing priorities. We have the priority of making  sure  that we help  those who need our help in a time of  economic decline. And then we have  the priority of making sure we have  not mortgaged the opportunity of freedom for children such as Madeline.  Who will  fight  for the Madelines?  Who will  stand up  for  our  grandchildren and say we can find $9.2 billion  out of an almost $4 trillion budget and  pay for it and not charge it to the  Madelines of this world? That is what  we are doing when we declare something an emergency.  I would also make the point that we  passed a 9-month extension for many of  these programs.  It was paid  for.  In  other words, we didn’t add to the debt  when we passed a bill that would extend this for 9 months. The Senate did  its work. That bill hasn’t come back  because the House is unlikely to pass it  with the pay-fors in it and, frankly,  several were used to pay for the health  care bill that passed.  Who will protect the Madelines of the  world? Since the beginning of this year  and the  famed passage of a statute  called pay-go, which says we will no  longer create new  spending without  cutting the spending somewhere else,  we have spent $120 billion of Madeline’s  future, and every Madeline who is out  there—every 3-year-old and 4-year-old  who is out there. We have done it by  waiving the new statute that says you  have to pay as you go. Congress—and  the Senate specifically—increased our  budget 5.6 percent this year. In a year  where true costs were down we  increased our own budget. Yet, we refuse  to look at the hard choices that are  necessary for us to make a future for  the Madelines of this world.  What happens if we continue this?  What happens if we continue to say we  will borrow from the future instead of  making the tough choices now? I will  tell you what happens. Madeline’s future—her opportunity for prosperity—  is mortgaged. We tend to think in the  short run, and the vision our Founders  had was thinking in the long term.  So where do we find $9.2 billion? If I  get an opportunity, I will offer  five  amendments that will pay for that. I  wager that nary a person would ever  miss the money. We could find $9.2 billion in the Defense Department. They  have at least $50 billion worth of waste.  But, no, we won’t go there. We have  $700 billion in unobligated balances of  which well over 20 percent has been sitting there for 2 years. That is $140 billion. We can pay for this for a year, but  we won’t go there. We have ineffective  spending  in  the  stimulus  bill  that  hasn’t been rolled out yet that I will  put forward as a greater priority than  the money intended left in the stimulus bill is for. But we are not going to  go there. What we are going to do—and  we will pass a motion to proceed today  to this bill. But what we are going to  do is take the easy, the soft road of not  paid  for. We cannot continue to do  that.  Last year—and we will continue this  year—out of every dollar the Federal  Government spent we borrowed 43 percent. So 43 cents out of every dollar the  Federal Government spent last year we  borrowed. We ended up with a real deficit of close to $1.6 trillion by the time  you get out of the accounting gimmicks that Washington uses. That is  what we added to the Madelines of the  world. We are going to do that this  year again.  The February deficit was the highest  on record ever for the Federal Government. So we are going to have an excessive $1.4 billion or $1.5 billion or  probably a  $1.6  trillion deficit  this  year, and we are going to add another  $9.2 billion with this bill.  How is it fair? How is it right that in  this country we cannot do two right  things, we can only do one right and  one wrong thing? I posit that stealing  money from our kids’ future and mortgaging their future is morally wrong. I  posit that helping people who need our  help on unemployment benefits is morally right. Why can we not do both? We  ought to be able to do both.  I sent a letter to the minority and  majority  leaders when the bill  first  came up. I will read it because I think  it  is  important  to  understand  the  thinking on why we should pay  for  this—realizing  that we passed a  9-  month extension that was paid for, and  because the House hasn’t acted, we  don’t feel an obligation to protect the  Madelines of the world. The letter says  this:  I am writing to notify you that I would  like to be consulted on any unanimous consent agreements regarding the consideration  of H.R. 4851, the Continuing Extension Act of  2010, which would extend the number of federal programs for one month.  No one is arguing that Americans who are  currently unemployed should not have their  unemployment  insurance  payments  extended. But once again, Congress is refusing  to find a way to offset the $9.15 billion cost  of the bill with cuts to less important federal  spending.  Time  and  time  again, Congress  intentionally waits until the last minute to consider important legislation and then declares  the billions of dollars in foreseeable costs as  ‘‘emergency’’ spending in order to avoid having to find a way to pay for the bills’ price  tags.  In the last 6 months, Congress has passed  four major extension bills. H.R. 4851 would be  the fifth such bill. The total cost of these  bills is almost $30 billion. Additionally, over  the last year Congress has increased funding  totaling $64.9 billion for the Highway and  Unemployment Insurance Trust Funds without offsets.  This  shortsightedness  sticks  taxpayers  with billions of dollars in additional debt and  treats the unemployed, doctors and Medicare  patients, hard working men and women who  help make our roads and bridges safe, and  others relying on federal funds as pawns in  Congress’ borrowing and spending game.  When the previous last-minute one month  extension (H.R. 4692) was brought up days before the funding authority for numerous federal programs, including Unemployment Insurance and the Highway Trust Fund, which  expired at the end of February, 2010, a United  States Senator was attacked for objecting to  passing  the  bill without  any  debate  or  amendments because the bill was unpaid for  and added $10 billion to our nation’s debt.

667,18,2010-04-12,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I have  sought recognition to comment briefly  about the prospective vacancy in the  Supreme Court of the United States  with the resignation of Justice Stevens. I do so to urge the President to  select a nominee without regard to any  threats of a filibuster. I urge the President to make his selection of whomever he believes to be the best qualified  to handle the responsibilities with a  view to academic excellence, professional  experience,  and  intellect  to  carry on the battle, where we have seen  the Supreme Court veer very sharply  to the right.  Let’s be candid about the Supreme  Court  being  an  ideological  battleground today. That happens to be the  fact. When some decry judicial activism, what could be more judicial activism than reversing the 100-year precedent that corporations may not engage  in political advertising, as  the Supreme Court did in Citizens United, in  a  contortion  of  procedural  maneuverings to take a case with an  isolated issue with a predetermined obvious purpose of changing the law on  that very vital subject for the operation of our democracy?  We had Chief Justice Roberts, in the  confirmation proceedings, under oath,  swear he would not, quote, ‘‘jolt the  system.’’ Well, there have been quite a  number of jolts in the system with his  key vote. We had a very extensive  questioning  and  commentary  about  Chief Justice Roberts’  deference  to  congressional  fact-finding. Only Congress has hearings, hears witnesses,  and makes determinations of fact-finding. When the voting rights came up,  all of that seemed to have been forgotten.  We have a situation where it is obvious the Supreme Court makes the cutting-edge decisions on the law of the  land. The Supreme Court, it turns out,  decides who will be President in Bush  v. Gore—a decision strictly along political partisan lines.  The Supreme Court of the United  States decides what will be the  law  with respect to campaign finance reform, as we seek to make a determination as to how we can limit the expenditures in political campaigns—the very  core of the democratic process.  In Buckley v. Valeo, in 1976, the Supreme Court said that, under the First  Amendment, speech equals money. It  seemed to me at the time that was a  farfetched decision. Now, with Citizens  United, we find that corporations are  somehow persons, somehow entitled to  first amendment rights and can advertise in political campaigns.  The Supreme Court decides who will  live and who will die, decides what is  the extent of the death penalty. The  Supreme Court decides the extent of a  woman’s  right  to  choose—Casey  v.  Planned  Parenthood.  The  Supreme  Court decides about the power of the  State to take private property in eminent domain. And so the cases go on  and on and on.  I have sought, for more than a decade  now, to have the Supreme Court televised, and twice during my tenure as  chairman or ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee  the committee  reported out  favorably  legislation to  require the Supreme Court to be televised, unless there was some extraordinary circumstance  invoked by the  Court. More recently, in this Congress,  I have modified that effort with legislation which recommends that the Supreme Court televise its proceedings.  When Bush v. Gore came up, then-  Senator BIDEN and I wrote to Chief  Justice Rehnquist  urging  that  the  Court allow that monumental case to  be televised so the public could see it,  considering the very limited number of  people who could gain access.  When I went over to the Court that  day—being one of the few who could  gain access to the Court—the block  was surrounded with television cameras because of so much public interest. But the cameras could not go inside. That day the Supreme Court, with  the Chief Justice’s order, did change  practice and allowed an audio transcript  to  be  released  immediately  thereafter.  I believe Congress has the authority,  should it choose to do so, to direct the  Supreme Court  to  permit  its  proceedings to be televised. The Supreme  Court, in a series of cases, has said the  public has a right to know what  is  going on  inside the courtroom, and  that was the case which involved Richmond Newspapers. Well,  in an electronic era, where the public gets so  much of its information via television  or via radio, there ought to be that access.  But the Congress has the authority  to determine when the Court starts to  function each year: the first Monday in  October. Congress sets a quorum for  the Court: six. Congress can set the  number of Justices on the Court, as  evidenced by the effort by President  Franklin Roosevelt in the mid to late  1930s to increase the number of the Supreme Court to some 15.  Obviously, we cannot tell the Supreme Court what to decide, how to decide, but we can tell them about administrative matters. And  the Congress has the authority to tell the  Court which cases to take. So there is  a broad range of matters where the  Congress cannot act.  I modified the effort I had to have  the Supreme Court televised—instead  of  ‘‘requiring  it’’ to  ‘‘recommending  it’’—because in the final analysis the  Court can make a determination on  separation of powers if Congress imposes a requirement that can be overruled by the Court.  But if the public had access to what  was going on in the Supreme Court, it  seems to me there would be a clamor to  have more  openness, more  transparency, and greater public appreciation of the fact that the Supreme Court  is a battleground.  When  considerations  are  made  about—as the Sunday talk shows have  filled the airwaves  just yesterday—a  number of Senators from the other side  of the aisle left the filibuster on the  table, would not rule it out, the question of what is judge-made law. Well,  that is very much in the eye of the beholder as to what is judge-made law.  But I would urge the President not to  pay any heed to that. When we start to  engage in the subtleties of a nominee  who will be among the five instead of  the four, I suggest that is a stretch beyond making any determination. That  is, I believe—well, it was candidly said  trying to persuade Justice Kennedy to  be among five, as it is speculated with  some pretty solid foundation that Justice Stevens succeeded in persuading  Justice Kennedy to side on the issue of  habeas corpus.  We had Rasul v. Bush, where Justice  Stevens—in a very  learned opinion,  tracing the authority of detention from  the Magna Carta down through habeas  corpus—made a determination that habeas corpus was a constitutional right.  The case then came to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and  in a contorted opinion—at least contorted  in my  judgment—the Circuit  Court for the District of Columbia said  it was on statutory grounds and not  constitutional  grounds. But  reading  Rasul v. Bush, starting with the Magna  Carta and tracing the constitutional  evolution, it certainly, as a fair reading would say, was on constitutional  grounds.  Then Boumediene v. Bush came up,  and on the petition for cert, only three  Justices voted to hear the case, and  Justice Stevens was not among them.  Had Justice Stevens voted to hear the  case, there would have been four Justices to take up the case and it would  have been docketed and it would have  been heard. But Justice Stevens voted  not to hear the case. It was speculated  at that time widely that Justice Stevens felt if the Court took the case habeas corpus would be rejected.  We had the long fight on the floor of  this body, and I offered an amendment  to restore habeas corpus, which was defeated 51 to 48 on the military commissions act. I predicted at that time the  Supreme Court would eventually overrule the congressional determination  and reinstate habeas corpus as a constitutional right.  Then there came to light information  in  the military  commissions  about  some very questionable practices, and  there was a subsequent petition for reconsideration for a grant of cert. On a  petition for reconsideration on a grant  of cert, it takes five votes. Four votes  are insufficient. You have to have five  votes to have cert granted and cert was  granted. Justice Stevens and Justice  Kennedy joined the other three Justices in the petition for reconsideration  to grant cert.  In Boumediene v. Bush, the Supreme  Court said that habeas corpus, in fact,  was a right. Well, those are speculative  and those are subtleties. But my own  thinking on the subject is the President ought to appoint somebody who  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:38 Jul 08, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S12AP0.REC S12AP0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010
668,25,2010-04-12,Mr. BENNET.," Madam President, on  March 19, 2010, Colorado lost two great  public servants dedicated to protecting  Colorado’s water. Douglas L. Shriver,  53, and Raymond Brett Wright, 56, both  of Colorado’s San Luis Valley,  lost  their lives in an accident near Creede,  CO. These men were active leaders in  their communities and particularly engaged  in water-related  issues across  Colorado and in the San Luis Valley.  Water is a scarce and precious resource in Colorado. In working to protect Colorado’s water, Doug and Raymond also worked to protect public  health,  sustain  agriculture,  support  Colorado’s  economic  interests,  and  maintain the vast parks, wildlife, and  wilderness for which Colorado is world-  renowned. Our State  is  forever  indebted to Doug and Ray, for their hard  and generous work has been to the benefit of all who live in Colorado.  Doug served as chairman of the Rio  Grande Water Users Association and as  the vice chair for the Rio Grande Basin  Roundtable. He was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed golf, boating, fishing,  hunting, sporting clays, snow machining, and cross country skiing. Beyond  his leadership in protecting Colorado’s  water supply, he gave back to his community by tutoring  fourth and  fifth  graders at the Bill Metz Elementary  School. He  is  survived by his wife  Karla, his mother Zola, and siblings  Deanna, Larry, Kay, Randy, Jean, and  David.  Ray served as board president for the  Rio Grande Water Conservation District. He also had a strong passion for  the outdoors and enjoyed hunting, fishing, skiing, and building and flying his  own bamboo fly fishing rods. A keen intellect and sharp memory made Ray  stand out, and he will be remembered  by those who  love him as an affectionate man who lived life to its fullest. He is survived by his daughters  Susan,  Sara,  and  Lauren,  granddaughter Brynn, and  siblings Diana  and Greg.  Doug and Ray were well respected for  their hard work, intelligence, and congeniality. I join Coloradans in grieving  the loss of these public servants, and  my prayers go out to their families.  Colorado is a better place as a result of  these two men. The works of Doug  Shriver and Ray Wright will affect  Coloradans for generations to come.∑  f  REMEMBERING EDWARD EUGENE  CLAPLANHOO  ∑",2010
669,25,2010-04-12,Ms. CANTWELL.," Madam President,  today I wish to remember and pay tribute to a beloved and revered tribal  Claplanhoo,  leader, Edward Eugene  who died on March 14, 2010.  Mr. Claplanhoo served three terms as  chairman of  the Makah Tribe, and  many years on the Tribal Council, the  tribe’s Whaling Commission,  higher  education  and  election  boards. Mr.  Claplanhoo was  also  chair  of  the  United Indians of All Tribes Foundation Board for 5 years. He was known  for his ability to build consensus with  his calm and steady leadership.  Mr. Claplanhoo was chair of the tribe  in the 1970s when the Ozette archaeological  dig was  underway  in  the  Makah village of Ozette. He worked  with Dr. Richard Dougherty of Washington State University to ensure that  the artifacts from the site remained on  the reservation, and was instrumental  in the foundation of the Makah Cultural and Research Center, a museum  which now displays the heritage of the  community.  A  proud  graduate  of Washington  State University, Mr. Claplanhoo believed strongly in the power of education and encouraged young people to  seek advance degrees. He was also an  Army veteran and last year donated  land to establish a monument to veterans and to the Spanish influence at  Neah Bay.  Mr. Claplanhoo will always be remembered for his many contributions  to the Makah Tribe and all the tribes  of Washington State, as well as the  many others in the State whose lives  he touched. His legacy will be cherished for years to come.∑  f  50TH ANNIVERSARY OF NA¯  HAUMA¯NA O HAWAI’I  ∑",2010
670,25,2010-04-12,Mr. MERKLEY.," Madam President,  today I recognize the 50th anniversary  of Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i and its annual lu’au. The Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i  is a culture club at Pacific University  in Forest Grove, OR. For half a century, Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i has been  spreading the culture and traditions of  Hawaii to Pacific University, enriching  the  school and  surrounding communities.  Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i was founded  in 1959 by 16 students from the islands  of Hawaii. Since then, it has expanded  its membership to more than 200 students and includes Native Hawaiians as  well as those  interested  in  learning  more about Hawaiian culture. One of  the ways that Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i  shares the Hawaiian culture with the  local community is through its annual  lu’au. It is the only completely student-run and student-directed lu’au in  the Northwest. Each year, about 2,000  people attend the lu’au and celebrate  the Island heritage, which includes an  authentic lu’au meal and traditional  Polynesian dance, music and entertainment.  Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i has made a  tremendous impact on Pacific University, Oregon, and our Nation. By bringing to the mainland a taste of Hawaii’s  cultural  tapestry,  Oregonians  and  Americans have been able to enjoy the  State’s rich Aloha spirit. I know that  all Oregonians will  join me  in congratulating Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i on  the occasion of  its 50th anniversary  and annual lu’au.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  and withdrawals which were referred to  the appropriate committees.

President Kaczynski was a steadfast supporter of advancing  freedom  and prosperity in Poland and throughout Central and Eastern Europe and  was a close friend of the United States.  It is with tragic irony that this devastation has occurred at a time of solemn  remembrance of the massacre of Polish  officers and civilians in the Katyn Forest and elsewhere 70 years ago. Together with  the Polish nation  and  friends of Poland worldwide, I mourn  this  unbelievably  tragic  loss. With  these sentiments in mind, I am introducing  this  resolution honoring  the  lives  of President  of Poland Lech  Kaczynski, his wife, and 94 others who  perished on April 10, 2010 in a plane  crash while en route to memorialize  those Polish officers, officials, and civilians who were massacred by the Soviet Union 70 years ago.  f  SENATE  RESOLUTION  477—HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS  CE´SAR  AND  LEGACY  OF  ESTRADA CHA´VEZ  Mr. MENENDEZ  (for himself, Mr.  REID, Ms. STABENOW, Mr. DURBIN, Mrs.  BOXER, Mr. UDALL of Colorado, Mr.  SCHUMER, Mrs. GILLIBRAND, Mr. BINGAMAN, Mr. BROWNof Ohio, Mr. UDALLof  New Mexico, and Mr. WYDEN)  submitted the following resolution; which  was referred to the Committee on the  Judiciary:  S.

673,4,2010-04-20,Mr. COHEN.," Madam Speaker, today  America mourns the loss of Dr. Dorothy Height, a civil rights pioneer, Presidential adviser, and woman’s rights  activist. For many years, this Freedom  Fighter served as president of the National Council of Negro Women, the  Young Women’s Christian Association,  and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated.  Dr. Height was the backbone of the  civil  rights movement  and worked  alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,  Whitney Young, A. Phillip Randolph,  Roy Wilkins, and our own JOHNLEWIS.  During the March on Washington, she  was the only African American woman  on the speaker’s platform during Dr.  King’s historic  ‘‘I Have  a Dream’’  speech.  In 1994, President Clinton awarded  Dr. Height the Presidential Medal of  Freedom for her selfless service to others. In 1995, in my hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, she received the National Civil Rights Museum’s Freedom  Award.  In 2004, President Bush presented her with the Congressional Gold  Medal. During Dr. Height’s  lifetime,  the freedom gates were half ajar, yet  she fought to open them full and wide  for everybody.  Our Nation mourns the loss of a great  woman, a great African American leader, a great civil rights leader. Hers was  a life well lived.

674,4,2010-04-20,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, this  week is Victims’ Rights Week. Today I  honor the life of Houston Police Officer  Timothy Abernethy.  For Officer Abernethy, fighting crime  was more than an occupation, it was  his personal calling. He bravely dedicated his life to keeping the peace on  the streets of Houston, Texas, until he  was murdered on December 7, 2008, by a  cowardly killer. The murder was cruel  and it was calculated. After shooting  Officer Abernethy once in the neck, the  assassin calmly walked up and put the  gun close to the back of the officer’s  head and fired again.  Recently, a  jury  in Houston convicted Mabry Landor, III, of capital  murder of a police officer. This week  the Texas jury sentenced the outlaw to  death.  Officer Timothy Abernethy  served  the people of Houston for 11 years. He  was married  to Stephanie, and had  children. He, like so many before him,  put his life between the people and the  lawless.  We as a Nation need to remember  peace officers sometimes become victims of crime while taking care of the  rest of us.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  HONORING ROY ISOM  (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2010
675,4,2010-04-20,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the life and the career of Roy  Isom, a broadcasting legend in the San  Joaquin Valley from California. Known  as the Voice of Agriculture for over 40  years, Roy was a force in the broadcasting industry, relentless in reporting on issues that mattered the most  to our communities.  Roy began his career at KFSN channel 30 and KYNO radio before moving  to KMJ radio, where he spent the last  28 years. He was known as a workhorse,  and his colleagues fondly remembered  how he would begin his days at 1 a.m.,  getting  ready  for  the  farm  report.  Roy’s hard work translated into stories  and reports that were critical to making sense of what was going on in our  valley and the Nation.  Whether  it was reporting the  first  lunar landing or breaking down the agriculture news of  the  region, Roy’s  style and ethics serve as a role model  to our younger generation of reporters  and  broadcasters  because  he  was.  Today, Roy is remembered by his family and friends and colleagues. Everyone who new Roy,  including myself,  had a tremendous respect with him. I  join with all the people of our valley in  celebrating Roy’s  life and contributions to broadcasting.

Hooks  was more than just an accomplished man; he  was a modern-day pioneer who overcame  modern-day struggles. No matter the obstacle,  Rev. Hooks continued to fight for equal rights,  always believing that tomorrow will be better.  In  fact, Rev. Hooks was often quoted as  saying,  ‘‘you have  to believe  that  tomorrow  somehow can be, and will be, better  than  today.’’ His mission in life was to make this  belief a reality. As the first African-American  commissioner of the Federal Communications  Commission, a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Tennessee’s first  African-American criminal court judge, and, finally, as the Executive Director of the National  Association  for  the Advancement of Colored  People  (NAACP)  from 1977  to 1992, Rev.  Hooks worked  tirelessly  to make America a  fairer, and more just, nation.  Under his  leadership of  the NAACP, he  brought  this storied civil  rights organization  from  the brink of  financial  collapse. Rev.  Hooks returned it to stability, increased membership, and created programs such as  the  NAACP ACT-SO (Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics) competitions,  a major youth  talent and skill  initiative, and  Women in the NAACP.  Rev. Hooks also was a stalwart in the face  of adversity. In 1989, there were several gasoline bomb attacks in the South, resulting in the  murder of a federal judge in Alabama and an  African-American civil rights lawyer in Georgia.  NAACP leaders were threatened with violence  as well. Rev. Hooks responded to these acts  of violence by saying,  ‘‘We believe  that  this  latest incident is an effort to intimidate our association, to strike fear in our hearts. It will not  succeed.’’  This  remarkable American  lived a  life of  honor and purpose, leaving behind a legacy of  equality and  justice. Our nation  is so much  better for his dedication to the idea that ‘‘all  men are created equal.’’ Rev. Hooks is an inspirational figure to us all, and we must continue  to strive  to ensure  that  tomorrow will  continue to be better than today.  ",2010
678,18,2010-04-20,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.,"  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 1271 to honor the life and achievements  of Dr. Benjamin Lawson Hooks who passed  away on April 15, 2010. Dr. Hooks served as  the Executive Director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,  and wads a great civil rights leader.  Born in Memphis, Tennessee as the fifth of  seven children, Dr. Hooks faced numerous racial barriers growing up  in  the segregated  South. He graduated from Howard University  in 1944, and after serving in the army during  World War II, he completed a law degree from  DePaul University in 1948. Upon graduation,  he returned to Memphis where he opened his  own law practice. Although faced with relentless discrimination in the legal field, Dr. Hooks  managed to make a reputation for himself. In  1965 he was appointed to fill a vacancy in the  Shelby County criminal court making him the  first black criminal court judge in Tennessee  history. Later, in 1972, he became the first African-American member of the Federal Communications Commission where he developed  a reputation as a champion for minority owned  television and radio stations.  In 1976, Dr. Hooks became the Executive  Director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples. His  tenure  saw an increase in membership and revenue,  and additionally, he was influential in the national  recognition of Martin Luther King, Jr.  Day.  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Benjamin Hooks was an  unyielding advocate for African-American civil  rights, and he will be greatly missed. I ask my  fellow colleagues to join me today in recognizing this remarkable leader who worked diligently for the black community and was a stalwart champion of fairness and equality for all.  ",2010

684,18,2010-04-20,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker, I move to  suspend the rules and agree to the resolution  (H. Res. 1104) supporting the  mission and goals of  2010 National  Crime Victims’ Rights Week  to  increase public awareness of the rights,  needs, and concerns of victims and survivors of crime in the United States, no  matter their country of origin or their  creed, and to commemorate the National Crime Victims’ Rights Week  theme of ‘‘Crime Victims’ Rights: Fairness. Dignity. Respect.’’  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 1104  Whereas over 25,000,000 individuals in the  United States are victims of crime each  year, including over 6,000,000 individuals who  are victims of violent crime;  Whereas a just society acknowledges the  impact of crime on  individuals,  families,  neighborhoods, and communities by ensuring  that rights, resources, and services are available to help rebuild the lives of victims;  Whereas although our Nation has steadily  expanded rights, protections, and services for  victims of crime, too many victims are still  not able to realize the hope and promise of  these expanded rights, protections, and services;  Whereas despite  impressive accomplishments over the past 40 years in crime victims’ rights and services, there remain many  challenges to ensuring that all victims—  (1) are treated with fairness, dignity, and  respect;  (2) are offered support and services regardless of whether they report the crimes committed against them to law enforcement; and  (3) are recognized as key participants in  our system of justice when such crimes are  reported;  Whereas  justice  systems  in  the United  States should ensure that services are available for all victims of crime, including victims from underserved communities of our  Nation;  Whereas  observing  victims’  rights  and  treating victims with fairness, dignity, and  respect serve the public interest by engaging  victims in the justice system, inspiring respect for public authorities, and promoting  confidence in public safety;  Whereas individuals in the United States  recognize that our homes, neighborhoods,  and communities are made safer and stronger by identifying and meeting the needs of  crime victims and ensuring justice for all;  Whereas treating victims of crime with  fairness, dignity, and respect, as encouraged  and expressed by the theme of 2010 National  Crime Victims’ Right Week, ‘‘Crime Victims’  Rights: Fairness. Dignity. Respect.’’, costs  nothing more than taking time to identify  victims’ needs and concerns, and effective  collaboration among justice systems to meet  such needs and concerns; and  Whereas  2010 National Crime Victims’  Rights Week, April 18 through April 24, 2010,  provides an opportunity for justice systems  in the United States to strive to reach the  goal of justice for all by ensuring that all  victims are afforded legal rights and provided with assistance as they face the financial, physical, spiritual, psychological, and  social impact of crime: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives—  (1) supports the mission and goals of 2010  National Crime Victims’ Rights Week to increase public awareness of—  (A) the impact on victims and survivors of  crime; and  (B) the constitutional and statutory rights  and needs of such victims and survivors;  (2) recognizes that fairness, dignity, and  respect comprise the very foundation of how  victims and survivors of crime should be  treated; and  (3) directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives to transmit an enrolled copy of  this resolution to the Office for Victims of  Crime within the Office of Justice Programs  of the Department of Justice.

686,25,2010-04-20,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we were to have a hearing in my  Committee on Energy and Commerce  about  the companies  in  the United  States that restated their earnings as a  result of us passing  the misguided  health care bill last month. These companies were performing under requirements of the Securities and Exchange  Commission and under the Federal Accounting Standards Board.  Some of the restatement of earnings  you see here on this poster, the chairman of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce thought that these restatement of earnings were simply done to  embarrass the President on the signing  of the bill. In fact, this was a loophole  that was closed by a Senator on Christmas Eve and the loophole was to undo  the Federal Government  and  these  companies partnering together in order  to prevent retirees  from  losing prescription drug benefits. It was a win-  win situation for the employer and for  the retiree.  Unfortunately,  there  are  many  things like this in this health care bill  that are going to be coming forward.  This hearing was canceled after it was  pointed out to the chairman that in  fact these companies were just simply  restating earnings as  they were  required to do under the law. But many  of the other provisions in this bill are  going to be coming out over the next  several months. We’re just now entering into phase B, the rulemaking part,  over at Health and Human Services.  It behooves this Congress to exercise  its oversight authority over the Department of Health and Human Services as these rules are written.  f  RECOGNIZING ISRAEL IN HONOR  OF HER 62ND BIRTHDAY  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2010
687,25,2010-04-20,Mr. PAULSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  tonight to recognize our great ally,  Israel, on the 62nd anniversary of their  nation.  As the standard bearer for democracy  in the Middle East, Israel is of critical  importance to the United States. Since  the declaration of the State of Israel in  1948, they have consistently shown the  power of democracy in a very volatile  part of the world.  Their achievements cannot be understated. The per capita annual GDP in  Israel is nearly $30,000 and the average  life span is over 80 years. Israel consistently keeps its citizens safe, despite  the security threats that occur on a  daily basis. The fact that Israel continues to grow in population at an annual increase of 1.8 percent is a strong  signal of the nation’s strength.  So today let us recognize Israel and  their many achievements and let us always remember the unending bond between  the United States and  Israel  that must continue to be protected.  f  HONORING THE SERVICE OF WEST  FORK  FIRE  CHIEF  MITCH  MCCORKLE  (Mr. BOOZMAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2010
688,25,2010-04-20,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor Mitch McCorkle, who  has devoted his life to protecting the  citizens of West Fork, Arkansas and is  now retiring after 50 years of serving as  the only fire chief in West Fork.  During his time as fire chief, Mitch  has demonstrated his ability to innovate time and time again by building  fire trucks that are uniquely suited to  the landscape of northwest Arkansas.  The longest serving fire chief in all of  Arkansas, Mitch was a visionary  in  terms of what can be done with a volunteer department. Mitch’s pride  in  doing his job and serving his community is an example to be followed and  has made West Fork a better place.  West Fork will undoubtedly be losing  an  amazing  fire  chief.  I  commend  Mitch for his service as the fire chief of  West Fork, his passion for protecting  our citizens, and his continued commitment to our safety. I wish him continued success  in his endeavors and  today I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Mitch McCorkle, a fire chief  whose continued devotion to the Third  District of Arkansas has not gone unnoticed and will never be forgotten.  f  REGARDING THE HEALTH CARE  REFORM BILL  (",2010

690,25,2010-04-20,Mr. DANIEL E.," LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, I asked if I could  borrow this display here which really  should have minuses  in  front of all  these  numbers  because  essentially  these companies had to file in their financial reports the  losses that they  will incur immediately as a result of  the passage and signing into law of the  health care reform bill.  Now  that’s bad enough, but even  worse was the initial response by this  House to them following the law. And  it was to receive a letter commanding  their CEOs come before a committee of  this House, a  subcommittee of  this  House, with all of their internal documents as to how they could come up  with this position.  Now think about it. This is one of the  concerns many of us expressed about  having the government take over medical care in this country to the extent  this bill allows it: if you criticize the  government, you will be called to heel  before a committee of the House.  Now it is true that that call has been  removed, but they have received a letter which told them the Congress will  continue watching. This is not democracy. This is not independence. This is  what we fought against.  f  SPECIAL ORDERS  ",2010

693,25,2010-04-20,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker,  for  those of us who want to live in a world  without nuclear weapons,  there was  very little good news, very little to celebrate over the last decade or so. The  previous administration showed barely  any interest in eradicating the nuclear  threat. But now finally, with the recently signed START treaty between  the United States and Russia, there is  cause for optimism and hope for further progress.  In negotiating this agreement, I am  pleased that President Obama has embraced the principles of the ‘‘no-nukes’’  resolution, House Resolution 333 that I  have introduced in the Congress, and  the SMART Security approach  I’ve  championed for years.  Much of the attention paid to arms  control issues focuses on North Korea  and the looming possibility of a nuclear threat from Iran. And of course  these are gravely important matters to  grapple with. But the fact is that more  than 90 percent of the world’s nuclear  capability rests with the two Cold War  superpowers. So a serious commitment  to nonproliferation must begin with a  bilateral U.S.-Russia approach.  This pact, the New START, mandates  a 30 percent reduction in the allowed  number of deployed strategic warheads,  from a maximum of 2,200 down to 1,550  for each country, the most significant  step toward disarmament in years. The  treaty is far from perfect. In fact, I am  disappointed that it places no restrictions on the development of missile defense programs which have delivered  little bang for the taxpayer buck over  the last several decades. But it is crucial that our Senate colleagues move  quickly to ratify this treaty. Hopefully  the partisan obstructionism that we’ve  seen over and over again on the other  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:36 Jul 08, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\H20AP0.REC H20AP0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010
694,32,2010-04-20,Mr. ANDREWS.," I thank my colleague  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker,  I know that tonight  many Americans are going to put their  head on the pillow and have a very  restless  and maybe  sleepless  night  again because tomorrow’s going to be  another day of trudging around with a  resume that no one seems to want.  Maybe they’re concerned that tomorrow will be the day that the final foreclosure notice arrives in the mail. Tomorrow may be the day that they have  to pull the plug on their small business  that they struggled so hard to sustain.  This problem began to metastasize,  this cancer began to grow in this country in the summer of 2007 when the  days of irresponsibly cheap credit and  easy credit came to an end and the  bubble began to burst. In the part of  the country that I represent, between  Labor Day of 2007 and Labor Day of  2009, we  lost about 36,000  jobs,  just  evaporated, the way eight million jobs  evaporated around this country.  b2015  Now, the President took office  in  January of 2009, inherited what I believe was the worst economic crisis  since the Great Depression, and we decided to act to try to take advantage of  it, put some people back to work building highways and roads and bridges,  cut taxes for small businesses to buy a  laptop or a truck or a piece of equipment. We had a substantial tax cut for  just about every family in the country;  98.5 percent of American families had a  credit so people could buy a home and  get a substantial down payment to buy  a home. And these steps, although I believe they were in the right direction,  opposed unanimously by the other side  of the aisle, have taken us in the better  direction; but they are not enough.  In my area of those 36,000 jobs we  have lost between Labor Day of 2007  and Labor Day of 2009, we have gotten  about 16,000 of those jobs back since  Labor Day of 2009. So between September of 2007 and September of 2009  we lost 36,000 jobs. From Labor Day of  2009 to the present we have gained  about 16,000 of them back.  I worry, Mr. Speaker, tonight, and I  say to my colleague as well, that one of  the reasons we haven’t gotten enough  of those jobs back soon enough is the  credit crunch in this economy. I hear  from entrepreneurs  large and small,  people running stores and factories and  software companies, that they are profitable, they have collateral, they have  a track record of paying their bills on  time, but they cannot get credit. They  cannot get the loans that they need to  make their businesses grow.  This lack of credit is rooted in a lack  of trust, and this lack of trust is rooted  in a lack of confidence, and this lack of  confidence, without a doubt, is rooted  in the failure of the regulatory system  to properly regulate the financial system and assure the investor and the  American people they are getting a fair  deal.  Now, this House late last year passed  legislation that would fix that problem, that would have some even-handed regulators look at whether the system was once again teetering on the  brink of collapse, that would say that  if you lend money, you have to have  some skin in the game. You can’t have  one industry that makes a profit by  originating  loans but doesn’t collect  any of  them, and another  industry  that’s solely responsible for collecting  the loans but doesn’t originate them.  The legislation also said that if these  steps to prevent another catastrophe  failed, the next time there has to be a  bailout of the failure; it won’t be paid  by real estate agents and teachers and  truck drivers. It will be paid by the  people who created the mess  in the  first place.  Now, a version of this legislation is  being considered by the other body,  and I know that the rules do not permit us to comment on the affairs of the  other body, so I will not. I will simply  offer this generic observation. When  the health care bill was in its final  stages of debate, our friends on the Republican side of the aisle loudly insisted, I think correctly insisted, that  there be an up-down vote on all aspects  of the health care bill, and there was.  It was an up-down vote on the underlying text of the Senate bill, and there  was an up-down vote on the fixed bill  that occurred. That’s the right way to  do things.  When there is a major question before the country, that will be an up-  down vote. I would hope that the other  body adheres to that principle. With an  issue this significant, with the stakes  being so high, I think the American  people not only have a right to demand  that the problem be fixed. I think they  have a right to demand they know that  their Representatives go on record and  say yes or no. Mr. GARAMENDI, we say  ‘‘yes’’ to responsible regulation, we say  ‘‘yes’’ to getting credit flowing again  in this economy and we would say ‘‘no’’  to those who would block a vote to  block the will of the American people.  ",2010
695,32,2010-04-20,Mr. GARAMENDI.," Well, the question  really is, whose side are you on? Are  you on the side of average Americans  out there, the middle class, the men  and women that are trying to get a job,  the men and women that are working,  or are you on the side of Wall Street?  You raised a very  interesting point  about loans.  Let’s put it this way: the American  taxpayer gave to the bank some $400  billion to stabilize that financial industry, and it was necessary. No one is  doubting  the necessity of  it. Every  other  industrialized  country  in  the  world also shored up their financial institutions, and it worked. We want that  money back, but it’s not coming back  to the businesses that are in our communities.  And then we look here, in 2009, the  total lending by U.S. banks fell 7.4 percent, the steepest drop since the outset  of World War II in 1942. At the same  time, there were enormous profits, and  we will come to the profits of Wall  Street where many of those profits are  a direct result of the money that the  American people used to stabilize Wall  Street.  We want that back, and we want to  make it very, very clear: we are on the  side of the working men and women  out there, the middle class, the small  businesses, Main Street. That’s where  we stand. It’s interesting that when the  bill came up, and you spoke to this a  moment ago, our colleagues on the Republican side voted ‘‘no.’’ When it came  time to rein in Wall Street, they voted  ‘‘no.’’  ",2010

697,46,2010-04-20,Ms. RICHARDSON.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to remember and honor the legacy of  Dr. Dorothy Height, who passed away  this  morning at the age of 98. As one of the most  significant  figures of  the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. Dorothy Height was a true American  heroine. Dr. Height spent her entire life fighting injustice and discrimination, and, in doing  so, helped make our society more equitable  and tolerant.  Dr. Dorothy Height was born in Richmond,  Virginia in 1912, a setting in which racism and  sexism were the norm. However, Dr. Height  did not let this oppressive environment prevent  her from following her dreams. After being denied entrance  to Barnard College due  to a  quota allowing only two African-American students per class, she enrolled at New York University, where she earned a Master’s degree  in educational psychology.  Although Dr. Height began her career as a  caseworker, she soon felt called to the arena  of social justice and joined the National Council of Negro Women. In 1957, Dr. Height was  elected President of  the National Council of  Negro Women and proudly served in that post  for 40 years. Dr. Height also served as  the  president of the historically black Delta Sigma  Theta Sorority, where  she developed programs that promoted education and leadership  among African-American women.  Dr. Height is often referred to as the ‘‘godmother of the Civil Rights Movement ‘‘ due to  her  founding role  in  the Movement and her  consistent voice of guidance and inspiration in  the  fight against discrimination. Dr. Height  fought  to desegregate public schools, obtain  voting  rights  for African-Americans, and ensure equality  for women of all  races. Dr.  Height marched alongside Dr. Martin Luther  King and gave advice to Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Lyndon Johnson on civil rights  and women’s rights issues.  Dr. Height’s amazing and inspirational work  has been honored by our nation’s most prestigious awards. In 1994, President Bill Clinton  awarded Dr. Height with the Medal of Freedom and in 2004, President George W. Bush  presented her with  the Congressional Gold  Medal. Dr. Height has also received the Presidential Citizen Medal,  the Franklin Delano  Roosevelt Freedom From Want Award,  the  Spingarn Medal from the NAACP, and the 7th  Annual Heinz Award Chairman’s Medal.  Dr. Height never stopped fighting for justice  and equality, and in January 2009, Dr. Height  was honored as a distinguished guest at the  inauguration of our nation’s first African-American president.  Our country has  lost a  true  leader and a  beacon of social justice. I extend my deepest  condolences to the family and friends of Dr.  Dorothy Height, as they grieve the loss of this  special  individual. All Americans mourn her  loss, but we take solace in the certain knowledge that our country is better because of her.  ",2010
698,46,2010-04-20,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to honor the incredible life and legacy of a great leader in the Civil Rights Movement and a dear  friend and neighbor, Dr.  Dorothy Irene Height, who passed away this  morning, at the age of 98.  Dr. Height was always elegant, full of grace  and poise, naturally commanding attention.  She led an extraordinary life fighting for civil  rights and women’s  rights. Her  fight began  when she was denied entrance  into college  because the school had filled its annual quota  of black students, and she never gave up the  fight.  Over the years, she continued the fight for  justice and equality for all Americans. In fact,  Dr. Height was on stage at the Lincoln Memorial with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. when  he delivered his  ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ speech.  She was in Birmingham, Alabama to comfort  the families of the four African-American girls  who perished in the bombing of the Sixteenth  Street Baptist Church. She watched as President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay  Act to eliminate wage disparity based on sex.  She also helped  create and organize  the  Black Family Reunion Celebration, and was  among the few women present at the Million  Man March in 1995.  Throughout her life, she befriended countless people as she strove for justice. Among  her many friends were the American educator  and  National  Council  of  Negro Women  (NCNW) founder Mary McLeod Bethune, First  Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Dr. King,  to  name a few.  Dr. Height also served as the Director of the  YWCA’s Center for Racial Justice, as a visiting professor at the Delhi School of Social  Work  in  India, as National President of  the  Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and as the fourth  President of the NCNW. Her forty-year tenure  as President of the NCNW was the highlight of  her distinguished career.  In addition to her tireless work for racial justice and gender equality, she served on the  advisory council of the White House Initiative  on Historically Black Colleges and Universities  and the National Advisory Council on Aging.  Along with her 36 honorary doctorates  from  colleges and universities, she is a recipient of  the Congressional Gold Medal, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  Although she received many accolades, she  did not put forth her best efforts to achieve notoriety or  fame. She  said,  ‘‘Stop worrying  about whose name gets in the paper and start  doing something . . . We must try to take our  task more seriously and ourselves more lightly.’’  Dr. Dorothy Irene Height was a remarkable  woman. Her years were long as were her accomplishments. Leonardo da Vinci said, ‘‘As a  well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life  well used brings happy death.’’ May Dr. Height  sleep happily now for a life well used.  f  LEAVE OF ABSENCE  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:  Mr. BISHOPof Georgia (at the request  of Mr. HOYER) for today.

700,53,2010-04-20,Mr. REID.," Madam President, America today lost a civil rights icon. Dorothy Height died early this morning.  She helped transform our country as  considerably and as courageously as  anyone who dedicated his or her life to  ensure our Nation fulfills its promise of  equality.  For decades, Mrs. Height fought tirelessly for the rights of women and African Americans and helped lead a national dialog about gender and racial  equality. She was a trusted counsel of  every White House since Franklin Roosevelt’s  administration.  Generation  after generation relied on her vision  and tenacity and our country is better  because so many sought her help.  Mrs. Height’s legacy is in the fairer,  more equal America in which she died  and we live today. She knew her work  was not done and she never stopped  pushing her country forward. Until the  last days of her  98 years, Dorothy  Height was still fighting for equality  and opportunity.  The thoughts of the entire Senate  today  are  with  Dorothy  Height’s  friends, who are too numerous to mention, and her loved ones—and her loved  ones are more than just her family.  f  SCHEDULE  ",2010
701,53,2010-04-20,Mr. REID.," Madam President, today,  following leader remarks, the Senate  will be in morning business for about  an hour, with Senators permitted to  speak therein  for up to 10 minutes  each. The Republicans will control the  first 30 minutes and the majority will  control the final 30 minutes.  Following morning business, the Senate will turn to executive session to debate the nomination of Lael Brainard  to be Under Secretary of the Treasury,  postcloture.  At 12 noon, the Senate will vote on  that nomination. Following the vote,  the Senate will recess until 2:15 to  allow for our weekly caucus luncheons.  Following the recess, the Senate will  debate  the  nomination  of Marisa  Demeo to be an associate judge of the  Superior Court of the District of Columbia. There will be up to 6 hours for  debate, equally divided, prior to a vote  on confirmation of that nomination.  Upon disposition of the Demeo nomination, the Senate will immediately proceed to vote on the confirmation of  Stuart Gordon Nash to be an associate  justice of the same court, the Superior  Court of the District of Columbia.  Cloture motions have been filed on  the nominations of Christopher Schroeder, Thomas Vanaskie,  and Denny  Chin. Today we will consider a way to  move forward on those nominations.  f  RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY  LEADER  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

702,53,2010-04-20,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Madam President,  with  regard  to  financial  regulation,  from the beginning of this debate, I  have called for a bipartisan approach.  And for several months, I was encouraged to see bipartisan talks approaching agreement on a bipartisan bill.  Somewhere  along  the  line,  those  talks got off course, leading to Democrats pulling away from bipartisan efforts, a party-line vote in committee  and the Democrat leadership’s stated  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

I ask for the regular order on the  unanimous-consent request. The unanimous-consent request is pending right  now, and there is nobody on the floor  to answer it or object to it.  ",2010
704,60,2010-04-20,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Is there  objection?  ,2010
705,60,2010-04-20,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," I am told a Senator is coming to make an objection, so  I will withhold.  While we are waiting for a Republican Senator to come and object to  these nominees, they came out of the  Judiciary Committee back in January.  They were voted out of the Judiciary  Committee by, in one case, a unanimous, bipartisan vote of 19 to 0.  I am informed that the Senator from  Arizona, Mr. KYL, is coming to object.  He sits on the Judiciary Committee. He  likely was one of those 19 who voted in  favor of this nominee at the committee  level. I don’t know who the one vote  against  Judge Wynn was,  but  he  cleared the committee by a vote of 18  to 1—again, a strong bipartisan vote of  support. Yet I am informed by the floor  staff that they are finding somebody to  come and object to these nominees who  have now been held through all of February, all of March, half of April, despite being,  in one case, unanimous  votes in the Judiciary Committee, and  the other an 18-to-1 overwhelming bipartisan majority.  For the record, I am informed that  the minority was aware that  I was  coming to make these unanimous-consent  requests;  that  they  had  full  knowledge this was going to come. If  they are unable to get somebody to the  floor to object, as far as I am concerned  that is not my concern.  Mr. President,  I renew the unanimous-consent request now that there is  a Senator on the floor.  ",2010
706,60,2010-04-20,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Is there  objection to the Senator’s request?  ,2010
707,60,2010-04-20,Mr. KYL.," Reserving the right to object, might I ask my colleague to restate the request?  ",2010
708,60,2010-04-20,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Yes. It was to  call up Executive Calendar Nos. 656 and  657, which  are  the nominations  of  Judge Albert Diaz and Judge James  Wynn to the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the Fourth Circuit. As  the  distinguished Senator from Arizona will recall, since he sits with me on the Judiciary Committee, Judge Diaz was voted  out by a vote of 19 to 0 back on January 28, 2010. If my math is correct, that  means the distinguished Senator from  Arizona voted for this nominee in the  Judiciary Committee.  Judge James Wynn was reported out  the same day, January 28, by a vote of  18 to 1. I don’t know if the Senator was  the single dissenting vote in that overwhelming vote  in  support of Judge  Wynn’s nomination.  Judge Diaz  served  in  the Marine  Corps and has 9 years of State court judicial experience. Judge Wynn is a certified military trial judge and a captain in the U.S. Navy Reserves.  My unanimous-consent request was  that the Senate proceed to executive  session,  and  notwithstanding  rule  XXII, the Senate proceed to Executive  Calendar Nos. 656 and 657; that nominations be confirmed en bloc; that the  motions to reconsider be laid upon the  table en bloc; that any statements related to the nominations be printed in  the RECORD, as if read, and that the  President be immediately notified of  the Senate’s action.  ",2010
709,60,2010-04-20,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I appreciate  my colleague restating the request. Reserving the right to object, and I will  object, as I think my colleagues are  aware, the two leaders have worked out  a process for consideration of at least  some of the judicial nominations. My  understanding  is,  there  is  another  agreement on at least one circuit court  nomination that they are working out  a time agreement on right now and  that would occur, I presume, later this  week. I think it is important to let the  two  leaders work  out  those  agreements. As a result, reluctantly, I have  to object to my colleague’s request.  ",2010
710,60,2010-04-20,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Objection is heard.  ,2010
711,60,2010-04-20,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Mr. President, I  appreciate the distinguished Senator’s  objection. We do have 101 nominees on  the Executive Calendar. The objections  have holds which are secret. They are  holding up people, as I said, for an average of 106 days. While it is nice one  or two might be given a time agreement by the minority party, it does  very little to relieve the blockade that  the minority party is engaged in of judicial and Executive nominees.  I will continue forward. I call up Executive Calendar No. 701, the nomination of Nancy Freudenthal  to be a  judge for the U.S. District Court for  the District of Wyoming. She passed  out of the committee by voice vote—a  voice vote, as the Presiding Officer  knows, is a vote without dissent—on  February 11, 2010. She has decades of  experience as a public servant and as a  lawyer  in private practice. She currently is Wyoming’s First Lady.  If confirmed, she will be that State’s  first female Federal judge. It is the  practice of the Judiciary Committee  not to put forward judges unless the  consent of the home Senators has been  obtained. I point out that both the  Senators  from Wyoming are Republicans.  I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to executive session,  and notwithstanding  rule XXII,  the  Senate proceed to Executive Calendar  No.  701,  the  nomination  of Nancy  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:33 Apr 21, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G20AP6.013 S20APPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2010
712,67,2010-04-20,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Illinois is recognized.  ,2010
713,67,2010-04-20,Mr. BURRIS.," Mr. President, when I  came to Washington over a year ago,  this country faced an economic crisis  greater than anything we have seen in  generations. So my colleagues and I set  out to work. Under President Obama’s  strong  leadership, we passed a  landmark stimulus package that stopped  the bleeding. We did what was necessary to prevent a complete economic  collapse and set America back on the  road to recovery.  Since that time, we have come a long  way. Many key economic  indicators  have started to turn around, but we are  not out of the woods yet. The economy  has started to grow again, but unemployment is still too high, and rampant  foreclosures continue to threaten families in my home State and across the  country. During the first 3 months of  this year, almost 15,000 homeowners  went into foreclosure in Illinois alone.  Despite  our  best  efforts  to modify  mortgages to make them more affordable, that is twice as many foreclosures  as we saw during the same period last  year. This  is unacceptable. We are  making progress, but it simply isn’t  enough.  Today, America no longer stands at  the brink of disaster, but we are still  vulnerable  to  the  same  recklessness  that led to this crisis in the first place.  For years, at big corporations such as  Goldman Sachs, Wall Street bankers  packaged bad mortgages together and  sold  them  to  investors. They knew  these investment vehicles would inevitably fail, so they turned around and  bet against them. They bet against the  American people. They sought to make  a profit off of the misfortunes of their  own customers. They allegedly committed fraud, and that is why they are  currently being sued by the Securities  and Exchange Commission on behalf of  the American  people. As  a  former  banker, I understand the seriousness of  this misconduct. I know it continues to  pose a dramatic threat to the American financial system.  That is why we need to pass strong financial reform to prevent bad behavior  on Wall Street from sinking ordinary  folks on Main Street. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the reform legislation introduced by Senator  DODD. This bill would prevent Goldman  Sachs and other companies from getting us into a mess in the first place,  and it can help ensure that we will  never end up in this position again.  This legislation creates a consumer  protection bureau designed to shield  ordinary Americans from unfair, deceptive, and abusive financial practices. It  would establish an oversight council  tasked with keeping a close eye on  emerging risks so that we are never  taken by surprise again. It would end  so-called too big to fail, protect taxpayers  from unnecessary  risks, and  eliminate the need for future bailouts.  This bill would also increase transparency and accountability for banks,  hedge funds, and the derivative market, so a big company such as Goldman  Sachs would not be able to get away  with their alleged fraud anymore.  These basic  reforms will establish  clear rules of the road for the financial  services industry so we can keep the  market free and fair without risking  another economic collapse. But if we  fail to take action, if we do not pass  this reform bill, then we will be right  back where we started, with no safeguards against this kind of deception  and abuse in the future. I call upon my  colleagues to  join me  in supporting  Senator DODD’s bill when it comes to  the floor this week. I ask my friends on  both sides of the aisle to stand with me  on the side of the American people. Let  us pass  financial reform  legislation,  and let’s do it without delay.  I yield the floor.  f  RECESS  ",2010

720,67,2010-04-20,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President,  Thursday is Earth Day. Actually, it is  the 40th anniversary of Earth Day. It is  a good day to celebrate by creating a  national  resolve  in our  country  to  build 100 new nuclear power plants in  the next 20 years, which would be the  best way to create the largest amount  of  pollution-free,  carbon-free  electricity. Today, nuclear power produces  20 percent of America’s electricity but  69 percent of all of our carbon-free, pollution-free electricity.  During 2009, America’s national energy policy looked more like a national  windmill  policy—the  equivalent  of  going to war in sailboats. If we were  going  to  war,  the  United  States  wouldn’t think of putting its nuclear  navy in mothballs. Yet we did mothball  our nuclear plant construction program—our best weapon against climate  change, high electricity prices, polluted air, and energy insecurity. Although 107 reactors were completed between 1970 and 1990, producing 20 percent of our electricity today—which, as  I said, is 69 percent of our carbon-free  electricity—the United States has not  started a new nuclear plant in 30 years.  Instead of using our own nuclear  power invention to catch up with the  rest of the world, President Obama, in  his inaugural address, set out on a different path: America would rely upon  ‘‘the sun, the winds, and the soil’’ for  energy. There was no mention of nuclear power. Windmills would produce  20  percent  of  our  electricity.  To  achieve this goal, the Federal Government would commit another $30 billion  in subsidies and tax breaks.  To date, almost all the subsidies for  renewable energy have gone to windmill developers, many of which are  large banks, corporations, and wealthy  individuals. According to the Energy  Information Administration, big wind  receives an $18.82 subsidy per megawatt  hour—25 times as much per megawatt  hour as subsidies for all other forms of  electricity production combined. Last  year’s stimulus bill alone contained $2  billion in windmill subsidies. Unfortunately, most of the jobs are being created in Spain and China. According to  an American University study, nearly  80 percent of that $2 billion of American taxpayer money went to overseas  manufacturers. Despite the billions in  subsidies, not much energy  is being  produced. Wind accounts for just 1.3  percent of America’s electricity—available only when  the wind blows, of  course, since wind cannot be stored, except in small amounts.  Conservation groups have begun to  worry about what they call the  ‘‘renewable energy sprawl.’’ For example,  producing 20 percent of U.S. electricity  from wind would cover an area the size  of West Virginia with 186,000 turbines  and require 19,000 miles of new transmission  lines. These  are  not  your  grandmother’s windmills. These  turbines are 50 stories high. Their flashing  lights can be seen for 20 miles.

724,74,2010-04-20,Mr. DEMINT.," Madam President,  I  rise in opposition to the nomination of  Marisa Demeo to be a Superior Court  judge in the District of Columbia. I do  not believe she has enough judicial experience to sit on the DC Superior  Court. She is currently serving as a  magistrate judge, a position she has  held for the past 21⁄2years. Although  being a magistrate judge is good training for a Superior Court judge, 2 years  is not enough of that training. Of the 25  magistrate judges in the District of Columbia, she is one of the least experienced. Nineteen of the current DC magistrate judges have served for 5 years  or more compared to her 21⁄2. Some  have served for decades. In fact, only 3  of her 24 colleagues have served less  than Ms. Demeo.  Looking at her record, I see she has  much more experience working as a  lobbyist  for a special  interest group  than a magistrate judge. She was chief  lobbyist  for  the Mexican American  Legal Defense and Education Fund, a  national Latino civil rights organization, from 1997 to 2004. In this position,  she became more well known for divisive comments she made against Hispanic Republicans than for her legal  expertise. She took on a high-profile  role opposing President Bush’s nomination of Miguel Estrada, criticizing him  in numerous newspaper stories because  he did not appear to support her political  agenda. During  this  time,  she  made personal attacks against him,  suggesting he was a traitor to other  Hispanics.  Let me read from a 2003 article from  National Review entitled,  ‘‘Dems  to  Miguel Estrada, You’re Not Hispanic  Enough.’’ Ms. Demeo said:  If the Senate confirms Mr. Estrada, his  own personal American dream will come  true, but the American dreams of the majority of Hispanics living in this country will  come to an end through his future legal decisions.  In another press statement she said:  The most difficult situation for an organization like mine is when a president nominates a Latino who does not reflect, resonate  or associate with the Latino community.

726,81,2010-04-20,Mr. VITTER.," Madam President, I do  object. General Walsh  today, before  any promotion, is one of nine leading  officers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He is part of that leadership. I  am happy my two colleagues are satisfied with his leadership and the corps’  leadership and how  that agency  is  being run. I can tell them, as a Senator  from Louisiana, I am absolutely not  satisfied with their leadership and how  that agency is being run at all.  Since Hurricane Katrina, there were  14 major report deadlines put on the  Corps of Engineers,  required of  the  corps. The corps missed all 14 of those  major deadlines. Today, as we speak,  the corps is still actively missing and  has failed to respond to 13 of the 14,  having accomplished 1 many months  late.  I have brought nine significant issues  before the Corps of Engineers in conversations  with  them,  not minor  projects, major issues with regard to  hurricane recovery and hurricane and  flood protection. I have outlined the  authority they have to do constructive  things under each of those categories.  They have not responded in a positive  or timely way on eight of those nine  issues.  One of those issues is a particularly  good example. That is the Morganza to  the gulf hurricane protection project.  That  is a vital hurricane protection  project that would protect significant  portions of south Louisiana that was  originally proposed in 1992. The Senators want to  talk about authority  from Congress. That project has been  authorized by Congress three different  times  in  three  different water  resources bills. Yet the corps continues  to drag its feet and is still not moving  forward toward full implementation of  that project, after three specific authorizations  by  Congress,  18  years  later.  I am sorry the corps leadership is  frustrated with an 18-day delay or an  18-week delay. But I suggest they try 18  years on for size. That is how long the  people of Lafourche and Terrebonne  Parishes, many folks throughout Louisiana, have been waiting on the Corps  of Engineers.  I yield the floor.  ",2010
727,81,2010-04-20,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from North Dakota.  ,2010
728,81,2010-04-20,Mr. DORGAN.," Madam President, let  me say to my colleague  from Louisiana, if he will stay in the Chamber—  let the record note he has  left the  Chamber—there is no State, none that  has received more help more consistently  from  this Chamber,  from  the  American people, and, yes, from the  Corps of Engineers in the aftermath of  Hurricane Katrina. That State and the  city of New Orleans were leveled. It  was an unbelievable catastrophe  for  the Senator’s State and for his city.  But after billions and billions and billions of dollars that has come from this  Congress  and,  yes,  from my  subcommittee, the subcommittee on appropriations I chair, I think it would be  nice for a change to hear that maybe  the Corps of Engineers, the Senate, and  the American people have been a great  help to New Orleans and to Louisiana.  Let me describe what my colleague  just said on the floor, why this is such  an unbelievable mistake  for him to  make. He says, just to pick an example: Well, the Morganza to the gulf  issue is a perfect example of how the  corps simply will not do what it is supposed to do. It has been authorized  three times, he says, on and on.  Let me read what the Corps of Engineers says and  let me tell my colleagues what I know as an appropriator. The Corps of Engineers is not authorized to construct the Houma lock,  which  is what  he wants  in  this  Morganza to the gulf—the Houma lock,  as  an  independent,  freestanding  project—or separable elements of the  Morganza to the gulf project. An additional authorization will have to be required to construct the Morganza to  the gulf project in accordance with the  new design criteria.  My colleague might not like that. I  understand that. There are a whole lot  of things he doesn’t like. But it is a  fact. He cannot possibly go to sleep believing that holding up the promotion  of a soldier who has gone to war for his  country because of something that soldier can’t do that he demands be done,  he cannot possibly sleep easy believing  that is the right course of action. It is  not the right course of action. This is  but 1 of 100 names on the Executive  Calendar to date, 100. This was put on  the calendar nearly 6 months ago for a  general  who  has  an  unblemished  record, has served America for 30 years,  gone to war for this country, and was  told by the Armed Services Committee,  Republicans  and  Democrats  unanimously by Senator LEVINand Senator  MCCAIN: You deserve a promotion to  the second star as a major general. But  6 months later, this is not a major general.  This soldier has lost his promotion  for the last 6 months because of one  Senator saying: I am going to use this  soldier as a pawn in my concerns and  demands about the Corps of Engineers.  I could go through the rest of these  demands. In fact, let me go through a  couple, if I might. Outfall canals and  pump to the river. He is making demands about that. Let me tell you  about that. We had a vote on this. He  lost. He doesn’t like it. The Appropriations Committee, the full committee,  voted and he lost. Why did he lose? Because what he wants to do is the most  costly approach that will provide less  flood protection for New Orleans. So  you want to spend more money for less  protection? No,  the Appropriations  Committee voted on that. I led the opposition.  The  appropriations  subcommittee voted no. He is demanding  holding up, by the way, the promotion  for this major general. He is demanding  it be done. The Corps of Engineers says  if Congress appropriates the funds for  this study, we will do it. But there are  no funds appropriated.  Why? Because we voted against it.  That is why. Unbelievable. And the list  goes on. Ouachita River levees. The authorization  for this project specifies  that the levee maintenance is a nonfederal responsibility. Congress has not  enacted a general provision of law that  would supplant this nonfederal responsibility or that would allow the Corps  to correct levee damages that are not  associated with flood events.  That is just two. I mentioned three  with Morganza. The fact is, we have a  circumstance here where a soldier deserves  a  promotion,  and  that  promotion  is being held up because we  have  a Senator who  is  demanding  things the Corps of Engineers cannot  do.

733,88,2010-04-20,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, today is  Justice John Paul Stevens’ birthday,  and I cannot help but think about that  and  some wonderful conversations  I  have had with him of late. As I said,  his retirement from the Supreme Court  will begin to draw to a close an extraordinary  judicial  career  spanning  four decades, including 35 years on the  Nation’s highest Court.  It is interesting, Justice Stevens and  I both came to Washington in the wake  of the Watergate scandal in 1975. President Ford was  impressed by Justice  Stevens’ anticorruption record, including his investigation of two Illinois Supreme Court Justices who were charged  with accepting bribes. His confirmation  to the Supreme Court was the first of a  dozen Supreme Court nominations  I  have considered and voted on in my  years in the Senate. As a young freshman Senator, it was my privilege to  support his confirmation in 1975. Incidentally, he was nominated by a Republican President and considered by  an overwhelmingly Democratic Senate.  From the time he was nominated until  the  time he was  confirmed unanimously, it was 21⁄2weeks.  Justice Stevens is the only sitting  Justice with Active military service  during wartime. He is the last Justice  from the  ‘‘Greatest Generation.’’ He  has never turned away when the Nation  sought his service. He worked as a  Navy intelligence officer during World  War II, and that earned him a Bronze  Star.  Justice Stevens’ unique and enduring  perspective is irreplaceable; his stalwart adherence to the rule of law is unparalleled. The Federal judiciary and  indeed the entire Nation will miss his  principled jurisprudence. Today, as he  marks another milestone with the celebration of his 90th birthday, and as we  continue to honor his legacy, I want to  mention just a few of his most notable  opinions.  During my 35 years in the Senate, I  have submitted briefs to the Supreme  Court in only a few cases. The most recent case was very important to me. It  involved a Vermont musician named  Diana Levine.  Ms. Levine was  forced—remember,  she is a musician—she was forced to  endure the amputation of her arm after  she was injected with a drug to treat  nausea. The drug maker failed to include critical information on its warning label that could have saved Ms. Levine’s arm, and she ultimately sued the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  00:32 Apr 21, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G20AP6.065 S20APPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2010

Williams, Jr.  I would also like to congratulate John on his  upcoming retirement.  John  is  the president of  the Salt River  Project (SRP), the nation’s third-largest public  power utility and the largest supplier of water  to the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. John  serves as president of both the Salt River Valley Water Users’ Association,  the water distribution side of  the company, and  the Salt  River Project Agricultural  Improvement and  Power District,  the electricity-generating side  of  the company. He began serving on  the  SRP council in 1964 and has served 28 years  with SRP,  including 12 years as vice president. He was elected SRP’s 16th president in  2007.  During his tenure as president, John signed  the largest-ever Indian water rights settlement;  helped SRP expand  its  sustainable-energy  portfolio to approximately seven percent of the  total energy generated, including partnering on  the state’s  first commercial wind  farm; and  presided over a  far-reaching settlement  that  will help ensure the future sustainability of Arizona’s Verde River.  John  is a member of  the Groundwater  Users’ Advisory Council, the American Public  Power Association,  the National Water Resources Association, the Colorado River Water  Users’ Association and the Cowman’s Club. In  addition, President George W. Bush appointed  Infrastructure Advisory  him  to  the National  Council in 2008.  An Arizona native, John is active in numerous community-based efforts,  including serving on the board of the Farmers Gin and as  a committee member of the Maricopa County  Farm Services Administration. He has been involved in many other community activities in  the Laveen area. John, who owns John M.  Williams Farms in Laveen, lives in the West  Valley with his wife, Dawnetta.  I have been  fortunate  to have John as a  friend for many years. I first became familiar  with John’s trademark black cowboy hat when  he came to visit my office in Washington, DC.  Since  that  time,  I have seen him wear  that  same black cowboy hat twice a year at Corona Ranch, where we have enjoyed  the  music and good company together.  Madam speaker, I am honored to recognize  the leadership of John Williams and the friendship he has given me and my family.  f  HONORING  THE  40TH  ANNIVERSARY OF PINE FORGE ATHLETIC  ASSOCIATION  HON.

The Association formed as a result of the vision and leadership of Merle Harner and Robert ‘‘Skip’’ Trainer, who wanted to create more  opportunities for participating in youth sports.  The Association has thrived since its first team  began practicing and playing on a single,  small field at Pine Forge Elementary School  four decades ago. Today, more than 400 boys  and girls play on more  than 30  teams  that  have access to as many as 15 fields faithfully  maintained by the Association.  While many  things have  changed  since  1970,  the Association remains committed  to  the core principles of teaching the fundamentals of the game, promoting good sportsmanship and helping youth learn the importance of  team work, perseverance and hard work. The  Association’s tremendous success was made  possible thanks to dedicated volunteers who  generously give countless hours each year to  serve as coaches, umpires,  league officials  and in various other roles.  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues  join me today in congratulating the Pine Forge  Athletic Association as it commemorates this  very special milestone and offering best wishes for continued success in enriching the lives  of our youth and strengthening the bonds within our community.  f  TRIBUTE TO BILL AND MAURA  SCULLY  HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR.  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 20, 2010  ",2010
741,109,2010-04-20,Mr. PASCRELL.," Madam Speaker,  I would  like to call to your attention the work of two  outstanding individuals, Bill and Maura Scully,  who are being honored by the Frank McGovern Association on Sunday, April 18, 2010, for  their lifetime of friendship and service.  It is only fitting that they be honored in this,  the permanent record of the greatest democracy ever known,  for  they have brought  joy  and comfort to many others through their dedication to community service and the preservation of Irish-American culture.  Bill  was  born  August  14,  1937,  in  Glenamaddy, Co. Galway. His family moved to  Middleton, Co. Cork, in 1950 when he was 13  years old. He is a product of the C.B.S. where  he learned his skills of Human Interaction. Bill  came to America on February 14, 1958, and  started work as a waiter in McGovern’s. Bill  has one brother, Edward and one  sister,  Breda.  Maura  McGovern  was  born  in  Kinawley, Co. Fermanagh. Her family moved  to Swanlinbar, Co. Cavan, where she attended  the National School. She came to America in  April 1955. Maura is the oldest of seven children. She has  two brothers, Eamon and  Freddie, and four sisters, Geraldine, Theresa,  Patricia and Carmel. Bill and Maura are the  proud aunt and uncle of many nieces and  nephews.  Bill worked for Prudential in Newark before  marrying Maura on May 6, 1961. The U.S.  Army called him into service in August of that  year and he headed to Hawaii, where he was  stationed  for  the next 18 months. When he  was discharged he went  to work  for Crown  Furs.  Upon his  retirement, Frank McGovern offered Bill and Maura the tavern and on July  10, 1968, they became the proud owners of  the most popular  Irish Tavern on  the East  Coast of the U.S. In April 2001 they turned the  reins over to Patrick and Sean McGovern and  young Mike Nagle. The boys have made the  Scullys  proud  by  ‘‘Keeping  the  Tradition  Alive.’’  The Scullys have long worked to help keep  their community strong and to keep alive Irish-  American culture. Bill has been honored by  many organizations such as the Independent  Irish, the Peter Smith School of Irish Dancing,  The Giblin Association, The Cryan Association, The Shillelagh Club, The Irish American  Association of the Oranges, Project Children,  the Emerald Society,  the F.O.P. Local #12,  and  the Sheriff’s Department P.B.A. Maura  was honored as the Deputy Grand Marshal of  the Newark Saint Patrick’s Day Parade  in  1971.  Throughout their lives, Bill and Maura have  not only given much of their own time and energy to community efforts, but have also inspired others  through  the example  they set.  Bill and Maura are  the Standard Bearers of  the Frank McGovern Association and members of many civic, social and charitable organizations. They welcome this tribute and thank  everyone for all the love and support over the  last 50 years. It’s their sincere wish for Peace  with Justice for all the people of Ireland, both  North and South.  The job of a United States Congressman involves much  that  is  rewarding, yet nothing  compares  to  learning about and recognizing  individuals like Bill and Maura Scully.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues,  the Scullys’  family and  friends,  the  members of the Frank McGovern Association,  everyone who has enjoyed a visit to McGovern’s, and me in recognizing the contributions  of Bill and Maura Scully.

742,116,2010-04-20,Mr. CROWLEY.," Madam Speaker, I rise in  honor of the life, and great works of Dr. Dorothy Height.  Widely recognized as one of the founding  members of  the Civil Rights movement, Dr.  Height served as the president of the National  Council of Negro Women  for  four decades,  stepping down from the position in 1997. In  her position with the Council, which connected  nearly 4 million women worldwide, she tackled  issues  that affected women,  including child  care for working mothers, health and nutrition,  education and adequate housing for families in  need.  While I did not personally know Dr. Height,  I have seen her good works embodied though  the National Council of Negro Women Section  in Co-op City, in the Bronx, New York.  Less than two weeks ago, I was visiting the  National Council of Negro Women Co-op City  Section  to honor  their work  in  the weekend  mentoring of students between 2nd and 6th  grades in the community.  Since 1972, the National Council of Negro  Women Co-op City Section has provided after-  school  educational  support  for  elementary  school students. They have licensed teachers  who work  in small groups with children on  strengthening  their  language and computational skills.  They meet on Saturday mornings, and the  passion showed by the educators, administrators, students and parents is electric.  I have worked with several of the leaders of  the Co-op City Section, including past presidents Maxine Sullivan and Joyce Howard, as  well as the current President of the Co-op City  Section of NCNW, Judith Roberson. These  women  embody  the work  of Dr. Dorothy  Height every day in my community.  Dr. Dorothy Height’s vision and her legacy  are hard at work in Co-op City, New York—  just as it is in the communities of many of my  colleagues.  While her family and friends—as well as our  country—mourn her passing  today, we also  honor her for the contributions she made to  our great nation.  Her legacy will live on for decades to come,  and I hope her family and friends realize that  her  life’s work will continue  to benefit many  more generations to come.  f  HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY  OF BILL STANLEY  HON. JOE COURTNEY  OFCONNECTICUT  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 20, 2010  ",2010
743,116,2010-04-20,Mr. COURTNEY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  with a heavy heart today to honor the life and  legacy of Bill Stanley, an icon in eastern Connecticut, who passed away Sunday, April 18,  2010, at the age of 80.  Stanley was a graduate of Norwich Free  Academy and attended the New York School  of Modern Photography before  joining  the  United States Marine Corps. He returned to civilian life and joined with his brother Jim to co-  host the WICH morning radio program. Later  he became a stockbroker and published author.  The impact that Bill Stanley had on Norwich,  Connecticut and  its residents was profound.  He delighted readers with his newspaper columns titled, ‘‘Once Upon A Time’’ which related countless stories of local lore and history  to generations of readers in our area. No one  individual had a better grasp on  the  issues  and shared history  that defined our  region  than Bill Stanley. He was also one of the most  dedicated public  servants of his  time. He  served  two  terms  in  the Connecticut State  Senate and ran, albeit unsuccessfully, for the  Congressional  seat  I am honored  to hold  today. While his career as an elected politician  may have ended early on, his service to his  fellow man continued until the day he died. Bill  was active  in a number of causes,  raising  money and supporting William Backus Hospital, Norwich Free Academy, St. Jude’s Common,  the Norwich Diocese and his beloved  Norwich Historical Society which he founded.  As everyone in Norwich knows, there wasn’t a  single major event in recent memory in which  Bill was not involved.  Along with his love of Norwich, it was his  love of history  that perhaps motivated Bill  most of all. He would regale countless school-  children and adults alike with tales of Benedict  Arnold and Samuel Huntington. Stanley even  gained national attention with his efforts  to  preserve the legacy of Huntington, who served  as President of  the Continental Congress.  While Stanley may have been ultimately unsuccessful in the effort to establish Huntington  as our Nation’s first President, he was able to  raise more than a $100,000 and public awareness about the importance of Huntington’s role  in American history.  Bill Stanley was an institution in the State of  Connecticut and his memory will live on in the  hearts and minds of the people he touched.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to his beloved wife Margaret,  his  children William,  Carol, and Mary, as well as his grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, I ask that all Members of the  House join me in honoring the life and legacy  of Bill Stanley.  HONORING THE HANNA BOYS  CENTER  HON. LYNN C. WOOLSEY  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 20, 2010  ",2010
744,116,2010-04-20,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize and honor Hanna Boys  Center, who has been providing a home and  education to students in Northern California for  60 years.  The school began as an experimental program for neglected and troubled boys in 1944  in Menlo Park, south of San Francisco. The 25  original students were  referred  to  the new  school by social service agencies and parish  priests. The demand quickly outweighed  the  physical  resources of  the small school and  after a very successful speaking tour, enough  funds were raised to purchase 157 acres in  the Sonoma Valley, the school’s home today.  By  1949,  classrooms,  an  administration  building, a chapel, gymnasium, swimming pool  and one residence hall had been completed.  The first students entered the Sonoma Valley  campus by the end of that year. Today 109  boys ages 13 to 18 call the campus home.  Although Hanna  students  come  to  the  school from throughout the country, many are  from my Congressional district. Many are from  troubled homes.  There is a fully accredited high school on  campus and all students can participate  in  woodshop, choir, soccer, baseball, track and  basketball. Football  is  provided  at  nearby  Sonoma Valley High School.  Thirty-four Hanna graduates are currently  serving in the military. Graduates include very  successful businessmen and civic leaders or  simply men who live quiet lives of contribution  and contentment.  Only three directors have piloted the school  in  its 60  year history,  founder Monsignor  O’Connor  for  23  years,  Father  James  Pulskamp for 12 years and Father John Crews  for the past 25 years, a testament itself to the  loyalty the school inspires.  Madam  Speaker,  Hanna  Boys  Center  changes lives. It has been a stabilizing influence on hundreds of young men who have  passed through its doors. It is therefore appropriate to honor the school for 60 years of dedicated service to our community.  f  U.S.-ISRAEL  TANT ON  ENCE DAY  FRIENDSHIP  IMPORISRAEL’S  INDEPENDHON.

749,1,2010-04-28,Ms.  SPEIER.," Mr.  Speaker,  as  I  watched yesterday’s Senate investigations subcommittee hearing, I was disappointed to discover it was not just  the greedy, irresponsible, and likely illegal  actions  of  some  of Goldman  Sachs’ more dubious employees that  were the center of attention. In fact,  the useless and dangerous financial instruments  known  as  synthetic  collateralized  debt  obligations,  or  CDOs, shared the spotlight as well.  Fabrice Tourre, one of Goldman’s  hotshot young stars who created and  sold  these  so-called  investments  to  Goldman’s clients, testified yesterday  that they were, quote, ‘‘things which  had no purpose,’’ and likened them to  Frankenstein’s monster. Sadly, he’s  right. These CDOs did nothing for our  economy and spread billions of dollars  in toxic assets, heightened speculation,  and added dangerous risk to our financial system that ultimately was borne  by the U.S. taxpayers.  Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and others reaped millions of dollars in bonuses even as the economy was crashing. These synthetic CDOs were synthetic garbage.  Unscrupulous  individuals  on Wall Street  worsened the financial crisis by creating garbage, selling it and betting against it. Oh, they  drove away with a garbage truck full of cash.  Let’s ban the creation and sale of them, and  prevent this from ever happening again.  f  AMERICANS ABROAD FACE  BANKING ROADBLOCKS  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, Americans living abroad continue to face unnecessary roadblocks  not only to U.S. banks, but increasingly at foreign banks as well. The requests from expats continue to come in  at a startling rate.  I want  to  thank Congresswoman  CAROLYNMALONEY for helping to bring  these banking roadblocks to the attention of the Treasury Department. We  are hoping that the Financial Services  Committee will soon hold hearings to  review current U.S. banking laws and  regulations that may prevent Americans  living overseas  from accessing  U.S. banking services.  International  Herald  Tribune  reporter Brian Knowlton recently highlighted that ‘‘amid mounting frustration over taxation and banking problems, small but growing numbers of  overseas Americans  are  taking  the  weighty step of renouncing their citizenship.’’  I encourage  the Financial  Services Committee to read Knowlton’s  article and schedule a hearing in the  very near future.  In conclusion, God bless our troops  and we will never  forget September  11th in the Global War on Terrorism.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

751,8,2010-04-28,Mr. BILBRAY.," I would like to thank  the coauthor of the bill, Mr. MURPHY,  and especially Chairman TOWNS and  Ranking Member ISSAfor bringing this  item up today. I appreciate the ability  to address it.  Mr. Speaker,  all  across America,  Americans are speaking out loudly. In  fact, there’s a degree of dismay  for  those of us in Washington when we go  home to see the outrage that is coming  out from the average taxpayer in this  country. I think we are just now really  realizing that there is a justification  for the outrage and the strong feelings.  Basically, as we tell the American people that they must give more and that  we are going to take more, they are  saying, No way. You have not earned  the right to be trusted with our tax  money.  Mr. MURPHYand I have been able to  identify one of those items that the  American people have been calling for  for a long time. How do we explain to  our constituents that we are giving  away  inappropriately twice as much  money as we spend to defend their  neighborhoods from terrorism when it  comes to homeland security? How do  we have the gall to ask them to trust  us with more money when we have this  kind  of mismanagement  of  public  funds—not just recently, but historically. And I think this is one place we  can, in a bipartisan effort, admit that  Washington needs to be more responsible, needs to do more and, frankly,  demand more from Washington and the  bureaucracy and less from the American people when it comes to accountability.  We’re talking about the fact that we  need now to lower the thresholds of reporting so the problem can be more  transparent. We need  to make  sure  that we hold those who are trusted in  the Departments with the American  taxpayers’ money to do more, report  more, and be more accountable for the  mismanagement of those funds. Frankly, we need to demand more recovery of  the money when we detect these funds  are being misappropriated.  Frankly, right now, I think the outrage across this country is something  that is healthy for all of us—Democrats, Republicans, Independents. We  should not be asking, Why are the  American people so outraged? We’re  saying, Why didn’t we realize this earlier and sooner so that that outrage did  not just show up in screaming town  hall meetings and protests around this  country?  I want to thank Mr. MURPHYfor joining with me at showing the American  people there are some of us that hear it  loud and clear. We do not blame the  American people  for being outraged.  We blame ourselves and  the Washington establishment for not addressing this issue before and not moving  forward.  So I, again, thank the chairman and  the ranking member. I thank my coauthor on this. And I think, Mr. Speaker, this is more than just money. We’re  talking about we have  taken hard-  earned  resources  from  hardworking  Americans and we have been trusted in  the past; and we have violated that  trust.  ",2010

754,8,2010-04-28,Mr. BILBRAY., This bill will start on  a pattern towards earning the trust  back from the American people. But we  do not have a right to ask them to  trust us with more money until we  prove to them that we can correct this  problem and take care of the money  that we have already been endowed  with. So I ask that this body pass this  bill and address it. It’s a small step in  the direction that America has asked  us to go to for far too long.  ,2010
755,8,2010-04-28,Mr. TOWNS.," I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  The Improper Payments Elimination  and Recovery Act, H.R. 3393, provides  the Federal Government with the tools  needed to prevent mistakes and overpayments in the first place and recover  funds that are paid in error. That’s the  reason why I’d like to salute Congressman ISSA of California, Congressman  BILBRAY, and of course Congressman  PLATTSand Congressman MURPHY for  the outstanding  job that they have  done on this legislation.  The bill we are considering today  takes the next step and makes Federal  agencies more accountable for properly  managing taxpayers’ funds. The bill requires agencies to develop and report  corrective action plans based on measured error rates and creates incentives  for meeting their goals and penalties  for failure to meet their goals. Importantly, the bill also gives the agencies  the means to go after the funds that  they have overpaid, which will make  the taxpayers, agencies, programs, and  activities which relied on those appropriations whole.  We are living in a time, Mr. Speaker,  when our government is under extreme  fiscal demands, and we need to do everything possible to ensure that every  tax dollar goes to where it is needed.  To ensure this takes place, we need to  provide our Federal agencies with the  tools to properly manage their spending. We also need to give the agencies  the ability to follow through with their  oversight and provide them with the  ability to recover erroneous payments.  However, we cannot stop there. We  must do everything that we can to ensure that Federal agencies who make  improper payments  fix  the problem  that allows the improper payments to  take place. At the end of the day, this  bill amends  current  law  to  require  more accountability through reports,  plans, definitions, clarification of responsibility, allocation of  funds, and  oversight.  Again, I would like to thank my colleagues,  Representatives  BILBRAY, ISSA, and others, for working  together in a truly, truly bipartisan  manner to get this piece of important  legislation to the House floor. H.R. 3393  is a commonsense, good government  bill, and I encourage my colleagues to  join me in supporting it.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010
756,8,2010-04-28,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I’d like to  share with you something that happened this morning. I was on C–SPAN  and a woman named Betty called in  and was very concerned that we were  not working on a bipartisan basis; that  there was no consensus or compromise;  that we were paralyzed. It’s sometimes  hard to answer somebody on the other  end of a telephone line, but I would  like to today take note that this is an  example of the dozens of times every  week that we come together, the chairman and myself, members of the committee, and we find things we can agree  on that are good for America, the common good, and they will not usually be  noted.  So today I would hope that we all  note that—and for Betty who called in  this morning—that in fact this is an  example where we  can  find  compromise. We can find a win-win for the  American people. I would hope that we  would do more of it. Chairman TOWNS  has been good at looking for those examples, and I pledge to be better at  looking for opportunities like this. I’d  like to,  lastly, thank Leader HOYER  and Leader BOEHNER for the help they  gave us in expediting this to the floor.

757,15,2010-04-28,Ms. FOXX.,"  I  thank my colleague  from New York for yielding time.  Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned  that the underlying bill we have before  us  today  is  being  brought  forward  under a structured rule, adding to the  record number of structured and closed  rules the Democrats have arbitrarily  used since they have been in the majority.  Today, the Democrats in charge have  rejected nine amendments offered by  their colleagues, and they have refused  to allow these amendments to be debated and for their colleagues’ voices  to be heard. Democrats have chosen to  stifle and control the debate today,  presenting the Congress with another  structured rule, eliminating the ability  of both the Republicans and the Democrats to offer important amendments  affecting their constituents.  After promising to have the most  honest and open Congress in history,  why has the Speaker consistently gone  back on her word? Why are the Democrats in charge shutting off debate and  silencing their colleagues on both sides  of the aisle? Are they afraid of debate?  Are  they protecting  their Members  from tough votes?  Regardless  of  their motives,  one  thing is clear: The Democrats in charge  are doing the American people an injustice by refusing to allow their Representatives to offer their amendments  on  the  floor of  the people’s House.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this structured rule.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010
758,15,2010-04-28,Ms. SLAUGHTER.,"  I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I need to point out to  the gentlewoman that there were 26  amendments offered on this bill. Only  one was a Republican amendment. Ten  amendments were not allowed, but the  Republican amendment was. We are  not afraid of debate. We are not afraid  of discussion. As a matter of fact, I am  somewhat taken aback by your calling  for a ‘‘no’’ vote on this rule given that  this  legislation  passed  unanimously  out of the committee.  I have no further requests for time,  so I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010
759,15,2010-04-28,Ms. FOXX.,"  I appreciate  the comments of the gentlewoman from New  York.  Mr. Speaker, I do realize that the bill  passed out of committee unanimously,  and I am sure it is going to receive  strong support on the  floor. Yet we  know that providing protection for our  Nation is one of the few jobs specifically assigned to the Federal Government by the U.S. Constitution. Indeed,  the Federal Government  is the only  level of government that can provide  for the defense of this Nation. However,  based on the policies of this administration and the Democrats in charge,  who have slashed defense spending even  in the midst of ongoing terror threats,  only to increase domestic spending and  our national debt, you would never  know this was true.  I am very concerned about the backward spending priorities of this administration  and  of  the Democrats  in  charge. While the defense budget proposed by the administration  is  flat,  growing only by 1 percent last year,  automatic spending grew by $77 billion,  or 5 percent. Military spending represents less than one-fifth of the Federal budget and approximately half of  the average level of defense spending  during the Cold War as a percentage of  our  economy. Meanwhile, Medicare,  Medicaid, Social Security,  and  the  President’s new health care takeover  are on course to consume the entire  Federal budget, including defense. According to the Heritage Foundation,  under current projections,  it  is expected that the Federal Government  will spend more on interest payments  for the national debt than on defense  by the year 2015, if not sooner.  The Obama administration’s recently  released Nuclear Posture Review and  New START agreement will weaken  national security, and it will make our  Nation less safe. It will cause the U.S.  to fall dangerously behind at a time  when other countries are seeking to  strengthen and to develop their own  nuclear weapons. The President seems  to  believe  that  the  power  of New  START’s example will  somehow encourage Iran and North Korea to surrender their ambitions, but there is no  evidence to believe this is the case.  Since the end of the Cold War, these  countries have only increased their attempts to gain nuclear weapons even as  the U.S. and Russia have been reducing  their supplies.  What would do far more good is a  loud and clear declaration that the  U.S. and Russia will stop Iran from  gaining a nuclear military capability  by whatever means  necessary. The  NPR references existing treaties that  our enemies disregard and treaties that  have yet to be negotiated, which will  take years  of  diplomatic  effort  to  achieve but will do  little  to make  America more secure.  The  threat  to  international  nonproliferation is a nuclear Iran, not the  U.S. nuclear arsenal. Nuclear weapons  are an inevitable truth in our modern-  day world, so, unfortunately, they are  essential to our national survival. As  long as they exist, we must have the  world’s most effective nuclear arsenal  and possess a missile defense system to  protect ourselves against any actor  that employs nuclear weapons. This is  necessary in order to comply with the  Constitution’s requirements to provide  for our common defense.  The NPR signifies that the Obama  administration plans to neglect this responsibility. The administration’s NPR  provides many carrots but few sticks.  It commits the U.S. to unilateral disarmament while hoping that this will  give incentives to other nations to do  the same, which it will not. It leaves  the U.S. with no deterrent against  rogue nations, such as North Korea and  Iran, which continue to develop nuclear arsenals and to assert they will  use nuclear weapons if they so much as  feel threatened by the U.S.  A ‘‘nuclear zero,’’ which the Obama  administration talks eloquently about,  cannot be achieved unilaterally or even  bilaterally. It will require many countries to make the strategic decision  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:38 Apr 29, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K28AP7.022 H28APPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 C L B Y K 8 K S D n o l l e w e s e c i r p c         ",2010

The panel members all  worked very hard on this, and we appreciate that.  We obviously want to extend our appreciation to the incredible members of  the staff of the committee and the  panel. I want to thank Andrew Hunter,  who did a  tremendous  job on  this;  Cathy  Garman,  who  particularly  worked very hard on the issues regarding  labor  relations; Jenness Simler,  who was an all-star on last year’s bill  and once again proved her impeccable  credentials;  Zach  Steacy;  Jennifer  Kohl; Paul Arcangeli, who is our brand-  new  staff  director;  Bob  Simmons;  Kevin Gates; Mary Kate Cunningham;  Debra Wada; Megan Howard; Matt Bell,  who worked very tirelessly on this in  my office, and I appreciate his excellent efforts; Phil MacNaughton; and  Lara Battles. And if there are any others, I apologize for that, but there was  extraordinary work.  Mr. Chairman, did you want to add  anything during general debate?  ",2010
764,22,2010-04-28,Mr. SKELTON.," No. I appreciate the  gentleman  from New Jersey.  I have  nothing  further to add, except that  hopefully this bill will receive a unanimous vote at a later moment.  ",2010
765,22,2010-04-28,Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida.," Thank  you, Mr. Chair, for your leadership and hard  work on defense acquisition and making sure  that our defense industrial base is working for  the national defense and not for profits.  However, there is a serious problem that minority, women and veteran companies are not  well represented in the contracting of defense  systems and these groups need to be made  more of a priority.  The Department of Defense spends billions  of  taxpayer dollars each year, but minority,  women, and veteran-owned businesses are  not getting  to participate.  I often use my  grandma’s sweet potato pie as an example.  We all pay for the ingredients and we should  all get a slice. But they can’t even get a sliver.  These same big companies keep getting all  the contracts and make little effort to include  smaller companies. This is completely unacceptable.  The Defense Department doesn’t need  to  look any further than the Department of Transportation in seeking a model for including minority participation. The DOT has a strong program for inclusion and I would encourage the  Department of Defense to ensure that they develop a system that included minority, women,  and  veteran-owned businesses. These are  their tax dollars we are spending and they deserve to be at the table.  I am pleased to see that Section 401 of the  bill expands the industrial base by identifying  non-traditional suppliers and using  tools and  resources available within the Federal Government and in the private sector.  This legislation is a good vehicle to make  sure that Congress and the Department of Defense work to minimize discrimination and include all companies in the defense of our nation.  Small and minority businesses are the backbone of our economy. We need to make sure  all companies have an opportunity  to contribute to our national defense.  ",2010
766,22,2010-04-28,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Chairman, I want to  thank Chairman SKELTONand Ranking Member MCKEON for their efforts in crafting this important, bi-partisan bill to reform the acquisition system of the Department of Defense. I  would also like to commend Congressmen ANDREWSand CONAWAY for their leadership and  for their many vital contributions to the legislation.  Reports of waste,  fraud and abuse  in  the  DoD acquisition system have been the source  of great concern for Members of Congress for  many  years. As a  result, a  congressional  panel was established  to carry out a comprehensive review of the DoD acquisition system. Led by Representatives ANDREWS and  CONAWAY, this panel held more than a dozen  hearings exploring a broad  range of  issues  within  the acquisition system. Their  findings  and recommendations resulted in a report that  is the basis of the IMPROVE Acquisition Act  of 2010.  The IMPROVE Act is designed to overhaul  the entire defense acquisition system.  It requires DoD  to  introduce effective accountability measures into its requirements process  to create an acquisition system with clear objectives  and meaningful  consequences  for  success or failure. Not only will the bill encourage the development and deployment of improved financial management techniques within the DoD, it will also enhance competition  and increase access to more innovative technology.  As our Nation struggles through these difficult economic times, this common sense initiative will both strengthen our defense and  save money for the taxpayer. I commend the  members of House Armed Services Committee for their efforts and encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.  ",2010

775,36,2010-04-28,Mr. QUIGLEY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  today in strong support of H.R. 5013,  and I want to commend Mr. ANDREWS  and all of his colleagues who have  worked so diligently on this important  piece of legislation.  I have offered an amendment, along  with  Congresswoman GIFFORDS and  Congressman BARTLETT, which seeks to  make the Department of Defense more  energy efficient. This goal  is absolutely essential to improving defense  acquisition.  The Department of Defense accounts  for 80 percent of the U.S. Government’s  energy consumption, including 330,000  barrels of oil each day. Just petroleum  products cost the DOD $13 billion per  year. Passing my amendment will save  money and will conserve energy by including energy efficiency as a metric in  performance assessment of defense acquisitions. It will also make weapon  systems more energy efficient, which is  a critical reform that can save lives.  In Afghanistan,  consider  that  the  Marines alone consume 800,000 gallons  of fuel each day. These 800,000 gallons  of fuel must cross from Pakistan into  Afghanistan through a lawless border  region. During this 400-mile trip from  Karachi, convoys are extremely vulnerable  to  IEDs,  but  energy-efficient  weapons  systems  reduces  fuel  use,  which reduces the number of convoys,  which reduces the number of troops in  harm’s way.  I urge you to support my amendment  and to support energy efficiency in the  defense acquisition process, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  ",2010

778,36,2010-04-28,Mr. ANDREWS., I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  (Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ,2010
779,36,2010-04-28,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  would like to thank Mr. QUIGLEYfor offering this amendment, as well as Ms.  GIFFORDSand Mr. BARTLETT for their  joint authorship of this amendment.  As I stated earlier, the basic mechanism in this bill is to provide performance criteria for the purchasing organizations within the Department of Defense. This amendment says that one  criterion may  be  energy-efficiency  standards in the purchasing.  Now, what does this mean?  It means that the procurement organization should get the very best deal  from the point of view of the servicemember as well as of the taxpayer and  that one of the factors that should be  taken  into  account  is  energy  efficiency. For example, if under this bill  the procurement organization is purchasing landscaping services and if, all  other things being equal for the quality  of  the  landscaping  services and  the  price, one of the organizations uses  more energy-efficient  lawnmowers or  other gardening machines, that purchase would  be  favored under  this  mechanism to encourage but not to require energy efficiency.  This goes to a much broader question  in our country that obviously involves  the fact that we are buying nearly $300  billion a year worth of imported oil  from countries around the world which  may or may not be friendly to us.  The largest consumer of energy in  the United States’ economy is the Department of Defense. Commendably,  the Department under Republican and  Democratic administrations has adopted, as a matter of policy, a methodical  increase in the amount of renewable  energy the Department is using. One of  the ways it can reduce consumption toward that goal is by implementing energy efficiency.  The amendment the gentleman from  Illinois  is  offering  is  entirely  consistent with that purpose because what  it does is integrates into the procurement decisionmaking process a set of  ideas which says that the procurement  organization will look at the energy-efficiency ideas of a given competitor for  a given contract.  We support this amendment because  we believe it will save the taxpayers  money, that it will add value to our efforts to protect the environment, and  that it will provide inducements to the  ability to promote renewable energy,  so we would urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.  Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of  my time to one of the coauthors of the  amendment, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BARTLETT).  ",2010

I am very pleased to join my colleagues Congressman QUIGLEYand Congresswoman GIFFORDS in offering this  amendment. This amendment provides  the Department of Defense the full support of Congress to use energy efficiency as a key tool toward improving  our national security and toward providing more value to taxpayers for our  defense dollars. This amendment will  send an important and strong signal to  defense contractors that their bids will  be more competitive if their products  and services will use less energy.  I urge the support of this bill. I am  very pleased that, among all of the institutions in our country, our Defense  Department is the most aggressive in  pursuing good energy policies. We and  the world face a huge crisis in energy,  so I am pleased that our Defense Department  is  leading the way  in our  country. I am very pleased to be here  to support this good amendment and a  really good bill.  ",2010

I do want to express a concern, however, that sometimes getting the best  value may mean paying more for a superior product or service, especially  when it comes to the complex technological requirements of the equipment  of our men and women in the American  Armed Forces. There may be  legitimate cases where the cost, the price of  a good or service,  is  less  important  than other factors. Probably a good example of that is pretty recently the acquisition of MRAPs and body armor  that certainly have saved the lives of  our courageous troops.  A concern that I think we need to  weigh here is just that this may be a  little premature, this specific amendment, because a similar amendment  was included in the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act. During the  conference, a provision was added to  that language that requires the Government Accountability Office to do a  study to determine how often it occurs  that cost is not the overriding factor or  the primary factor. That study is due  back to us in October of this year. It  seems like it would be appropriate to  get that knowledge base from GAO before going  further with another  requirement at this time.  So I don’t oppose the intent of the  sponsor of the amendment. We are certainly in agreement that we want to  get the best value, but just believe it  may be helpful to wait for GAO to complete its work.  ",2010
789,43,2010-04-28,Mr. GRAYSON.," I yield myself the  balance of my time, and I thank my  colleague for making these points. I’d  like to respond to them briefly.  With regard to the first point, I want  to make it clear that within the literal  wording of this amendment no agency  is ever required to choose the least-  cost product. All that this amendment  says is that in the evaluation scheme,  in order to encourage people who are  offerers to think about how to save  money for DOD, we make the commitment in general, overall, that cost or  price will be considered at  least as  much as all the other  factors combined.  In addition to that, we allow the  head of the agency to suspend the rule  at will, without any condition or limitation in the statute. The head of the  agency can determine  that  for any  item, including mission-critical items,  cost or price can be 40 percent, 30 percent, 10 percent, even 5 percent of the  evaluation factors.  So I think that although the gentleman’s point  is well taken, that we  should not ever bind the hands of the  DOD when DOD needs to get items that  may not be the low cost item, this is  an amendment that does not do that.  This amendment simply says that, in  general, under ordinary circumstances,  particularly  in buying volume commodities  that are  identical  to each  other, we should in fact make 50 percent of the consideration cost or price.  Now, I’ve seen procurements where,  for instance, a commodity like gasoline is being bought by DOD and somehow they determine that two-thirds of  the evaluation factor should be something other than cost or price. Sometimes we waste billions of dollars on  account of decisions like that.  So I think that this is a rule that  really needs to take place. I understand  the gentleman’s point concerning the  study that’s ongoing; but, frankly, I  think that if we do this now, we’ll save  money now. If we do this later, we’ll  save  less money.  I’d rather see the  money saved now, particularly when  we have such great needs abroad and  our defense budget is so great. I think  that this simple rule, this commonsense rule, will help to save billions almost immediately as soon as it’s implemented. I thank the gentleman for  his comments.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2010

In order to create jobs, level the playing  field  for  domestic  manufacturers,  and  strengthen economic recovery, it is the sense  of Congress that the Department of Defense  should—  (1)  ensure  full  contractor  and  subcontractor compliance with the Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C. 2533a) and the Buy American  Act (41 U.S.C. 10a et seq.); and  (2) not procure products made by manufacturers  in  the United States  that violate  labor standards as defined under the laws of  the United States.

Let me begin by taking this opportunity to thank Chairman SKELTONand  Ranking Member MCKEON as well as  Chairman ANDREWSand Ranking Memfor their  leadership on  the underlying bill and for their commitment  to  our  Nation’s  Armed  Forces.  The amendment before us today is  one of great importance that aims to  ensure a level playing field for domestic manufacturers with  the hope of  strengthening our economic recovery  through the defense acquisition process. My amendment declares that it is  the sense of Congress that the Department of Defense  should ensure  full  compliance throughout the acquisition  process with the Berry Amendment and  the Buy American Act. Further, the  amendment declares the sense of Congress that the Department of Defense  not procure products made by domestic  manufacturers that fail to comply with  the labor standards that are set by the  laws established by Congress.  Both the Buy American Act and the  Berry Amendment are intended to benefit American  industry and workers.

Arizona has a window  seat to an illegal invasion and on the  escalating and violent drug war  in  Mexico that has put American  lives  and society at risk.  ‘‘President Obama  calls Arizona’s  tough new law ‘irresponsible’ and ‘misguided.’ But it wouldn’t be necessary if  the Federal Government  fulfilled  its  responsibilities to secure the border.  We are a Nation of immigrants—legal  immigrants—but we are also a Nation  of laws that 70 percent of Arizonans  and most Americans want to see enforced.

800,50,2010-04-28,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker,  this  body took an important step today by  passing  the  IMPROVE Acquisitions  Act, which will bring badly needed reforms to the defense procurement process. The Pentagon, of course, is legendary  for bureaucratic  inefficiency,  cost overruns, and even outright corruption in its purchasing practices. Remember the $640 toilet seat that the  Navy bought back  in the 1980s? Remember our  soldiers  in  Iraq  sifting  through  scrap  heaps  for makeshift  body armor?  b1600  For too long, Mr. Speaker, the Pentagon has been the irresponsible teenager who gets a ridiculously generous  allowance, loses part of it, and then  spends the rest on junk food. With this  new bill, though, mom and dad will  begin to exercise some oversight over  that allowance. Given the size of the  DOD budget and the nature of its mission, it is about time. It’s remarkable  that up until now, there’s been no effective performance metric system to  assure that taxpayers are getting value  for their defense dollars.  We’re  living  through a  time, Mr.  Speaker, when nearly every American  family is tightening its belt and making sure that every dollar it spends is  on something it truly needs. We owe it  to these families to ensure that the  government agency charged with keeping them safe is doing the same.  As pleased as I am with the passage  of the IMPROVE Act, I can’t help but  think that we are nibbling around the  edges of a much, much larger problem.  The issue is not just a managerial one  of how the Pentagon goes about its acquisitions. The more significant matter  is the Nation’s overall defense policy  and budget priorities. For example, we  continue to spend billions of dollars  every year on sacred cow weapons systems that were designed for a bygone  era.  Finally, last year, we cut off funding  for the F–22 Raptor, designed to neutralize the next generation of Soviet  planes. I guess it took almost 20 years  to figure out there has been no generation of Soviet plane because there’s  been  no  generation  of  the  Soviet  Union. But we’re still throwing money  at the V–22 Osprey, a plane so wasteful  and unnecessary that even former Vice  President Cheney was trying to kill it  as far back as the late 1980s when he  was Secretary of Defense. According to  our analysis at the Congressional Progressive Caucus, we can save $60 billion, at least, a year by eliminating  such Cold War relics.  And, Mr. Speaker, then there’s the  biggest ticket item of all, purportedly  keeping us safe but actually spending  us into bankruptcy and undermining  our national security interests. I’m referring to the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Every day, at a predicted price tag of around $1 trillion,  we are sending American soldiers to die  for a strategy that is a moral outrage  and a practical failure. For a fraction  of the cost, we could take a smarter approach by expanding poor countries’  capacity to provide for their own people. That means more resources for democracy  promotion,  physical  infrastructure, human capital development,  et cetera, et cetera. That would be the  way to fight terrorism—with compassion, not aggression; using diplomacy,  not destruction; by  investing, rather  than invading.  So let’s do more than streamline procurement, because, Mr. Speaker, if we  overhaul the way we go about protecting America and we redefine what  it means to provide for the common defense as the Constitution instructs us  to do, we will do the right thing, and  the right thing will be to start by  bringing our troops home.  f  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Ms.  CHU).

804,57,2010-04-28,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," You bring up  a very, very pertinent point, which is,  this year in America, as of the last  number  I  saw, we were  training a  whopping  total of  600 primary care  physicians.  ",2010
805,57,2010-04-28,Mr. AKIN., You’re  saying we  are  training  this year  600 primary care  physicians?  ,2010
806,57,2010-04-28,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," This is for a  country with 300 million people in it.  Also, 15 percent of the practicing physicians in America today are over 65,  and you know what they’re going to do  when this ObamaCare plan hits.  I’ve studied the Massachusetts plan  in detail. It’s a little different than  what we did in Tennessee. What they  did there was to impose the mandates  like they have in this plan. The idea  was to spread the costs over more people. Therefore, we were going to hold  the costs down, and we’d have fewer  people going to the emergency rooms.  So what’s going on in Massachusetts?  This is the fourth year that they’ve  had it. It was initiated in 2006, and it’s  like in Tennessee. You can’t spend $8  billion and not help some people. You  do. There is no question about that. No  one is arguing that point. In Massachusetts, with the billions of dollars that  have been spent, you are going to help  some  folks because they’ve  included  another 400,000-plus people. What the  Governor  is  now  doing  is  recommending that almost all of the private  plans’ premiums be capped.  Why are they going up faster than  they thought they would?  Well, they’ve added more people to  the rolls that they’re not paying the  costs of, and the  idea was we were  going to get people out to primary care  doctors and that we were going to cut  the number of people who would be  going to the emergency rooms.  Well, guess what? That didn’t happen. Why?  As the gentleman from Pennsylvania  just pointed out, Mr. THOMPSON, who is  going to see you? That is the problem  with this whole plan. The fallacy is:  Who is going to see these patients?  Let me just make one final point.  ",2010
807,57,2010-04-28,Mr. AKIN.," I don’t want you to make  just a final point, but I’d like you to  answer this question:  The Democrat Governor  of  Tennessee, before  this bill was passed,  called this the mother of all unfunded  mandates. In other words, one thing  State legislators hate is when we up  here pass  some piece of  legislation  which busts their budgets. Then they  have to take the political hit for the  fact that we’re  fiscally  irresponsible  and legislatively irresponsible.  Now, is this a budget buster for a  State?  ",2010
808,57,2010-04-28,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," There is no  question. In Tennessee, it’s over $1 billion.  The problem with it is that people  from a patient standpoint don’t understand that, if I’ve got a card, I’ve got  health  insurance coverage. Not necessarily. That’s what happened with  Senator NELSON in Nebraska. He exempted Nebraska. Then, of course, the  final bill that was passed put everybody  in, and the States were made  whole for the first 3 or 4 years of this  plan.  ",2010
809,57,2010-04-28,Mr. AKIN., Was that the cornhusker  kickback?  ,2010
810,57,2010-04-28,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," That was the  kickback. Exactly.  Eventually what happens is that it  will be an unfunded mandate for the  States. They see it coming. They get  it. We have a gubernatorial election  right now in Tennessee, and it’s a hot  topic. Who is going to pay this unfunded mandate? We’ve dealt with it  for so long.  You’re right. This was a fiscally conservative Democratic Governor who  understood. He got it. He had to deal  with it, and he asked them not to do  that, not to pass this bill. He was very  much against it.  ",2010
811,57,2010-04-28,Mr. AKIN.," Wow.  We’ve been joined by a good friend of  mine, Congressman LAMBORN.  Welcome to the discussion. We’re just  taking a look at the fact that, you  know, you’d think logically: What in  the world are these Congressmen doing,  standing on the  floor, railing about  some bill that has already been passed?  Well, part of the reason is there was  some truth  in what Speaker PELOSI  said, which is that you’ve got to pass  the bill to find out what’s in it. We’re  still discovering all kinds of surprises.  In a way, that’s what we’ve been talking  about  tonight—things  that  the  Obama accountants  in the Medicare/  Medicaid group are analyzing in the  bill. They’re saying, Whoops. It’s not  going to bend the cost curve down; it’s  going to bend the cost curve up, so it’s  going to be more expensive. Uh-oh, it’s  going to cost jobs.  Anyway, please join us.  ",2010
812,57,2010-04-28,Mr. LAMBORN.," Well,  thank you.  This is a great discussion that you all  are having. Thanks for letting me participate for a few minutes.  You raised a really good point, which  is that this report has shown that this  is going to be a lot more expensive,  that it’s going to raise taxes, that it’s  going to raise health  insurance premiums, that it’s going to make people  drop out of the existing coverage they  have. They will be thrown into the government plan. This is a CMS report,  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services, which is nonpartisan and objective.  What really is outrageous about this  report, Representative AKIN,  is  that  they had it over at DHS before we ever  had the final vote on ObamaCare. They  were sitting on it. Their language now  is, Oh, we didn’t want to influence the  debate.  Isn’t that what a report is all about?  b1700  ",2010
813,57,2010-04-28,Mr. AKIN.," Influence the debate with  any facts? My goodness, people might  not vote for this thing.  ",2010
814,57,2010-04-28,Mr. LAMBORN.," These are vital facts  to have. It really is a lot more expensive. And it is going to raise taxes and  throw people out of the insurance they  have now than what the administration was claiming. So if we had known  this maybe it wouldn’t have passed by  the four or five votes that it passed by.  Maybe  it would have  failed, and we  would have been on a whole different  trajectory right now if they had been  open and honest about this report that  the American people and us as their  Representatives should have had access  to.  ",2010
815,57,2010-04-28,Mr. AKIN.," That is really frustrating,  isn’t  it,  to basically give people a  mushroom treatment. You keep them  in the dark, smother them in some sort  of a fertilizing material, and we tell  them these things: if you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care  plan, you will be able to keep your  health care plan, period. No one will  take it away, no matter what. And yet  the report that you are talking about  makes it clear that this just flat is not  true. So it is a frustrating thing. And  in a sense, all of these things are falling out now, and it wasn’t so obvious  before.  My good friend from Louisiana, Congressman SCALISE, please join us.  ",2010
816,57,2010-04-28,Mr. SCALISE.," I thank the gentleman  from Missouri. And this latest smoking  gun that’s come out is just yet one  more example of why the American  people are so angry about what happened with this government takeover  of health care, with the way it was  rammed through, with all the broken  promises.  And you can go back to the very beginning when the President was a candidate. He said multiple times all of  these hearings would be on C–SPAN so  you could actually have transparency  and find out what’s going on. In fact,  none of that transparency happened.  None of those meetings were held on C–  SPAN. And now we see this document  that comes out conveniently  just  2  weeks, 3 weeks after the vote that  barely passed by three votes that confirms what we were saying, that this  would actually raise the costs of health  care for most American families at a  time when we should be lowering the  cost of health care, like our bill did  that we filed that actually would have  addressed the real problems in health  care. But in fact their bill does the opposite, and now it’s confirmed that.  What I really want to  find out  is  when  did  the  administration know  about this report? Was this report produced by CMS, a Federal agency, before the vote and then covered up, literally held under wraps so that this  couldn’t become public until after the  vote, when the American people would  once again see that yet another promise by this administration on health  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:17 Apr 29, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K28AP7.108 H28APPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 C L B Y K 8 K S D n o l l e w e s e c i r p c         ",2010
817,64,2010-04-28,Ms. SPEIER.," I thank the gentlelady  from Ohio. You referenced the number  of people in the Department of Justice  that are tasked with doing the investigations. It was very interesting this  week when we had the hearing on Lehman Brothers and Mary Schapiro spoke  to their ability to do their job when  they only had 24 staff members in that  specific division to do investigations of  all of the Wall Street firms.  If you ill-equip your very agencies to  do the job, they won’t be able to do the  job. Between 2003 and 2007 under the  Bush administration with Christopher  Cox as the head of the SEC, you will  not be surprised to know that there  was an 80 percent reduction in enforcement actions at the SEC and 60 percent  reduction in disgorgement actions at  the SEC.  So no surprise that we had an SEC  that was ill-equipped, and also a different perspective. It was not there to  protect the American people but to  allow business  to  flourish. And  the  business that flourished was much like  what Goldman Sachs was doing where  they actually put AIG in some of these  synthetic  collateralized debt obligations that they knew were going to  fail.  Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs  shorted Lehman Brothers and helped  make sure it did come down. It was reportedly  in many of the e-mails at  Goldman Sachs by  employees when  they were communicating with some of  their clients that they said that they  were no  longer going to support or  back up Bear Stearns, and then all of a  sudden Bear Stearns went down.  We now have China suing Goldman  Sachs over bad derivative deals. We  have Germany, France, and the U.K.;  and God knows, what did they do with  Greece? Much  like Enron, Goldman  Sachs went to Greece and created a  way by which they could take some of  their debts off their balance sheet so  they could get support from the EU,  and in the course of doing so, hid much  of the debt. And now we all know what  has happened to Greece. We all know  what has happened to the stock market  just yesterday as a result of the rating  agencies taking the steps they did.  This company has no shame. This  company is willing to do any deal as  long as it makes them money.  ",2010

But  under current value and current dollars, a child born today, for being a  natural-born American citizen,  their  share of the national debt is $44,000.  That’s like here’s your mortgage, sign  here with your  little  ink  footprint  when you’re born, we’ll wheel you right  out of the delivery room and you’ve got  a $44,000 debt that you have to pay the  interest and  the principal on. That  same child born today, by the time  they start fifth grade in school, their  share of  the national debt will be  $88,000. That’s the difference between  the Obama budget and the budget that  we had coming into the Obama administration. That’s that kind of a burden  that I’m going to presume cross-references to the $300 a month that the  gentlelady from Minnesota has talked  about.  ",2010
823,71,2010-04-28,Mrs. BACHMANN.," Also, remember,  that’s  if  every American  is paying  taxes and paying the debt. But one  thing that we saw from this current filing of income tax is that 47 percent of  Americans paid no taxes. Now, that  doesn’t mean that 47 percent of Americans  are  deadbeats,  because  they  aren’t. Many Americans don’t have income because they’re senior citizens  living off of fixed assets. There are a  number of reasons. But still the number remains true, that 47 percent of  Americans aren’t paying the taxes. An  increasingly smaller group of people  are paying a larger share of the taxes.  And so the debt burden on particular  Americans will be especially egregious.  ",2010

I believe he counted 72 different programs that distribute  the wealth from taxpayers in America  to people who are sometimes taxpayers  but more often a greater share of them  are tax users. Of those programs, even  though we brought down some of the  welfare in the mid nineties, it didn’t  really reduce it so much as it produced  a temporary plateau; and then it was  built up again with a whole series of  programs that we can’t track.  Well, he has done  so. And  it’s a  chilling thing to see what happens to a  society that was a meritocracy, that  rewarded people for their work, that  now has become a welfare state.  One of his definitive  studies, Mr.  Speaker, was  this. He went  in and  looked at households that are headed  by high school dropouts, without regard  to  their  immigration  status;  whether they were legal, illegal, foreign or natural-born Americans, whatever their category might have been  with their immigration status, if they  headed households, and  the average  household, a family of four, and they  were a high school dropout, they would  draw down an average of $32,000 a year  in taxes in the whole collection of the  benefits that are there and they would  pay about $9,000 a year in taxes. They  would draw down 32, they would pay  about $9,000 a year in taxes. The net  cost to the taxpayer was $22,449 a year,  and that’s an average, and the average  sustained life of that household, Mr.  Rector calculated, was 50 years.  So the math comes out to about $1.5  million  to  subsidize  that household.  And we’ve got people here in this country that are arguing that we need to  open up our borders and bring in any  number of people because our economy  needs this labor and we need someone  to pay for the Social Security of the  baby boomers. Well, if they can’t sustain themselves here, if they’re undereducated, even though we have entrepreneurs that fit that category, that  are going to make millions of dollars  and create millions of jobs, on average  it  is a net cost to the taxpayer of  $22,449 a year, $1.5 million for the duration of that household, that’s a burden  on the taxpayers that is not a stimulation to the economy, it’s a drag and a  drain on the economy. And the argument that they are paying Social Security with the payroll tax and, therefore, that’s good for those of us that  are looking at retirement, members of  the baby boom generation, which I am  and Mrs. BACHMANN is not. That’s my  little pandering piece here, Mr. Speaker.  ",2010
825,71,2010-04-28,Mrs. BACHMANN.," If I could just add  with Robert Rector from the Heritage  Foundation, he also did a study on welfare and increasing use of welfare in  the United States. The trajectory that  we’re on with the growth in welfare is  also unsustainable. And we also recall  that  shortly after President Obama  came into office, one thing that he did  is he rescinded all of the welfare reform regulations that were put  into  place by the Republican Congress after  they won control in 1994. So all of the  reforms that actually got people off of  welfare and into working jobs and actually plateaued the cost of the welfare, now all of those restraints have  been taken off. We’re seeing a dramatic  increase in the trajectory in welfare  spending.  But something else that was interesting from Robert Rector, he said that  if an individual on the full panoply of  welfare benefits  leaves welfare, that  that individual would have to seek a  job paying in excess of $44,000 a year to  replace  the  welfare  benefits  that  they’re  receiving  from  the Federal  Government. That is the level of generosity of the welfare benefits that are  currently available to people  in the  United States. There are people in my  district that would love to be making  an income of $44,000 a year. And yet  that is what the United States is providing on average for welfare benefits  across the United States. Of course  there are exceptions to that, but that’s  on average. Again I would refer people,  Mr. Speaker, to the heritage Web site  and the work is by Robert Rector.  ",2010
826,71,2010-04-28,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Reclaiming my  time, I appreciate the gentlelady refreshing that point. I had actually forgotten that number. I remember it now  when you say it. $44,000. And now I  think in terms of, if you have all the  free time in the world to do whatever it  is you want to do and you have rent  subsidy and heat  subsidy and  food  stamps and the refundable child care  credit and the earned income tax credit.  ",2010
827,71,2010-04-28,Mrs. BACHMANN.," And you’ve got a  home mortgage, a home mortgage that  is  subsidized by  the  taxpayers. Because, remember, this was a part of the  problem with the amendments to the  Community Reinvestment Act in the  1990s, and it was this: An individual  could have no income, no assets, no  job. With all of that, you could still get  a mortgage just based on your welfare  benefits. This was a complete change in  the way mortgages were given out. And  welfare is inherently unstable.  So to think that a 30-year mortgage  is being given to someone on the basis  of  their welfare payments. We had  never done that before in the United  States. And so what we saw is a correlation with a very high rate of foreclosure. What inducement or incentive  is there for an individual to save up to  buy a house, save up for a down payment, be frugal, do what you need to do  to have a good credit score to get into  a house when if in fact because of the  Community Reinvestment Act, banks  were forced to not look at credit scores  essentially and to give mortgages to  people on the basis of their welfare  checks?  And a lot of these mortgages that  were given would give cash back to  people. Then people went out and took  home equity loans against their home  and they had virtually nothing in the  home. No wonder we’re in the problem  we’re in. If you change your banking  standards to ones that don’t even rank  up with a comic strip level of regulations, you’re going to get disastrous results. That’s what we’re in the middle  of living with now.  Unfortunately the bill that’s going  through the Senate  is  institutionalizing the worst aspects that there are  about government policy that led to  the financial meltdown.  ",2010

831,78,2010-04-28,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I wish to  say a few words about one of the Senate’s most senior Members but one of  the newest on this side of the aisle. I  have known Senator ARLEN for many years. I have worked with  him, learned from him, and admired  him. He is truly a legal scholar.  Anyone who has read his books—and  I have—knows Senator SPECTER’s life  has been a struggle. From his days as  the son of immigrants in Depression-  era Kansas to the treatment for HodgSPECTER  kin’s lymphoma, he has endured, while  working as a full-time Senator. He has  not had it easy, but he has fought hard.  I consider it a privilege to work with  ARLENSPECTER. He is a strong contributor to our caucus, a valuable Member  of this body and, most importantly, a  fine public servant for the people of  Pennsylvania.  It would not surprise anyone to learn  that over 25 years Senator SPECTERand  I have not always agreed on every  issue. But I have never seen another  Senator with a greater willingness to  work in a bipartisan manner, put people over party, and to encourage others  to search their hearts and to do what is  right.  Senator SPECTERhas fought to end  the partisanship in Washington as hard  as he has fought for his constituents in  Pennsylvania. He has often reminded  us, in key times, including right here  on the Senate floor, that we had to go  in a direction he thought was important. He would tell us about that, that  we were sent here to govern, not to  demagogue.  He has warned his former colleagues  on the other side of the aisle not to let  a strategy of obstructing obscure their  responsibility to govern. That is a message with particular relevance with the  issue before us this week. Without Senator SPECTER’s courage to reach across  the aisle, we would not have passed the  economic recovery plan that is pulling  our Nation out of recession and putting  people back to work. ARLENSPECTER  did not vote for it for political reasons;  he supported it because he saw what  the Great Depression did to his family.  It forced the Specters to move from  their home in Wichita to his aunt’s  home in Philadelphia. He did not want  to see it slip up again and fall into a  depression.  Senator SPECTER then came over to  our side of the aisle and helped us pass  the historic health care reform  law  that will help so many Americans afford to live healthier lives.

832,85,2010-04-28,Mr. LEVIN.," Now, throughout these  hearings we see a  lack of accountability. Executives of Washington Mutual make  the  reckless mortgage  loans—not held  accountable. Executives at Goldman Sachs and their company packaged many of these same  loans that were toxic securities and  then took a conflict-of-interest position on  it—no accountability. Regulators, credit rating agencies that were  supposed to check these excesses—no  accountability. In each case, the senior  leaders managed  to  avoid  responsibility for their contribution to a crisis  which has caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs or their homes  or their businesses.  Others may  fail to take responsibility for their actions, but we must  exercise our accountability. We must  act. I do not understand our Republican colleagues, knowing what they  know about the crisis, knowing there is  no real regulator on the beat on Wall  Street, can vote against beginning a  debate. We don’t have a cop on the beat  on Wall Street. We need a regulator  there. We need credit rating agencies  not  involved  in conflicts of  interest  which are inherent to the way they are  now being paid. We need a banking regulator which acts; one that doesn’t just  observe and watch  things going off  track but acts, and has a responsibility  to act as well.  The Dodd bill takes very significant  steps relative to each of these areas.  Whether it is the banking area, the  regulator area, the credit rating area,  there are some critical steps that are  taken in the Dodd bill. There are some  people who say they do not like portions of the Dodd bill. Okay, bring the  bill to the floor and let’s debate it.  Let’s legislate.  The legislative process is supposed to  involve, sooner or later, a bill which  comes to the floor and then is open to  amendment and then debate. There are  a lot of areas in this bill that can be  strengthened. There are some areas in  the bill that some people don’t like and  wish to strike. We have been on this  bill now in committees of jurisdiction  for months. There have been hearings  in those committees. I think we know  what the issues are.  There is no agreement on the resolution of this. There is no unanimous  consent, obviously, as to exactly what  reform should be put in place and how  that should be written. But we can’t always operate in the middle of a crisis  by unanimous consent. At some point,  where there are differences, we have to  bring those difference to the floor and  debate them and offer amendments on  them and vote them up or down. That  is our responsibility. It is not responsible—it is irresponsible—to block that  process from taking place.  I think almost all of us say that we  want reforms.

840,92,2010-04-28,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Madam President, I think it has been said before,  but here we go again. What we have  just seen tells us what the American  people ought to know. There are fundamental questions being asked of Senators  this week, principal of  those:  Whose side are you on? Whom do you  work for?  On Monday, Tuesday, and yet again  today we got an answer. On the other  side of the aisle they made it clear.  They stand with the big banks. They do  not stand with the infrastructure of everyday people who make this country  the great place we have become. They  do not stand for opportunities such as  the ones that allowed Americans to  come together after World War II to  get an education, get jobs, become the  greatest generation that built our Nation into the greatest on Earth.  Instead, our friends across the aisle  stand with Wall Street lobbyists who  demand that we do not take up this  bill. What an outrage. They stand for  maintaining a banking system that denies people and businesses the funds  they need and sells people mortgages  they cannot afford, while lining executives’ pockets with billions  in compensation. The picture is quite clear. It  is very obvious as to what has taken  place here. After hearing the demands  of the Wall Street lobbyists, the other  side  of  the  aisle  systematically  marches down here and votes no  in  lockstep, not once, not twice but three  times. There is no one bold enough to  say: Yes, we ought to do something  about  this  situation  that hurt our  economy so; that destroyed jobs, lives,  and homes.  What the Republicans voted against  three times this week was simply to  start debating the Wall Street reform  bill, to make it an even fairer system.  The banking lobbyists may not want us  to take up this bill, but everyday people do want  reform. They do want  change. They do want to see capital  flowing into small businesses so they  can get on with work and planning  their families’ and their children’s future.  On behalf of the everyday people,  whose side we are on, we will keep voting to take up this bill until the other  side  understands  that  is what  the  American people want and gives them  a break.  Some say they voted no because they  wanted more time to make a deal. The  reality is, the American people are fed  up with backroom deals  that  leave  them out in the cold. We have carefully  listened to testimony that has been developed these days. We are shocked to  find out how they think hiding the  deals was OK, but they didn’t want it  to be known to the public. They want  us to roll up our sleeves, talk aloud  about  this bill,  tell  the public  the  truth, vote on amendments, and pass a  strong Wall Street reform bill. That is  what the average person in this country wants.  Why don’t the banking lobbyists like  our bill? There are several reasons: Because it puts an end to giant, taxpayer-  funded bailouts by creating a safe, responsible way  to  liquidate  failing  firms. They don’t like it because it will  end the era of too big to fail and stop  protecting  irresponsible  executives  who mismanaged their companies and  because it will help prevent reckless  gambling with  investors’ money by  starting a new consumer protection  watchdog.  They  don’t  want  those  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:45 Jul 08, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S28AP0.REC S28AP0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010
841,99,2010-04-28,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, I am delighted to join in this debate, and I invite my friends on the other side to listen to what the people in communities  in our home States are saying, who  don’t spend time soliciting  funds on  Wall Street.  Let’s be very clear: We all agree we  need to hold Wall Street accountable  for the havoc wreaked on Main Street.  We all agree we need to enact reform to  prevent another financial crisis. Where  we disagree on is what the responsible  reform looks like. I have real concerns  that, in its current form, the Democrats’ bill, written with  the White  House, is a massive government overreach that will punish Main Street,  hurt families, and cost jobs by stifling  small businesses and entrepreneurs.  To sum  it up, Democrats want to  treat Main Street,  our  community  banks, our farm lenders, and our auto  dealers like they were Goldman Sachs  or others on Wall Street. We Republicans want  to  ensure we  fix Wall  Street, without crippling Main Street.  The only way to do that is to force the  Democrats to listen to the concerns of  Main Street, to open this up and make  it a bipartisan process. It has not been,  and it isn’t going to be until we get  some discussion and real substantive  changes in what I view as a very dangerous bill to the economic climate  and health of our country, our States,  our communities, and the creation of  jobs.  Today, let me share with you some of  the concerns I have heard from Main  Street. Like families in every community and every State, small businesses  were the victims. They weren’t the perpetrators of the financial crisis caused,  among other places, on Wall Street.  Small businesses were not responsible for the financial crisis and should  not be treated as if they were. But that  is exactly what this bill does. This  1,400-page bill reaches far beyond Wall  Street and will impose new costs and  onerous new regulations on small businesses to fix a problem they were not  responsible for causing. In short, this  bill would change the way every American does business.  We are not just talking about changing the way Wall Street banks do business, but also how every community  banker, local dentist, farm lender, and  auto dealer does business. I urge my  colleagues to take time away from the  floor and listen to the people at home.  They have a very different message  than that which we are hearing from  our friends on the other side of the  aisle.  These concerns are not just Republican concerns. I hope my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle are also  hearing from their constituents back  home about disturbing provisions  in  the Democrats’  proposal  and  have  begun  to agree with Senate Republicans that there is a lot of work to be  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:45 Jul 08, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S28AP0.REC S28AP0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010

843,106,2010-04-28,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Mr. President, I  rise today to speak on the financial  regulatory reform, and particularly the  effect of the Dodd proposal that came  out  of  the Banking Committee  on  which I sit, that we have been voting  on cloture on for this whole week.  I heard Senators from the other side  talk about delay; the Republicans are  delaying this bill. I have heard them  for the last week say it is because we  are siding with Wall Street, Republicans are siding with Wall Street.  That is odd to me because it is the  Wall Street big banks that are for this  bill.  It  is Citigroup,  it  is Goldman  Sachs that are in support of this bill.  They are publicly supporting the bill.  It is the community banks that are  flooding my office and the offices of my  colleagues. It is the community banks  that had nothing to do with the financial meltdown that are hugely concerned with this bill.  That is the issue. The groups that are  opposing Dodd’s bill are the National  Federation of Independent Businesses,  the small businesses of our country;  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Americans for Tax Reform; the Americans for  Limited Government; Freedom Works;  the National Taxpayer Union;  the  United States Automobile Association.  We have had auto dealers in our offices all week who are very concerned  about not being able to get credit from  the little banks and the ability to finance the buying of automobiles. It is  the Military Officers Association that  has concerns with this bill; the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives;  the Farm Credit Council; the National  Association of Home Builders; the Fertilizer Institute.  This is a bill that is going to affect  our economy. So many of the groups I  have named are the groups that are  providing jobs in our country that we  want to encourage to create more jobs,  not discourage in a time such as this.  So, yes, Republicans have been trying  to have input on this bill. There has  not been any Republican input at all. If  we have learned one thing as Republicans, it is that we know what it is  like to be completely shut out. We  were completely shut out of the health  care debate. We had amendments offered day after day after day. Oh, the  process worked. Not one Republican  amendment was passed. Not one. Neither was there one Republican vote in  the House or Senate on the health care  bill. So we have had that experience.  So this time, because we see the dangers in the Dodd bill to our economy  and the small businesses and the small  banks, we are saying we are not going  to let this bill go to the floor if we have  the power to stop it until there is Republican input.  The biggest failure in the bill is that  it still allows taxpayer bailouts. That  is wrong. That is why Republicans are  voting not to bring it up yet, because  we are trying to change the language  in the bill before it comes to the floor  to assure that the taxpayers will not  have the responsibility to bail out big  financial institutions that took gambles with other peoples’ money. That is  the holdup.  This bill is not a bill that is favored  by community and little banks. It is  favored by the big banks. It is favored  by Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. So  let’s be clear about that. As we consider the bill before us, the Dodd bill, it  should focus on the gaps and holes in  regulations that led to our nation’s financial crisis from which we have not  yet recovered, because there are still  millions of people who are unemployed  because of the financial crisis.  We must end too big to fail. We must  end taxpayer bailouts. That is not done  in this bill, and that is why Republicans are saying: Stop this bill from  coming to the floor until it does at  least that one major thing; that is, to  be clear, that we stop too big to fail in  this country.

846,113,2010-04-28,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President,  I  thank the Senators from Connecticut  and Alabama for all their hard work on  this issue. I am delighted that after  three votes and 3  full days of pressuring those on the other side of the  aisle to allow us to at least begin debating this critical bill, it appears they  have relented. Finally, it appears they  are willing to listen to not only what  Democrats have been saying about the  importance of a strong new reform bill  for Wall Street but what the American  people have been saying.  What we have been saying is it is  time to hold Wall Street accountable.  It is time to pass strong reforms that  cannot be ignored or sidestepped. It is  time to end bailouts and give Wall  Street the responsibility of cleaning up  their own mess. It is time credit card  statements are  in plain English,  in  loan terms that are spelled out. It is  time for Wall Street to come out of the  shadows and into the light of day. It is  time for negotiations to come out of  the back room and on to the Senate  floor. It is time to put an end to obstruction and begin working for American families.  I am glad we are finally now on this  bill. For most American families, this  debate is not complex; it is simple. It is  not about derivatives or credit default  swaps. It  is about  fundamental  fairness. It is a debate about when they  walk into a bank to sign a mortgage or  apply for a credit card or start a retirement plan, are the rules on their side?  Are they with the big banks or Wall  Street?  For far too long, the financial rules  of the road have not favored the American people. Instead, they favored big  banks and credit card companies and  Wall Street. For too long they have  abused  those  rules. Whether  it was  gambling with the money in our pension funds or making bets they could  never cover or peddling mortgages to  people  they knew  could never  pay  them, Wall  Street made  expensive  choices that came at the expense of  working families. That is exactly the  reason we have all fought so hard to  move forward now with a strong bill.  It is why we have refused to back  down or sit by while it was watered  down, and it is why we were ready to  stay up all night or vote to move forward with this bill all week long. It is  why we have insisted on a bill that includes the strongest protection for consumers ever enacted, an end to taxpayer bailouts, and tools to give individuals  the  resources  they need  to  make smart financial decisions because  each of us knows what the ‘‘anything  goes’’ rules on Wall Street have meant  for our States and our constituents.  Each one of us has talked to people  who have been hurt through no fault of  their own. We have all seen the tremendous cost of Wall Street’s excesses.  In my home State of Washington, it  has cost us over 150,000 jobs. It has cost  small businesses access to credit they  need to grow and hire.  It has cost  workers  their  retirement  accounts  they were counting on to carry them  through their golden years. It has cost  students  their  college  savings  that  would help launch their careers. It has  cost homeowners the value of their  most  important  asset,  as neighborhoods have been decimated by  foreclosures.  It  has  cost  our  schoolteachers, our police officers, and our  communities.  It has cost young people such as  David Corrado of Seattle, whose mother, since he was very young, would  take $400 out of her paycheck and put  it toward David’s education  fund. It  was a long-term, smart investment she  knew would pay off for David’s future.  When the financial crisis occurred, he  lost  one-third  of  his  college  fund,  $10,000.  It has also cost older people such as  Edward Diaz, who is also from Washington State. He was not only laid off  from his job of 21 years due to the recession, he also lost $100,000 from his  401(k) account. On the verge of retirement, Edward tells me he now scours  the classifieds every day searching for  any way to get back to work.  In the days ahead, as we debate this  bill, those are the people we have to remember constantly. We have to keep  them in mind as we work to protect  against this happening ever again; the  people who, through no fault of their  own, paid the price for the risks and irresponsible behavior of Wall Street.  There are people  in my State and  across the country who scrimped and  saved and made right decisions and  were left holding the bag.  Now is not the time for half measures. The American people are looking  to us now for real reform and to put  progress before politics. We have to put  people before Wall Street.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Bolkcom,  Congressional  Research  Service Specialist, on the occasion of  the  first anniversary of his passing  away, on May 1, 2009.  Christopher Bolkcom served Congress  with distinction for 9 years at the Library of Congress as a specialist  in  military aviation for the Congressional  Research Service. He held a bachelor’s  degree in international relations from  the University of Minnesota, a master’s degree  in  international affairs  from American University  in Washington, DC, and a master’s degree in  national  security  strategy  from  the  National War College in Washington,  DC.  Christopher was born on June  13,  1962, in Minneapolis, MN, raised there  and then spent his adult life and career  in the National Capitol Region until  his untimely death on May 1, 2009.  Christopher was recognized throughout Congress, the military Services,  the defense community, and the aeronautical industry as an expert on the  management, operational use and procurement of military aircraft. In that  capacity, he assisted Congress in its  legislative and oversight activities, including testifying before the Senate  Armed Services Committee; the House  Armed Services Committee; the Senate  Commerce, Science and Transportation  Committee; and  the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. Christopher  published many  influential CRS  reports on such subjects as Air Force aerial refueling; the role of airpower in  counterinsurgency operations; tactical  aviation and bomber force modernization; military aviation safety; suppression of enemy air defenses; and protecting  commercial  aircraft  from  shoulder-fired missiles. He provided objective, expert analysis on a number of  issues,  including  the  Joint  Strike  Fighter and the KC–X Tanker, to Congress, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and to me and my staff personally—analysis  for which  I am very  grateful.  Christopher displayed generous enthusiasm for meeting the professional  needs of colleagues and clients, enlivened by persistent humor and wit in  his interpersonal relations. He worked  hard at his public duties. He also  played hard with friends, whether skiing or kick-boxing, and found time to  serve others, at for example the Falls  Church Presbyterian Church in Falls  Church, VA.  On this occasion—the first anniversary of Christopher’s passing away—I  want to honor the  life and achievements of Congressional Research Service Specialist Christopher Bolkcom,  who is survived by his loving family,  including his children Jessica and Maxwell Bolkcom; their mother Mary Anne  Alexander; his parents Gene and Ann  Bolkcom;  his  sister  Elizabeth  Matteson; his brother Bill Bolkcom;  and his nephew Tristin Matteson.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO VICE ADMIRAL MIKE  LOOSE  ∑",2010
854,120,2010-04-28,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, I would  like to take a moment today to recognize the extraordinary contributions of  VADM Mike Loose, Civil Engineer  Corps, U.S. Navy to our Nation. Vice  Admiral Loose has served with exceptional distinction as the Deputy Chief  of Naval Operations, CNO,  for Fleet  Readiness and Logistics, a position of  great responsibility, from January 2007  to April 2010.  Vice Admiral Loose brought a unique  and  remarkable  perspective  to  the  CNO’s  leadership  team,  resulting  in  profound innovations to Navy policy,  programs, and resourcing. His professional  reach  extended  to  the Joint  Staff, the other Services, our  international defense partners, and the industry to achieve alignment and collaboration resulting in great benefits  to everyone involved. He was the visionary leader and driving force behind  the Navy’s transition from a level-of-  effort based budget to a model-based  approach that links Afloat Readiness  to output metrics and resources. This  transformational leap provided senior  Navy leadership the intellectual basis  and  the  tools  to  enhance  core  Warfighting capabilities in a restrained  fiscal environment and to clearly define the relationship between baseline  and overseas contingency operations  funding.  Vice Admiral Loose was also the vanguard who recognized the strategic imperative of energy to the employment  of Navy combat forces and spearheaded  the establishment of Task Force Energy and the Navy Energy Coordination Office 2 years ago. He fully established the mindset that energy is a tactical advantage and strategic enabler  for military forces. In short order, his  Energy organization was recognized as  the premier model for the other Services and as  the  foundation  for  the  DON’s Energy program. In addition, he  profoundly reshaped and expertly guided the Navy’s Environmental Program  at a time when the importance of the  program was paramount. His foresight  and energetic  leadership ensured the  Navy achieved regulatory milestones  and uninterrupted, critical operational  training in support of national command authority objectives.  In recognition of the enormous challenges inherently facing the funding of  future ownership costs of existing and  new systems Vice Admiral Loose directed the development of a ‘‘2030 and  Beyond’’  assessment  that  demonstrated that the growth  in  future  ownership costs of existing and new  systems would far exceed the expected  growth in the Navy’s topline budget  over the next 20 years. His efforts led  to an increased focus on total ownership costs across the Navy, specific direction in the 2010 Chief of Naval Operations Guidance and his assignment as  the Navy’s Executive Agent for Total  Ownership Costs.  Today, I honor Vice Admiral Loose  for his service to our country, his inspirational and visionary  leadership,  his extraordinary strength of character  and moral courage, and his irrepressible drive and leadership. He and his  wife Carol and their son Chris have  made many sacrifices during his career  in the Navy.

855,134,2010-04-28,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1280, ‘‘Expressing  the support of  the House of Representatives  for  the goals and  ideals of National Healthy Schools Day.’’  Let me begin by  thanking my colleague  Representative PAUL for  introducing  this piece of legislation into the House of Representatives as it is important that we diligently  work towards the improvement of deteriorating  public schools across the nation and also work  towards the improvement of construction techniques in schools.  The  issue  of  environmental  hazards  in  schools has been a growing problem over the  last several decades. It is unfortunate that in  schools across  the nation  investigators can  find  unchecked  renovations,  pesticide  misapplications, unsafe drinking water, and indoor air pollutants such as mold infestations.  It is unreasonable to think that our children  can receive the best possible learning environment when they are expected to learn under  these types of conditions.  There are also a wide range of problems  stemming from poor air quality and ventilation  problems in schools. It has consistently been  shown that these types of air quality problems  can lead to poor concentration, respiratory illnesses, learning difficulties, and even cancer  in students.  Today  there are approximately 55,000,000  children and 7,000,000 adults who spend their  days in the Nation’s more than 125,000 public  and private schools. Students and  teachers  also spend an average of 30 to 50 hours per  week in school.  These numbers equate to nearly 20 percent  of our nation’s population spending their days  in schools across the country—many of which  are currently facing deterioration in the quality  of their buildings while in the face of massive  budget cuts. Therefore  it  is critical  that we  work  together  to seek comprehensive solutions to the trend of deteriorating schools in  our nation.  A recent study showed  that approximately  one-third of public school principals reported  that  some  environmental  factors  in  their  schools have  interfered with classroom  instruction. This report highlights an increasingly  troubling trend among schools of deteriorating  environmental factors.  In  fact school  facilities with poor building  quality can result in lower test scores, poor attendance, and health problems  for students  and staff. These problems are only worsened  for the nearly 9 percent of American students  who are known  to have asthma. Asthma  is  also the leading cause of absence from school  and is aggravated by poor air quality and ventilation problems in schools.  To meet these challenges, I believe that we  should begin working with  school districts  across the nation towards the implementation  of healthy and high performance schools.  These types of schools would be designed  to improve indoor environments while reducing  energy and maintenance costs. They would  also provide for an improvement in the quality  of ambient  light, would reduce exposures  to  toxic  substances  and  would  provide  a  healthier and safer  learning environment  for  children.  Healthy and high performance schools are  designed with specific environmental factors in  mind, such as pollutant source controls, proper ventilation mechanisms, and moisture and  mold controls. It is imperative that school districts in our nation recognize the importance of  these new construction and maintenance techniques and work to ensure the improvement of  student and teacher health across the board.  By officially designating April 26, 2010 as  ‘National Healthy Schools Day,’ we  in Congress will be sending a strong message to students and teachers across the nation that we  intend  to provide healthy and safe buildings  for students to learn in. We will also be sending a message to school districts across the  nation that it is vitally important to build new  schools with  renewable  resource materials  and energy efficient appliances.  We must always ensure  that schools and  children  receive all  the necessary  tools  for  their continued growth. Furthermore it is vitally  important that we continue to work with state  and  local  agencies  including  independent  school districts across the nation for the implementation  of  these measures  in  public  schools.  I would  like  to again  thank my colleague  Representative PAULTONKO for introducing H.  Res. 1280. I ask my colleagues for their support of this legislation as well as their continued support for children, teachers and public  schools across the nation.  Mr. Speaker,  I strongly support H. Res.  1280 and the rule.  f  HONORING  SAUNDERS  OMNIPRESENT  NETWORK  INSPIRING  AMERICA’S  YOUTH,  INC.  FOR  THEIR  EXTRAORDINARY WORK  IN THE COMMUNITY  HON.

857,134,2010-04-28,Mr. SAM  JOHNSON  of Texas.," Madam  Speaker, I ask my fellow colleagues to join me  in  congratulating  the  2009–2010 Congressional Youth Advisory Council. This year, 45  students  from  public,  private,  and  home  schools  in grades 9  through 12 made  their  voices heard and made a difference in their  communities, their country and their Congress.  These students volunteered their time, effort,  and talent to inform me about the important  issues facing their generation. As young leaders within their communities and their schools,  these students boldly represent  the promise  and the hope we all have for their very bright  future.  President Ronald Reagan said, ‘‘Freedom is  never more  than one generation away  from  extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in  the bloodstream.  It must be  fought  for, protected, and handed on  for  them  to do  the  same, or one day we will spend our sunset  years  telling our children and our children’s  children what it was once like in the United  States where men were free.’’  To ensure that the blessing of freedom is  passed from one generation to the next, the  members of the CYAC spent time interviewing  a veteran and documenting the experience for  the  ‘‘Preserving History Project.’’ Today  I’m  proud to submit the brief summaries provided  so the patriotic service of our dedicated veterans and  the  thoughtful work of  the CYAC  may be preserved  for antiquity  in  the CONGRESSIONALRECORD. A copy of each submitted student summary follows.  To  each member  of  the Congressional  Youth Advisory Council, thank you for making  this year and this group a success. It is not a  coincidence  that  this  congressional  tribute  celebrates two generations of service. Each of  you is trusted with the precious gift of freedom.  You are the voices of the future and I salute  you. God bless you and God bless America.  The summary follows:  Sergeant Archie Lee Dyer joined the Marine Corps on November 22, 1967. He was only  19 years old at the time, but he was courageous enough to begin his journey as a soldier in the Vietnam War. As a granddaughter  of Archie Dyer, I have gotten to know his  military career well. It’s amazing to sit and  listen to the stories of my sweet, humble’  and brave Pawpaw’s journey as a Marine. His  life has been shaped greatly because of his  time spent in the Vietnam War and I am  very lucky to have a brave grandfather who  was willing to potentially sacrifice his life  far our nation. Although he has created a  successful pool company and had many other  great successes in life, the one that can be  most appreciated is his success as a Marine.  I have learned so much about my Pawpaw by  doing this interview. I have realized how passionate he is about protecting our nation by  the way he continually holds his head high  while telling stories of the ‘‘good old days’’  when he was a Marine. Although his time in  the Vietnam War was a very trying experience, my Pawpaw never regrets his time  spent braving the war and protecting our  great nation. I am so proud of my Pawpaw  for all that he has done and I am grateful to  have had this experience to learn more about  this man that I love and respect so much.—  Caitlyn Woolum.

858,141,2010-04-28,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Madam Speaker, it  is with great pleasure I rise to recognize the  50th anniversary the Red Knights of Training  Squadron Three. Through  times of war and  through times of peace, the Red Knights have  served our country with great distinction and  valor.  In  their commitment and  in  their sacrifice, Training Squadron Three rightfully holds  a place in the annals of Naval History as a  squadron that took immense pride in preparing  America’s finest youth for the defense of our  great nation and her ideals. For that reason, I  am proud  to  recognize  the Red Knights of  Squadron Three for their exceptional training  and excellent performance over  the  last 50  years.  With World War II raging in both the Atlantic  and Pacific theaters the demand for trained pilots was at its zenith, and the first squadron to  bear the name Training Squadron Three was  created. Throughout  the costly struggle with  the Axis Alliance that claimed many young pilots, Training Squadron Three continued  to  train pilots for day-to-day operations and for  the units needed to carry out the final campaigns against the Japanese mainland. After  the  terms of surrender were signed by  the  Japanese,  there was  little need  for multiple  training squadrons to train an enormous invasion force and Training Squadron Three was  decommissioned.  The current Red Knights of Training Squadron Three picked up the torch lit by their predecessors on May 1, 1960, and continued the  legacy of ‘‘Training the Best for America’s Defense.’’ On that day, Training Squadron Three  was commissioned with  the  task of utilizing  the T–28 Trojan to prepare a younger generation of student naval aviators in radio instruments, formation flying and air-to-air gunnery.  In 1968, at  the height of  the Vietnam War,  Training Squadron Three was at its peak size;  consisting of 174  instructors, 494 students,  649 enlisted and 162 T–28 aircraft. During  1968, Training Squadron Three had flown almost 110,000 instructional hours and trained  902 students. These impressive figures set the  record for any training squadron in the history  of Naval Air Training command.  In 1980, Training Squadron Three became  the only primary fixed wing training squadron  to be alternately commanded by a Navy and  Marine Corps officer. The Red Knights were  honored once again  in 1994 when  they became  the Navy’s  first and only  joint service  primary flight training squadron. In 1997, the  squadron was  selected as  the  first Navy  squadron  to  transition  to and  fly  the T–6  Texan II.  Madam Speaker, on behalf of  the United  States Congress, I am privileged to recognize  the Red Knights for going above and beyond  the call of duty on their 50th anniversary. To  this day, the Red Knights of Squadron Three  continue to provide the highest quality training  to student aviators  from  the Navy, Marine  Corps, Coast Guard, Air Force and several Allied nations. As  they  remain  resolute and  steadfast to do their part defending our nation,  we must do our part to remember their unwavering commitment with our hearts and minds.  f  HEROES  COME  IN ALL  SHAPES  AND  SIZES:  EIGHT-YEAR-OLD  DILLON EARL IS A HERO  HON.

859,141,2010-04-28,Mr.  SALAZAR.," Madam  Speaker,  heros  come in all shapes and sizes and I rise today  to honor eight-year-old Dillon Earl of Fruita,  Colorado for heroic acts that saved lives on  Sunday, April 25.  While the two were on their way to church,  Dillon’s grandmother Lisa DeKruger had a seizure behind the wheel of her truck. Luckily for  both of them, Dillon’s quick thinking and bravery under pressure saved both their lives and  those of other drivers on the road.  When he noticed something was wrong with  his grandmother, eight-year-old Dillon reached  for the brake and guided the truck to the side  of  the  interstate. With  the assistance of another driver, he called 9–1–1 and got his  grandmother the urgent medical attention she  needed.  The  impact of Dillon’s actions has only  begun to sink in for his grandmother who recently told him, ‘‘I guess Grandma owes you  lots of candy for the rest of your life.’’  Throughout  this  incredible  incident, Dillon  has shown humility and a maturity beyond his  years. His remarkable courage and concern  for his loved ones are an inspiration to all of  us. This brave young man from Mesa County  Colorado has made his family, his community  and his Congressman very proud.  I wish him and his family continued health  and happiness.  f  HONORING CARLOS BRADLEY  HON. ROBERT A. BRADY  OFPENNSYLVANIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 28, 2010  ",2010

864,8,2010-05-07,Mr. COBURN.," I object.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.  Mr. UDALL  of New Mexico. Mr.  President, moving forward with some  individual  nominees  for  President  Obama to put in place people at the Department of Commerce, at the Health  and Human Services Department, at  the Treasury Department, at the State  Department, and at the Energy Department—all very important government  agencies. All President Obama wants is  to have his team in place so they can  start doing their work. But what we  are seeing on the other side over and  again is secret holds and delay.  It is important to remind everybody  that at this particular point in time 107  nominees of the executive branch are  being held up. At this point in time in  the past  for President Bush, only 8  nominees were being held. So 107 are  being held for President Obama, and  for President Bush, there were only 8.  You can only think and draw the conclusion that this is about preventing  the President from getting his team in  place, which is obviously a very important function.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session for the purpose of consideration  of  Calendar  No.  640,  Eric  Hirschhorn, to be Under Secretary of  Commerce for the Export Administration;  that  the nomination  be  confirmed; that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the  table; that no further motions be in  order, the President be  immediately  notified of the Senate’s action, and  that any statements relating to the  nominee be printed in the RECORD, as if  read.

Mr.  President, I will proceed with another  important position in the Department  of the Treasury. We all know the Department of the Treasury supervises  everything that is out there in terms of  our economy—a very important position.  I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to executive session for  the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 652, Michael Mundaca, to be  an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; that the nomination be confirmed;  that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table;  that no further motions be in order;  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate’s action, and that  any statements relating to the nominee be printed in the RECORDas if read.

I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to executive session for  the purpose of consideration of Calendar No.  722, Judith Ann Stewart  Stock, to be an Assistant Secretary of  State;  that  the nomination be confirmed; that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the  table; that no further motions be in  order;  that  the President be  immediately notified of the Senate’s action,  and that any statements relating to  the nominee be printed in the RECORD  as if read.

868,8,2010-05-07,Mr. COBURN.," Reserving the right to  object, Mr. President, I want to make  it known that I am carrying on a Senate courtesy on my side of the aisle,  and these are not necessarily my objections, but they are on behalf of my colleagues. I object.  Mr. UDALL  of New Mexico. Mr.  President,  I say to Senator COBURN  that we very much understand that he  is doing this for others. We want them  to step forward. We want to get rid of  these secret holds, as the Senator from  Oklahoma has stepped forward on the  broadcasting board. He has said he is  holding up six people to go on that  board of governors. It is out there in  public, and it is something that all of  us can examine and the media can examine. We can figure out whether his  objections are legitimate. But that is  the process. That is what is going on—  secretly delaying  the administration  from getting its team in place.  Let’s admit what is going on here.  The  folks who are putting on these  holds do not want to see the President  have his team in place. If he doesn’t  have his team in place, I think the expectation is that they think he would  not be able to do the job.  Once again, the President nominated  somebody important to work with Secretary Chu at the Department of Energy.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 726, Patricia A.  Hoffman, to be an Assistant Secretary  of Energy; that the nomination be confirmed; that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the  table; that no further motions be in  order;  that  the President be  immediately notified of the Senate’s action,  and that any statements relating to  the nominee be printed in the RECORD  as if read.

869,8,2010-05-07,Mr. COBURN.," I object.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Once  again, they are being held up through  secret holds, and Senator COBURNhas  said he is doing this on behalf of Members on his side—not allowing all of  these people to get into the government and do the job. We are talking  about important government agencies,  such as the Department of Commerce,  Health and Human Services, Secretary  of the Treasury, Secretary of State,  Secretary of Energy—all objected to  today.  Many of these nominations have been  pending for a while. There are very few  objections in committee. This is something that is being put forward for the  purpose of delay.  ",2010

873,8,2010-05-07,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, I think  the motives ascribed by the Senator  from New Mexico are improper. I do  not think it is so people can’t get into  a job to cause President Obama problems. I reject that motive.  With any administration, there is a  very big difference of opinion. That is  why we have elections. That is why  things move like this in our country. It  is about whether somebody objects to  somebody’s either philosophical bent  or qualifications for a certain job.  I make the point again that at the  same time under a Republican Congress, President Bush had fewer numbers approved than President Obama  does at this time.  I hope we would not ascribe that motive. I want President Obama to have,  in fact, the people he needs to have in  place to effectively run our government. I will give the numbers again.

875,15,2010-05-07,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, I pay  tribute to one of my staff members  today. She recently  left. She had a  child and is being a mom and a civic  activist. But she was a trusted adviser  and, more than that, a dedicated patriot.  Jane Treat, who has been with me  since the earliest parts of 2004, is leaving to become a full-time mother. It is  hard to lose her. But I understand the  attraction as well as the commitment  for a much more important job. She  first came to work for me as a volunteer, fresh off her studies at Patrick  Henry College.  Since that time she has played a key  role  on my  Judiciary  Committee  through many intense legislative battles. She spent many long days in the  Dirksen Building poring through briefing materials, preparing background  notes for me, and negotiating on my  behalf with other offices.  She was there during the Roberts and  Alito hearings. For a time she also  served as my interim chief counsel on  the committee, since I had no attorneys and she was a nonattorney as  well, which was a rare occasion. Her  dedication has never wavered. The fact  is, she worked the day she delivered  her first child. She prepared negotiations that day for a bill that threatened the second amendment of the Constitution and how it interacted with  our veterans. We prevailed that day in  no small part because of her efforts.  One would be hard pressed to find anyone who cherishes the Constitution and  who knows  its principles as well as  Jane Treat.  My legislative director jokes:  Although Jane did not actually write the  Constitution, she is its fiercest defender.  I would have to agree.  For the past 2 years, and after the  birth of her daughter, Jane has managed a correspondence team that works  in my office, ensuring that every letter  that reached my desk was treated with  the  utmost  concern  and  professionalism. She  cared  for  each  constituent as if it were written to a close  relative or a neighbor. In that, she has  done a terrific job.  There is one last quality of Jane that  I commend to everyone in the room,  and that is courage. Jane has a keen  sense of right and wrong and will not  allow an injustice to stand, whether it  is policy related or simply human. She  fights for everybody.  When she disagrees—I am laughing  about this because when she disagreed  with me, I was always sure I would  hear about it later. She would come to  the office and knock on the door, and  say: Now we need to have a talk. You  were wrong.  Of course, I would remind her that  she was not elected and I was and there  is some interpretation to the Constitution.  But the quality of having the courage  to confront on things that are strongly  held beliefs is a great quality that built  our country, and she distinguishes herself in it. That is in contrast to what  usually happens in this town where we  avoid difficult issues rather than confront them.  True to her principles, she will turn  her attention toward her new community in Broken Arrow, OK, where she  will be a full-time mom. It will not be  long,  for  sure, before  she  is volunteering again for a cause close to her  heart.  Jane, we appreciate you. We thank  you for your service, and we thank you  for the modeling of your behavior.  SECRETHOLDS  Now, I just want to spend a few minutes because what we have just gone  through is a challenge to a process that  has been ongoing for a long period of  time. The President knows I am  in  agreement with sunshine. As a matter  of fact, the President and I created the  Transparency and Accountability Act  so that everything we do gets published  in terms of what we spend and how we  spend it.  I agree we ought to be  forthright  with the reasons we hold individuals.  But let’s talk about what a hold is. A  hold is saying you do not agree to a  unanimous-consent request to pass out  an individual. In other words, what is a  hold? What does it really say?  It really says, first of all, I either  may have some very significant concerns with this  individual or I may  want to study this individual for a period of time and their record before I  agree to it or I may want to debate it,  the qualifications of the individual.  I agree on the transparency. But I  think it is very important that we go  back to say—and not necessarily attune the motive. But when I read the  sign about those who are being held  now versus in the Bush administration,  I am reminded that there were over 100  U.S. attorneys and marshals and 50  judges at  the  same  time who were  blocked  in committee so they could  not even get to the floor at that time.  So it depends on where one takes the  snapshot. There are lots of reasons to  not agree to people being confirmed. I  have no problem with stating my reasons, and I will publish my reasons. I  do not have any problem even publishing them. But I am not sure that  we want to necessarily impugn the motives of somebody who takes advantage  of that.  I agree with the Senator from Missouri. I have no problems with putting  it out in the open. But I did ask the  question, and at some point in time I  think it would be wise for those who  think that, that we get a parliamentary ruling on what the rule really  means because I think there is some  discussion. I do not doubt that the intent of what was passed was exactly  what we intended: to put it out there.  But I think the interpretation or how  it may be read is subject to some debate, and it would be great to have a  Parliamentarian rule on that.  Finally, I would say, the other side of  this issue, which comes back to things  that are dear to my heart, is the fact  that  94 percent of  everything  that  passes in this body passes by that very  process, unanimous consent.  Unanimous consent says: We will not  have debate. We will not have an  amendment. Things will pass because  nobody objects to it passing.  There is a real disadvantage for our  country in that. The disadvantage is  that the American people never know  what we are doing. They do not get a  hearing. They do not get to hear the  policy debates on both sides of the  issue. It is good that we work some  things out, but if you watch the floor,  what we know is 40 percent of the floor  time is spent in a quorum call.  The real issue we are fighting is the  moving,  is  the  reason  the majority  leader does not move them, because it  takes time to move them. Right? That  is our problem. Time  is our biggest  enemy in the Senate. But yet that is  exactly what our Founders intended.  They wanted it to be very difficult to  change what they had put in place, and  they set in motion this system that  says: We are going to make things  thoughtfully, under full consideration,  with open debate.  We hear our colleagues all the time  say this  is the greatest deliberative  body in the world. It is, but not all of  the deliberation goes on on the Senate  floor. I have no doubt there are abuses  on both sides. I do not know what the  motives are.  When I hold somebody, I hold them  because I think they are either not  qualified for the job, I think they have  a past record that would question their  character, or I think, in fact, they will  do a terrible job at the position even if  they are qualified. And  I have  the  right, as an individual Senator, to say  I am not going to support that nomination. So I am all for moving and giving  Presidents what they want, but I am  not for doing it without the debate and  the  consideration  that needs  to be  there.  So I am very supportive of people  standing up and saying why they are  holding up people. Through the courtesy of the Senator from Missouri, she  did not list one of the judges that I am  sure she was going to ask unanimous  consent on because I was the lone Senator  in the Judiciary Committee to  vote against him. Now, I do not know  who is holding him. But the fact is, I  do not think he is qualified. I want him  to be debated. I want to have a chance  to inform the American people why I  think he should not be a circuit court  judge. And that is my right.  To say we are just going to move him  without a debate, without anything but  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:22 May 08, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G07MY6.015 S07MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 C L B Y K 8 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2010

Many European nations have long observed  ‘‘Mothering Sundays,’’ which  are also part of the liturgical calendar  in  several Christian  denominations.  Catholics observe Laetare Sunday, the  fourth Sunday in Lent, in honor of the  Virgin Mary and the ‘‘mother’’ church.  Some historians believe the tradition  of  sending  flowers on Mothers Day  grew out of the practice of allowing  children who worked in large houses  that day off to visit their families. The  children would  pick wildflowers  to  take to their mothers on their way  home for the visit.

882,50,2010-05-07,Mr. REED.," Mr. President, I rise to  engage in a colloquy with my colleague  from Rhode Island, Mr. WHITEHOUSE,  and my colleague from West Virginia,  ",2010
883,50,2010-05-07,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.,"  Mr. President, I want to thank the  chairman of the Commerce Committee  for his  leadership  in advancing this  bill. As he, Senator WHITEHOUSE, and I  have discussed, there is significant concern with respect to the safety and security of proposed  liquefied natural  gas, LNG,  facilities  throughout  the  country. Given the Deepwater Horizon  disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, we know  that no system for handling volatile  substances is fool-proof.  Over the last several years, the people of Rhode Island have been greatly  concerned about proposals to develop  LNG facilities on or in close proximity  to Rhode Island’s shores, as well as  proposals  to  transit  LNG  traffic  through our waterways. I have come to  the floor on many occasions to express  my deep concerns about the wisdom of  these projects; not as a matter of reflexive opposition to LNG but as a matter of  the appropriateness of  siting  these facilities with little State control.  This includes a proposal in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that will  have significant impact on the State of  Rhode Island, as it calls for vessels to  transit through Narragansett Bay and  off-load at an offshore berth in Mount  Hope Bay just outside of Rhode Island  waters. Over the years, members of the  Rhode Island and Massachusetts delegations have raised concerns about this  project, but the most severe impacts of  the vessel traffic and related safety and  security measures will be on Rhode Island, which has very little authority to  influence the process. The Coast Guard  has the responsibility of  issuing so-  called Letters of Recommendation to  establish the suitability of a waterway  to accommodate this type of vessel  traffic and operation. Its determination is critical in the siting LNG facilities. Unfortunately, Rhode Island, like  other states, has little recourse to object to the findings or conditions laid  out by the Coast Guard, even though  the bulk of the vessel activity will take  place in its state waters. I believe the  state should have a say about the appropriateness of activities in its waterways and should be consulted, especially about the broader  impacts of  LNG  facilities and vessel traffic on  other waterway users and on communities.  Although the underlying House bill  includes a port security title, the substitute does not. While I recognize that  and that the Committee will be dealing  with port security legislation later this  year, I think that it is critical that we  act on this issue as soon as possible. I  would like to work with the Chairman  in crafting that bill, but I would also  ask for his commitment to work to address the issues related to LNG facilities during conference with the House  on the Coast Guard Reauthorization  bill.  ",2010
884,50,2010-05-07,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Mr. Chairman, I  share the sentiments of the senior Senator from Rhode Island, ",2010
885,50,2010-05-07,Mr. REED.,"  Rhode Islanders are strongly opposed  to this project. Furthermore, the process for siting the LNG facility has afforded us too few opportunities to address the impacts it will have on our  state’s economy, safety, and environment.  The Coast Guard is charged with the  narrow task of determining whether  LNG tankers can safely transit Rhode  Island waters on their way to an offshore  berthing  station  just  on  the  other side of the state line in Massachusetts. However, the safe transit of  these tankers is only one of the many  important considerations that can, and  should, be taken into account in determining  the  suitability  of  such  a  project. Narragansett Bay is the backbone of the Rhode Island economy, as  it sustains our fishing, recreation, and  tourism sectors. The proposed LNG facility in Fall River threatens to undermine these pillars of our economy.  I am not opposed to LNG as a fuel  source. However, I have serious concerns with the proposal under consideration. The LNG  tankers  transiting  Rhode Island waters must pass through  heavily populated communities, under  the presence of heavy security. The  Coast Guard admits that this will likely displace other users of the bay and  disrupt traffic on the bridges the tankers must travel beneath. This is too  high a burden for Rhode Island to carry  for a facility that is located in a neighboring state—and I am not convinced  this burden is worth the marginal benefits of the proposed LNG facility.  I thank the Chairman of the Senate  Commerce Committee, Senator ROCKEfor his willingness to work  with us on an  issue critical to the  State of Rhode Island.  ",2010
886,50,2010-05-07,Mr. ROCKEFELLER., I am aware of  both Senators’  concerns and  I will  work with each of you related to LNG  facilities during conference with the  House on the Coast Guard Reauthorization bill.  ,2010

896,71,2010-05-07,Mr. COSTELLO.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing  the 10,000th GED  ‘‘graduate’’  from  the Adult Education Program at Southwestern  Illinois College.  In  1990,  Southwestern  Illinois  College  changed its adult education programming from  a general literacy effort to a program focused  on preparing students for the GED test and  transitioning  them  into postsecondary education. Martha Giordano, Ph.D., who headed  the program then, recalls that ‘‘It was like a  light  coming on. Students wanted a high  school completion so they could move on. We  had to make everything we did relate to this  primary goal.’’ The program revised  its curriculum and course scheduling to accomplish  that goal.  Martha O’Malley, the St. Clair County Regional Superintendent of Education at  the  time, also saw the light and decided to help.  She made GED testing locally available when  she took on the responsibility of testing and  persuaded the other district Regional Superintendents to do likewise. GED tests were administered monthly throughout the district and  registration for testing became an ongoing activity in the regional offices. This practice continues to the present.  ‘‘This combination of  intensive, highly  focused instruction and frequent local testing accounts  for our high numbers,’’ states Giordano. ‘‘When students come to our program,  they know we will take them from where they  are and push  them  forward until  they are  ready for that test.’’  Southwestern Illinois College keeps careful  records of the students who pass, and in October 2009,  it  recorded  its 10,000th GED  ‘‘graduate.’’ This year, at its annual GED Certificate Ceremony—May 19, 2010—the College and District will celebrate this important  milestone.  Southwestern Illinois College has one of the  largest adult education programs in Illinois. It  averages over 500 graduates annually, and  last year 573 of its students earned the GED.  Over the years 42 percent of these GED graduates have enrolled  in undergraduate programs at Southwestern alone.  ‘‘We see our  former adult education students  in  the halls  and classrooms at SWIC and all about town,’’  reports Janice Buchwald, the current GED Director. The program has students who have  finished nursing programs,  transferred  to 4-  year institutions and are working as lab technicians, graphic designers, cafeteria managers,  salespersons and in a host of other occupations. Undoubtedly Southwestern  Illinois College’s adult education efforts are having a significant  impact on  the  lives of many district  residents.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me in congratulating the board, administration,  faculty and students of Southwestern  Illinois  College as they recognize and celebrate the  10,000th GED  ‘‘graduate’’  from  their Adult  Education Program.  f  CELEBRATING MOTHERS AND  MOTHER’S DAY  SPEECHOF  HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 5, 2010  ",2010
897,71,2010-05-07,Ms.  JACKSON  LEE  of  Texas.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.  Res. 1295, ‘‘Celebrating the role of mothers in  the United States and supporting  the goals  and ideals of Mother’s Day.’’ First and foremost  I would  like  to  thank my distinguished  colleague from Nebraska, Representative JEFF  FORTENBERRY, for introducing this bill. It is vital  we  recognize  that mothers have made  immeasurable  contributions  toward  building  strong families, thriving communities, and ultimately a strong nation. The services rendered  to the children of the United States by their  mothers have strengthened and  inspired  the  Nation throughout its history.  Today  I stand before my colleagues honoring the 102d anniversary since the first official Mother’s Day. As a mother of two children  myself, I understand the hardships and difficulties that so many mothers face every day in  our country. We honor ourselves and mothers  in the United States when we revere and emphasize  the  importance of  the  role of  the  home and family as the true foundation of the  Nation.  I want  to pay  tribute  to my mother  Ivalita Jackson who has stood the test of time  in  rearing and  raising her children.  I would  also like to take this time to honor my aunt  Valerie Bennett for her constant love and support. To the mothers of Houston, too many to  name here, I salute you for your dedication to  raising and saving your children.  Today, thousands of mothers in this country  have become active and effective participants  in public  life and public service, promoting  change and  improving  the quality of  life  for  men, women, and children throughout the Nation.  Mothers continue to rise to the challenge of  raising their families with love, understanding,  and compassion, while overcoming the challenges of modern society; Mothers throughout  our country juggle between work, family and  the household, all with a smile on their faces.  On May 9, 2010, we will honor mothers,  grandmothers, mothers-in-law,  stepmothers,  foster mothers and godmothers who  take  in  children, mothers who adopt, those who act as  mothers, for those women who have no relations by blood but who give the gift of mothering to children.  I want to congratulate and praise all of the  mothers in America for all of their hard work.  Mothers have a huge influence on our everyday lives; we owe all of our success to them.  As former President George Washington put it  best  ‘‘My mother was  the most  beautiful  woman I ever saw. All I am I owe to my mother.  I attribute all my success  in  life  to  the  moral, intellectual, and physical education I received  from her.’’ We can never  thank our  mothers enough  for all  the sacrifices  they  have made for us. I wish all families a very  happy Mother’s Day this Sunday.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE  OFDELAWARE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 7, 2010  ",2010

899,5,2010-05-20,Mr. FLEMING.," Mr. Speaker, recently  the IMF announced a giant bailout to  keep Greece from defaulting, defaulting on its own debt, debt for its socialistic economy. The U.S. is the largest  contributor to the IMF; therefore, we  are the largest bailout source for this.  That’s right, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. taxpayer is now in the business of rescuing  Greece from its debt crisis, which was  brought on by reckless borrowing and  spending to fund welfare programs.  While the U.S. is putting itself on the  hook for another bailout, liberals in  Washington are working hard to copycat the Greek model: taxing, spending,  borrowing, and increasing entitlement  programs  across  the  board. Behind  Greece are other European countries  on the verge of default. Are we going to  bail them out, too? And that’s not to  mention States like California and the  many companies this government has  already bailed out. Who will bail out  our country when we can’t borrow our  way out of trouble?  Mr. Speaker, let’s stop bailing out  countries, States, and companies, and  hold all entities, including ourselves,  accountable for runaway spending.  f  PASS WALL STREET REFORM  (Ms. MARKEY of Colorado asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)  ",2010
900,5,2010-05-20,Ms. MARKEY  of  Colorado.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to urge this Congress to pass meaningful Wall Street  reform to protect American taxpayers  from ever again being forced to bail out  Wall Street banks. It’s time to end  ‘‘too big to fail’’ financial firms whose  irresponsible behavior almost crashed  our entire economy. And it’s time to  end predatory lending practices with  tougher enforcement.  We must pass a bill that will end  bailouts and ensure that banks and  taxpayers are never again on the hook  for Wall Street’s risky gambles. We  must act to protect  families’ retirement  funds, college  savings, homes,  and small businesses, and bring transparency and accountability back to a  financial system run amok.  I wasn’t in Congress while some Wall  Street banks were running our financial system into the ground, but I came  here to clean up the mess and get  America’s economy back on track. So I  ask my colleagues, whose side do you  stand on? Do you stand with the reckless Wall Street banks or will you  stand with American families? I urge  my colleagues to pass this bill.  f  FLORIDA IS STILL OPEN FOR  BUSINESS  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  on Wednesday the U.S. Coast Guard announced that the tar balls discovered  on the Florida Keys shoreline were not  linked to the gulf oil spill. What does  this mean? It means that Florida is  still open for business.  Mr. Speaker, public beaches in my  congressional district of Miami Beach  and the Florida Keys are open. Their  waters are warm and inviting. Charter  boat captains eagerly await the opportunity to take tourists deep sea fishing. Similarly, dive shops stand by to  take visitors on a tour of some of the  greatest underwater treasures in this  world, the Florida Keys coral reef.  For those outside of Florida, it is important to note that fresh-caught fish  from our Sunshine State  is  just as  fresh as ever, as are our stone crabs,  spiny lobster, and shrimp. Recent news  reports have caused a premature panic  for visitors. And while it is important  that coastal communities prepare for  the possibility of oil coming ashore,  Florida is open for business.  Come on down; the water’s fine.  f  ARIZONA’S MISGUIDED LAW  (Mr. BACA asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2010
901,5,2010-05-20,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Speaker, America’s  immigration system  is broken. Congress’  failure to act has opened the  doors  for  laws  like Arizona SB 1070  that are inspired by hate and racism.  Sadly, this misguided law hurts everyone who looks different, whether they  are American citizens,  lawful  immigrants, or undocumented immigrants.  Everyone deserves the right to live  free from unwarranted suspicion, but  Arizona  SB  1070  legalizes  racial  profiling, taking away our basic freedoms.  Later today, I will introduce legislation in the House to fight this law that  clarifies the role of the Federal Government as the sole enforcer of immigration laws.  I urge all of you who value fairness  and justice to join me in an economic  boycott of Arizona and wear a red and  yellow wristband in opposing this hateful law.  f  YOUCUT  (Mr. NEUGEBAUER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2010
902,5,2010-05-20,Mr. NEUGEBAUER.," Mr.  Speaker,  every day all across America right now  families are sitting down at the dinner  table trying to figure out how to make  ends meet. Many of them have  lost  their jobs. Others have seen that their  mortgage payments have gone up, their  utility costs are going up. And you  know what they are having to do? They  are having to sit down and revise their  budget. They are trying to figure out  instead of taking a vacation if they  need to go and fix the car.  What we have seen is the American  people are realizing that you can’t borrow and spend, borrow and spend, that  someday there is a day of reckoning.  And they are wondering why their government hasn’t figured that out.  Last week, Republicans  gave  the  American people an opportunity  to  voice their opinion about whether we  should cut expenses or not; 280,000 people said we should start cutting spending. And they are going to be given an  opportunity this week to express themselves as well.  Mr. Speaker, what they wonder  is  why Congress doesn’t get the message.  We saw today that the jobless rate is  up to 471,000 people. People are out of  work, Mr. Speaker. We need to get  Americans back to work and we need  to cut the spending. We need to listen  to the American people.  f  THE  SMALL  BUSINESS  INTERMEDIARY LENDING PILOT ACT  (Ms. KILROY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2010
903,5,2010-05-20,Ms. KILROY.," Mr. Speaker, when I  talk to people in my community, the  thing that they are most concerned  about are jobs and the economy. When  we took office, when I was sworn in  last January, we were losing jobs at an  atrocious rate, over 600,000  jobs per  month. Now we are seeing months of  job growth and adding jobs to our economy. That’s the good news.  We must continue to stay on this  pathway.

Mr. Speaker, I do want to commend,  as well, the chairman of our Education  and Labor Committee, Mr. GEORGE  MILLER, within whose jurisdiction the  Mine Safety Health Administration resides.

908,19,2010-05-20,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker,  let me  close as I began, saying first that we  could have done this under unanimous  consent. We all concur with the need to  ensure that we take steps to ensure  adequate oversight to ensure that we  never, ever, ever see the kind of loss of  life that we did in West Virginia or any  other mine disaster.  Mr. Speaker, the American people,  the hundreds of millions of Americans  who want us to rein in Federal spending have, unfortunately, because of the  Democratic majority, they have been  denied a voice here on the House floor.  They’re saying, Try and bring down the  size and scope and reach of government.  My friend, Dennis Prager, says, very  correctly, the bigger the government  grows, the smaller the individual becomes. And so we decided to utilize a  procedure here known as defeating the  previous question. And we said, Why  don’t we let the American people actually have a chance to be heard? And so  what we did is we put five proposals  out there on the Republican Whip’s  Web site and asked the American people to vote. Nearly 300,000 Americans  cast votes, and they ended up with  81,000 votes being cast in favor of a  measure that said, Gosh, should people  be  required  to work  for welfare or  should we have an open-ended policy  that allows them, without any kind of  accountability, to see States actually  rewarded for not having people have a  work component  in the welfare program?  So, Mr. Speaker, we said with that  overwhelming vote that we would use  this procedure to ensure that Democrats and Republicans alike would have  an opportunity  to make a decision  whether or not they want to go down  the road towards continued spending  where, again, we’ve had an 85 percent  increase  in nondefense discretionary  spending since President Obama has  been  in  office. And  that’s why  I  couldn’t understand why my  friend  from New Jersey was arguing that we  had an 8 percent increase when President Bush was there, and his answer is  a tenfold increase and that’s going to  solve the problem.  We know that we are deeper in the  hole. We have more serious problems  now, and the American people want us  to cut Federal  spending, and every  Democrat and Republican will have a  chance when we move to defeat the  previous question to do just that.  So, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that the text of the amendment and extraneous material be included in the RECORD just before the  vote on the previous question.  ",2010
909,19,2010-05-20,The SPEAKER pro tempore., Is there  objection to the request of the gentleman from California?  There was no objection.  ,2010
910,19,2010-05-20,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, with that,  I urge my colleagues to vote for reduced spending by defeating the previous question.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2010
911,19,2010-05-20,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker, this  has been a most interesting debate. As  I  started,  I  am  terribly  concerned  about what caused the awful mine disaster in West Virginia. I look forward  to finding out why that was. Lack of  government  oversight, without  any  question in my mind, will be a large  part of it, just as we’re finding out in  the oil spill.  This has also been an  interesting  afternoon of playing charades. I have a  6-year-old granddaughter who loves to  play a game with me. She will tell me  a tall tale, and then I pretend to believe  it. Then, at a moment of her  choosing, she says, ‘‘Gotcha.’’ Don’t let  them ‘‘getcha’’ today. What they have  been doing here is totally nongermane  to this bill. And if you all run up and  vote  ‘‘no’’ on the previous question,  they’re not going to bring this up, because they can’t.  Don’t be taken in by this again. The  Obama administration did not create  this awful problem, but we’re totally  aware of it, and we have undertaken responsibility to clean it up. And we’re  going to do that. As soon as the supplemental bill comes, we’re going to have  one of the best chances in the world if  we start to cut back the money that  we’re spending on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where we’ve already spent a  trillion dollars, lost enormous numbers  of our young soldiers, maimed many,  many more. And it is time for us to cut  that out. That, again, will start, along  with other things we are doing, to get  this country back on some solid footing.  Let me say to you once again, Please  come down here and vote ‘‘yes.’’ Don’t  be fooled by this. I imagine that this is  the beginning of every charade every  week,  sort  of  like  what  Mr.  said  about  the  COMPETES Act. Please don’t forget, my  colleagues, that twice we tried to vote  out that bill to create jobs, put people  back to work, and procedural games  have killed it, to the great concern of  the National Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce,  to name a couple.  So this afternoon I want you to come  down here as quick as you can, wherever you are, and put your ‘‘yes’’ in  here so that we can get this done and  to give Chairman MILLER the opportunity to use this deposition authority  with his staff to get to the bottom of  this mine disaster. We have many disasters of all stripes that we’re working  on, as you know. Don’t be held up by  what we have been through here today.  There’s no question about it, it’s nongermane.  The material previously referred to  by Mr. DREIERis as follows:  PERLMUTTER AMENDMENTTOH. RES. 1363  OFFEREDBYMR. DREIEROFCALIFORNIA  At the end of the resolution add the following new section:  SEC. 3. Immediately upon the adoption of  this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant  to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the  House resolved into the Committee of the  Whole House on the State of the Union for  consideration of the bill (H.R. 1277) to repeal  the emergency fund for the TANF program.  The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall  not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader or their respective designees.  After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute  rule. During consideration of the bill  for  amendment, the Chairman of the Committee  of the Whole may accord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member offering an amendment has caused it to be  printed in the portion of the Congressional  Record designated for that purpose in clause  8 of rule XVIII. Amendments so printed shall  be considered as read. At the conclusion of  consideration of the bill for amendment the  Committee shall rise and report the bill to  the House with such amendments as may  have been adopted. The previous question  shall be considered as ordered on the bill and  amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to  recommit with or without instructions. If  the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on  the bill, then on the next legislative day the  House  shall,  immediately after  the  third  daily order of business under clause 1 of rule  XIV,  resolve  into  the Committee of  the  Whole for further consideration of the bill.  Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the  consideration of H.R. 1277.  (The information contained below was provided by Democratic Minority on multiple  occasions throughout the 109th Congress.)  THEVOTEONTHEPREVIOUSQUESTION: WHAT  ITREALLYMEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the  previous question on a special rule, is not  merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering  the  previous  question  is  a  vote  against the Democratic majority agenda and  a vote to allow the opposition, at least for  the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It  is a vote about what the House should be debating.  Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the  House of Representatives, (VI, 308–311) describes the vote on the previous question on  the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the  consideration of the subject before the House  being made by the Member in charge.’’ To  defeat the previous question is to give the  opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s  ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that  ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the  control of the resolution to the opposition’’  in order to offer an amendment. On March  15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated  the previous question and a member of the  opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry,  asking who was  entitled  to  recognition.  Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said:  ‘‘The previous question having been refused,  the gentleman  from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to  yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to  the first recognition.’’  Because the vote today may look bad for  the Democratic majority they will say ‘‘the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:13 May 21, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K20MY7.044 H20MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 C L B Y K 8 K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2010
912,26,2010-05-20,Mr. THOMPSON  of Pennsylvania.,"  Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 56th  anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling of Brown v. Board of Education. It  was a landmark case known throughout this country for putting an end to  segregated schools.  The case was argued before the Supreme Court by the chief counsel for  the NAACP, Thurgood Marshall. The  decision by the Justices was unanimous when  they declared  that  the  State laws establishing separate public  schools for black and white students  was unconstitutional.  There followed a period of national  debate and unrest over the decision.  Then, in 1965, Congress passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,  which emphasized equal access to education and established high standards  and accountability in schools.  Fifty-six years after Brown and 45  years after the first ESEA, we are not  finished with our common goal of education equity for all students, whether  they attend schools in the inner city or  rural America.  As we contemplate ESEA reauthorization, I call upon my colleagues here  in the House to support a world-class  education system that provides every  student with the opportunity to live up  to his or her individual potential regardless of race, class, or geographic  location. This would be the greatest  and best remembrance of this  landmark case.  f  HONORING REV. BOBBY JOHNSON,  FIRST ASSEMBLY OF GOD, VAN  BUREN  (Mr. BOOZMAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2010
913,26,2010-05-20,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor Pastor Bobby L. Johnson for 30 years of leadership at Van  Buren’s First Assembly of God.  Under Pastor  Johnson’s  guidance,  First Assembly of God has enjoyed  much  success,  and  it  continues  to  reach new heights. From revivals and  youth camps to ministers’ retreats and  mission  crusades, Pastor  Johnson’s  message  resonates with  community  members, both young and old. Its Sunday  school  program, which  started  with 270 students, now has more than  2,000 students. In addition, its campus  houses a retirement center, which enables it to reach more seniors.  Pastor Johnson has  served  in  the  ministry  for many  years  and  has  touched the lives of countless individuals, including myself. In addition to  being pastor at First Assembly of God,  Pastor Johnson serves as a General  Presbyter of the Assemblies of God.  Prior to joining the First Assembly of  God, Van Buren, he served as the Arkansas District Assemblies  of God  Youth Director.  Mr. Speaker, Pastor Johnson’s dedication to spreading the gospel is unparalleled; his leadership is unsurpassed. I  ask that my colleagues recognized Pastor Johnson for his commitment and  service to the ministry and continued  success.  f  WORLD TRADE WEEK  (Ms. BEAN asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2010
914,26,2010-05-20,Ms. BEAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  with my fellow New Dems to highlight  the value of trade and exports to our  economy. During World Trade Week, it  is  important  for America  to  demonstrate  our  commitment  to  competing and leading in the global marketplace.  To bolster economic  recovery and  build sustainable economic growth and  employment  opportunities,  America  cannot cede emerging markets to our  global competitors. Instead, we must  recognize,  target, and  seek  to gain  share in high-growth, high-population  markets.  Trade agreements that give American workers and products access to  new markets, and greater share, are  critical to removing barriers to sustainable growth and competitiveness.  By ensuring these agreements do not  disadvantage American employers but,  instead, create a level playing field and  are enforced, American innovation and  work ethic can and will prevail in the  global economy.  I applaud and support the President’s  National Export Initiative to double  our exports in the next 5 years, and I  encourage the administration and Congress to resolve remaining issues and  move forward on passage of the pending trade agreements. New Dems look  forward to working with the administration to do just that.  f  YOUCUT  (Mr. HASTINGS of Florida asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)

915,26,2010-05-20,Mr.  HASTINGS  of  Florida.," Mr.  Speaker, yesterday in the Rules Committee, we met the newest ploy of the  Republicans, YouCut.  The rule under consideration was to  grant deposition authority to the staff  of Ed and Labor regarding the safety  issues surrounding the tragic loss of  life and  limb of coal miners. Enter  YouCut.  So-called 240,000 Americans voted on  the  Internet. The Republicans  then  chose to offer an amendment to the  previous question so that we could not  go  forward on  substantive business,  and to cut poor people’s opportunities.

919,33,2010-05-20,Mr. FLEMING.,"  I  thank  the  gentleman from Iowa. I would like to state  emphatically here  this evening, Mr.  Speaker, that I support the law of Arizona. Just as the gentleman said, it is  really a mirror image of the United  States law. I would say that those who  are against the law who criticize it,  some in our own government, do so for  very interesting reasons. It is not really the law that they have such a problem with. It is the fact that we are enforcing a law that already exists. If  that were not the case, then why, Mr.  Speaker,  do  these  people who  are  against this Arizona  law, why don’t  they simply bring a bill to the floor  and vote to repeal the existing American law. But that is not happening.  What we have had is a wink and a  nod for many years, in which case we  have a law on the books—I think it is  a good law, it is not a perfect law—but  a  law  that  if we  enforced  it, we  wouldn’t have the problems that we  have today. Let’s just take a moment  to understand why we have the problems that we have.  I lived in the San Diego, California,  area some years ago, and it was very  interesting. When you would leave San  Diego and drive across the border into  Tijuana, here we are, two cities that  are so close together that they abut  one another, and yet on one side of the  border you have beautiful homes, million dollar homes. You have wonderful  bridges and infrastructure. And then as  you cross the border, you find poverty.  You find dirt roads. You find people in  some cases living in the streets.  b1800  So there is such a chasm between the  standard of  living below the border  than above that border, no wonder people try to cross the border for opportunity. I can’t blame them for doing  that.  But the problem is that it’s a cultural and political problem that exists  in Mexico today. And so rather than  pointing his  finger at us, President  Calderon should, I think, address the  problems in his country, and that is  the fact that they have a high level of  corruption, a high level of poverty.  I do agree with the gentleman from  Iowa  (Mr. KING) that he  is doing a  much better job about the drug cartels  and  enforcing  those  laws  than any  President in modern times from Mexico, so I definitely tip my hat to him  for that.  But there is also no middle class in  Mexico today. And  like many third  world countries, it’s mostly a poverty-  driven country, where many people are  desperate for work and desperate for  opportunities. But on the other hand,  there is 10 percent or so of the population that lives a wealthy lifestyle.  But there’s very few opportunities for  upward mobility.  And let’s just finally look at it. We’re  all descendents of immigrants at one  point or another, and our ancestors  came here because they were looking  for opportunity. And we have many  people around the world who come here  looking for opportunity, and we have a  way for them to do that.  I think it was the gentleman from  California earlier that mentioned that  600-something  thousand  legal  immigrants came to this country last year.  So we have a way of doing that, although we, I think, could make it better. We could make it more efficient.  But the truth is there is a legal way to  immigrate to the United States, and  we should make that available, and we  do make that available.  On the other hand—and I welcome  those  immigrants. But on the other  hand, those who come across our borders  illegally,  inappropriately,  and  who, in many ways, create danger for  our own citizens, create problems for  our own economy in terms of the need  for education for their children and for  health care, doing that illegally is not  a solution to the problem. It may be a  short-term  solution  for  their  immediate economic problems, but Mexico  has got to address its own economic  and cultural problems. And we, on the  other hand, have got to take care of  our borders, our sovereignty here.  And so, again, I would just reiterate  that I do support Arizona’s bold move,  I think a necessary move, to protect  their borders, to protect their economy. I believe it’s Phoenix that is considered the kidnapping capital of at  least  the United States,  if not  the  world. And who can blame the people of  Arizona for doing for themselves what  the Federal Government refuses to do,  even though it has an obligation to do  that?  And  then, as  the gentleman  from  Texas (Mr. POE) points out, and the  gentleman  from  Iowa  (Mr. KING) as  well, we have the Attorney General sitting here today right in front of this  body and having already admitted, confessed that he didn’t read the law to  begin with; and, after all, it’s essentially the same law that he’s agreed to  uphold and defend as Attorney General,  and somehow agreeing with the President from another country who says we  should turn a blind eye to the illegal  immigrants who are coming across the  border.  So I would just say that I agree with  the two gentlemen here tonight. It’s  time something is done. And I agree  with the efforts of Arizona, and I do  think other States are going to take  this up as well and come up with similar laws.  And I think we here in the body of  the U.S. Congress should also move forward with immigration reform, but not  in the form of amnesty that we hear  about from the other side, but a true  reform where we can more efficiently  allow people to come across the border  to work here temporarily if there are  jobs for them in a legal way, but make  sure  that  they  return when  they’re  done; and, on the other hand, those  who are here illegally return and never  come back in an illegal status.  ",2010
920,33,2010-05-20,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Reclaiming my  time, and I thank the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. FLEMING).  A number of things come to mind as  I listened to the dialog here. One of  them was lurking in the back of my  mind that I had to go back and find. It  was a statement that was made by  President Calderon  that  I’d  like  to  have a sit-down conversation with him  on, when he said in the early part of  his speech today, he said, As you can  see, Mexico was founded on the same  values and principles as the United  States of America. I don’t think I can  see that. I’d like to know what he’s  thinking about and talking about when  he makes that statement. There are  certainly principles that are similar  and principles that are identical, but  there are principles on the way the  United States was  founded that are  unique to the United States of America. And that’s a conversation for another time.  I pose that question out there, and if  anybody has an answer to that, I’m not  illuminated  enough on  that  subject  matter to see into his mind to understand what he’s actually saying so that  I can agree with him. No, I disagree  with him until I can find a better explanation.

921,47,2010-05-20,Mr. HARKIN.," Madam President,  I  also ask unanimous consent to have  printed in the RECORD a letter dated  April 30 from the National Association  of Insurance Commissioners.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCECOMMISSIONERS, THECENTER  INSURANCEPOLICY ANDREFOR SEARCH,  Washington, DC, Apr. 30, 2010.  Hon. CHRISTOPHERDODD  Russell Senate Office Building,  Washington, DC.  DEARSENATORDODD: We are writing to  convey the support of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) for  efforts to preserve state regulatory authority over  indexed annuities  inherent  in S.  1389, the Fixed Indexed Annuities and Insurance Products Classification Act of 2009. This  legislation, which would nullify the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Rule  151A and clarify the scope of the exemption  for annuities and insurance contracts from  federal regulation, will help ensure that consumers continue to benefit from the vital  consumer protections provided by state insurance regulators.  The NAIC represents the chief insurance  regulators from the 50 states, the District of  Columbia, and five U.S. territories, whose  primary objectives are to protect consumers  and promote healthy insurance markets. As  regulators vigilantly working towards these  goals, we strongly believe that this SEC rule  is unnecessary and distracts from important  ongoing efforts at the NAIC and in the states  to address emerging  issues concerning  indexed annuities.  Rule 151A ignores the fact that, at their  core, indexed annuities are insurance products  that guarantee purchasers’ principal  and a minimum rate of return. Though index  performance may reduce payments above the  minimum rate of return, the consumer still  has a guaranteed benefit and  the  fundamental risk lies with the company, not the  consumer. For this reason, indexed annuities  are  fundamentally  insurance products and  should be regulated by state insurance regulators who can approve annuities contracts  before they can be introduced to the market,  monitor individuals involved with the sales  and marketing of the annuities, and regulate  the  investments and  financial strength of  the issuing company. We believe that the uncertainties and ambiguities created by the  new SEC regulatory scheme could greatly  hinder these rigorous consumer protections.  Additionally, Rule 151A will greatly constrain the product distribution channel. Indexed annuities can be sold through several  distribution  channels  by  companies,  but  under Rule 151 A indexed annuities would  only be sold through one distribution system—the broker dealer channel. Since fewer  people have a broker dealer connection, especially in the less populated areas, whereas  almost all have an insurance representative,  this product will become less available to  consumers.  Thank you for your efforts to ensure that  states can continue to protect consumers of  annuities. We look forward to working with  you to enact this important piece of legislation.  Sincerely,  JANEL. CLINE,  West Virginia  Insurance  Commissioner,  NAIC President.  SUSANE. VOSS,  Iowa Insurance Commissioner,  NAIC  President-Elect.

925,54,2010-05-20,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Madam President, I wanted to discuss very briefly  an amendment that I have filed with  respect to the  independence of compensation consultants.  As we all know, executive compensation has been a significant issue in this  country. Much of executive compensation is set on the advice of compensation consultants. I had an interesting  meeting  earlier  this year with  the  Obama administration’s ‘‘pay czar,’’ he  is called, and he said when he was in  the process of trying to work out how  he should try to restructure executive  compensation, he tried to find an independent compensation consultant  to  advise him. He found he could not find  a single compensation consultant  in  the country who met his standards for  independence.  This amendment would ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to set  standards  for  independence  for compensation consultants, so that when,  consistent with  this  legislation,  the  compensation committee of a board  has to evaluate which compensation  consultant to hire, they get an independent seal of approval from the SEC,  and they can know they are doing the  right thing; and, of course, we can assure that we have independent compensation consultants and not people  who get paid  in order to encourage  higher salaries for CEOs in our country.  I had a brief discussion about this  with the chairman. He expressed some  interest in it. I understand we will be  continuing to work together to try to  get this language incorporated into the  final bill. I expressed my appreciation  to him for his consideration. I believe  it matches the language on the House  side, so maybe it is something we can  do  in conference. But, clearly,  this  question of compensation  is an area  where the chairman has been a leader,  and I look forward to working with  him.  ",2010
926,54,2010-05-20,Mr. DODD.," Madam President, in response to my colleague, I thank him.  He was been very active in the debate  on  this bill.  I am grateful  for his  thoughts and ideas. This is a very important proposal—one that we have not  adopted. It is in the House bill. I told  my friend I would be anxious to pursue  the idea he has incorporated because,  obviously, this is subject matter that  has probably evoked more public interest almost more than any other aspect  of the crisis over the last 2 years. Obviously, people have lost homes and jobs  and retirement  income and the economic damage done to the country; but  people seemed to understand this issue  from the very beginning more than almost anything  else, particularly  in  light of the fact that taxpayers were  writing the check of $700 billion to stabilize, we are told, and preserve many  of these institutions.  What was degrading to many people  is, in the midst of all that, we watched  some executives take excessive bonuses  who could only receive them because  the American taxpayer stabilized and  preserved those companies as a result  of that legislation.  What also bothered me beyond that, I  might have thought at some particular  point the executives might have expressed their appreciation to the American taxpayers for stabilizing and saving some of these institutions. They  not only didn’t do that, in most instances they went out and took significant bonuses that were only available  because the companies had been saved  by  the American  taxpayer. So  this  issue is one that I think had more to do  with inflaming public passions about  what happened almost more than anything else I can think of.  Our colleague from Rhode Island has  crafted a proposal that would go to  deal with this issue. I applaud him for  that. I hope we can work something  out that will meet his concerns.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  BURRIS). The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",2010

929,54,2010-05-20,Mr. ENSIGN.," Mr. President,  the  American people have accused Washington and this Chamber of being far  too partisan, and they have been right.  But I would venture to guess that we  can reach a bipartisan agreement on  the fact that our economy has taken a  major hit over the last few years—a hit  that I would argue we have yet to recover from. So here we are, debating  another massive bill that is supposed  to stave off another economic disaster.  But does it do that?  I am sure that most here are familiar  with the children’s tale of the boy who  cried wolf far too often. The problem  faced by this character was that when  there was an emergency—such as the  wolf verging on attack—there wasn’t  anyone around to take that alarm seriously. This is the path we are heading  down.  The Senate is passing a massive bill,  after many other massive bills that we  have passed, and expanding the Federal  Government to an unsustainable level,  all in the name of avoiding another  economic downturn. But what we are  doing here is setting our country up on  a course that we cannot correct and  creating unintended consequences that  may ultimately rain more economic  damage down on the American people.

931,68,2010-05-20,Mr. GRASSLEY.," The current financial reform bill will not end the cycle  of  financial booms and busts. This  cycle is not the result of green, or capitalism, or animal spirits, or irrational  exuberance. Ultimately, it is caused by  our  failure to recognize and enforce  traditional  legal principles, namely,  the protection of private property.  According to Huerta de Soto: It is a  remarkable fact that three of the most  noted monetary theorists of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries  were  bankers:  John  Law,  Richard  Cantillon, and Henry Thornton. Their  banks all failed.  Law was  involved  in the  infamous  Mississippi scheme, and Cantillon was  involved in a fraudulent stock trading  scheme. Only Thornton escaped controversy because his bank did not fail  until after his death. All of these bankers were  actively  involved  in  convincing their colleagues and customers  of the safety, soundness, and wisdom of  violating traditional legal principles.  Once upon a time, common sense as  well as  the  law  recognized  the difference between a demand deposit and  a loan deposit.  According to Huerta de Soto, ancient  Roman law made it clear that bankers  carried out two different types of operations. On one hand, they accepted demand deposits, which involved no right  to interest and obligated the bank to  maintain the continuous availability of  the money; and the depositor had absolute privilege  in  the case of bankruptcy. On the other hand, bankers  also received loan deposits, which obligated the banker to pay interest on the  money; and the depositor  lacked all  privileges in the case of bankruptcy.  The clear distinction between these  two types of deposits began to break  down with the unfortunate choice of a  penalty for the failure to return a demand deposit. A banker who accepted a  demand deposit and later failed to return the money upon demand was obligated to pay a penalty in the form of  interest.  According to Huerta de Soto, the ban  on usury by the three major monotheistic  religions—Judaism,  Islam,  and  Christianity—did much to complicate  and obscure medieval financial practices. Historically, usury meant charging any interest on a loan. Today, it  means charging excessive interest on a  loan.  Since it was forbidden to pay interest on  loans, it is easy to understand how convenient it was in the Middle Ages to disguise a  loan as a deposit in order to make the payment of interest legal, legitimate and socially acceptable. For this reason, bankers  started to systematically engage  in operations in which the parties openly declared  they were entering into a deposit contract  and not a loan contract.  The method of concealment . ulated [demand] deposit which . . was a sim. was not a  . . true [demand] deposit at all, but rather a  loan [deposit]. At the end of the agreed-upon  term, the supposed depositor claimed his  money. When the [bank] failed to return [the  money], [the bank] was forced to pay a ‘‘penalty’’ in the [form] of interest on [its] presumed ‘‘delay.’’  Disguising loans as deposits became an effective way to get around the canonical ban  on interest and escape severe sanctions, both  secular and spiritual.  It would appear the history of banking consists of a continuous effort to  eliminate  the  distinction  between  these two types of deposits. I do not  mean to criticize modern day bankers.  I suspect they are largely unaware of  this  history.  They  simply  operate  under the rules as they exist today.  Anyone who studies money and banking  in college  is taught about  fractional reserves, deposit insurance, and  the need for a central bank to serve as  lender of last resort. This is standard  fare that passes for higher education  around the world.  As economist John Maynard Keynes  once observed,  ‘‘even the most practical man of affairs is usually in the  thrall of the ideas of some long-dead  economist.’’  Having said all this, the question remains: Where do we go from here?  To answer that question let me return to the topic of money. In a world  of paper currency—without the backing of any tangible commodity—the  supply of money is ultimately determined by the government.  In most countries, the power to create money has been delegated by the  government to a central bank. The central bank in turn controls the money  supply in a number of ways: buying and  selling financial assets—so-called discount window or open-market operations—and requiring banks to keep  deposits at the central bank—so-called  reserve requirements.  As our Nation’s central bank, it is  often suggested that the Federal Reserve controls both interest rates and  the money supply. However, the only  interest rate the Fed controls is the  discount rate. That is the rate the Fed  charges other banks when they borrow  money from the Fed. The Fed generally  prefers that banks borrow from each  other. So, it usually sets the discount  rate higher than the rate banks charge  each other. That rate is called the Federal funds rate.  U.S. banks are required to hold reserves as a percentage of their demand  deposits, but not their loan deposits.  These reserves are designed to cover  daily withdrawals. On any given day,  some banks may have a reserve shortfall, while others may have excess reserves. Thus, banks borrow from each  other on an overnight basis. The Fed  sets a  target  for  the  interest  rate  banks charge each other—the Federal  funds rate—and then  it attempts to  achieve its target.  According  to  the  textbook  explanation, when the Fed wants to lower  the Federal funds rate, it buys financial assets, such as government bonds,  from other banks and pays for them by  creating additional reserves. This  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  creating  money out of thin air. Since the banks  now have more reserves, they are generally willing to lend at a lower rate.  When the Fed wants to raise the Federal funds rate, it sells financial assets  back to the banks and withdraws the  additional reserves. Since the banks  now have fewer reserves, they will usually require borrowers to pay a higher  interest rate.  The Fed can also change the supply  of money by changing the reserve requirement. By raising or lowering the  reserve requirement, the Fed can control how much money banks must hold  in reserve. Higher reserves mean less  money is available for banks to lend,  and lower reserves mean more money  to lend.  Although central banks control the  money supply in the long run, in the  short run individual banks are largely  in control.  As the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago explained in its publication Modern Money Mechanics:  In the real world, a bank’s lending is not  normally constrained by the amount of reserves it has at any given moment. Rather,  loans are made, or not made, depending on  the bank’s credit policies and its expectations about its ability to obtain the funds  necessary to pay its customers’ checks and  maintain required reserves in a timely fashion.  In other words, when banks make  loans, they create new deposits, thereby increasing the money supply. In the  short run, banks are free to make as  many loans as they want based solely  on their expectation of future repayment and their ability to meet required  reserves  and  expected withdrawals,  plus their capital requirements.  In the long run, central banks control reserve requirements and the cost  of borrowing  excess  reserves. Thus,  they can eventually prevent individual  banks  from endlessly expanding  the  money supply.  Money can be defined as the thing  that all other goods and services are  traded for, or as the means to achieve  final settlement of all transactions. As  the means of final payment, money is  uniquely valued above all other assets.  It is considered to be the most liquid  because it is accepted by everyone and  it trades at face value. That is, $1 is always equal to $1.  Because banks have the power to create money—within limits set by the  central bank—they are viewed with a  high degree of suspicion. But banks are  ultimately at the mercy of their customers because they are obligated to  convert deposits into cash. When banks  lose the confidence of their customers,  they are subject to bankruptcy if too  many customers try to withdraw their  money.

932,75,2010-05-20,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 10  minutes.  ,2010
933,75,2010-05-20,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, first of  all, I thank Senator MERKLEY for his  extraordinary work on this amendment  of ours. We are very hopeful we are  going to be able to get to a vote. As it  stands right now, we are going to get  to a vote because we are the pending  amendment. That is where it stands.  We are in order. We are germane. It is  postcloture but we are germane. The  only way we know of where we could be  thwarted from getting to a vote is if  there were a decision made on  the  other side to withdraw the underlying  amendment. We hope that decision will  not be made.  These issues are too important not to  be voted on. A parliamentary trick  should not be used now to avoid a vote  on  this critically  important amendment, which will strengthen in very  significant ways the underlying Dodd  bill.  We saw, weeks ago, that the Republican leadership was going to try to  deny us the opportunity to even get to  this bill, and there was such a public  outrage at the Republican  filibuster  that they had to back off from that.  Well, if we do not get to a vote tonight  on Merkley-Levin, there is going to be  similar outrage  from people because  they understand what the stakes are.  The stakes are whether we are going to  take the steps to avoid a repeat of the  deep recession we are now in—a recession that was brought about in large  measure by the excesses, the extreme  greed of Wall Street, taking high-risk  mortgages,  dubious  mortgages,  securitizing them, dicing them, slicing  them in different ways, enlarging the  risk dramatically, selling them to clients and customers, and then, to add  insult  to  injury,  betting  against  them—in the case of Goldman Sachs,  making a fortune on those bets; in the  case of the banks that bet the other  way, ending up being bailed out by the  taxpayers on the losing bets.  That is what has happened. While our  constituents may not be able to define  what a collateralized debt obligation is  or what a naked default swap is—and  there are very few people in the country who can—they do know they have  been had. They know how many houses  in their neighborhoods have been vacated, have been foreclosed upon. They  know because they themselves or their  neighbors have been unable to keep up  with mortgage payments because the  value of housing has gone down, and  they sense that the Wall Street greed  was a big part of this.  It is more than the greed. It is the  conflicts  of  interest which  accompanied that greed. Our bill addresses  some of the major problems that got us  here, and some of that is proprietary  trading where the Wall Street banks  put their own interests ahead of their  clients’  interests and gambled—gambled, as  it ended up—with our taxpayers’ money.  So our constituents understand this.  What I want to do is spend the few  minutes I have left talking about the  conflict of interest that existed on Wall  Street: betting against themselves. I  think yesterday’s New York Times perhaps quoted someone who put it best—  a man named Cornelius Hurley, director of the Morin Center for Banking  and Financial Law at Boston University and former counsel to the Federal  Reserve Board. This is what he said:  Their business model—  The business model that now exists  at banks such as Goldman—  has completely blurred the difference between executing trades on behalf of customers versus executing trades  for themselves. It’s a huge problem.  That shift in the business model has  to be addressed by us. We have to act  to put an end to the conflict of interest  which exists when a Goldman Sachs—  as we showed at our hearing—is able to  sell securities to customers, packaging  these mortgage-based  debts,  these  asset-backed securities or these securities which referred to assets—these are  the synthetic ones where there is nothing there but a reference to some other  security,  a  bet—and  then  betting  against their own customers.  This was one of the most dramatic  findings of our subcommittee. Our subcommittee investigated this matter for  about a year and a half. We had four  hearings. We had millions of pages of  documents. We started with a bank in  the State of Washington which took  dubious mortgages—fraudulent mortgages, in many cases, in a large percentage of  the cases—based on  liar  loans, where the mortgage companies  would fill in the amount of people’s income and then securitize them. Because they saw—and we had the evidence in their e-mails, where the mortgage companies saw—there was a high  default rate in these mortgages, they  decided they better get them off their  books quick because there were high  defaults coming down the river.  So what happened? They securitized  them, shipped these to a very welcoming Wall Street that would then  resecuritize them, slice them in a different way, sell them to their customers, and then bet against them. The  added insult was when, inside the same  bank, the salespeople knew they were  selling junk and said so in e-mails in  words  that  are  even  worse  than  ‘‘junk’’—treating customers that way,  putting their own interests at Goldman  Sachs ahead of the interests of their  customers.  That is what happened. We have to  end this conflict, and we have to give  the Securities and Exchange Commission the running orders to end the conflict. That  is what our amendment  does. We do it in a very thoughtful  way, a very careful way. We set forth  the requirement that the conflict of interest be ended, but we assign the Securities and Exchange Commission the  responsibility to end it, to implement  the conflict of interest prohibition we  have in our bill.  As Senator MERKLEY said, we have  heard there is a possibility that the Republicans are going to withdraw the  underlying amendment. That would be  an  incredible signal of the power of  Wall  Street  that  the  underlying  amendment, which has the support of  so many people on both sides of the  aisle—and probably majority support  in this body relative to the treatment  of  car  loans—that  that amendment  might be withdrawn in order to kill  Merkley-Levin. That is the rumor we  keep hearing this afternoon. It is the  only way they can stop this amendment from coming to a vote that we  know of.  We believe, as Senator MERKLEYsaid,  there should be a vote on both amendments; that these two matters should  be split. The only way we could get a  vote on Merkley-Levin—this incredibly  important  strengthening  amendment  to the underlying Dodd bill—was by offering it as a second-degree amendment  to the Brownback amendment. We are  perfectly happy to have separate votes.

934,82,2010-05-20,Mr. KAUFMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today, as I have many times this Congress, to talk about the role of fraud at  the heart of the financial crisis.  I have previously discussed the urgent need for law enforcement to give  high priority to the investigation and  prosecution of financial fraud, and for  Congress to provide law enforcement  with the tools it needs to do so, including increased funding and stiffer sentences.  I was proud to work with Senator  LEAHY last year on the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. I was proud to  work again with Senator LEAHY, as  well as Senator BAUCUS, the leader, and  many others to include key antifraud  provisions in the health care legislation signed into law in March.  Last month, I, along with the other  members  of  the  Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations, my Senate colleagues, and Americans watching at home, were treated to a truly revelatory series of hearings chaired by  Senator LEVIN.  Chairman LEVINand his staff deserve  high praise for their tenacity and diligence: Beginning in the fall of 2008 and  culminating this spring, the chairman  and his staff reviewed millions of pages  of documents, conducted over 100 interviews, and consulted with dozens of experts.  Thanks to the Levin hearings, we  now have a thorough accounting of  what happened—and what went wrong.  Mortgage origination practices were  rife with fraud, and bank management  and bank regulators failed miserably in  their oversight.  The  practice  of  mortgage  securitization allowed everyone in the  financial  industry  to earn  lucrative  fees  and  commissions,  even  though  banks  knew  that  these  securitized  mortgages were filled with liar’s loans  and  other  fraudulent  products  that  practically guaranteed their eventual  collapse.  At all levels of the industry, compensation  structures  favored  the  riskiest loans and the most minimal  oversight. As a  result, underwriting  standards were laughable. Banks didn’t  care that they were writing bad loans  because  they did not believe  those  loans would stay on their books.  The regulators and ratings agencies  were totally captured by the banks,  due in part to their absolute dependence on the banks for revenue. The Office of Thrift Supervision  relied on  Washington Mutual for 12–15 percent of  its operating budget.  The credit ratings agencies gamed by  investment banks, which had reverse  engineered  their models—bent  over  backwards to stamp AAA and other investment grade ratings on what was  actually junk because they needed the  fees.  Investment  banks marketed  synthetic CDOs, which they had permitted  the ‘‘big shorts’’ to design so that they  were most likely to fail, in some cases  without disclosing that material information to their customers and despite  their own inherent conflict of interest.  As long as the music played, there  was plenty of money to go around. But  when the music stopped, banks were  bailed out and the American taxpayers  were left without a chair.  Fixing the system requires an all out  effort by the bank regulators, the FBI,  the SEC, and the Justice Department.  And Congress should not rest until in  its oversight capacity we are convinced  that  a  systemic,  strategic  and  foundational approach to targeting and  prosecuting fraud is well funded and  well underway.  Bank  regulators,  especially, must  execute a 180-degree cultural turn, assisting the FBI by providing roadmaps  to the fraud that has occurred.  But we still need to do far more than  just add more cops to the beat and ensure that they’re  looking  in all the  right places. We also need to realign  incentives so that banks are encouraged to make sound loans, so that credit ratings agencies can dispense untainted  evaluations  of  creditworthiness, and so regulators aren’t beholden  to those they regulate.  That is why I am proud to support  Senator LEVIN’s package of amendments. Each of the eight proposals in  the package grows directly out of lessons learned through the Levin hearings.  The Levin-Kafuman package will restore regulatory independence by instituting a cooling off period for regulators—putting a stop to the revolving  door between industry and regulator.  The amendment will also guarantee  that the FDIC as secondary regulator  can never again be shut out of an examination by the primary regulator.  To realign bankers’ incentives, the  Levin-Kaufman package will  require  that anybody who securitizes a pool of  loans must maintain at least a 5-percent stake in a representative sampling  of those securities. Other risky lending  practices would be banned outright,  such as synthetic asset-backed securities, which have no purpose other than  speculation.  Finally,  the package will  improve  oversight and operation of the credit  ratings agencies by prohibiting them  from relying on faulty due diligence  and by permitting the SEC to monitor  and regulate the methodologies that  the ratings agencies employ.  The Levin hearings also set in stark  relief the untenable conflicts that rest  at the heart of our financial system.  The Levin hearings focused on the  residential housing market. But conflicts  of  interest  permeate  almost  every corner of our capital markets,  whether in the context of asset backed  securities, or proprietary trading, or a  broker selling private order flow into a  private dark pool, or the prioritization  of trades by a broker ahead of its clients.  We simply cannot  leave  it to the  banks and the brokers to manage conflicts of interest in any way they see  fit. If we can learn one thing from the  financial crisis, surely, it is that.  Under current law, broker-dealers are  not required to disclose conflicts of interest to their clients. They are not required to resolve conflicts in favor of  their clients. They are not required to  act in the best interests of their clients.  In fact, they are permitted to knowingly fleece their clients, provided the  client  is  ‘‘sophisticated’’ enough and  provided the broker has disclosed the  requisite information about the product.  This must change. We can’t expect a  full economic recovery without restoring the public’s trust in markets. This  is why I support, and have cosponsored,  two amendments that would impose a  fiduciary duty on the part of broker-  dealers to their customers, one sponsored by Senator SPECTER and  the  other by Senator AKAKA.  Imposing such a duty would protect  investors and improve the level of integrity  in our  capital markets. No  longer would brokers  like Goldman  Sachs be able to withhold critical information about its conduct from clients and conceal fraud under the cover  of caveat emptor.  Just as important, it would help address the widespread and understandable mistrust  of  the  securitization  process, which in turn makes capital  more expensive and hinders recovery.  I also support Senator SPECTER’s aiding and abetting amendment, which  would reinstate an important deterrent  to the sorts of fraud that contributed  to our current financial crisis.  On March 15, 2010, I came to the Senate floor to discuss the Bankruptcy Examiner’s report on Lehman Brothers  and said—as many of us have suspected  all along—that there was fraud at the  heart of the financial crisis.  Lehman Brothers could not have accomplished  this apparent  fraud—the  use of so-called Repo 105 transactions  to  ‘‘window dress’’  its balance sheet  and mislead  investors—without  the  help of its accounting firm.  And that is true of many sophisticated fraud schemes, where the advice  or analysis of third parties enables or  facilitates the fraud.  Those third parties were answerable  to their victims in court, and therefore  faced a real deterrent, at least until  1994. That year,  in Central Bank of  Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, a divided Supreme Court rejected  years of settled precedent and limited  Federal law in this area to so-called  ‘‘primary violators.’’ The Central Bank  decision, like many others since, reflected the Court’s probusiness bias. It  also left the SEC alone to bring civil  suits against aiders and abettors, and  too often left victims holding the bag.  Regulators will fail. When they do,  however, we must depend on professionals such as accountants and lawyers  to acquit  their  roles as gatekeepers against accounting fraud, not  to materially aid that fraud.

935,103,2010-05-20,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I am  proud to join Senator FRANKENin sponsoring the Student Non-Discrimination  Act of 2010, SNDA, an important step  in our march toward a more inclusive  Nation. This bill continues the civil  rights work we began earlier this Congress when  I  offered  the Matthew  Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate  Crimes Prevention Act as an amendment to the defense authorization bill  last year. The Student Non-Discrimination Act will ensure that under Federal law, all public school children are  protected equally from discrimination.  Children deserve a safe environment  where they can learn the skills and  knowledge necessary to be good citizens.  More than 55 years ago, in the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court reaffirmed  our Nation’s commitment to  justice  and equal rights for all Americans by  ending racial segregation in our public  schools. A unanimous Court recognized  that ‘‘it is doubtful that any child may  reasonably be expected to succeed in  life if he [or she] is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken  to provide it, is a right which must be  made available to all on equal terms.’’  Congress continued on the path of  progress by passing laws like the Civil  Rights Act  of  1964,  the Education  Amendments of 1972, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. These laws protected  students  in  federally-funded  public  schools from discrimination and harassment based on race, national origin,  sex, and disability. President John F.  Kennedy said in 1963, ‘‘Simple justice  requires that public funds, to which all  taxpayers . . . contribute, not be spent  in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes or results in . . .  discrimination.’’  Tragically, for far too long, U.S. taxpayer  dollars  have  gone  to  public  school systems that tolerate or perpetuate discrimination, harassment, and  even violence based on sexual orientation and gender  identity. To paraphrase Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,  ‘‘now is the time to make justice a reality’’ for all of our children—now is  the time for Congress to extend existing Federal protections against discrimination to all public school students.  The legislation we introduce today  does just that by prohibiting discrimination and harassment based on actual  or perceived  sexual orientation and  gender  identity  in  public, non-religious, federally-funded schools.  Vermont has recognized the importance of creating a safe school environment  for our children.  In  1993,  the  State legislature enacted a law to protect school children from harassment  based on sexual orientation, and  in  2007, the law was strengthened to protect against harassment based on gender identity. Nine other States and the  District of Columbia protect  school  children from discrimination based on  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:48 May 21, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A20MY6.056 S20MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2010
936,124,2010-05-20,Mr. CONAWAY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to remember and pay tribute to the life  of Grace Stengel Thompson.  Grace was born in Menard, Texas, to a German pioneering  family on August 12, 1916.  Her grandparents were Peter and Emma Jordan, who settled on Upper Willow Creek  in  Mason County  in 1856. Her parents were  George and Louise Stengel, who were prominent members of  the Menard  community.  Grace and her husband, Claude, had  three  children—Toni  Thompson  Hurlbut,  Judith  Thompson Hunter and Claude John Thompson. Grace also has six grandchildren,  ten  great-grandchildren,  one  great-great-grandchild, and many nieces, nephews and cousins.  Grace was proud of her heritage and of her  large extended family; she kept up with many  of her cousins, aunts, uncles, nieces, and  nephews, loved them all, and loved being with  them especially at family gatherings. Her front  door was always open, as was her table. The  family remembers many fine ‘‘spur of the moment’’ meals she  fixed  for whoever showed  up. To say that she was a wonderful cook and  hostess is quite an understatement.  After graduating from Menard High School,  Grace attended Texas Tech University, and it  was at Tech  that Grace met her husband,  Claude, who was President of  the Student  Body while she was Secretary of the Student  Body. They were married in Menard in July of  1937. Grace was a  life-long  supporter of  Texas Tech, and especially  the university’s  athletic programs.  Grace moved  from Menard  to  Lubbock  when son John enrolled at Texas Tech University. While there, she served as administrative assistant to three Deans of Students from  1972 until 1983. Grace belonged to the PEO  Sisterhood and she was also a member of  Delta Delta Delta Sorority. Grace was a lifelong Methodist who  loved  the Lord and all  around her.  Grace passed away on May 13, 2010,  in  Fredericksburg, Texas. Services were held on  May 15, 2010 at  the First United Methodist  Church of Mason, Texas, and the burial followed at Rest Haven Cemetery  in Menard,  Texas.  Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to honor  Grace’s life and to offer her many family and  friends my deepest condolences. Grace was  adored by all those who knew her, and she  will be missed.  HON.

Lee Elementary School.  Mrs. Acors began her  teaching career  in  1957 after graduating from Mary Washington  College with a degree in psychology. Over the  first part of her career, she taught first, second, third, and fifth grades. In 1974 she graduated  from  the University of Virginia’s Curry  School of Education with a Master’s in Education degree. After  receiving her Virginia  state certification as a Reading Specialist, she  began serving as Robert E. Lee’s Reading  Specialist and has served in that position to  the present day. She has taught children and  grandchildren of her early students, and this  year she is teaching her first great-grandchild.  Mrs.  Acors  has  taught  through many  changes—new  trends  in education and  the  ever-increasing use of technology in the classroom. She made it her goal to embrace and  utilize innovative teaching methods in accordance with new research findings. In 2001, she  was named  the University of Virginia’s Elementary Teacher of the Year and in 2008 she  was  named  Robert  E.  Lee  Elementary  School’s Teacher of the Year. To summarize  her outstanding career, Mrs. Rebecca Acors  has had a positive impact on colleagues, parents, community members, and most  importantly, children. As she described  it,  ‘‘To be  able  to help children accept  themselves,  to  challenge each child to reach his/her full potential and to give the gift of reading is invaluable.  I am content  in knowing  that  I have  changed lives and made a difference in this  world.’’  Rebecca Acors devoted her life to the children of Virginia and I congratulate and commend her on this significant achievement.  f  CONGRATULATING  STAFF  SGT.

942,131,2010-05-20,Mr. TIBERI.," Madam Speaker, I am pleased  to honor Janet Brenneman on the occasion of  her  retirement  from  the Delaware County  Board of Elections.  Throughout our history, countless individuals  have striven to preserve and expand one of  our most  fundamental rights —  the right of  every American  to cast a ballot.  Informed,  thoughtful participation in our electoral process  by all citizens has been valued by generations  of Americans as the quintessential action helping propel  the United States onto  the world  stage as the foremost example of self-government.  The dedicated men and women working at  our  local boards of election can  trace  their  civic lineage to the suffragettes and freedom  riders of the past. They are the defenders of  our most cherished public act. In this pursuit,  Janet Brenneman has devoted  the  last 35  years of her  life  to  the people of Delaware  County. Whether through long hours on election night or her tireless advocacy to inform  the voters, Janet established an unparalleled  standard of excellence for all other election officers to emulate.  The Delaware Board of Elections stands out  as an example for other counties throughout  Ohio. Janet’s quality of service  is matched  only by the quality of her character. A devoted  friend to colleagues and a trustworthy public  servant to voters, Janet’s many virtues, both  professional and personal, will certainly be  missed and hard to replace.  I  offer  my  congratulations  to  Janet  Brenneman on her  retirement and  join her  friends and  family  in celebrating  this great  milestone. On behalf of the citizens of Delaware County and the 12th Congressional District of Ohio, I offer my thanks and gratitude  for her many years of service.  f  HONORING MS. GLORIA CHAO,  RUTGERS LAW LIBRARIAN  HON. ROBERT E. ANDREWS  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 20, 2010  ",2010
943,131,2010-05-20,Mr. ANDREWS.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor Gloria Chao for both her service as a  librarian at  the Rutgers School of  Law-Camden and for her infectious positive attitude.  Ms. Chao  received her Bachelor of Arts  from Providence University  in 1967 and a  Master  of  Science  in  Library  Science  (M.S.L.S.) from the Graduate School of Library  and Information Science at Villanova University  in  1970. After  graduation, Ms. Chao  worked with Temple Law Library and Air Asia  in Taiwan.  In 1979, Ms. Chao  joined  the  library staff at Rutgers School of Law in Camden, New Jersey. Upon  joining  the  library  team, she immediately played an integral role  in establishing the cataloging department and  Research Library Information Network (RLIN)  system. By 1984, Ms. Chao was appointed  Head of Technical and Automated Services.  In her 31 years with Rutgers School of Law-  Camden, Ms. Chao has been a model of success, hard work and positivity. She is affectionately referred to as the ‘‘sunshine’’ of the  law library and the law school. Currently she  is using her bravery, optimism and strength to  battle stage 4 lung cancer. She is facing the  disease while keeping her sense of humor intact.  Madam Speaker, Ms. Gloria Chao  has  helped students and  faculty  find and secure  knowledgeable  resources  and  information  while brightening the days of all around her. I  congratulate Ms. Chao on her accomplishments at Rutgers and wish her  the utmost  strength and courage in this time of sickness.

With increasing global competition, it is critically important that we boost our country’s research potential and expand our commitment  to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,  and Mathematics) education. Economic growth  requires innovation; innovation requires robust  research; and effective  research  requires a  broadly educated workforce. I am deeply saddened  that COMPETES  fell victim  to shortsighted Republican political gamesmanship,  and  I  look  forward  to working with House  Science and Technology Chair BARTGORDON  to get COMPETES reauthorized through another legislative vehicle.  f  JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE  MONTH  HON. WM. LACY CLAY  OFMISSOURI  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 20, 2010  ",2010
945,138,2010-05-20,Mr. CLAY.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the rich heritage and invaluable contributions that Jewish Americans have made to  our Nation and  to  the community  that  I am  proud to represent in Missouri’s First Congressional District.  The earliest Jewish immigrants came to St.  Louis over two hundred years ago.  Like most new Americans, they came seeking a refuge from persecution and discrimination, with the hope of building productive lives  and practicing their faith, without fear.  In St. Louis, and across the Nation, Jewish  Americans have excelled in every facet of our  society. From commerce, to the arts, to education, medicine, the law, government, and in  our armed forces.  Jewish Americans have enriched our Nation  and contributed much  to our shared cultural  heritage.  I also want to make special mention of the  long and historic partnership between the African American and the Jewish American communities, in the pursuit of social justice, civil  rights, voting rights and equal protection under  the law.  During  the most  trying  times of  the civil  rights movement, Jewish Americans and African Americans marched  together, stood  together, protested  together, prayed  together,  and even died together, to advance the cause  of full citizenship and real equality for all.  That partnership and common pursuit of justice endures today.  In my district, I am blessed to represent a  large, vibrant Jewish community with many  outstanding  congregations, educational and  cultural groups and social service agencies;  including: the Jewish Federation of St. Louis;  the Jewish Community Center; Jewish Family  and Childrens Services; the Jewish Community Relations Council; the St. Louis Holocaust  Museum and Learning Center, Barnes-Jewish  Hospital, the Central Agency for Jewish Education, and many others.  Jewish Americans have helped shape our  Nation’s history, and  their unending commitment to faith, family, learning and social justice will continue  to strengthen  the United  States.  I am proud  to  join with my colleagues  mark Jewish American Heritage Month.  to  f  COMMENDING DAVID BARTON FOR  EDUCATING  AMERICA  ABOUT  OUR NATION’S RELIGIOUS HERITAGE  HON. BILL POSEY  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 20, 2010  ",2010
946,138,2010-05-20,Mr. POSEY.," Madam Speaker,  recently,  I  had the opportunity to tour our nation’s Capitol  building with one of our nation’s leading scholars, David Barton. David Barton is an accomplished author, speaker, and historian who focuses on helping Americans explore and understand our nation’s moral,  religious, and  constitutional heritage. It is critically important  that all of us have a deeper understanding  and appreciation of our nation’s founding.  Mr. Barton has dedicated his life to studying  historical documents  from  the  foundation of  our nation and helping Americans understand  the impact moral and religious teaching and  beliefs had on our nations’ Founding Fathers  and the direction of our nation. Through his  work, he teaches that in addition to a constitutional  foundation, our nation has undeniable  religious and moral underpinnings.  Mr. Barton  is  founder and president of  Wallbuilders, a national organization that presents  ‘‘America’s  forgotten history and heroes.’’ The organization seeks to educate citizens about  the  important  role  that  religious  faith had on our Founding Fathers and our nation’s institutions, including our government.  Mr. Barton has received substantial recognition for his work, including being named ‘‘one  of  the 25 Most  Influential Evangelicals’’ by  TIME magazine and receiving several Angel,  Who’s Who in Education, and Telly Awards,  as well as  the George Washington Honor  medal.  I commend Mr. Barton for his commitment  to  fostering  a  scholarly  understanding  of  America’s heritage and for the important work  he does  in studying and  teaching regarding  the Biblical values that guided our Founders  during the birth of our nation more than 225  years ago.  I have been on several Capitol  tours with Mr. Barton, and his knowledge  about the religious foundation of our country  never ceases to amaze me. It is through this  type of work that Americans gain a better understanding of what  the Founders expected  our nation to be like and what we should expect  from our elected  leaders and  the  laws  they create.  Madam Speaker,  I  encourage my  colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Barton  and the work that he does to educate Americans about our nation’s past so that America  can be a beacon to the world.  f  OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL  DEBT  HON.

On January 6, 2009, the start of the 111th  Congress,  the  national  debt  was  $10,638,425,746,293.80.  This means the national debt has increased  by $2,336,866,581,274.10 so  far  this Congress.  This debt and its interest payments we are  passing to our children and all future Americans.  f  IN CELEBRATION OF THE DEDICATION  CEREMONY  FOR  CONGREGATION OLAM TIKVAH  HON. GERALD E.

948,138,2010-05-20,Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Congregation  Olam Tikvah on the occasion of the Dedication Ceremony for their recent expansion.  Congregation Olam Tikvah was  formed  in  1964 by six Fairfax County families who recognized the need for a synagogue that would  serve the Kings Park, Springfield, Fairfax and  Annandale areas. The congregation was  initially led by Reb Jack Frankel who, although  not an ordained rabbi, provided religious leadership and guidance in those early days.  From  these modest  beginnings,  Olam  Tikvah has grown  into a vibrant community  and is the spiritual and religious home to over  620 Jewish  families  in  the Northern Virginia  area. Along with  this growth  in membership  has come an expansion of programs which  now include a preschool, child and adult education classes, ritual support, a Men’s Club, a  Sisterhood and a senior social group.

949,3,2010-05-26,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker, on Monday  it was my birthday, and it didn’t quite  go as planned. One of the things I did is  I went  to Arlington Cemetery and  spent 4 hours looking at the graves and  thinking about American history and  the people who wished  they had a  birthday, and what they gave for their  country. Some gave their lives, some  gave part of their lives.  I visited the Kennedy graves and let  the word go forth. I visited Robert Kennedy’s grave and the tiny ripples of  hope that can wipe down the mightiest  walls of oppression. But I found Earl  Warren’s grave, along with John Foster  Dulles and Arthur Goldberg together.  I would like to read from Earl Warren’s tombstone. I think it is something we should reflect on.  ‘‘Where there is injustice, we should  correct it. Where there is poverty, we  should eliminate it. Where there is corruption, we should stamp it out. Where  there is violence, we should punish it.  Where there is neglect, we should provide  care. Where  there  is war, we  should  restore peace. And wherever  corrections are achieved, we should add  them permanently to our storehouse of  treasures.’’  This from the vice presidential candidate of the Grand Old Party in 1948,  the nominee for the Supreme Court and  the  Chief  Justice,  nominated  by  Dwight Eisenhower when Republicans  were Republicans. Thank God for Earl  Warren.  God bless the United States, and may  God save the Gulf of Mexico because it  doesn’t look like anybody else is going  to.  f  LACK OF COMMITMENT ENFORCING  NATIONAL  IMMIGRATION  LAWS  (Mr. SULLIVAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2010
950,3,2010-05-26,Mr. SULLIVAN.," Mr. Speaker, I am  troubled by this administration’s commitment, this lack of commitment of  enforcing  our  national  immigration  laws.  Just last week, John Morton, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security  for the U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement,  said  that  ‘‘his agency  will not necessarily process illegal immigrants referred to them by Arizona  officials,’’ in light of their new State  law.  My district contains two permanent  ICE offices, and I am seriously concerned that one of the top officials in  the Obama administration in charge of  enforcing  our Nation’s  immigration  laws is refusing to do his job. Regardless of his personal feelings on the Arizona immigration law, Assistant Secretary Morton has an obligation to enforce the rule of law and protect U.S.  citizens and legal residents.  Arizona  is under  siege with both  human and drug smuggling, and it is  on the front lines dealing with Mexico’s drug violence that is spilling over  into the United States.  On behalf of my constituents and  millions of Americans, I urge President  Obama and Immigration and Customs  Enforcement Secretary Morton to enforce our immigration laws.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF TAM  NGOC TRAN  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and  to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2010
951,3,2010-05-26,Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  an  extraordinary  young  woman, a scholar, a student activist,  Ms. Tam Ngoc Tran of Garden Grove,  California, who was recently killed in a  head-on collision with her close friend,  Cinthya Perez.  Tam was the daughter of a refugee  couple who fled Vietnam over two decades ago after escaping from a communist reeducation camp.  She graduated  from Santiago High  School, attended Santa Ana College,  transferred to UCLA, earned a bachelor’s degree  in American  literature  and culture and was a doctoral student  at Brown University.  Tam was also a courageous  leader  who inspired many through her personal story of immigration. In 2007, the  U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency  raided  the Tran  home and subsequently arrested Tam  and many of her family members.  Representatives LOFGREN, SMITH, and  I then wrote a letter to then-Secretary  Rice urging her to uphold the U.S. policy regarding the return of refugees to  the Socialist Republic  of Vietnam.  That allowed them to remain in the  United States.  f  CONTINUE  HEALTH  INSURANCE  COVERAGE OF CHILDREN UNTIL  AGE 26  (Mr.  COURTNEY  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2010
952,3,2010-05-26,Mr. COURTNEY.," Mr. Speaker, on  May 7 United Technologies Corporation, the largest private employer in  the State of Connecticut, announced  that they were going to take advantage  of the health care reform law and extend age 26 coverage to all their employees’ families. A few days later, Mohegan  Sun  Casino, which  employs  10,000  in  the State of Connecticut,  made the same decision.  Prior to health care reform, during  graduation time, graduating students  get a diploma in one hand and a notice  from their parents’ insurer that they  are being kicked off their parents’ insurance coverage. Because of health  care reform, 1.2 million up to age 26  Americans will now be able to use their  parents’ health insurance.  For the voices who call for repeal, I  challenge them to tell those families  that we should repeal that provision  and kick their kids off health insurance.  In a few days, we are going to pass a  Defense authorization bill which will  extend age 26 coverage for TRICARE so  that military families will also be able  to insure their kids up to age 26. That’s  why health care reform was needed in  this country. We are going to provide  14 million young adults with health insurance coverage by 2014. It is because  we took that step that we are going to  provide access to that population.  f  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION  REFORM  (Mr. BACA asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2010
953,3,2010-05-26,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Speaker, our immigration system is broken and yet there  are those that refuse to do anything  about it. The misguided Arizona law  S.B. 1070 has made it so difficult for  families  that  some have  started  to  leave the State.  The general atmosphere in Arizona is  one of distrust and fear, not just for  Hispanic families, but for all communities of color. In the media, blatant  attacks, hate speeches, negative  images of Latinos only adds to the fuel  and fire.  Immigration reform is about people,  all of us. It’s about families, our neighbors, our fellow parishioners, our classmates, our children. Make no mistake,  our immigration problem will not go  away by just attacking those without a  voice.  I urge my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to roll up their  sleeves and pass comprehensive immigration  reform  that will  reinforce  strong security at our borders, strong  sanctions against employers who hire  the undocumented workers, and unite  our families.  We need comprehensive immigration  reform now.  f  STRAIGHT FROM BP’S WEB SITE  (Mr. GUTIERREZ  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

It goes on to say ‘‘Great companies  are built on  trust.

Mr. Speaker, I think it is plain to see  from the words of my esteemed colleague, it is plain to see Israel’s extraordinary impact on the global economy. Its accession to the OECD will  have a positive impact on our global  economy at a time when our economy  is suffering worldwide.  It would be my hope that the Palestinians, rather than to continue to  refuse to make peace with Israel, to  continue its terrorist attacks on innocent Israelis, its continuance to refuse  face-to-face  negotiations  with  the  Israelis  for peace, to actively  incite  anti-Semitism  and  hatred  towards  Israel, and to continue its attempts to  delegitimize  Israel’s  very  right  to  exist, that perhaps instead it would be  more worthwhile  for the Palestinian  people if its leaders would work with  Israel to improve its own economic situation, to raise the Palestinian people  from the misery, poverty, and squalor  in which they live, and in which they  continue to live, not because of the  Israelis’ success, but because of the  lack of movement on the part of the  Palestinian leadership that continues  to use and abuse their own people and  attempt to delegitimize Israel’s very  right to exist.  ",2010
956,10,2010-05-26,Mr. GRAYSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1391, congratulating  Israel for its accession to membership in the  Organization  for Economic Co-operation and  Development.  On May 10, 2010, 31 OECD member states  unanimously agreed to invite Israel to become  a member of  that organization. The OECD  noted  in a statement  that  ‘‘Israel’s scientific  and technological policies have produced outstanding outcomes on a world scale.’’ Israel’s  finance minister, Yuval Steinitz,  described  Israel joining the OECD as ‘‘a badge of honor’’  for Israel, which was one of the few economies to show growth in 2009 during the world  economic crisis.  It is critical to recognize the importance of  Israel’s involvement now and in the future in  international organizations.  I stand with my  colleagues in commending President Obama  and the administration for the integral role it  played in Israel’s successful bid for accession  to membership  in  the OECD. This only  furthers  to strengthen  the bonds between  the  United States and Israel.  ",2010
957,10,2010-05-26,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Madam Speaker, I rise  in support of H. Res. 1391, a resolution congratulating and commending Israel for its accession to membership in the Organization for  Economic Co-operation  and Development,  OECD.  On May 10th, it was announced that OECD  member states had unanimously voted to extend membership to Israel. This landmark vote  recognizes Israel’s economic strength, and it  is a clear victory over efforts  to marginalize  and delegitimize  the country.  Israel’s accession to the OECD will speed its economic integration into the global community and provide  increased opportunities for foreign investment.  Despite living under the constant threat of  terror and war, Israel has developed one of  the world’s most robust economies. Last year,  Israel boasted one of  few economies  in  the  world to show growth during the economic crisis. OECD has predicted a 3.5 percent  increase in Israel’s economy in 2010.

960,17,2010-05-26,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, in the  year 2005, I joined my colleagues and  fellow Californians, MAXINEWATERS  and BARBARALEE, and other strong  progressives in forming the Out of Iraq  Caucus. That group was critical in galvanizing support for an end to the Iraq  war and a return of our troops safely  home.  Before we  formed the Out of Iraq  Caucus, Mr. Speaker, questioning the  occupation of Iraq was considered a political death wish, but because we had  the courage to speak out and to organize, ours became a firmly mainstream  position. Without the work we did and  the pressure we applied and the growth  of our Out of Iraq Caucus, we would not  be poised for redeployment out of Iraq  later this year.  It’s now time for those of us who oppose the war  in Afghanistan—a bloc  that’s growing every single day—to do  the same thing. I urge Members on  both sides of the aisle to join the new  Out of Afghanistan Caucus, formally  launched by my  friend Mr. CONYERS  from Michigan.  As  Afghanistan  becomes  more  bloody, more expensive, and, frankly,  more hopeless, we must rally with the  same sense of purpose and fearlessness  as we did in 2005 in the debate over  Iraq. Every day, it seems, brings more  bad news  out  of Afghanistan. The  United States death toll has topped  1,000. According to news reports,  for  the first time we now have more troops  in Afghanistan than we do in Iraq, and  the combined costs of both wars is fast  approaching $1 trillion—that’s trillion  with a ‘‘T,’’ Mr. Speaker.  The American people are losing patience with  this war, and who can  blame them? For 81⁄2years, they have  sent their finest men and women and  their  hard-earned  taxpayer  dollars  halfway around the world only to find  that the Taliban is resurgent, the terrorist threat remains strong, and Afghanistan remains mired in corruption,  violence, and poverty. At just the moment when we need to draw down, we  are doubling down. We’re pouring thousands of troops into Kandahar for an  all-eggs-in-one-basket offensive that no  one seems confident will succeed.

And last year we  had a  lengthy budget debate  in the  committee, it was very robust, to discuss possible amendments to the budget. And even though the majority of  the Republican amendments  to  the  budget were not passed, we did pass a  budget. It was over the ‘‘no’’ votes of  the Republicans. However it fulfilled a  duty of this body to pass a budget.  At $3.6 trillion,  it was the  largest  budget  in the history of the United  States. President Obama this year proposed a $3.8 trillion budget. At a time  of recession, he proposed a budget that  was $200 billion larger than the budget  the year before. And the budget the  year before included some astronomical increases, such as a 39 percent increase in the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency.  Well, as you can see from a full day  of hearings that were held today in the  House Natural Resources Committee,  that additional 39 percent increase in  one agency’s budget in 1 year, as now  applied in the Gulf of Mexico to the oil  spill, has not yielded the kind of efficiency that we expect  from government.

I  thank my  I wanted to follow Mr. POLISand just  talk about the Rocky Mountain West,  which really did receive Jewish immigrants with  open  arms. Sometimes  there was discrimination, but generally  it was open arms. In New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming,  ranching,  farming,  mining, construction, you name it, the  Jewish community was involved in it.  Merchants, oil and gas, the Manhattan  Project down in Los Alamos in New  Mexico.  So, my  family, a great-great-great  uncle immigrated from the Ukraine in  the late 1800s, was part of a mining  commune above a  little town called  Center, Colorado,  remained  in  that  mining commune for about 3 years, realized he didn’t  like being at about  11,000 feet in the mountains of Colorado, moved to the Denver area, where  he had a small store, and that uncle  then attracted the others who immigrated from the Ukraine. So the youngest brother came first, then the next  brother, the next brother, and the next  brother. My grandfather was the oldest. He was the last to arrive from the  old country.  But the Denver area in Colorado really did allow people a chance to really  show what they were made of, and the  Jewish community in Colorado, in the  Denver area, has flourished over the  years. It has been very much a part of  the fabric of the community in charitable efforts, as well as education and  those kinds of things.

967,31,2010-05-26,Mr. DEUTCH.," Thank you. Thank you  very much.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the American Jewish community’s many contributions to our Nation’s society and culture. I would like  to thank my dear friend and colleague,  Congresswoman  SCHULTZ, for her outstanding dedication to preserving Jewish history and  culture in America.  Jewish American Heritage Month  gives all Americans the opportunity to  WASSERMAN  DEBBIE recognize Jewish Americans as leaders  in every facet of America’s life, from  athletics, entertainment, the arts and  academia,  to  business,  government,  and our Armed Forces.  b2130  Florida’s 19th District is home to the  largest,  one  of  the  largest  Jewish  American populations in this country.  I’m  privileged  to  represent many  first generation Americans whose parents arrived on our shores seeking a  better life. Many of these Jewish Americans are members of the Greatest Generation. They stepped up to serve in  World War II and rebuilt this Nation  after the Great Depression.  In  fact,  over half a million Jewish Americans  fought for the United States in World  War  II, and 11,000 of them perished  fighting for our country.  For those who arrived in Europe as  the Holocaust raged on, this war became very personal. As a quote from a  Jewish Air Force officer reads, As a  Jew, it was Hitler and me. That is the  way I picture the war.  While  the contributions of Jewish  American soldiers during World War II  cannot be understated, the truth  is  that Jewish American  soldiers have  been fighting for this country since the  Revolutionary War.  Colonel Isaac Franks and Major Benjamin Nones were aides de camp to  General  George Washington.  Commodore  Uriah  Phillips  Levy,  who  served in the War of 1812, was court-  martialed six times due to his defiance  of anti-Semitism. And by the time the  Civil War broke out, there were 150,000  Jews in the United States, with 7,000  fighting for the North and 3,000 fighting for the South. Senator Judah Benjamin  even  served  as Secretary  of  State  for  the Confederacy. And although Jews only made up 2 percent of  the population during World War  I,  they made up 6 percent of the United  States Armed Forces.  Jewish Americans have  served  in  Korea and Vietnam. They’ve served in  Operation Desert Storm and in countless  operations  around  the  globe.  They’re among the brave young men  and women who served after September  11 in the war on terror and who are  serving bravely and valiantly in Iraq  and Afghanistan, even as we speak.  And as we approach Memorial Day, I  recognize those Jewish war veterans  who made the ultimate sacrifice  for  freedom, like Major Stuart Wolfer, a  Jewish American major from my district, a loving father of three daughters  who was killed by rocket fire in Baghdad 2 years ago.  Since  the Congressional Medal of  Honor, Jewish Americans have been  awarded this high honor for their dedicated service to this Nation since it  was created. Six Jewish Americans received the award in the Civil War, two  in the Indian wars in the late 1800s,  three in World War I, two in World War  II, one in the Vietnam conflict.  I am proud to also note that Florida’s 19th District is home to one of the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:03 May 27, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K26MY7.062 H26MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 D K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2010
968,38,2010-05-26,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Reclaiming my  time,  I  thank  the gentleman  from  Texas. I wanted to go back through a  couple of points  the gentleman has  made with regard to the Arizona law.  One of them would be, my recollection  is  that  ‘‘lawful  contact’’ was  amended to say ‘‘stop, detention, or arrest.’’ I happen to have had a copy that  has the amendment integrated into the  overall bill, and I was able to sit down  and read that on Saturday morning.  ",2010
969,38,2010-05-26,Mr. GOHMERT.,"  If  the  gentleman  would yield, yes, it does say any lawful  contact, stop, detention or arrest.  ",2010
970,38,2010-05-26,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Didn’t they strike  ‘‘lawful contact’’ and just put in ‘‘stop,  detention, or arrest?’’  ",2010
971,38,2010-05-26,Mr. GOHMERT., This is supposed to  be the updated law as amended.  ,2010
972,38,2010-05-26,Mr. KING of Iowa., Your copy doesn’t  reflect that. I recall mine did.  ,2010
973,38,2010-05-26,Mr. GOHMERT., The gentleman needs  to understand  that  ‘‘lawful  contact  stop’’ means you can’t stop them unless you have a reasonable suspicion.  ,2010
974,38,2010-05-26,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Let me suggest  that  ‘‘lawful  contact’’ would mean,  among it, ‘‘lawful contact’’ would be  ‘‘stop, detention, or arrest,’’ so specific  within those individual subcategories  of lawful contact. So I think I make a  distinction without a difference in the  language as I recall it, and that is carefully crafted language.  When we look at the reasonable suspicion component of this, Mr. Speaker,  I think about this; that I wrote the reasonable suspicion  law  in  Iowa as a  State senator for the Workplace Drug  Testing Act that we passed in 1998. It  has been in law for all of 12 years, and  in that period of time, in fact 12 years  and 2 months, I happen to remember it  was St. Patrick’s day in 1998 that it  was signed into law, Mr. Speaker.  But we provide for an employer or  employer’s designee to direct an employee to undergo a drug test, and generally that will be a urinalysis, based  upon a representative of the employer  declaring that the employee in question has a reasonable suspicion that  they are using or abusing drugs. That  might be any of the indicators that  have to do with bloodshot eyes, or dilated pupils, or erratic work habits, or  showing up late, or let me say agitated  nature or nervous nature, something of  that nature.  So the designee of the employer can  point to an employee and say, I have a  reasonable suspicion that you are using  drugs. Go get a drug test right now.  That has been an Iowa law for 12  years. It is more draconian than the  Arizona reasonable suspicion law with  regard to requiring the  law enforcement officer to draw their reasonable  suspicion and make a determination  when he has reasonable suspicion as to  the lawful presence of the individual  that he has had lawful contact with  and had a stop, detention, or arrest.  A reasonable suspicion, I would add  also to the gentleman from Texas, who  went to law school down there, that if  I remember correctly, it is a specific,  articulable fact, so that it has to be  specified as well as articulable. I have  trouble practicing that word too. I am  doing it here. So I didn’t go to law  school to learn that.  But  the  reasonable  suspicion  language that is there is well settled, and  it has been completely utilized for decades in the United States, and for at  least 12 years in Iowa. Maybe it is the  janitor, or it is the nurse or the truck  driver, or maybe it is the accountant  or the keyboard operator that is the  designee of the employer, that has received 2 hours worth of training to  start out and one hour worth of training each year to refresh them, and they  are the ones that get to point their finger at somebody and not say, let me  see your papers; it is, we will send you  into the clinic here, and you can fill  this jar up, and we will check it out  and see if you are using illegal drugs.  I would submit that it is a little bit  more invasive in a person’s privacy to  require a urinalysis than it is to require that they show their papers. Yet  we have people across  this country  that are demonstrating against Arizona’s immigration law, when all it does  is ask the local law enforcement officers to carry out the function of enforcing immigration law, Arizona immigration law, which mirrors Federal  immigration law in that practice, and  it has been a requirement for a long,  long time, perhaps half a century, that  those who are in this United States  that are not natural born citizens or  naturalized citizens have to carry their  papers if they are 18 years old or older.  That has been a  common practice.  There appears to be no offense taken  about that practice.  But here, behind where I stand, Mr.  Speaker, we had President Calderon  take issue with Arizona’s immigration  law. He said he strongly disagrees with  the Arizona law, that it is a terrible  idea that could lead to racial profiling.  That is pretty close to the quote, not  exact. Mr. GOHMERT provided  it exactly.  So  if President Calderon  is so offended by the  law that Arizona has  passed, I would take him back to the  simplest lessons in deductive reasoning  that were perfected by the Greeks 3,000  years ago, and it would be this: President Calderon, if you are not offended  by the United States Federal immigration law that sets a standard that is  more stringent than the Arizona immigration law, but you are offended by  the Arizona immigration law, the only  logical deductive reason that could remain is that he is offended that Arizona law enforcement will be enforcing  Arizona  immigration  law.  So  that  would tell me President Calderon is insulted or offended by Arizona’s State  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:03 May 27, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K26MY7.070 H26MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 D K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2010

",2010
1025,59,2010-05-26,Ms. COLLINS.," Madam President, this  is a modified version of an amendment  I offered yesterday. I am joined by Senators  BOND,  GREGG,  ALEXANDER,  VOINOVICH,  SNOWE,  BROWN COBURN, THUNE, and CORKER of Massachusetts, MURKOWSKI,  in supINHOFE,  BEGICH,  porting this amendment.  On April 22, the EPA’s new lead paint  rule went into effect. As I explained to  my  colleagues  yesterday,  unfortunately the EPA completely botched the  implementation of this important rule.  This rule is intended to make sure that  lead-based paint is removed safely from  our homes and, thus, it requires those  involved in house renovations to participate  in a training course  in the  proper removal of lead-based paint, and  then be certified.  Unfortunately, the EPA did not plan  well  for the  implementation of this  new rule. Across our country, it did not  have in place the necessary trainers  and classes so that individuals could be  trained to comply with this new rule.  What our amendment would do is to  delay the  fines that would apply  in  cases of violations of this new rule  until September 30. Indeed, it would  prohibit the EPA from imposing these  fines, which are as high as $37,500 per  day per violation  for violating  this  rule.  I want to make clear that I support  efforts to rid our homes of toxic lead-  based paint in a safe manner. But it is  simply not fair to impose these burdensome, onerous fines on contractors who  have been unable to get the EPA-provided training because the EPA did  such a lousy job in planning for implementation of this new rule.  In my State, for example, as of last  week, we have only three EPA trainers  to certify contractors  for the entire  State. As a result, only about 10 percent of the State’s contractors have  been certified. Hundreds of home renovators have had their names on waiting lists, some for as long as 2 months,  but they simply cannot get the necessary training, and that is through no  fault of their own.  I note that my amendment has been  endorsed by the National Federation of  Independent  Business,  our Nation’s  leading small business advocacy organization. It has been endorsed by the  Window & Door Manufacturers Association and the National Lumber and  Building Material Dealers Association.  These groups have endorsed  it because  they  are hearing  from  their  members of the tremendous burden and  the tremendous fines that their members are potentially at risk of receiving  through no fault of their own.  As the NFIB pointed out in its letter,  the new EPA lead rule applies to virtually anyone who is involved in home  renovations involving lead-based paint.  That includes painters, plumbers, window and door  installers, carpenters,  electricians, and other specialists. Its  reach is very broad.  What we found throughout the country is the EPA completely underestimated the number of people who would  have to be trained. They also seem to  be operating under the false assumption that contractors either do new  construction  or  renovation. Madam  President,  I don’t know about your  State, but that is not true in my State.  In my State, the home renovators do  all sorts of work, particularly in this  economy.  This imposes a tremendous burden on  those of us who represent large rural  States.  In my State, most  of  the  courses were held in the southern part  of the State, requiring painters and  other contractors to travel hundreds of  miles to get the training they need.  There are three States where EPA does  not have any certified trainers available.  This is a commonsense amendment  attempting to put some sense in the  decisionmaking at the EPA by extending, until the end of this fiscal year,  the time for compliance.  I want to make clear that I believe  we should try to proceed with the removal of lead-based paint and that we  need strict safety standards. But  it  does not make sense to impose huge  fines on contractors who are unable to  get the required training, the mandatory classes because the EPA did not  have the trainers in place before putting the rule into effect.  In my State, the building industry is  still struggling, and for a lot of individuals who are involved in the building  industry, their only work is to do home  renovations.  My State also has an old housing  stock, one of the oldest in the Nation.  Ironically, this new rule may result in  not having anyone who is qualified to  remove  lead-based paint  from homes  because of the way this rule has been  implemented.  I talked at some length about this  issue yesterday. I am not going to repeat what I said yesterday. But let me  point out that a lot of the contractors  in my State who are struggling already  financially do not earn in a whole year  the $37,500 they can be fined for one  violation by the EPA. It is simply unfair that these heavy fines can be imposed when it is the EPA’s fault that  the classes have not been made more  readily available.  All I am attempting to do is to provide the EPA with more time to increase the number of certified trainers.  This is a matter of fairness.  Madam President, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the RECORD  the  endorsement  letters  from  the  NFIB, from the National Lumber and  Building Material Dealers Association,  and from the Window & Door Manufacturers Association.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  NATIONALFEDERATIONOF  INDEPENDENTBUSINESS,  Washington, DC, May 25, 2010.  DEARSENATOR: On behalf of the National  Federation of Independent Business, the nation’s leading small business advocacy organization, I am writing in strong support of  the Collins Amendment to H.R. 4899, the  Supplemental Appropriations bill, to delay  the enforcement of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) lead rule until September 30, 2010. The NFIB will consider a  vote in support of this amendment as an  NFIB Key Vote for the 116th Congress.  On April 22, 2010, the EPA’s lead rule went  into effect requiring home renovation contractors to complete a mandatory training  class at an accredited facility. The new EPA  lead rule applies to virtually any industry  affecting home renovation including: painters, plumbers, window and door installers,  carpenters, electricians, and similar specialists. The penalty for non-compliance can be  up to $37,500 per violation per day. NFIB appreciates the intent of the law to ensure  lead-free painting, home renovation, and repairs. However, we continue to be concerned  that the tight enforcement deadline unfairly  punishes contractors who have not been able  to become accredited through no  fault of  their own.

1030,66,2010-05-26,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, in a moment  I am going to talk about both the  amendment offered by my colleague,  Senator MCCAIN, to provide funding for  members of the National Guard to be  deployed to the border, our southern  border with Mexico, for the purpose of  better border security, as well as the  amendment which I have offered as a  second-degree  amendment  to  the  Cornyn  amendment which  provides  funding  for  Operation  Streamline,  which is the process by which people  who are apprehended crossing the border illegally are sent to jail for a couple of weeks as a deterrent so that they  then don’t want to cross in the future  because they know they are going to be  in jail rather than working someplace  for the money they came to work for.  Just to explain one thing: when there  is a member of the majority on the  Senate floor, I will ask unanimous consent to modify my amendment with a  technical modification. But the amendment is the same. What it does is to  provide the sum of $200 million for additional funding for multiagency law  enforcement  initiatives—that  is  the  way they are described—for the Tucson  sector of the border, and that is roughly the eastern half of the Arizona border with Mexico.  Mr. President, $155 million of that  would be available for the Department  of Justice for the purpose of hiring additional deputy marshals, constructing  permanent detention space, and other  related  needs  of  the  Secretary  of  Homeland Security and the Attorney  General, then $45 million available to  the judiciary for courthouse renovation  and administrative support, including  judges and court clerks.  This is offset, and the emergency designation would be appended to it as the  modification I will submit. The purpose of this is to enable the Border Patrol and the Department of Justice,  when  illegal  immigrants are apprehended crossing the border, to present  them to court. They are represented,  and they can enter a plea or they can  waive further proceedings. For those  who, in fact, are found to have crossed  the border illegally, they can be sent to  jail. Ordinarily, if it is the first time, it  is a 2-week sentence. If they have done  it repeated times, it can be 30 days or  it may be that some will serve 60 days.  I am not sure.  The point  is, where this has been  done,  for everybody who crosses the  border—with some exceptions—for almost everybody who cross illegally, it  has created a very effective deterrent  to crossing.  It becomes apparent to  people who are trying to cross in that  particular vicinity that if they do, and  they are apprehended, they are going  to jail.  About 17 percent of the people who  come across  illegally are criminals,  wanted for crimes in this country, and  obviously they don’t want to go to jail.  For  the  other  83  percent,  roughly,  those are people coming here to work.  They cannot work and make money if  they are  in  jail. They cannot  send  money back to family in Mexico or El  Salvador or wherever it might be, so  they, too, want to avoid this result.  The effect of this in the Yuma sector  of the border—which is one of the two  sectors, Del Rio, TX, being the other—  where it is fully implemented, is that  there is virtually no illegal immigration attempted in that sector of the  border anymore. There are effective  fences—about 11 miles of double fencing—and they have sufficient Border  Patrol agents in the area.  There are some other factors for the  reduction of  illegal  immigration  in  that sector. In the last 5 years, the apprehension has declined  from  18,500  down to about 5,000-some—a 94-percent  decrease. The head of the Border Patrol  and others tell me one of the primary  reasons for that reduction is this operation  streamlining—the  sure knowledge if they cross into that sector, they  are going to jail. If we can provide that  same kind of deterrence in the Tucson  sector, where about 50 percent of all illegal immigrants are crossing into the  United States from Mexico, then we  would have gone a long way toward securing the border. Certainly, in Arizona we would  have  substantially  eliminated illegal immigration in the  State.  If we add to that the amendment of  Senator MCCAIN, which would provide  the  funding  for  deploying National  Guard on the border, I think we can go  a long way toward securing the border  in a relatively short period of time. So  when the President has said he agrees  with us that we need to secure the border, and he even proposed some funding  or some National Guard troops on the  border, I think this is a recognition  that it is the right way to go.  I will make two quick points about  Senator MCCAIN’s amendment. First,  the President has proposed far fewer  numbers than Senator MCCAINhas proposed, which is a total of 6,000 National  Guard, or 3,000 on the Arizona border.  We believe it will take that many in  order  to  accomplish  the  goal. The  President’s numbers are far fewer. It is  unclear from the lack of detail in this  proposal, but it appears those will not  be  literal boots on the ground but,  rather, these National Guard troops  will be there for the purpose of training  and for administrative work, investigative work, and will, for the most part,  be back from the border and not actually engaged in the work at the border  itself.  The  importance of that  is we are  told—at  least  anecdotally—the  one  thing the people who are coming across  the border  illegally  fear more  than  anything else is National Guard troops.  Border Patrol, they don’t like them.

1032,73,2010-05-26,Mr. MCCAIN.," I would say to the distinguished  chairman,  if  there  is  a  unanimous  consent  agreement  concluded, I would be more than happy to  be interrupted. I know that business in  the Senate needs  to proceed.  I am  proud to be joining forces with my colleague from Oklahoma, Dr. COBURN, to  insist that we stop burdening our children and our grandchildren with massive debt.  We have before us today a supplemental  appropriations  bill  totaling  nearly $60 billion, most of it not paid  for, simply being added to the ever  growing debt, to be paid for by future  generations of Americans.  If we are serious about our commitment to reduce our debt and eliminate  our deficit,  then Congress needs  to  start making  some  tough  decisions  about our national priorities and we  need to start now.  Dr. COBURN is seeking a vote on one  of two reasonable amendments, both of  which would fully offset the cost of  this bill. Yesterday, Dr. COBURN very  eloquently laid out his reasons for offering those two amendments. Essentially our fiscal situation is extremely  perilous and we can no longer afford to  approve any new Federal funding without eliminating wasteful and unnecessary spending in other areas.  Mr. President, a kind of bizarre thing  happened yesterday. In the middle of  his speech and his argument before the  Senate, Dr. COBURNyielded the floor to  the majority leader who proceeded to  file cloture on this bill after only 1 day  of floor consideration and not a single  vote on any amendment. So on a $60  billion bill, most of it not paid for, we  are now going to, without a single  amendment having been voted on, be  voting on a bill, in fact, that will not  be paid  for. As my colleagues know  quite well, the editorial page of the  Washington Post is by no means a conservative, right-leaning, penny-pinching bunch, but even they are perplexed  about what we are doing here. Yesterday, in an editorial entitled ‘‘Congress  as Usual: There’s an election coming.  Time to spend,’’ the Post wrote:  All across the Western world, fiscal stimulus is starting to give way to fiscal consolidation. In London, the new British government has announced $8.6 billion in immediate budget cuts. In Paris, French President  Nicolas Sarkozy is negotiating to raise that  country’s retirement age. In Madrid, Spanish  civil servants are facing a 5 percent pay cut,  followed by a wage freeze. Even Italy is talking about tightening spending. And don’t get  us started on Greece.  Only in Washington, it seems, is the long  awaited ‘‘pivot’’ to fiscal restraint nowhere  to be seen. As the mid-term elections draw  near, Congress is considering a passel of new  spending, necessary and otherwise, most of  which won’t be paid for.  Sadly, the Washington Post hit the  nail on the head and the bill before us  is the perfect example of Congress’s inability to deal with the very serious  fiscal realities that are facing this Nation.  Under  this  supplemental, DOD  receives $33.7 billion for operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. The bulk of  this money, $24.6 billion, is for operations  and maintenance,  and much  needed other funding. The remainder of  the DOD funding is for military personnel costs and other equipment.  Some  say  the  fiscally  responsible  way to pay for our war costs is to increases taxes. We disagree. The American people, particularly our soldiers  and  their  families,  are  sacrificing  enough already. It is time for Congress  to start making some sacrifices and  forgo the earmarks and other special  deals to help provide our troops with  the support and equipment they need.  The first amendment of Dr. COBURN  saves taxpayers $59.6 billion by doing  the following: freezing raises, bonuses,  and salary increases for Federal employees for 1 year; collecting unpaid  taxes from Federal employees, $3 billion; reducing printing and publishing  costs of government documents, $4.4  billion over 10 years; reducing excessive duplication, overhead, and spending within the Federal Government, $20  billion; eliminating nonessential government  travel,  $10  billion  over  10  years;  eliminating bonuses  for poor  performance by government contractors, $8 billion over 10 years; repealing  the Energy Star Program, $627 million  over 10 years; eliminating an increase  in foreign aid for international organizations, $68 million; limiting voluntary  payments to the United Nations, $10  billion over 10 years; striking unnecessary appropriations for salaries and expenses of a government commission  Congress ignored, the Financial Crisis  Inquiry Commission, 1.8 million; rescinding a State Department training  facility that was not requested by the  community where  it  is  to be  constructed, $500 million.  On the second amendment we can  save taxpayers $60 billion by cutting  budgets of Members of Congress, by  disposing of unneeded, unused government property, auctioning and selling  unused and unneeded equipment, rescinding  unspent  and  uncommitted  Federal funds, $45 billion.  We have ways we can cut spending.  We have ways we can reduce the government, in the first amendment, by  nearly $60 billion, and in the other one  by $60 billion.  In a letter to Speaker PELOSIin April  of last year, President Obama wrote:  As I noted when I  first  introduced my  budget in February, this is the last planned  war supplemental. Since September 2001, the  Congress has passed 17 separate emergency  funding bills totaling $822.1 billion for the  wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. After 7 years  of war, the American people deserve an honest accounting of the cost of our involvement in our ongoing military operations.  Quoting from the President’s letter  of April of last year:  We must break that recent tradition and  include future military costs in the regular  budget so that we have an honest, more accurate, and fiscally responsible estimate of  Federal spending. And we should not label  military costs as emergency funds so as to  avoid our  responsibility  to abide by  the  spending limits set forth by the Congress.  The  President  emphasized,  again  quoting from his letter to the Speaker  of the House:  After years of budget gimmicks and wasteful spending, it is time to end the era of irresponsibility in Washington.  COBURN I could not agree more. That is why  I am disappointed to see yet another  supplemental spending bill designated  as an emergency without offsets. Dr.  and  I agree with what  the  President said last year. ‘‘After years  of  budget  gimmicks  and  wasteful  spending, it is time to end the era of irresponsibility in Washington.’’ That is  precisely what we are seeking to do  with these two amendments.  In the past 2 years, America has  faced her greatest  fiscal  challenges  since the Great Depression. When the  financial markets collapsed, it was the  American taxpayer who came to the  rescue of the banks and the big Wall  Street firms. But who has come to the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:34 May 27, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A26MY6.019 S26MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2010
1033,80,2010-05-26,Mr. DURBIN., Will the Senator yield  for a question?  ,2010
1034,80,2010-05-26,Mr. MENENDEZ.," For all of these reasons, I am in strong opposition to these  amendments. I certainly urge their defeat. We are going to send billions more  after billions that have already been  sent to accomplish the same negative  result, and your own words speak to  the very essence of how we get to a solution, which is to pursue a comprehensive nature to this reality.  If you want to ensure a continuing  set of circumstances in which law enforcement turns U.S. citizens into second-class citizens, then vote  for the  amendments.  But  otherwise,  you  should oppose them.  I will be happy to yield.  ",2010
1035,80,2010-05-26,Mr. DURBIN.,"  I  ask  through  the  Chair, both  the McCain amendment  and the Cornyn amendment appear to  be paid for out of funds that have already been allocated for creating new  jobs in America—the stimulus funds we  have voted for. If they are successful in  these amendments, they would be reducing the funds that are being used to  hire people  in New Jersey,  Illinois,  Minnesota, and other places to go to  work. Is that the way the Senator from  New Jersey sees it?  ",2010
1036,80,2010-05-26,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Yes. The Senator is  correct. In addition, some of the funding they take  is  from already mandated  programs,  programs  that  are  critical to citizens and communities  and States, and they would, in essence,  detract from those mandated programs  for which there is a Federal obligation  to move it in this direction, at the  same time decreasing the job opportunities at a time in which we are trying  to grow this economy, not contract it.  ",2010
1037,80,2010-05-26,Mr. DURBIN.,"  I  ask  through  the  Chair, if the Senator will yield further,  do I understand the statement that was  sent by the administration, the National  Security  Adviser,  that  the  McCain amendment would circumvent  the power of the President to deploy  troops in the United States in the manner sought by this amendment, an unwarranted interference with the Commander in Chief’s responsibility for the  direct  deployment  of  our  Armed  Forces? And this McCain amendment  by Senator JOHNMCCAIN—I kind of recall speeches from the other side of the  aisle about the right of the Commander  in Chief, the power of the President—  this McCain amendment would spend  $250 million and allocate 6,000 National  Guard troops to start within 72 hours,  a mobilization within  72  hours  of  troops to the border. Is that the way  the Senator from New Jersey reads this  amendment?  ",2010
1038,80,2010-05-26,Mr. MENENDEZ.," The Senator from  Illinois is correct. As a matter of fact,  the same letter he read from General  Jones, the National Security Adviser,  and John Brennan, the Assistant to the  President for Homeland Security and  Counterterrorism, said:  There is no modern precedent for Congress  to direct the President to deploy troops in  the manner sought by that amendment.  ",2010
1039,80,2010-05-26,Mr. DURBIN.," If the Senator will further yield  for a question,  it would  seem, since two of these three amendments are emanating from the State of  Arizona, there is a free-for-all in Arizona to think of more extreme ways to  respond to what they consider to be a  political situation there, from the passage of the legislation—and I concur  with the analysis of the Senator from  New Jersey of it—and now $21⁄4billion  dollars to be sent down for other—I am  sorry, that includes the Cornyn amendment, the Senator from Texas. It is  $200 million for Senator KYL—let’s say  $450 million between Senators MCCAIN  and KYL, money to be sent into this Arizona situation.  I wonder if we shouldn’t declare a  time out in Arizona for at least some  thoughtful reflection about what works  and what doesn’t. It seems there is no  end to ideas that are being propounded  down there to respond to situations  real and imagined. These amendments  are clear evidence.  I don’t know if the Senator from New  Jersey sees it the same way.  ",2010
1040,80,2010-05-26,Mr. MENENDEZ.,"  I appreciate  the  question and view of the Senator from  Illinois. Yes, that is why I said I respect the previous positions Senator  MCCAINhad. He understood that you  cannot solve this problem by throwing  more money, more troops at it. At the  end of the day, that has not achieved  all  the goals, despite enormous  increases. And yet there are still challenges.  In view of the fact the President himself—something I personally don’t support but nonetheless has gone ahead  and made a deployment on his own, it  seems to me we should see what works  before we advance billions for efforts  and directing troops by an amendment  when those troops could be needed for  a whole host of things.  I have to be honest with you. If we  are going  to  start directing  troops,  then I wish to see them directed to the  gulf so, in fact, we can help out with  the oilspill not getting  into critical  wetlands and estuaries. I think that is  a national emergency.  ",2010
1041,80,2010-05-26,Mr. DURBIN.," I ask through the Chair  one last question. I don’t know what  the situation is with the New Jersey  Guard, but many of the Illinois Guard  have been deployed and redeployed in  Iraq and Afghanistan at great inconvenience and hardship to their families. The McCain amendment calls for  deployment within  72 hours. People  will  literally be removed  from their  families and on the road headed down  to Arizona within 72 hours under the  McCain amendment.  I ask the Senator if he has dealt with  these Guard families and has any idea  what impact this might have on their  lives.  ",2010
1042,80,2010-05-26,Mr. MENENDEZ.,"  I appreciate  the  Senator’s question. The fact is, as I  mentioned earlier in my comments, we  have used the National Guard in an unprecedented  way.  They  have  been  called for deployment abroad, both in  Iraq and Afghanistan, and elsewhere in  unprecedented numbers.

1043,87,2010-05-26,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, I wish today to mention  the outstanding work of an ambassador  who  is  leaving Washington  after  4  years of distinguished achievement—  Ambassador  Oleh  Shamshur  of  Ukraine.  There  is  little doubt that he has  made a major contribution to strengthening bilateral relations between our  countries. Ambassador Shamshur was  one of the senior negotiators of the  United  States-Ukraine  Charter  on  Strategic Partnership signed on December 19, 2008, which elevated relations between the United States and  Ukraine to a new level. The charter is  a  living document and continues to  guide  cooperation  between  the  two  countries. On April 12, 2010, President  Obama and President Yanukovych reaffirmed  their  commitment  to  the  charter and expressed their intention  to realize its full potential.  Ambassador Shamshur also played an  important role in the establishment of  the United States-Ukrainian Strategic  Partnership Commission and participated in its first inaugural session in  December 2009. The commission has reinvigorated  relations  between  the  United States and Ukraine with an ongoing dialog and program of cooperation on issues of democracy, economic  freedom and prosperity, security and  territorial integrity, energy security,  defense-related cooperation, the rule of  law, and people-to-people contacts.  During Ambassador Shamshur’s tenure in Washington, Ukraine once more  demonstrated its important leadership  on the question of nonproliferation and  arms control  issues. Cooperation on  these issues between Washington and  Kyiv has been significantly enhanced.  These efforts were conspicuous in the  positive outcome of the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington.  While  in Washington, Ambassador  Shamshur’s accomplishments were not  limited to issues of international security or geopolitics. Early on  in his  service here, the United States reinstated tariff preferences  for Ukraine  under the Generalized System of Preferences and granted Ukraine market  economy status. The Ambassador was  instrumental in the efforts that led to  Ukraine’s graduation from the Jackson-Vanick Amendment on 23 March  2006. The United States and Ukraine  were also able to sign a bilateral agreement on market access issues, which  became a key step in Ukraine’s eventual joining the World Trade Organization. The establishment of the United  States-Ukraine Council on Trade and  Investment in March 2008 was also a result of Ambassador Shamshur’s tireless  efforts.  This  year,  Ambassador  Shamshur can also claim credit for the  resolution of difficulties surrounding  the operation of the Overseas Private  Investment Corporation in Ukraine and  its return to the Ukrainian market.  Many of us on Capitol Hill and in the  administration share an appreciation  for  Ambassador  Oleh  Shamshur’s  achievements. He leaves relations between Ukraine and the United States  immeasurably  stronger  for  having  served here these 4 years. We wish him  and the Ukrainian people well on the  occasion of his departure.  f  AMERICA COMPETES ACT  ",2010
1044,87,2010-05-26,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President,  about a year ago, the United Arab  Emirates decided to secure its energy  future. The Emirates is a small Persian  Gulf state that is awash in oil and annually rakes in about $80 billion in oil  revenues. For its own domestic energy  needs, however, it opted to go with another technology—nuclear power.  Its  reasoning was  that  the  oil  in  the  ground will eventually run out and  that it would be best to conserve and  prepare for that day.  The Emirates specified they wanted  to build four nuclear reactors and estimated the costs at around $40 billion.  Sure enough,  the bids  soon  started  coming in from the world’s leading nuclear vendors. There was Areva, the  company born out of France’s nuclear  effort—they now get 80 percent of their  electricity from nuclear and are building  one of  their new Evolutionary  Power Reactors in Finland. There was  Westinghouse, which  is building  its  new AP1000  reactors  in Japan  and  China. You may recognize the name.  They were once, along with General  Electric, America’s leading electrical  manufacturer. Now they are a Japanese company, bought by Toshiba in  2006.  While  these  two giants dueled, a  third  competitor  entered  the  field.  South Korea only started building its  own nuclear reactors  in 1996. Before  that they bought from the U.S. and the  Japanese. But then they took an old  design from Combustion Engineering,  another American company, and fashioned the APR–1400. After building a  few  for themselves they entered the  world market. Meanwhile, in the Persian Gulf oil business, the Koreans had  established a  reputation  for getting  things done on budget and on time.  Still, it was a complete shock last  October when the United Arab Emirates passed over bids from the world’s  two leading companies, Areva and Westinghouse, and awarded the contract to  South Korea for $20 billion—half the  original estimated price. The French  and the Japanese have gone back to  the drawing boards to figure out what  went wrong so they will be better able  to compete next time.  How did the Koreans come so far so  fast? People will talk about  ‘‘cheap  labor,’’  ‘‘government enterprise’’ and  ‘‘copycat technology.’’ But I have another hypothesis. Year after year, Korean students are at the top of world  performance in math and science while  the United States doesn’t even rank in  the top 10. In the Program for International Student Assessment’s math  test  for 15-year-old students,  for  instance, South Korea ranks third, behind Finland and Taiwan, while the  United States ranks 21st. They are 75  points ahead of us on a scale of 1,000.  We have been hearing about these  statistics for decades—maybe we have  even grown used to them—but now we  are starting to see the consequences.  We are a country that is falling behind  the rest of the world in science literacy. In terms of energy, the rest of  the world is currently going through a  nuclear renaissance while we are barely able to construct new reactors in  our own country. Part of our population still thinks a nuclear reactor is  an atomic bomb that can go up in a  mushroom cloud any minute. A larger  number believes that if we cover the  Great Smoky Mountains with windmills we could generate all the electricity we need without having to build  either nuclear reactors or coal plants. I  call this ‘‘Going to War in Sailboats.’’  That is the title of a book I have just  written. If we were to go to war tomorrow, would we put our fleet of nuclear  submarines  and  aircraft  carriers  in  mothballs and commission a fleet of  sailing vessels?  Four years ago Senator JEFFBINGAand I asked the National Academies:  MAN What are the top 10 actions, in priority  order, that federal policymakers could take  to enhance the science and technology enterprise so that the United States can successfully compete, prosper, and be secure in the  global community of the 21st century? What  strategy, with several concrete steps, could  be used to implement each of those actions?  The Academies responded quickly to  that request by assembling a distinguished panel, headed by Norman R.  Augustine that quickly produced a list  of  20  recommendations  along with  strategies in the report, ‘‘Rising Above  the Gathering Storm.’’ That report was  issued 3 years ago. I think its message  is even more immediate today.  In response to the Gathering Storm  report, Congress enacted and the President signed the America COMPETES  Act in 2007, incorporating many of the  Academies’ recommendations and establishing a blueprint for maintaining  America’s competitive position. In the  COMPETES Act we authorized funding  to improve education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

I also submit a copy of  the letters referenced therein.  CONGRESSOFTHEUNITEDSTATES,  HOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES,  May 24, 2010.  Hon. BARACKOBAMA,  The President, The White House,  Washington, DC.  DEARMR. PRESIDENT: This is in response to  your actions of December 30, 2009, on House  Joint Resolution 64, a short-term continuing  resolution of appropriations that was presented to you on December 19, 2009. That  measure was intended to accommodate your  review and approval of the regular appropriations but was rendered unnecessary when  you were able to act swiftly on the regular  appropriations. You therefore decided not to  approve the joint resolution. Although you  cited The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655  (1929), you returned the parchment to the  House with a memorandum of disapproval  stating that you wanted to leave no doubt  that the joint resolution was being vetoed as  unnecessary.  You acted on the joint resolution on the  ninth day of the 10-day period during which  you could approve it. The standing rules of  the House made the Clerk available to receive your message. The House and Senate  stood adjourned sine die but with provision  for reassembly of the first session and with  the certainty of reassembly for the second  session of the instant Congress. Thus, each  body was in a position to reconsider the vetoed measure in light of your objections, either in the second session or even in the first  session.  The circumstances surrounding the presentment and return of House Joint Resolution 64 and the readiness of Congress to reconsider the joint resolution in light of Presidential objections compel us to question the  assertion that a pocket veto did or could  have occurred. We think you agree that the  pocket veto and the return veto are available  on mutually exclusive bases and, therefore,  during mutually exclusive periods. We think  you also should agree that the constitutional  concern  that a measure not become  law  without the President’s signature when an  adjournment prevents a return veto does not  arise when the President is able to return  the parchment to the originating House with  a statement of his objections. Accordingly,  we believe that your return of House Joint  Resolution 64 with your objections is absolutely inconsistent with this most essential  characteristic of a pocket veto, to wit: retention of the parchment by the President for  lack of a legislative body to whom he might  return it with his objections. Your successful  return of House Joint Resolution 64 establishes that you were not prevented from returning it.  After an enrolled measure is presented for  Presidential approval, the parchment ultimately meets one of four ends. It might be  tendered to the Archivist by the President  because he signed it or allowed it to become  law without his signature. It might be referred to committee by the first house to  sustain a veto. It might be tendered to the  Archivist by the second house to override a  veto. Or it might be retained by the President because he ‘‘pocketed’’ it. If the President returns a parchment to the Congress,  then he has not pocketed it, and it therefore  is subject to reconsideration. Either the Congress has prevented the President from returning the parchment with a statement of  his objections or it has not. By returning the  parchment a President is admitting that he  is not prevented from returning it.  The House has treated your message of December 30, 2009, on House Joint Resolution 64  as a return veto. On January 12, 2010, the  message—comprising  the  parchment  and  your memorandum of disapproval—was laid  before the House. After the memorandum  was read, your objections were entered in the  Journal and the House obeyed the command  of the Constitution to  ‘‘proceed to reconsider’’ the joint resolution. Rather than immediately considering the ultimate question  of overriding or sustaining the veto, the  House chose as its first mode of reconsideration a postponement until January 13, 2010.  On that day the House reconsidered the joint  resolution in light of your objections and  voted by the yeas and nays on the question  of overriding or sustaining the veto. The  House sustained your return veto.  We enclose for your consideration copies of  previous letters to President George H. W.  Bush, to President Clinton, and to President  George W. Bush, respectively dated November 21, 1989, September 7, 2000, and April 14,  2008. Those letters from Speaker Foley and  Leader Michel,  from Speaker Hastert and  Leader Gephardt, and from the two undersigned, respectively, expressed the profound  concern of the bipartisan leaderships over  similar assertions of pocket vetoes. We echo  those concerns and urge you to give appropriate deference to such judicial resolutions  of this question as have been possible.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Best regards,  NANCYPELOSI,  Speaker of the House.  JOHNA. BOEHNER,  Republican Leader.  CONGRESSOFTHEUNITEDSTATES,  Washington, DC, April 14, 2008.  Hon. GEORGEW. BUSH,  The President, The White House,  Washington, DC.  DEARMR. PRESIDENT: This is in response to  your actions of December 28, 2007, on H.R.  1585, the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2008, which you returned to  the House of Representatives without your  approval. In returning the parchment you  transmitted a memorandum of disapproval  stating your objections to enactment of the  bill. This memorandum of disapproval  included the following paragraph:  ‘‘The adjournment of the Congress has prevented my return of H.R. 1585 within the  meaning of Article I, section 7, clause 2 of  the Constitution. Accordingly, my withholding of approval from the bill precludes  its becoming law. The Pocket Veto Case, 279  U.S. 655 (1929). In addition to withholding my  signature and thereby invoking my constitutional power to ‘pocket veto’ bills during an  adjournment of the Congress, I am also sending H.R. 1585 to the Clerk of the House of  Representatives,  along with  this memorandum setting forth my objections, to avoid  unnecessary litigation about the non-enactment of the bill that results from my withholding approval and to leave no doubt that  the bill is being vetoed.’’  The circumstances surrounding the presentment and return of H.R. 1585 and the  readiness of Congress to reconsider the bill  in light of Presidential objections compel us  to question the assertion that a pocket veto  did or could have occurred. We think you  agree that the pocket veto and the return  veto are available on mutually exclusive  bases and, therefore, during mutually exclusive periods. We think you should also agree  that the constitutional concern that a bill  not become law without the President’s signature when an adjournment prevents a return veto does not arise when the President  is able to return the parchment to the originating House with a statement of his objections.

Your successful  return of H.R. 1585 establishes that you were  not prevented from returning it.  H.R. 1585 was presented to you on December 19, 2007. You returned the bill on December 28, 2007—the eighth of the ten days allowed under the Constitution. The Clerk was  available pursuant to the standing rules of  the House to receive your message. The Congress was in a position to reconsider the bill  in light of Presidential objections, even in  the first session of the instant Congress. Although the House had adjourned sine die  (without specifying a day of return), it did so  with provision for its reassembly. Moreover,  both houses were to reassemble in due course  for a second session of the instant Congress.  After an enrolled bill is presented for Presidential approval, the parchment ultimately  meets one of four ends. It might be tendered  to the Archivist by the President because he  signed it or allowed it to become law without  his signature.

1047,129,2010-05-26,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Madam Speaker, I  ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing  the 50th anniversary of the National Council  for  International Visitors, NCIV—a nonprofit  leader  in citizen diplomacy—and supporting  designation of February 16, 2011, as ‘‘Citizen  Diplomacy Day.’’  NCIV  is a membership association, with  members  based  in  congressional  districts  throughout the nation, dedicated to promoting  excellence  in citizen diplomacy—the concept  that individual citizens have the right and responsibility  to help shape U.S.  foreign relations ‘‘one handshake at a time.’’ NCIV’s nationwide network comprises 92 community organizations as well as federal agencies, associate members, and individuals. With leadership and training provided by NCIV, member  organizations create professional connections,  provide cultural activities, and offer home hospitality opportunities  for  foreign  leaders and  specialists. Each year, the aggregate efforts of  NCIV members involve more than 80,000 volunteers.  The NCIV network is the private-sector partner of the U.S. Department of State for the  International  Visitor  Leadership  Program,  IVLP, a long-standing, successful initiative for  strengthening U.S. foreign relations. More than  285 current and former heads of state (including F.W. de Klerk, Anwar Sadat, Manmohan  Singh,  Nicolas  Sarkozy,  and  Morgan  Tsvangarai) and approximately 1,700 cabinet-  level ministers have participated in the IVLP,  which U.S.  ambassadors  have  repeatedly  ranked first among 63 U.S. public diplomacy  initiatives.  Through citizen diplomacy,  the NCIV network and  the  IVLP have positively affected  hundreds of thousands of lives in America and  abroad—among countless other ways, by:  Empowering a key reformer to stand up for  democracy and  freedom  following  the February 2010 coup in Niger;  Introducing high school students  in Reno,  Nevada, to Moroccan journalists and Afghan  women leaders;  Sharing best practices with leaders of Malaysian disaster-relief nonprofits in the wake of  a devastating earthquake and tsunami;  Connecting an environmental and water resources engineering  firm  from Portland, Oregon,  to business opportunities with China;  and  Breaking stereotypes about Americans for a  Yemeni governance and conflict management  expert.  The success of NCIV is based on patriotic  citizens, entrepreneurs, and small businesses  coming  together  to help promote America  abroad while boosting the local economy. By  working with the State Department, NCIV is an  important source of income for many throughout the U.S. based on the increased economic  activity  generated  by  international  visitors.  Nearly the entire IVLP budget is spent within  the United States, where it generates millions  of dollars  in  local economic activity. NCIV  members raise an additional $6 for every dollar they receive in federal funding, all of which  is spent locally. Furthermore, by bringing foreign  leaders  to U.S.  schools, government  agencies, and businesses, the NCIV network  and the IVLP help U.S. communities build a  more globally literate, competitive workforce.  Please  join me  in demonstrating congressional support for this national network of citizen diplomats by recognizing NCIV’s 50th anniversary and  recommending designation of  February 16, 2011, as Citizen Diplomacy Day.

LAURA RICHARDSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 26, 2010  ",2010
1048,129,2010-05-26,Ms. RICHARDSON.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today in support of H. Res. 1339, which expresses  the House of Representatives’ support  for  the designation of May as National  Foster Care Month and recognizes the important role that foster parents play in the lives of  children across the country. There are nearly  500,000 children in America’s foster care system. Many of these children come from troubled backgrounds and turbulent pasts. America’s foster parents take these children in and  show  them  the care and attention  that  they  deserve as they wait to be reunited with their  families or adopted into new, loving families.  I thank Chairman LEVIN for his leadership in  bringing this bill to the floor. I also thank the  sponsor  of  this  legislation,  Congressman  for working  to  increase public  awareness about the critical role that the foster care system plays in our society.  In my home State of California,  there are  nearly 80,000 children in the foster care system, a majority of whom were placed there by  the State as a result of parental abuse or neglect. Foster parents play a critical role in the  lives of some the most vulnerable youths in  California and across the country. They help  hold our Nation’s social fabric together by ensuring that thousands of young people in this  country stay on track towards successful futures.  Designating May as National Foster Care  Month is a way to encourage responsible and  MCDERMOTT,  caring adults to serve as foster parents. Unfortunately, there is currently a shortage in the  number of foster parents available. There are  less than 3 foster homes for every 10 children  living under the State’s care.  While the foster care system provides a vital  service in our society, children in foster homes  often  face  special  challenges.  In  2008,  123,000 of the 273,000 children in the foster  care system were waiting to be adopted into  new homes. However, by the end of the year,  only 55,000 were adopted out of foster care.  Foster children who are not adopted or reunited with their families often end up ‘‘aging  out’’ of the foster care system. These children  who ‘‘age out’’ of the system are in need of resources to help them afford higher education  opportunities,  find  affordable  housing  and  quality health insurance, and achieve steady  employment. This is a social demand to which  Congress must respond.  Past  legislative  initiatives  to  invest  in our  country’s foster care system include the Adoption Assistance and Safe Families Act of 1980,  the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997,  and  the Fostering Connections  to Success  and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. These  initiatives recognized the need to provide increased  resources  for  foster  families and a  sense of stability for foster children, 65 percent of whom experience a minimum of seven  school changes while in the system. Congress  must continue working to improve the foster  care system, so  that all children within  this  system can develop and mature  in young  adults with bright futures.  I salute the selflessness and hard work that  foster parents demonstrate each day when  they care for a child who had been displaced  from his or her family. I offer my sincere support for dedicating the month of May as National Foster Care Month.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 1339.  f  CELEBRATING ASIAN/PACIFIC  AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH  SPEECHOF  HON. JOE BACA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 25, 2010  ",2010

As an original cosponsor of this bill, I am  proud to stand here today and speak on this  important resolution.  This is a nation of immigrants and it is always  important  to  take  time, and recognize  the contributions  that different cultures and  ethnicities have made to our society and our  American way of life.  Today, the Asian/Pacific community is one  of the fastest growing populations in America.  Over 15 million Americans claim Asian descent and over 1 million residents claim Native  Hawaiian descent. By 2050, the Census bureau estimates that over 40 million residents  will claim Asian/Pacific descent.  Since  the  time  the  first Asian  immigrants  came  to America  in 1843,  these  individuals  have had a profound effect on our history.  A large number of Asian immigrants helped  to complete the transcontinental railroad.

1050,2,2010-06-07,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, following  leader remarks, there will be a period  for the transaction of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  for up to 10 minutes each. At 4:30 p.m.  today, we will turn to executive session  to consider three nominations, with debate until 5:30 p.m. equally divided and  controlled  between Senators LEAHY  and SESSIONSor their designees. At 5:30  p.m., the Senate will proceed to a series of up to three rollcall votes. Those  votes will be on the confirmation of  Audrey Fleissing, of Missouri, to be a  U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Missouri; Lucy Koh, of California, to be U.S. district judge for the  Northern District of California; and  Jane Magnus-Stinson, of Indiana, to be  a U.S. district judge for the Southern  District of Indiana.  This week, the Senate will consider  the House message with respect to the  tax  extenders  legislation. Also,  on  Thursday, June 10, we will consider  S.J. Res. 26, a  joint resolution disapproving a rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency with  respect to greenhouse gases, under provisions of an agreement reached May  25.  f  JUNE WORK  PERIOD,  OILSPILL,  AND  IMPERFECT GAME  IN DETROIT  ",2010
1051,2,2010-06-07,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I welcome  back my colleagues from their travels  back home. It is always good to see  them and my staff. I am grateful for all  who are here working hard. I know we  all benefit from seeing and speaking  with our neighbors and constituents,  honoring our Nation’s bravest on Memorial Day, and talking about the good  work we have done this year.  We have really done a lot. Long overdue health care reform is now the law  of the land. To show how much we have  done, Norm Ornstein, one of the most  celebrated pundits, columnists,  journalists in all of Washington, reported a  few weeks ago that this is the most  productive Congress in the history of  the country. That comes from someone  who is not from the left or the right  but someone who is a mainstream journalist  in America today. The House  and Senate have each passed bills to  clean up Wall Street. Three million  Americans who  are  going  to work  today have the Recovery Act to thank  for their jobs. In Nevada, the Recovery  Act created or saved more than 4,000  jobs in just the past 4 months alone.  Again, that is in Nevada.  But every time I go home, I am reminded how much more we have to do  and become reenergized to do it. The  work period between now and July 4 is  short, but our to-do list is very long.  We have to pass an emergency extension of unemployment benefits and  other matters related to job creation,  which will be in the bill that will be  put on the Senate floor this afternoon.  These benefits have now expired and so  should our patience for excuses. These  people lost their jobs through no fault  of their own. They are struggling to  put food on the table and to take their  kids to the doctor. It is important that  we recognize that. It is an emergency  for these families and for our entire  country.  Many who oppose this extension gave  tax breaks to rich CEOs who shipped  American jobs overseas. Now their constituents are looking for a lifeline in a  job market they helped sink. I hope  both sides can come together to give  them the help both they and our economy need.  This legislation cuts taxes for middle-class families and small businesses.  This bill includes a host of tax credits,  tax extenders, and tax incentives, all of  which will help put people back to  work—something Democrats and Republicans should come together to finish because it is something we can all  support and be proud we did. More than  that, it is something each of our States  desperately needs.  To this legislation we intend to add a  bill for FMAP funding, that is, Medicaid money to ensure the poorest in  our communities can afford to stay  healthy, which will protect  jobs  in  States  such as Nevada and prevent  deep cuts to critical services all over  the country.  Mr. President, just a few comments  about the remarks of my friend, the  Republican  leader. We all know the  debt of our country is significant and  of concern to us. But I am stunned by  my friend’s short memory of history.  One reason we have this red ink that is  flowing so strongly is we had two wars  that weren’t paid  for. The Iraq war  alone cost $1 trillion. Many say it was  a war of choice, not of necessity.  The financial meltdown came about  as a result of decisions Republicans  made.

1055,30,2010-06-07,Mr. LUGAR.," Madam President,  I  wish today to take the opportunity to  express my congratulations to the winners of the 2009–2010 Dick Lugar/Indiana Farm Bureau/Indiana Farm Bureau  Insurance Companies Youth Essay Contest.  In 1985,  I  joined with the  Indiana  Farm Bureau to sponsor an essay contest for eighth grade students in my  home State. The purpose of this contest is to encourage young Hoosiers to  recognize and appreciate the  importance of Indiana agriculture in their  lives and subsequently craft an essay  responding to the assigned theme. The  theme chosen for this year was ‘‘Farmers Looking at a Bright Future.’’  Along with my friends at the Indiana  Farm Bureau and Indiana Farm Bureau  Insurance Companies,  I  am  pleased  with the annual response to this contest and the quality of the essays received over the years. I applaud each of  this  year’s  participants  on  their  thoughtful work and wish, especially,  to highlight the submissions of the  2009–2010  contest  winners—Jordan  Cadle of Orleans, Indiana, and Layne  Sanders of Greensburg, Indiana. I submit for the RECORD the complete text  of Jordan’s and Layne’s respective essays. I am pleased, also, to include the  names of the many district and county  winners of the contest.  The winning essays follow:  UNTITLED  (By Jordan Cadle)  With world population skyrocketing, farmers need to step off the treadmill of slow incremental growth and jump into using new  revolutionary  thoughts. The  three main  ideas for future generations of farmers meeting  this  challenge  are:  perennial  crops,  multistoried  planting  beds,  and  hover  robotic machinery.  Putting the knowledge of the crop geneticist to use, I believe the world can create  new perennial crops to plant in more evenly  balanced climates year around and in greenhouses. If we had corn and soybeans that  could survive the winter and keep producing  like a tomato plant (in proper growing conditions) this would allow farmers to rarely buy  seeds. Also,  this would maintain  yield  throughout the year for consumption. These  plants would be bred to have multiple ears,  pods, or heads in order to sustain a sufficient  yield at all times.  Helping to produce more of these perennial  crops, they could be raised on multistoried  planting beds. Imagine these being like large  parking garages where each layer is a field.  Artificial lighting would be used for stories  that are not exposed to sunlight. Going upward with fields leaves more room for people  to live and natural trees to grow since we  will be exhausting our supply of cultivatable  land on earth.  Tending to these crops, hover robotic machinery will be used. Utilizing this machinery will allow farmers to plant and tend to  crops, while the ground may still be too wet  for standard machinery. Also, the line of machinery will be equipped with laser sensors  to care  for each plants’  individual needs.  This will minimize input costs. Just like robots in general, one farmer will be able to  control several at a time.  I believe hover robotic machinery, multistoried planting beds, and perennial crops  will guide farmers running to a brighter future.  FARMERSLOOKINGATABRIGHTFUTURE  (By Layne Sanders)  Farming has been and will continue to be  a major part of Indiana’s future. Change is  inevitable, and Indiana’s farmers will need to  learn to change also. A continuing global demand for high quality and economic food  puts Indiana in an enviable position. I think  the number of farms will decline, and the average size will continue to increase. Large  farms will take advantage of continued advancements in technology to increase productivity and decrease labor. GPS systems  will allow tractors to drive themselves and  apply fertilizers in fields as needed. No-till  farming will play an important role in Indiana’s farming future also, no-tilling requires  less equipment, less fuel, and is better for  the soil. No-till farming reduces soil erosion  and saves tons of our precious top soil.  Smaller farmers may need to be more innovative  to  survive  the  changing  times  ahead. I feel there are real opportunities for  small farms in specialty markets. Organic  farming holds some intriguing possibilities,  as Americans and the world are more and  more concerned about the quality of their  food. Certified organic meats and vegetables  marketed thru a  farm name brand, using  sources like the Internet, traditional grocery  stores, and farmers markets, could provide  the niche a smaller farm may need to survive.  Livestock farms will have the technology  to collect waste from many locations and  pump the waste to a centralized location.  This animal waste can then be converted  into biogas, and used to provide energy for  our  farms, cities, and  industries. Carbon  credits could be earned by the farms that  contribute to biomass facility, these credits  could then be exchanged  for energy,  fertilizer, or other byproducts  from the digester. This is a relatively new technology  and the future is really wide open with possibilities. Indeed the future is bright.  2009–2010 DISTRICTESSAYWINNERS  DISTRICT1  Luke Kepler and Alexandra Magallon.  DISTRICT2  Ashley Kain and Curtis Mourey.

1056,37,2010-06-07,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President, along  with my distinguished colleague Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, I  rise today to introduce the Section 8(a)  Improvements Act of 2010. As the Chair  of the Committee on Small Business  and Entrepreneurship, I have held a  number of hearings and roundtables on  the  issues affecting small businesses  that contract with the Federal Government. The Committee has repeatedly  heard from small businesses throughout the country that more needs to be  done to level the playing field and help  our small businesses win Federal contracts. The legislation that I am introducing today seeks to improve access  to Federal contracts  for small businesses, particularly  for  socially and  economically  disadvantaged  small  businesses. It also represents the third  in a series of steps that the Committee  is taking to address the disparities and  inequalities that currently exist in the  Federal procurement process.  As I have explained in previous statements before this chamber, as the largest purchaser in the world, the Federal  Government is uniquely positioned to  offer new and reliable business opportunities for our small firms. Government contracts are one of the easiest  and most inexpensive ways the government can help to immediately increase  sales for America’s entrepreneurs, leading to the creation of new jobs and  helping to move our economy forward.  When large businesses get government  contracts, they are able to absorb that  new work  into their existing workforce. When small businesses get government work they must ‘‘staff up’’ to  meet  the  increased demand. By  increasing contracts to small businesses  by just 1 percent, we can create more  than 100,000 new jobs. Today, we need  those jobs more than ever.  But the reality is that small businesses need all the help they can get  when  it comes to accessing Federal  contracts. Small businesses  face significant challenges  in competing  for  these opportunities, including a maze  of complicated  regulations, contract  bundling  issues,  size  standards with  loopholes for big businesses, and a lack  of protections for sub-contractors. Despite the  fact that Federal agencies  have a statutory goal to spend 23 percent of their contract dollars on contracts to small firms, in recent years  the government has often fallen short.  For example, according to the Federal Procurement Data System, in fiscal year 2007 the Federal Government  missed its 23 percent contracting goal  by  .992  percent. That  .992  percent  doesn’t sound like much, but in reality  it represents more than $3.74 billion  and  93,500  jobs  lost  for  small businesses. In fiscal year 2008, the Federal  Procurement Data System  reported  that the government missed its goal by  1.51 percent, meaning more than $6.51  billion and 162,700  jobs  lost  for our  small businesses. At a time when more  than 15 million Americans are still out  of work, merely meeting that 23 percent goal could mean food on the table  for a family struggling to make ends  meet.  Clearly we need to do better when it  comes to helping our small businesses  access Federal contracting opportunities. Even  under  the  best  of  circumstances our small businesses face  significant  challenges when  seeking  Federal contracting opportunities. But  these  challenges  are  further  compounded for small businesses that face  additional obstacles, particularly those  that are socially and economically disadvantaged.  The Section 8(a) Improvements Act  of 2010 attempts to help socially and  economically disadvantaged  firms  in  three ways. First, it makes long overdue and much needed adjustments to  the average annual  income and net  worth thresholds currently  in place.  Since the establishment of the 8(a) program over 30 years ago, these thresholds have not been significantly updated to account for inflation, placing  unrealistic  limits on the number of  small businesses that are eligible to  participate in the program.  Additionally,  this  legislation  requires the SBA to establish maximum  net worth thresholds for socially and  economically  disadvantaged  small  businesses working  in  the manufacturing, construction, professional services, and general services  industries.  Small businesses working in these industries simply face different business  conditions as well as higher business  costs, which prevent them from participating in the 8(a) program. Making  this simple fix will open the program  up to a wide array of qualified small  businesses.  Secondly, this legislation builds upon  the previously mentioned adjustments  to the net worth and income thresholds, by extending the amount of time  under which a business can participate  in the program. For all of the success  that many small businesses experience  while participating  in  the program,  upon graduation as many as 70 percent  see their businesses fail within several  years. By establishing a transition period, businesses that have graduated  from the program can continue receiving developmental assistance for up to  3 years  after  graduation,  providing  them with much needed stability as  they seek to transition their business  operations.  The third way this  legislation attempts to improve contracting opportunities for small businesses is through  the creation of a Surety Bond Pilot  Program. Under the program, the SBA  can guarantee  90 percent of  surety  bonds,  protecting  small  businesses  against  any  loss  resulting  from  a  breach of the terms on a bond. To supplement the guarantee and help put  these small businesses in a stronger position to succeed upon graduation from  the 8(a) program, the legislation also  requires  the  SBA  to  provide  educational training and technical assistance on a wide range of topics. Finally,  the legislation establishes a revolving  fund to support the program, and also  creates an advisory board to oversee  and evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the program.  It is well past time to provide greater  opportunities  for  the  thousands  of  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:23 Oct 09, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S07JN0.REC S07JN0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010

1064,8,2010-06-14,Mr. KINGSTON.," Madam  Speaker,  Members of the House,  it’s a great  honor to introduce TOMGRAVES, the  newest member of the Georgia delegation and, obviously, the newest Member of the United States Congress. TOM  comes to us from the Ninth District of  Georgia, the seat which was held by  Nathan Deal. And we all miss Nathan.  He was a leading voice on Medicaid and  immigration issues. And I know that  TOMwill continue that fight for the  people of the Ninth District of Georgia.  comes  from Ranger, Georgia.  You may not know Ranger, Georgia,  population 91, but it’s a little bit down  the road from Red Bud, Georgia, which  isn’t incorporated, and not too far from  Fairmount, Georgia. The three of them  collectively are near nothing at all.  They are in Gordon County.  Now, TOMserved for 71⁄2years in the  Georgia General Assembly and was on  the Transportation, Health and Human  Services Committee and the Ways and  Means Committee. He was a leader in  job creation for the State of Georgia,  and with his JOBS Act, introduced in  2009, he worked for pro-growth legislation—legislation that would phase out  the corporate income tax and eliminate the burdensome inventory tax for  Georgia businesses. For this, he was  recognized  by ALEC,  the American  Legislative Exchange Council, to which  many of us once belonged. He was nominated and earned the title of Legislator of the Year.  TOMhas also been recognized by the  National Federation  of  Independent  Businesses as the Guardian of Small  Business and by the Georgia Retail Association for being Legislator of the  Year, and was one of only two State  legislators  in the country to be selected by FreedomWorks Foundation  to  receive  the Legislative Entrepreneurial Award.  TOM, we’re very glad to have you.  But we’re also especially glad to have  your wife, Julie, who’s sitting up in the  gallery. TOMalso has his three children  with him  today: JoAnn, John, and  Janey. And we’re glad  that you’re  going to share your daddy with us.  TOM is well known back home for  having a beautiful family and a very  ugly pickup  truck. But he  is committed to the truck. He’s had it for 13  years—and he thought that was a long  time. But I want to introduce you to  GARYACKERMAN, who will tell you how  to really take care of a car, which I  think now is going on 30 years old.  TOM, I also want to tell my friends  and CORRINE BROWN,  CLIFF STEARNS who come from a State that likes to  pretend like they play football, that  TOMGraves is a Georgia Bulldog. We  can always use one more in the world.  So if any of you people from Florida  want to convert, it would be a good  time.  TOM, we welcome you to the greatest  body, the greatest legislative body the  world has ever seen: the United States  Congress.  With that, I want to yield to my good  friend, Mr. JOHNLEWIS, the dean of our  delegation.  ",2010
1065,8,2010-06-14,Mr.  LEWIS  of  Georgia.," Madam  Speaker,  I would  like to thank my  good friend, JACKKINGSTON, for yielding me time.  As the dean of the Georgia delegation, it is my great pleasure to welcome TOMGRAVESto the United States  House of Representatives. Mr. GRAVES  is not a stranger to Georgia politics.  He served in the Georgia State House  of Representatives for almost 8 years.  TOM, I not only welcome you, but I am  proud to welcome your beautiful wife,  Julie, and your three lovely and beautiful children.  The SPEAKER. The gentleman from  Georgia is recognized.  ",2010
1066,8,2010-06-14,Mr. GRAVES  of Georgia.," Madam  Speaker and Congressman LEWIS, Congressman KINGSTON, thank you.  As we recognize Flag Day today, it’s  also a reminder of the greatness of this  young Republic, the  foundations  for  which  it rests, and the opportunity  that awaits.  As one who didn’t grow up in wealth  or politics but, really, quite the opposite—very simple beginnings in a single-wide trailer on a tar and gravel  road in the backwoods of north Georgia—I am here now able to pay tribute  to my parents who couldn’t give me  the material things in life but, instead,  they showed me love and they encouraged me to dream big, to work hard,  and achieve much.  And while I am standing before you  today as a freshman Member, I am the  freshest voice from the campaign trail.  And  the message  from  the hills of  north Georgia to the Hill of this great  building is very clear, and that is that  it’s time to curb spending. It’s time to  balance the budget, and it’s time to  empower the people.  While the challenges are great in this  Nation, the will and the Constitution  of her people are greater. And, you  know, my dad was right.  If we, as  Americans, dream big, work hard, we  can achieve much as a Nation.  So on behalf of Georgia Nine, Madam  Speaker, I am here to go to work.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  The SPEAKER.

1069,15,2010-06-14,Mr. JONES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to express my sincere dismay  with the letter from Jeh Johnson, general counsel of the Department of Defense, to Senator CARLLEVIN, declaring the DOD opposition to Senate bill  504, legislation to rename the Department of the Navy as the Department of  Navy and Marine Corps. In his letter  Mr. Johnson states: ‘‘The renaming of  the Department  is unnecessary and  would incur additional expense of several hundred thousand dollars a year  over the next several years.’’  In response to my letter, the CBO report actually  states  that  ‘‘the bill  would have very little effect on most  U.S. Naval or Marine Corps installations. The cost of implementing this  bill would be less than $500,000 a year  over the next several years from appropriated  funds. And enacting the bill  would not affect direct spending or revenues.’’ So therefore it would not have  an impact, Mr. Speaker.  With that said, I would like to ask  Mr. Johnson, Do you think that our  men and women of the United States  Marine Corps are worth  this  small  monetary  amount? Have  they  not  earned the right to be recognized and  respected?  Mr. Speaker, it is a joke for DOD to  be concerned about such a small monetary amount considering the money  that has been and is continuing to be  wasted by the Department of Defense.  An audit conducted by the Department  of Defense IG revealed that the Federal  Government failed to substantiate the  disbursements of at least $7.8 billion of  $8.2 billion spent for goods and services  in Iraq. I would think Mr. Johnson  should be more  focused  on  serious  money issues such as these instead of  focusing his efforts on opposing the  recognition that our marines truly deserve.  Our marines have fought alongside  the Navy for many years, and if they  are truly viewed as one fighting team,  they should receive equal recognition.  This bill is not meant to take anything  away from the Navy. It does not demand any special concessions for the  Marine Corps.  It  simply adds  three  words to the name. I am baffled as to  why Mr. Johnson felt the need to interject into this matter now, when it has  been ongoing for the past 10 years. We  have the support of a record 425 Members of the House of Representatives  and 80 Members of the Senate. The  numbers alone should speak volumes.  And, Mr. Speaker, before I close, I  want people to see this young marine  who gave his life for this country. The  family received posthumously the Silver Star medal that he earned by giving his life for this country. This is an  official copy. And it says the Secretary  of the Navy, Washington, D.C., with  the Navy flag. That’s all it has at the  heading, Mr. Speaker. Nothing about  the Marine Corps in the heading, but  Navy.  If this bill should become law, what  it would say is what you see now, Mr.  Speaker, the Secretary of the Navy and  Marine Corps, Navy flag, Marine flag,  present the Silver Star posthumously  to this man’s family.  Mr. Speaker, with that I would like  to close as I always do, because our  men and women, as Ms. WOOLSEYsaid,  they are over there  fighting, giving  their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, and  I would ask God to please bless our  men and women  in uniform, please  bless their families, and, God, please  bless the House and Senate that we  will do right in the eyes of God.  And, dear God, I ask three times,  please God, continue to bless this country. And, God, please always remember  that we care that you look after us so  that we will do what’s right for your  people. God, continue to bless America.  RESPONSE TO LONG-TERM  UNEMPLOYED  ",2010

1071,15,2010-06-14,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker, we  have a huge problem in our country  that we haven’t come to terms with,  long-term unemployment. The number  of Americans who have been jobless for  over 6 months has hit the highest level  ever recorded. I recently read an article that highlighted one of the long-  term unemployed Americans. Her name  is Cindy Paoletti. For 23 years she  worked in the corporate accounting division of J.P. Morgan Chase in upstate  New York.  In December  2007, Ms.  Paoletti was let go in a wave of layoffs  that eventually shuttered the entire  Syracuse operations center. Her  job  went to India.  She started collecting unemployment  benefits and severance while searching  for a job. In her own words, Cindy says,  ‘‘I apply  for everything out there.’’  Now that she’s about to run out of benefits, she has started taking money out  of her IRA. She doesn’t have health insurance, and she faces the daily fear of  losing her home. I hear similar stories  from all over  the  country. Jobless  Americans are desperately looking for  work, but there just aren’t enough jobs  to go around yet.  Last week, I conducted a hearing in  my subcommittee to discuss long-term  unemployment problems. Here are a  few of the  facts highlighted at the  hearing: nearly 50 percent of the unemployed haven’t been able to find a job  for more than 6 months, the highest  number ever recorded, which goes back  to 1948. More than 10 million jobs must  be created to restore the labor market  to its pre-recession level.  This huge  jobs hole, created by 8  years of gross economic mismanagement under the Bush administration,  has left five unemployed workers competing for every available job. In responding to these record rates of long-  term unemployment, our first priority  must be to maintain the current emergency  Federal  unemployment  programs that have lapsed 2 weeks ago.  People have been waiting for 2 weeks.  The House passed an extension on  these programs a long time ago, but  the Senate has yet to clear the legislation. If the Senate fails to continue  Federal unemployment program, 5 million long-term unemployed Americans  will lose their extended benefits before  the end of this year, with 1.2 million of  them losing their benefits by the end of  this month, June. We need to face the  fact that even with an extension of  these  Federal  unemployment  programs, more than 3 million people are  projected to exhaust all benefits available before the end of the year.

1073,64,2010-06-14,Mr. TOWNS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in recognition of Doris Turner Keys, a union  leader who has demonstrated dedication  to  improving the lives of others.  Doris Turner Keys has been a member of  District 1199, National Union of Hospital and  Health Care Employees, Retail, Wholesale  and Department Store Union (RWDSU), AFL–  CIO  for more  than  thirty years. She was a  leader  in  the historic 1959 hospital workers  strike which  launched  the union, and she  joined the union staff as an organizer in 1960.  She rose through the ranks, quickly becoming  Vice President, Area Director. She became  Executive Vice President in 1967 and served  in that position for 15 years.  In May 1982, she was elected President of  District 1199, and was re-elected in 1984. As  a  founding member and principal organizer  she served as Secretary, and as an officer of  the State AFL–CIO, and was the only African  American woman and one of two women of  the AFL–CIO to serve at that time.  Mrs. Keys served as a trustee of the union’s  Training and Upgrading program which provides over $1 million dollars annually to 1199  members seeking upward mobility. She was a  leader in the struggle to improve union services for members and their families, especially  children and retirees, and was instrumental in  expanding  the union’s civic, social, cultural,  and political programs.  She has dedicated herself to national, local  and community endeavors. Mrs. Keys was a  New York State delegate  to  the National  Women Founding Conference  in Houston,  Texas in 1975 and served as a New York City  Commissioner of Human Rights for six years.  She was also a member of  the Committee  International Year of the Woman and a Trustee of  the Martin Luther King Jr. Center  for  Non-Violent Social Changes. She served as a  delegate representing Westchester County at  a Democratic Convention. Mrs. Keys  has  served on the New York State Hospital Review and Planning Council as well as many  other health and labor related organizations.  Mrs.  Keys  has  been  honored  by  the  NAACP,  the NYC Council AFL–CIO,  the  Urban League, and the African Peoples Christian Organization, among others. She  is  the  recipient  of  the Coalition  of Black Trade  Unionists Sojourner Truth Loyalty Award, New  York State 33rd Assembly District’s Service  and Humanitarian Award,  and  the  Letha  Loggins  Bradford  Memorial  Foundations’  Woman of the Year Award. She has been recognized for her role in raising money for AIDS  research and  treatment. She has also been  listed in ‘‘Who’s Who in Black America’’ and  Who’s Who in the Labor Movement’’.  Mrs. Keys makes  her  home  in Mount  Vernon, New York and she and her family are  active members  of  the Bethesda Baptist  Church of New Rochelle. For more  than 12  years, she was the cook in the church’s soup  kitchen, Lad’s Lunch, which fed approximately  100 men, women and children each week.  She is married to Willie D. Keys and is the  mother of 2 daughters. She has 7 grandchildren and 5 great grandchildren. Her extended family includes several sisters, brothers, nieces, nephews and cousins. However,  she says she is most of all a child of the King.  Madam Speaker,  I urge my colleagues  to  join me  in  recognizing  the achievements of  Doris Turner Keys.  f  IN HONOR OF US NAVAL ARMED  GUARD AND AIR  FORCE VETERAN  CHARLES  ARTHUR  ALESHIRE  HON.

1074,64,2010-06-14,Mrs. HALVORSON.," Madam Speaker, today  I rise to recognize a Joliet citizen and hero of  the  Greatest  Generation,  Charles  Arthur  Aleshire. Due  to  its  rapid disbandment and  lack of proper records, the efforts of members  of the Naval Armed Guard Service, such as  Mr. Aleshire, have been largely overlooked by  history. Mr. Aleshire served our country with  courage and honor when the world turned to  the United States to fight tyranny and oppression in World War II.  Mr. Aleshire volunteered when he was just  17 to join the U.S. Navy Armed Guard service  and protect vital supplies and  troops necessary for the war effort. His service took him  around the world, to South America where he  watched for German U-Boats, to the invasion  of Okinawa, where he and his  shipmates  faced Japanese kamikaze attacks on  their  fleet. On February 18th, 1946, his 21st birthday, he was honorably discharged as a Coxswain at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center.  However, his service to our country did not  end there. In 1948, Mr. Aleshire entered the  Air Force, and was assigned  to  the 509th  Bombardment Wing, as an Airframe Repair  Specialist. This unit served as the core of the  newly  formed Strategic Air Command. Mr.  Aleshire was on active duty during some of  the most dangerous conflicts and crises of the  20th century,  including  the Korean War,  the  Berlin Airlift, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. He  retired as a Staff Sergeant in 1966.  An  indebted  country  cannot  thank Mr.  Aleshire and so many other brave man and  women enough for their selfless sacrifice. His  admirable service to our country is in keeping  with the highest traditions of honor and service  displayed by our armed forces, and is an example to all Americans.  HONORING DR. JOE E. ELLIS  HON. ED WHITFIELD  OFKENTUCKY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 14, 2010  ",2010
1075,64,2010-06-14,Mr. WHITFIELD.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize my good friend, Dr. Joe E.  Ellis of Benton, Kentucky.  Dr. Ellis will soon be elected president of  the American Optometric Association during  their 113th annual meeting, where he will be  installed as AOA’s 89th president on Saturday,  June 19th, 2010 in Orlando, Florida.  Dr. Ellis is a graduate of the Southern College of Optometry and has a private practice  in Marshall County. He was named Kentucky  Young Optometrist of  the Year  in 1992 and  has also  received  three President’s Awards  from the Kentucky Optometric Association.  Dr. Ellis’ particular area of interest is advocacy, especially as it relates to patients’ access to optometric care. He has been active in  legislative and government  relations at  the  state and national levels and recently served  as Chairman of the AOA’s State Health Care  Legislation Committee.  Dr. Ellis was instrumental in the passage of  the first state law of its kind that requires that  all Kentucky children entering public schools  receive a diagnostic eye examination. The  Kentucky General Assembly  identified problems with vision as an important factor limiting  children’s  abilities  to  learn  and  succeed.  Through this, they recognized that the early diagnosis and  treatment of  children’s  vision  problems is a necessary component to school  readiness and academic learning and the enactment of this legislation in 2000 ensured that  children in my state are able to meet their developmental potential.  Doctors of optometry serve patients in nearly 6,500 communities across the country, and  in 3,500 of those, they are the only eye doctors. Optometrists provide two-thirds of all primary eye care  in  the United States. The  American Optometric Association  represents  approximately 36,000 doctors of optometry,  optometry students and paraoptometric assistants and technicians.  Dr. Ellis’ enthusiasm for optometry and commitment to excellence in eye and vision care  has earned him this prestigious national office  and public recognition. I am confident that he  will have a very successful term as the American Optometric Association’s president. His  election is a tribute to his years of service to  the profession of optometry in Kentucky and  throughout the nation. I join his family, friends  and colleagues in congratulating him on this  achievement and wishing him the best of luck  in this endeavor.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

On January 6th, 2009, the start of the 111th  Congress,  the  national  debt  was  $10,638,425,746,293.80.  This means the national debt has increased  by $2,402,782,774,403.30 so  far  this Congress.  This debt and its interest payments we are  passing to our children and all future Americans.  sionary Baptist Church has grown to over 550  today.  The  impressive brick  structure, which  is  based on a  two-story, cross design with a  three-sided colonial balcony,  is  listed  in  the  Alabama Registry of Historic Places.  On Sunday, the church centennial celebration included the dedication of a historic marker in commemoration of the event.  The church’s first pastor, the Reverend William Franklin,  led his new congregation  into  their beautiful house of worship where succeeding generations have reflected under the  guiding hand of God.  I wish  to extend my personal congratulations to Reverend Willie J. Blue and the congregation of Second Saint Siloam Missionary  Baptist on this most special and historic occasion. May they continue to serve their community as they honor our Lord Jesus Christ.  f  f  CONGRATULATING  CATHERINE  ROBERTS ON HER RETIREMENT  AFTER 60 YEARS OF NURSING  HON.

I would like to recognize an outstanding constituent  from South  Florida:  Catherine Roberts has been a practicing  nurse for over 60 years. This month Catherine  will be retiring from the Lower Keys Medical  Center. Catherine has devoted her life to ensuring the health and comfort of others. For  over 30 years, Catherine has been a nurse at  the Lower Keys Medical Center where she  has had a positive impact on countless individuals.  Due to her generosity and commitment, the  Lower Keys Medical Center has been able to  continue  to serve  the people of  the Lower  Keys. Catherine, I would like to commend you  for your service and support to our community.  Thank you  for your dedication and commitment to improving the lives of South Floridians  and enjoy your well deserved retirement.  f  HONORING THE  CENTENNIAL OF  THE SECOND SAINT SILOAM MISSIONARY  BAPTIST  CHURCH,  BREWTON, ALABAMA  HON.

1079,2,2010-06-24,Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado.," Madam  Speaker, the majority has now finally  admitted what we have suspected for  months: They have no intention of fulfilling their obligation to draft and  pass a Federal budget.  This fiscal irresponsibility on display  in Washington  is affecting American  citizens, and it is further damaging our  economy and job growth. It is widely  known  and,  thankfully, widely  reported that the reason we won’t be seeing a budget this year is to evade calling further attention to an addiction to  reckless spending.  The Federal debt has gone up by  nearly $2.4 trillion since January of  2009 and by $240 billion just since the  budget was due back in April of this  year. Undoubtedly and correctly, Democrat leaders fear that the public will  be shocked at this figure, and will be  shocked at the future debt that a budget would show.  So they seek to hide behind a 1-year  ‘‘deeming motion,’’  but  the  consequences of their shame shows a lack  of fiscal discipline and a lack of responsible economic policy. America needs a  reasonable, pro-growth economic policy to promote job growth and business  development.  f  JOBS  (Mr. BACA asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2010
1080,2,2010-06-24,Mr. BACA.," Madam  Speaker,  the  failed policies of the Bush administration brought our economy to the brink  2 years ago, and while our economy is  showing  signs of growth, unemployment is still at unacceptable levels.  There are still too many  families  having to sit down at the table, who  are having to decide which bills they  can afford to pay each month. There  are still  families  finding themselves  with underwater mortgages—many of  them losing their homes.  I ask my colleagues: How would you  feel if this were your family or a family member you knew?  We need to make sure that hardworking Americans are able to come  home with a sense of pride after a day’s  work, not with a sense of fear about  bills they can’t afford. Too many of our  families are struggling to make ends  meet. Let’s build a momentum of job  creation as with the HomeStar, the  HIRE Act, and  the Small Business  Lending Fund Act, which provide incentives for growth and innovation.  America deserves better from their  government. I am committed to making sure that happens, but Republicans  and Democrats must come together for  the betterment of this country.  MORE MEDDLING BY MEXICO  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2010
1081,2,2010-06-24,Mr. POE of Texas.," Madam Speaker,  Mexico has joined a lawsuit against Arizona’s new  illegal  immigration  enforcement law.  In its legal brief, Mexico says the Arizona law is unconstitutional. That’s  right. The foreign country of Mexico is  lecturing us on our Constitution.  I guess President Calderon, like our  Attorney General, hasn’t read Arizona’s law either, because the Arizona  law  is  constitutional.  President  Calderon just doesn’t want the law enforced. He wants  open  borders  so  illegals can illegally come to America.  By the way, hypocritical Mexico enforces its own immigration laws, but it  doesn’t want us to do the same. President Calderon should not meddle  in  U.S. affairs.  If the Feds join the lawsuit against  Arizona, it will be Mexico and the U.S.  Government  vs. Arizona.  Ironically,  Mexico and the U.S. Government together will be arguing against border  security and public safety while Arizona will be arguing for the basic right  to protect its citizens.  Isn’t  there  something wrong with  that concept?  And that’s just the way it is.  f  GOOD NEWS FOR THE ECONOMY  OF SOUTHEASTERN CONNECTICUT  (Mr.  COURTNEY  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2010
1082,2,2010-06-24,Mr. COURTNEY.," Madam Speaker,  this past Monday, southeastern Connecticut  received  blockbuster  news  when it was announced that Electric  Boat will be acquiring 700,000 square  feet of office space from Pfizer pharmaceutical company. This is space from  which Pfizer was going to be departing  as part of  its global reorganization.  EB’s decision to come in and acquire  this space is huge, and it is good news  for the economy of southeastern Connecticut.  It is not happening in a vacuum. This  space is needed because the workforce  is growing. There are new  jobs  in  southeastern Connecticut because this  Congress  recognized  that  our  submarine  fleet, which had been underfunded under the prior administration,  was running into end dates for the Ohio  class submarine program.  We have  invested, over the  last 3  years, in growing the workforce and in  research, development, and engineering. These new jobs will ensure that we  will have a submarine fleet well into  the later stages of the 21st century. It  will provide stability for the economy  of  southeastern Connecticut, and  it  will maintain  that  Groton,  Connecticut, will become and will remain  the submarine capital of the world.

1083,2,2010-06-24,Ms. FOXX.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today in tribute to Don Moss of Pilot  Mountain, North Carolina, who  is a  dedicated volunteer at Wake Forest  University Baptist Medical Center.  Why is Mr. Moss so special? Because,  over the past three decades, he has  racked up 47,000 volunteer hours at the  hospital—a Guinness World Record.  Mr. Moss currently donates 48 hours  of his time each week to the hospital—  working 12 hours a day and serving up  a healthy dose of good cheer and plain  old helpfulness. He has a well-deserved  reputation for looking out for patients  and for his humor and humility.  North Carolina is, indeed, blessed to  be the home of people like Mr. Moss.  His service to the community and his  staggering number of volunteer hours  illustrate a true spirit of selfless generosity to those in need.  I  congratulate Mr. Moss  on  his  record-breaking time of service, and I  hope that others will be inspired by his  example to invest their time and abilities in their communities.  f  CONGRATULATING  PRESIDENT-  ELECT  OF  COLOMBIA,  JUAN  MANUEL SANTOS  (Mr. SIRES asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)

I congratulate the President-  elect  of  Colombia,  Juan  Manuel  Santos, and I commend the people of  Colombia  for their relentless dedication to the democratic process that  was shown through this election.  In an  increasingly volatile region,  Colombia has continued on the path towards  reform while combating drug  trafficking and terrorism, efforts which  have had a positive effect on Colombian and American national security.  Additionally, Colombia has made remarkable  progress  on  other  fronts,  emerging as an important growth market and as a leading center for Latin  American business.  In the face of hostility towards U.S.  interests and values, Colombia has consistently proven itself to be an important friend, a reliable partner, and a  champion for democracy. The positive  bilateral  relationship  between  the  United States and Colombia has been  based on many common strategic and  ideological  interests, reaffirming Colombia’s position as an important ally  and as a longtime friend of the United  States.  Again, I congratulate President-elect  Juan Manuel Santos on his victory. I  look forward to a continued partnership between our two nations.

1086,9,2010-06-24,Mr. PENCE.," Madam Speaker, I rise  in opposition to the rule.  While other matters are being debated in the course of this, this rule  also provides  for consideration of a  conference report on the Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment  Act, and I rise in strong support of this  legislation with a word of caution.  It was my great privilege to serve on  the conference committee for this Iran  sanctions bill that will be considered  today. I believe this  legislation represents measurable  and meaningful  progress in the United States’ effort to  economically and diplomatically  isolate Iran in the midst of its headlong  rush to obtain nuclear weapons, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.  My word of caution is directed both  to my colleagues in Congress, though,  and to this administration. It is important not only that we adopt the Iran  sanctions bill today, it is important  that  this  administration  implement  this legislation.  We know the nature of the threat.  Iran has made no secret of its intent to  use nuclear weapons to threaten the  United States or our allies, especially  our most cherished ally, Israel. President Ahmadinejad said in 2005 in Iran  that humankind ‘‘shall soon experience  a world without the United States and  without Zionism.’’ Led by this anti-  American, anti-Israeli president, Iran  has a long history of associating with  terrorist organizations. If Iran obtains  a nuclear bomb, it will only be a matter of time before terrorist organizations around the globe have access to  this technology, and America and our  allies—and our most cherished ally—  will be threatened as a result.  It is also essential that we consider  this  legislation  in  the wake of  the  failed leadership at the United Nations.  The adoption of so-called ‘‘sanctions’’  by the U.N. is nothing more than a hollow gesture which will do nothing except embolden Iran in its nuclear ambitions. We must lead by example.  I urge my colleagues to adopt this  bill. I urge the President to sign this  bill. But a word of caution: These sanctions include a number of waivers demanded by the Obama administration,  but  it  is  essential  that President  Obama carry out the clear congressional intent and cripple Iran’s energy  and financial sectors in implementing  this legislation.  Iran could be merely months away  from acquiring nuclear weapons; they  continue to test vehicles that could deliver it. This is a time for decisive action by the American Congress and the  American administration. Failure  to  act by this Congress or failure to implement these sanctions by this administration could lead to a second Holocaust. If we act and this administration  implements these sanctions, we  may yet see a future of security and  peace in the Middle East, but if we fail  to act, history will judge the Congress  and this government in the harsh aftermath of a flash of light, a rush of wind,  and a second historic tragedy.  Let us act. Let us adopt Iran sanctions. And Mr. President, do not waive  these sanctions.  ",2010

Concerned citizens have been vocal about  the potential consequences of the Citizens United decision, sending nearly  2,500 emails and making roughly 4,500  phone calls in 1 week to the Committee  on House Administration, urging Congress to quickly consider  legislation  that addresses the loopholes created by  the Citizens United ruling.

If Congress does not adopt the DISCLOSE  Act, the public will be left in the dark  to wonder whose  interests are truly  being served by a flood of negative advertising that will come to dominate  campaigns.

It does not allow the  free exercise of the First Amendment  right to speech.  The  Constitution  of  the  United  States refers to that First Amendment.  And, unfortunately, in many, many decisions by the Supreme Court, they’ve  talked about everything other than political  speech. Yet  in  the Citizens  United v. Federal Election Commission  case, the court finally got it right. The  majority  opinion  says  the  First  Amendment stands against attempts to  disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints  prohibited to or restrictions differing  among  different  speakers  allowing  speech by some but not by others. Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, that’s exactly what this bill does.  Benjamin Franklin stated: Whoever  would overthrow the liberty of a Nation must  begin  by  subduing  the  freeness of speech. Unfortunately, that  is what we have here before us, Mr.  Chairman. Just because you call something ‘‘disclose’’ or ‘‘disclosure’’ does  not make  it so. When you prohibit  speech, as has been done here; when  you have onerous disclosure obligations placed on some but not all; when  you make no distinguishing, that is,  constitutionally  justifiable  distinguishing differences between groups,  that is, you cause some to be subjected  to provisions of disclosure and others  not; when you specifically have five or  six provisions  in which you exempt  unions as opposed to corporations of all  stripes, then you have rendered the bill  unconstitutional.  Mr. Chairman, I would have asked if  it were proper to have a unanimous  consent request to extend our debate  for 4 hours, but I know that’s not in  order. The majority has decided to stifle debate by allowing only a single  hour of debate on this issue dealing directly with the First Amendment. We  have spent in excess of 10 hours in this  Congress talking about the naming of  post offices, but we have determined  that we do not have more time than an  hour to discuss something as important as the First Amendment to the  Constitution.  When we allow ourselves to become  an auction house for the First Amendment, where some, because of their  power and influence, are allowed to exercise First Amendment rights, unfettered, and others are not, it is a sorry  day. And to do it under the rubric of  disclosure  is even worse, but that’s  what we have here.  Mr. Chairman, in the time given to  us, I hope that we can explain exactly  what this bill does and what it does not  do and why it, in fact, not only is dangerous to the First Amendment but is  directed at  the heart of  the First  Amendment, which is vigorous political speech, particularly close to an  election. It may make some Members  uncomfortable. As a matter of fact, in  some of the hearings and markup of  this bill, we had Members saying, If I  had my way, I’d make sure no one  could  say anything about our campaigns except those of us who are candidates. Unfortunately, there’s something called the First Amendment. And  I know it’s bothersome to some on the  other side. I know it’s an obstacle to  what they want to do. But when I came  here, I took an oath to uphold the Constitution and all parts, not just the  Second Amendment by way of specific  exemption, but of all amendments, the  first as well as the second, and every  other.  With that, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2010
1092,16,2010-06-24,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House,  this is the most disturbing debate that  I have engaged in in the 111th Congress. And to hear what I’ve already  heard  from one of the most distinguished members  of  this  Judiciary  Committee is a little bit dismaying to  me. Let me say this. I’ll answer one of  his questions. What does the bill do?  And I agree, I’d love 4 hours. Perhaps  we’ll be debating this bill after the  vote, regardless of its outcome.  This bill rolls back the decision—the  blatant decision—of Citizens United in  the Supreme Court by using the three  tools that the Court said that we could  do to make their decision different.  First, we can increase disclosure; two,  we can require disclaimer requirements  on advertisements; and, three, we can  limit foreign influence in our elections.  One, two, three.  The danger of the Citizens United decision, the most shocking decision I  have read  in the Supreme Court  in  many, many years,  is the threat of  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:21 Oct 09, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\H24JN0.REC H24JN0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010

1094,23,2010-06-24,Mr. DANIEL E.," LUNGREN of California. I yield myself the balance of my  time.  Mr. Chairman, I have been privileged  to serve in this House for a number of  years. During that period of time, I  have had the opportunity to vote, probably,  thousands of  times on many,  many, many different  issues. Sometimes the result of the votes, of the  collective votes of this House and the  Senate and the signature of the President during the course of time that I  have been here, has resulted in legislation which subsequently was ruled to  be,  in part or  in whole, unconstitutional.  I have had conversations on the floor  of the House with Members who have  said at times, I’m not concerned about  the Constitution. I mean don’t let me  worry about that. The courts decide  that.  I’ve always said to them in response,  We have an obligation when we take an  oath of office to uphold the Constitution, and we ought to do it as we consider legislation.  Though, I am not sure that I have  ever seen a frontal assault on the Constitution as this bill is. Why do I say  that? I say that because this deals with  the First Amendment. It deals with political speech. It deals with political  speech at its most effective, which is in  the context of a political campaign,  and we ought to deal with that very,  very carefully.  I would say to my friend from Michigan, if we were so concerned about the  Constitution, why did our committee  waive jurisdiction here after only having this bill for a day? Other times, we  insist on dealing with constitutional  questions, but yet we gave it up.  You look at this bill, and you see  that it violates the contours of the decision by the Supreme Court. If you  want to amend the Constitution, bring  an amendment to the floor. It violates  it in so many ways, and it is a continual violation, as the auction block  was established on the other side of the  aisle. We kept hearing day after day,  week after week, They don’t have the  votes. They  don’t  have  the  votes.  They’re  going  to make  this  deal.  They’re going to make that deal.  What did they do? They expanded the  exemption.  They decided, yes, the National Rifle  Association got a special exemption. I  guess AARP did. I guess the Humane  Society did. We don’t know who else  did because they’ve just changed the  definition in the last couple of days  from a million members to a half a  million members, but we know that  most groups now will not be exempt,  just a privileged  few. That violates  what the decisions of the courts going  back decades tell us. You cannot discriminate among groups. You cannot  have disfavored and  favored groups,  and that is what we are doing right  here on the floor, not just about something dealt with by the Constitution,  but the essential of the First Amendment.  I am surprised that my liberal friends  are not down here on this floor, condemning provisions of this bill. They  say it’s not a perfect bill. No, it’s not  perfect. It’s unconstitutional. It is unconstitutional by its very terms. In the  last 2 weeks and even yesterday, it became more unconstitutional because  they carved out exemptions even further for unions and for selected groups  of large size.  Mr. Chairman, we should do better  than this. We should do better than  this. If we are not concerned about protecting the Constitution, who is?  You know, as was said basically by  our leader, we take an oath to protect  and to defend all parts of the Constitution—the First Amendment as well as  the Second Amendment. The  fact of  the matter is we take an oath to uphold the Constitution. To only allow an  hour’s worth of debate when we give  far more time to naming post offices is  a disgrace in this House—a disgrace. To  not allow amendments that deal with  some of the very subjects that my  friends on the other side talk about is  a disgrace.  Mr. Chairman, I ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote  on this bill.  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.  ",2010
1095,23,2010-06-24,Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself the balance of  my time.  First, let me thank the staff of House  Administration—Jamie  Fleet,  Matt  Pinkus,  Tom  Hicks,  and  Jennifer  Daehn—for the hard work they’ve done  on this bill. There was a lot of moving  around and a lot of moving parts to be  able to put  it back together so we  could be here today.  I would also  like to thank Karen  Robb, who I am sure, right now,  is  probably the most relieved person in  knowing that this is finally coming to  an end, and I appreciate all her help.  b1350  Despite all the rhetoric that we’ve  heard about this bill, the simple purpose, Mr. Chairman, is: Who’s saying  it; who’s paying it. All I want to know  when I run or if I run or anybody runs  for reelection, if somebody’s running  an ad against me, I’d like to know who  that person is, or if somebody is writing an ad in my favor, I’d like to know  who that person is.  We talked about the unions as opposed to corporations. The unions pay  dues and they take out at an hourly  rate a checkoff to go to a PAC committee, a PAC fund. They also have the  right not to do that. They can say, I  don’t want to send any money to a PAC  fund. But if they do, they now vote.  They sit and vote for every single candidate that that union is supporting,  whether or not they want to support  that candidate or not, and every union  puts a tagline saying who they’re supporting and they’re paying for that.  Corporations. I could be a member  and a stockholder of a corporation like  AT&T and have stocks, and they can  run against me and I don’t even know  it. Also, those corporations don’t vote.  I’m a stockholder; I don’t vote. I can’t  vote to say what they do with my  money, even though they spend the  money  for an opponent against me.  Again, Mr. Chairman, all we’re saying  is, who’s saying it and who’s paying for  it.  With that, Mr. Chairman, I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation.  ",2010
1096,23,2010-06-24,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Chair, I rise in support of  H.R. 5175, the DISCLOSE Act, as a cosponsor and strong proponent of this legislation.  The DISCLOSE Act is a bipartisan response  to  the Supreme Court’s reckless decision  in  Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission to give corporations the same rights as  American  citizens with  respect  to  political  speech. The decision overturned decades of  precedent upholding common-sense campaign  finance laws that kept special interests at bay  in our elections. Corporations—think Big Oil  and Wall Street—can now speak louder and  more  forcefully  than  the ordinary American  without any  restrictions. Moreover, Citizens  United opened up the very real possibility that  other countries—many of which do not have  America’s best  interest  in mind—can spend  money to influence our elections. Maybe the  opponents of this legislation don’t understand  that by voting  ‘‘no’’  they’ve allowed China  Telecom or Venezuela’s CITGO  the same  rights as ordinary Americans when it comes to  spending money in our elections.  Since we are not yet politically at a point  where we have the votes to overturn this reckless Supreme Court decision, the DISCLOSE  Act  is a step  towards ensuring corporations  now  have  these  rights,  they must  spend  money in the light of day. For one thing, corporations cannot hide behind shadow groups  that do not have to disclose their donors to the  public.  If  corporations  choose  to advertise  close to Election Day, they must report their  donors  to  the Federal Election Commission  and include a hyperlink to their disclosure report on their websites. Moreover, chief executive officers will have to stand behind their ads  and  top donors will be  listed on advertisements. American citizens have  the  right  to  know and deserve to know who it is exactly  that  is  telling  them  to vote  for or against a  candidate.  The DISCLOSE Act prevents foreign cash in  our elections, and also prevents corporations  receiving large government contracts, and corporations  that are using money out of  the  Troubled Asset Relief Fund from spending taxpayer money out of their general treasuries on  American elections. These practical limitations  are necessary to ensure that American elections are not co-opted by foreign entities and  special interests looking out only for their own  interests and bottom lines.  Mr. Chair,  the DISLCOSE Act  represents  months of hard work and compromise so that  American citizens would still have a strong  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:21 Oct 09, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\H24JN0.REC H24JN0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010
1097,37,2010-06-24,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Chairman, the  purpose of this bill, as I understand it,  is for transparency and for people to  understand what’s happening out there  as people spend lots of money—other  people’s money, very often—to advocate for or against candidates. In the  case of unions, unions are very transparent in who they’re supporting and  who they’re not supporting when they  decide to take that kind of action.  Union members pay voluntarily with  their dues money, and the unions disclose who they are and who they’re  supporting.  People who  invest  in corporations,  presumably for the purpose of investing money and  furthering America’s  economic and their own economic interest, have a right to know how those  corporations are spending their money  that they thought was being invested  for the purpose of capitalism and free  enterprise rather than to be diverted  into anybody’s personal political agendas. Unions do that because their members vote; corporations do not. And I  would have no idea of a corporation  that I may invest in, whether they’re  spending my initial investment money  to work against my interests or even  your interests—or for them, for that  matter. This is just to let people know.  The  second point,  the amendment  that I offer covers every organization  that is covered under the bill equally.  I yield back the balance of my time.  b1400  The CHAIR. The question is on the  amendment offered by the gentleman  from New York (Mr. ACKERMAN).  The amendment was agreed to.

1099,37,2010-06-24,The Acting CHAIR., The Clerk will  designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Add at the end of title I the following new  section:  SEC. 106. REMOVAL OF LIMITATIONS ON FEDERAL  ELECTION CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS.  Section 315(a) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441a(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new  paragraph:  ‘‘(9) The limitations established under this  subsection shall not apply to contributions  made during calendar years beginning after  2009.’’.  ,2010

1101,37,2010-06-24,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Mr. Chairman, my  amendment is simple in its language  and  is perhaps a  little more  complicated when one starts to understand  all the  freedom that would be exercised, should my amendment become  law. And  it  simply  does  this: my  amendment eliminates—it strikes all  limitations on Federal election campaign contributions. It takes out the  $2,000 limit, the $5,000 limit, all of the  limits set there because it reverts us  back  to  the constitutional principle  that contributions to campaigns are  free speech, funding is free speech. And  to limit our ability as individual Americans with  constitutional  rights,  to  make contributions to political campaigns is an unconstitutional limitation.  And by the way, to react to a Supreme Court decision by bringing a  piece of legislation like this, which is  an immediate and exactly a reaction to  the Citizens United case, I think tells  America where  this Congress would  like to go  in  limiting the constitutional rights of the people in this country.  I  am  for  reestablishing  those  rights to the maximum amount. That’s  what this allows, the individuals and  the corporations that choose to donate.  We don’t touch anything that has to  do with disclosure. I am for full disclosure. I am for sunshine. And I think the  American people and the voters can  discern where they want to place their  vote and where they want to place  their political contributions if we just  allow for the disclosure. But the limitations  are unconstitutional  limitations,  and  this  amendment  simply  strikes all of those limitations that are  in statute that are unconstitutional,  Mr. Chairman.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010

1104,37,2010-06-24,Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California.," Mr.  Chairman,  Representative  KING’s  amendment would, as he has indicated,  eliminate all  limitations on Federal  election campaign contributions, corporations and unions. Individuals could  donate unlimited amounts of money to  candidates, political parties, and committees. I think this is a fairly cynical  amendment designed to undermine all  support for additional disclosure and  reasonable regulation.  Since the Federal Election Campaign  Act of 1971 was first challenged, the Supreme Court has always upheld reasonable contribution limits to candidates  and political parties, and they did so as  a reasonable means to prevent corruption. Even the Citizens United decision  itself did not question  the Federal  Election Campaign Act’s limits on direct contributions to candidates, and  they reaffirmed that the Court was  concerned  that  large  contributions  could be given to secure a political  quid pro quo.  I quote the Court decision where they  refer favorably to the Buckley court:  ‘‘Nevertheless, sustained limits on direct contributions in order to ensure  against the reality or appearance of  corruption.’’ That case did not extend  the rationale to independent expenditures, and the Court didn’t do so in  Citizens United. But it did quote the  Buckley court favorably on the limitation of expenditures when it came to  candidates or political parties.  Money has a corrosive effect on the  electoral process, and eliminating campaign  limits would start a political  arms war. Candidates have to raise  millions of dollars to run competitive  campaigns; and if Mr. KING’s amendment passes, candidates are going to  turn to wealthy donors, special interests, corporations to get their money,  and the voices of average Americans  will not be heard. If this amendment is  passed, the voices of the American people will be drowned out by wealthy corporations and other  interest groups.  This isn’t what we should do. It’s not  what the Court suggested we do. And I  would urge that we oppose the King  amendment.

I now yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. SCOTT).  ",2010
1117,58,2010-06-24,Mr. SCOTT of Georgia.," We have a  unique opportunity today. I’ve heard  from the other side, the Republicans,  who are saying that they want to have  a permanent fix. We on the Democratic  side have shown that by pushing forward, we had a $68 billion bill that  went over to the Senate that would do  that.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, people all  across this Nation are paining, they  are crying to see this House of Representatives work in a bipartisan way,  and there is no more critical or important issue to show that than on this  issue.  The future of our health care system  rests on the ability to be able to have  our physicians to be able to receive  payment for their services. I’ve talked  to physicians—I talked to a group of  them today—and many of them not  only are refusing to serve Medicare patients now, but they’re losing hope in  the health care system.  We’ve just passed a new health care  bill. It’s going to bring 37 million more  people on, many of them are going to  be senior citizens. We’re growing more  senior citizens. Let’s be fair to our physicians. Let’s save our health care system. And  let us  come  together as  Democrats and Republicans this day  and come back and get a permanent fix  on this issue.  ",2010

1120,58,2010-06-24,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, we have  before us a wonderful opportunity; we  can begin to solve a problem that’s  going to destroy our medical care system in this country.  Doctors are abandoning Medicare patients because they can no longer afford to serve them. And it is turning  out that we are now finding that we are  losing the capability of addressing one  of the greatest health problems we’ve  got, and that is seeing to it that physicians do take care of our people and  that they have the necessary resources  to do it.  This is a proposal which has to be  adopted today.  I commend the gentleman from Texas who has urged the  House to work together, and I commend him for having had the courage  to say so, but it is something that we  must do.  We came close to having this issue  solved with a permanent fix. The law of  interest, compounded interest, tells us  that we have a big problem. The numbers in this have grown to $210 billion,  and they will grow more. It is time  that the House resolves this question  so we can assure that we take care of  our people, we deal with their health,  we preserve Medicare, and we do what  is necessary to carry out our responsibility in a fiscally responsible way.  We are, in good part, in this mess because of  the United States Senate,  which diligently disregards its responsibilities on all matters of this kind.  And regrettably, as we look to see, we  find that this is the best thing that we  can do because they refuse to do better.  They will tell us that because of their  incompetence, we must therefore bow  to them and do things the way they  only can do them.  I urge my colleagues to vote for this  legislation. And then let us prepare to  work together to try and resolve this  matter because the time is wasting and  the whole system is about to collapse  because of our failure to properly address it.

1122,58,2010-06-24,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 1  minute to the gentleman  from New  York (Mr. MAFFEI).  (Mr. MAFFEI asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2010
1123,58,2010-06-24,Mr. MAFFEI.," Mr. Speaker, many of  the doctors in my Upstate New York  district have started to turn away new  Medicare patients because of the 21  percent cut that has already started,  and seniors are fearful that their physicians may soon drop out of Medicare  altogether. Those doctors who still accept  seniors have  taken huge  risks  with their practice. At a time when we  should be promoting improved access  to physicians, a doctor payment cut of  this magnitude will only decrease access, especially  for our seniors, and  sometimes with tragic results.  Seniors and their doctors should not  pay  the price  for partisan politics.  They should have the peace of mind to  know that the doctor of their choice  GENE  will be available to see them. And physicians should know that the work they  perform will  be  reimbursed  fairly,  without having to worry about cuts  month after month.  Now, Mr. Speaker, while it is clear  that the Medicare payment system is  broken and needs to be fixed permanently, there is an urgent need to provide an immediate and temporary solution. If you cannot cure the patient, at  least find a treatment. If you cannot  administer a long-term treatment, at  least stop the bleeding.  Mr. Speaker, this band-aid  is  just  that. It stops the bleeding temporarily.  But lives and livelihoods are hanging  in the balance. We have made a commitment to provide for our seniors, and  I will stand with our seniors and our  physicians.  ",2010

1126,58,2010-06-24,Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas.," I thank  the chair of the full Energy and Commerce Committee for yielding.  To my Republican  colleagues, we  make history on the floor of the House,  and we did when we passed the health  care bill, but you can’t rewrite it. The  House passed a bill, H.R. 3961, that only  had one Member from the Republican  Party who voted for that bill that was  the permanent fix for this doctor situation so that our doctors wouldn’t be  cut 21 percent as of  last week. One  vote, and  it was my colleague  from  Texas, Dr. BURGESS. That’s why this is  so important today.  We wish we could pass a better bill  and a long-term fix, but we can’t get it  through the United States Senate; so  we’re going to November. You had a  chance to step up and do it, but you  didn’t do it. We passed that bill with  only one Republican vote.  This legislation is so important because Medicare is so important. Our  seniors need to be able to go to a doctor, and yet we’re seeing doctors say  they can’t afford to treat them anymore because we didn’t do the permanent fix. That’s why this bill is so important today, to get us through November. Hopefully we will be able to  then do a permanent fix so doctors will  be able to see our senior citizens.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act.  This legislation will prevent a 21-percent cut  in Medicare physician payment  reimbursements through November 30, and makes the  so-called doc fix retroactive to June 1, when a  previous stop gap measure expired.  While Congress enacted stop-gap measures  for  rate cuts scheduled  for several months,  yesterday CMS began mailing reimbursement  checks  to physicians who accept Medicare  with  the 21-percent  reduction  in  their  reimbursement.

1127,65,2010-06-24,Mr. ROYCE.," I thank the gentlelady  for yielding.  And  in  response  to  the  previous  speaker, I will remind my colleagues  that sanctions did work in South Africa, and that South Africa gave up its  atomic weapons program.  The threat, my  friends,  in Iran  is  crystal clear, and its regime closes in  on a nuclear weapon. So a crystal clear  response by us is urgent.  While I support this bill, much of this  legislation, unfortunately, is a muddle.  Good sanctions, good sanctions in this  bill are weakened by delays and by the  possibility of waiver after waiver.  b1800  For this, the Obama administration  gets the main blame. From the beginning, it has insisted on excessive leeway to  implement new sanctions. It  doesn’t want to be forced into dramatic  action. So, yes, we do provide the tools  with this bill. They’re in there. But  there  is  little guarantee that those  tools will be used.  For example, the House-passed bill  aimed to target Iran’s energy sector.  Yet with this conference report, a foreign oil company assisting Iran’s petroleum sector could avoid even the investigation required to sanction it for at  least 1 year. And the many companies  from  China  and  elsewhere  rapidly  building Iran’s energy facilities today  will be surely exempted  from these  sanctions.  This  report’s  aggressive  financial  sanctions rightly aim at Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps. While important,  they too can be waived. The so-called  ‘‘mandatory  financial  sanctions’’  aren’t  even mandatory. This  report  does require a barrage of reports, certifications and other executive branch  paper. Meanwhile, in the real world,  Iran marches on.  I would be less critical if the Obama  administration, or if previous administrations, had applied a single sanction  using existing Iran sanctions legislation. Instead, the Obama administration has naively given Iran time with  its ‘‘engagement policy.’’  I’ll be supporting this bill because it  does give the administration the tools  should it wish to use those tools. More  likely, it will have to be pressured into  action.  Mr. Speaker, even robust sanctions  might not deter  Iran  from nuclear  weapons. We need to give the intelligence  community what  it  needs,  strengthen our missile defense, target  Iran’s human rights abusers, and bolster  its  opposition movement. The  clock is ticking.  ",2010
1128,65,2010-06-24,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 30 seconds.  My friend from California raises, as  others have, the issue of waivers. I just  want to remind the body this legislation has  increased  the  standard  for  waivers, tightened the situations when  waivers can be given. And, remember,  we’re talking about a process I hope  will be rarely used, and I think we have  to push that notion. We’re not talking  about Ahmadinejad giving the waivers,  the Supreme Leader giving the waivers, the violating company giving the  waivers. We’re talking about a President of the United States, hopefully  quite  rarely, utilizing  the enhanced  standard waiver authority, a President  who has spent more time diplomatically and in every other way trying to  estop  Iran  from achieving this goal  than any other President in the history  of this country has ever done.  BERMAN,  I’ll stand with this legislation, with  this authority, with this President as  the  toughest, most  comprehensive  sanctions  ever on  the  Iran nuclear  weapons program.  I would now like to yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from New York, a  key supporter of this legislation, the  chairman of the Western Hemisphere  Subcommittee, ELIOTENGEL.  ",2010
1129,65,2010-06-24,Mr. ENGEL.,"  I  thank my  friend,  Chairman  for  letting me  speak; and I strongly support the Comprehensive  Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act. I am a  proud cosponsor of the bill. This is a bipartisan bill, as you can hear, and  should be passed.  Last fall, the world learned of the secret Iranian nuclear enrichment facility near the city of Qom. If there was  ever any doubt that Iran was trying to  build nuclear weapons, this revelation  dispelled any shred of that doubt. We  need strong sanctions on Iran to halt  their development of nuclear weapons.  Iran must not be allowed to have a nuclear bomb.  I  commend President Obama  and  Secretary  Clinton  for  achieving  a  strong fourth round of U.N. sanctions  against Iran and for bringing Russia  and China on board.  As chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I would like to  call attention to the fact that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at one  time agreed to provide 20,000 barrels  per day of refined gasoline to Iran and  to invest in the Iranian natural gas  sector. Iran is an importer of refined  gas, and this bill will hit them where it  hurts in their energy and financial sectors.  I would like to also express my support for section 110 of the bill which requires a report on other energy imports  into Iran. The U.S. and Brazil are the  world’s largest ethanol producers, and I  am glad to hear from Brazil’s private  ethanol producers that they have no  plans to supply ethanol to  Iran  for  blending into gasoline as they prefer to  build a global export market, anchored  by the large U.S. and European markets. That’s why this bill is so important. We must continue to monitor this  area as ethanol imports could undermine energy sanctions on Iran.  The U.S., our allies, and the U.N.  have recognized that a nuclear-armed  Iran would be a danger not only to our  ally, Israel, but also to the entire Middle East and the nuclear nonproliferation regime and is unacceptable. When  Ahmadinejad says he wants to wipe  Israel off the  face of the Earth, he  means it. When he calls the U.S. the  great Satan, he means it. We need this  bill to hit them where it hurts, and I  urge my colleagues to vote for this bill  today.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

1130,72,2010-06-24,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I stand in  support of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions  Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010.  As a cosponsor of the Iran Sanctions Act, I  congratulate the conferees for building on the  best  features of  that bill, and  the Senate  version, to produce bipartisan legislation that  moves beyond our initial focus on restricting  refined oil supplies and creates sweeping and  strong new sanctions on banks doing business  with Iran.  If Iran continues with its illegal nuclear enrichment activities, it will threaten the stability  of the Middle East, threaten the security of its  neighbors, including Israel, and jeopardize the  international counter-proliferation regime. This  bill directs  the President  to  take additional  measures to stop those efforts.  The measure codifies  longstanding executive orders  that  limit  the goods exempted  under  the American  trade embargo against  Iran and  includes new provisions  that hold  U.S. and foreign banks accountable for their  actions and  for  the actions of  their subsidiaries.  Some highlights of the bill include provisions  that impose sanctions on foreign insurance, financing and shipping companies that sell energy related goods and services to Iran; new  prohibitions on American banks doing business with any  foreign bank  that  facilitates  Iran’s illicit nuclear program; three new sanctions that prohibit Iranian access to foreign exchange in the U.S.; new prohibitions on access to the U.S. banking system; and a prohibition on property transactions in the U.S. The  bill even touches on the U.S. government procurement sector by  requiring a certification  from a company bidding on a U.S. government  contract  that  it  is  not  engaged  in  sanctionable conduct.  These new sanctions compliment efforts by  the European Union, the United Nations and  the Obama Administration, to create a web of  restrictions designed to cut Iran off from the  international financial community if it does not  abandon it illicit enrichment activities. The European Union passed a sanctions package  that places restrictions on Iran’s trade, banking  and insurance sectors in addition to instituting  new prohibitions on key sectors of Iran’s gas  and oil industry. The United Nations Security  Council passed its fourth round of sanctions  against military purchases, trade and financial  transactions carried out by the Revolutionary  Guard, which controls  the nuclear program  and has taken a more central role in running  the country and the economy.  The Obama Administration recently placed  dozens of Iranian companies and senior Iranian officials on a U.S. financial industry blacklist, appointed as a special adviser on nonproliferation and arms control Robert Einhorn,  a man the Chinese government calls ‘‘the dentist’’ for the way he extracts painful concessions during negotiations, and the administration is working with the Israeli government to  ensure that Iranians who are key to Iran’s nuclear program and who may want  to  leave  Iran, are able to do so.  Iran’s  refusal  to heed  repeated warnings  about its illegal enrichment activities must be  met with resolve. All options must remain on  the table. When combined with the efforts of  the Obama Administration and our allies, this  bill helps ensure that the president has at his  disposal a full range of tools to deal with Iran.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.  ",2010
1131,72,2010-06-24,Ms. LEE of California.," Mr. Speaker, I join  my colleagues today in acknowledging the real  and serious threat posed by a nuclear Iran to  the United States, our allies  in  the Middle  East, and  the global nuclear nonproliferation  regime  that  is vital  to securing a safer and  more prosperous world.  I would also like to acknowledge the Obama  Administration, which has rightly pursued and  kept open a dual-track approach of concerted  diplomatic  engagement  and  pressure with  Iran.  The President’s resolve proved successful  in securing a coordinated and  forceful  international response, and I am pleased to see  that this Conference agreement provides the  Administration  improved  flexibility  to ensure  we do not undermine  the very  international  partnerships  that are necessary  to prevent  Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapons capability.  As this package of unilateral U.S. sanctions  moves  forward  for  the President’s signature,  let us not lose sight of our ultimate goal—a  long-term diplomatic solution to bring Iran into  compliance with  international nonproliferation  standards and commitments.  Mr. Speaker, although  I support  this Conference agreement, I must reiterate my deeply  held belief  that sanctions should never be  viewed as a checkmark on the path to war.  I  remain  deeply  concerned  by  counterproductive  rhetoric with  regard  to  Iran  that  echoes the drumbeat to war we heard in Iraq.  The prospect of a military strike in Iran carries  devastating  and  unacceptable  consequences for United States foreign policy and  security interests in the region that cannot be  ignored.  Further, I believe our words and resources  are better served  in support of  the  Iranian  people, their resilient civil society and determination  to  seek  the  protection  of  basic  human rights and meaningful democratic reform despite the intransigence of the ruling regime.  We must closely scrutinize the implementation of these sanctions, which I believe could  be better targeted, in order to avoid punishing  the Iranian people at the expense of moderate  voices and to the benefit of hardliner elements  within Iran.  With that in mind, I urge my colleagues to  invest as much energy in support of a coordinated and cooperative diplomatic process  in  Iran as they have in finalizing these punitive  measures aimed at bringing them to the table.  It is this course of action that will be necessary to erase once and for all our fears of  a nuclear-armed Iran and the destabilizing impact this might have in an already volatile region.  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, as a passionate advocate throughout my career for the cause of nuclear non-proliferation,  I hope we can also  take  this opportunity  to  recognize and act  upon our own  commitments as a nuclear  power to take meaningful steps toward nuclear  disarmament and the realization of world free  from the threat of nuclear weapons.  ",2010
1132,72,2010-06-24,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act. The United  States does not deny  Iran’s  lawful  right  to  peacefully explore  technologies  for nuclear  power, but  the  Iranian regime has provided  just cause for skepticism about the peaceful  nature of  its nuclear ambitions. There  is an  international consensus  that  Iran should not  attain  nuclear  weapons  capability—a  circumstance  that unquestionably would accelerate a nuclear arms race in the Middle East,  threatening both regional stability and the security of the United States.  For over a year and a half,  the United  States and the international community have  worked diligently to achieve a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian regime’s reckless pursuit  of nuclear weapons. Yet the Iranian leadership  remains defiant and shows no signs of substantive cooperation. Their actions have left us  little choice but to pursue additional measures  to persuade the regime that it must live up to  its obligations to the international community  by suspending  its uranium enrichment program and verifiably ending any pursuit of nuclear weapons.  Recently, the United Nations imposed new  sanctions on  the Government of  Iran. The  United States joined the European Union and  others in taking immediate steps to implement  these measures  in a way  that  is consistent  with existing law. Now Congress will provide  the Administration with new  tools  that will  allow the United States to augment these multilateral efforts.  This  legislation will  broaden  the  list  of  sanctionable activities and provide new mechanisms  for  the U.S.  to sanction responsible  entities. Any banks, companies, or other institutions  that support  Iran’s  refined petroleum  sector or engage in transactions with Islamic  Revolutionary Guard Corps  (IRGC) or other  blacklisted  Iranian  institutions will  face stiff  penalties and be prevented from doing business in the United States. State and local governments will have clear authorization  to divest from entities that engage in business with  Iran, and private asset managers will be able  to undertake similar divestment without fear of  breaching  their  fiduciary responsibilities. The  Director of National  Intelligence will be  required to prepare a list of governments that  allow  re-export,  trans-shipment,  transfer,  re-  transfer, or diversion to Iran of goods or services  that could be used  for  terrorism or  the  production of weapons of mass destruction.  The U.S. will work with these governments to  strengthen  their export control systems, and  the President will be required to impose new  restrictions on those that fail to improve their  actions.  While I believe it is necessary for the U.S.  to enact these tough new measures as quickly  as possible, it is important to remember that  by  themselves,  they will not be effective.  Sanctions are blunt  instruments.

And, Mr. Speaker, indeed, when I say  ObamaCare, I do not mean any disrespect, although I consistently, along  with my colleagues on this side of the  aisle, voted against the passage of that  legislation. I would hope, Mr. Speaker,  I would hope when we on my side of the  aisle, on behalf of the American people  who  overwhelmingly  continue,  3  months after passage of this bill, continue in all polls taken oppose this legislation, so when my Republican colleagues and I, Mr. Speaker, regain the  majority and control this Chamber and  we repeal ObamaCare and we replace it  with legislation that I am going to talk  a little bit about tonight, I would not  be offended in the least, Mr. Speaker, if  they called it GingreyCare, or maybe  even better Dr. GingreyCare. I would  be very proud of that.  Mr. Speaker, the concerns I think of  the American people and their continued opposition to this reform is not  that they are opposed to certain health  insurance industry reforms. No, not at  all. Nor are we in the loyal minority  for things like the rescission of a policy after the fact. So many of our colleagues in their own families, or maybe  their distant relatives, extended families, have  seen  situations  like  that  where health insurance industry abuse  directly affected their families.  I have a grand-niece who went into  the hospital, Mr. Speaker, to have a  gall bladder removed. It was an emergency situation. And after the fact, she  was told that the health insurance that  they had had for a number of years—  her  family, of course, her mom and  dad, that covered the children—was not  going to cover, would not be applicable  because somewhere in filling out that  policy, 8, 10, 12, 14 pages worth of minutiae, they failed to dot one I or cross  one T. Fortunately, as a Member of  Congress, and this is what we do in regard to helping not just our constituents but our family members as well  when we can work with other Members  of Congress in their district, we were  able to get the insurance company to  pay that claim.  But people across the country are  rightly outraged about health  insurance abuse.

1212,100,2010-06-24,Mr. HATCH.," Madam President, next  week  the Judiciary Committee will  hold its hearing on the nomination of  Elena Kagan to replace Supreme Court  Justice John Paul Stevens. The Senate’s role of advice and consent, especially for Supreme Court Justices, is  one of our most important constitutional duties. I wish to share a few  thoughts about how I will approach  this task.  America’s Founders designed the judiciary to be, as Alexander Hamilton  described it, the weakest and least dangerous branch of government. Things  have not worked out as planned. The  judiciary today is, instead, the most  powerful,  and  potentially  the most  dangerous, branch of our government.  Rather than being accountable to the  people by being subject to the people’s  Constitution,  activist  judges  often  make the people accountable to them  by seeking to control the people’s Constitution. My objective  in this confirmation process is to find out which  kind of Justice Ms. Kagan would be if  confirmed to the Supreme Court.  Judicial qualifications fall into two  categories: legal experience and judicial philosophy. Legal experience is a  summary of what a nominee has done  in the past and can be described in a resume or on a questionnaire. Judicial  philosophy describes how a nominee  will approach the task of judging in the  future. It is harder to determine, but I  believe it is much more important.  Let me  first  look at Ms. Kagan’s  legal experience. I have never believed  that  judicial experience  is necessary  for Supreme Court service or, to put it  another way, I have never believed it  to be a disqualification if you do not  have judicial experience. In fact, 39 Supreme  Court  Justices—about  one-  third—had no previous judicial experience. What they did have, however, was  extensive  experience  in  the  actual  practice of  law, an average of more  than 20 years. These are Justices such  as George Sutherland, one of my predecessors as Senator  from Utah, who  practiced for 23 years, or Robert Jackson, who practiced  for 21 years and  served as both Solicitor General and  Attorney General. In other words, Supreme Court Justices have had experience behind the bench as a judge, before the bench as a lawyer, or both.  Ms. Kagan has neither. She spent  only 2 years as a new associate in a  large law firm. She never litigated a  case or argued before any appellate  court before becoming Solicitor General last year.  And her work in the Clinton administration was  focused  on  policy  and  legistation. As the Washington Post  described it recently, Ms. Kagan would  bring to the Court experience ‘‘in the  political  circus  that  often  defines  Washington.’’ Some people may see little difference between the legal and the  political, but I do and am concerned  about blurring the lines even further.  Last week, one of my Democratic  colleagues with whom I serve on the  Judiciary Committee talked about Ms.  Kagan’s  qualifications  and  claimed  that some Senators question her fitness for the Supreme Court solely because she has never been a judge. No  one has made  that argument. This  Democratic colleague  identified Justices Byron White, William Rehnquist,  Louis Brandeis, and Lewis Powell as  among those with no prior judicial experience. These Justices had practiced,  respectively, for 14, 16, 37, and 39 years  and Justice Powell had also been president of the American Bar Association.  There really is no comparison.  So on this first element of legal experience, we have to be honest about  what the record shows. Unlike other  Supreme Court nominees, Ms. Kagan  has no  judicial  experience and virtually no  legal practice  experience.  That leaves her academic and political  experience. The Democratic Senator I  mentioned  identified  as  among Ms.  Kagan’s  strongest  qualifications  for  the  Supreme  Court  her  experience  crafting policy and her ability to build  consensus. Judges, however, are not  supposed to be crafting policy, and consensus-building only begs the question  of what a consensus is being built to  support.  This relatively light record of legal  experience only places more  importance on judicial philosophy, the other  qualification  for  judicial  service.  Frankly, finding reliable clues about  judicial philosophy is often harder in  an academic and political record such  as Ms. Kagan’s  than  in  a  judicial  record. This is especially true when,  like Ms. Kagan, a nominee has rarely  written directly about the topic. This  does not mean that reliable clues do  not exist, just that they are harder to  find. I have to take Ms. Kagan’s record  as it is because I have to base my decision on evidence, not blind faith.  Judicial  philosophy  refers  to  the  process of  interpreting and applying  the law to decide cases. That is what  judges do, but they can do it in radically different ways. Notice I said this  is about the process of deciding cases,  not the results of those cases. Many  people, including some of my Senate  colleagues and many  in  the media,  focus only on the results that judges  reach, apparently believing that the  political  ends  justify  the  judicial  means.  That is the wrong standard for evaluating either judicial decisions or judicial nominees. Politics can  focus on  the results, but the law must focus on  the process of reaching those results.  Rather than the desirable ends justifying  the means,  the proper means  must legitimate the ends. It makes no  difference which side wins, which political  interest comes out on  top, or  whether the result can be labeled liberal or conservative. If the judge correctly interprets and applies the law in  a particular case, then the result is  correct.  So I wish to pin down, as best I can,  what kind of Justice Ms. Kagan would  be. Will the Constitution control her or  will she try to control the Constitution? Will she care more about the judicial process or the political results?  As I said, those clues come primarily  from her record, secondarily from next  week’s hearing. So let me briefly focus  on a few areas of Ms. Kagan’s record  and mention some questions that need  to be answered and some concerns that  need to be addressed.  First, while in graduate school, Ms.  Kagan wrote that the Supreme Court  may overturn previous decisions  ‘‘on  the ground that new times and circumstances demand a different interpretation of the Constitution.’’ Not a  different application, mind you, but a  different  interpretation.  She  wrote  quite candidly  that  it  is  ‘‘not necessarily wrong or invalid’’ for judges to  ‘‘mold and steer the law in order to  promote  certain  ethical  values  and  achieve certain social ends.’’  In a 1995  law  journal article, she  agreed that in most cases that come  before the Supreme Court, the judge’s  own experience and values become the  most important element in the decision. In her words, ‘‘many of the votes  a Supreme Court Justice casts have little to do with technical legal ability  and much to do with conceptions of  value.’’ That sounds a lot like President Obama, who said as a Senator  that judges decide cases based on their  own deepest values, core concerns, the  depth and breadth of their empathy,  and what is in their heart. If that is too  results oriented, Ms. Kagan wrote, so  be it.  While Ms. Kagan has not herself been  a judge, those judges she has singled  out  for particular praise have  this  same activist judicial philosophy. In a  tribute she wrote for her mentor Justice Thurgood Marshall, for example,  she described his judicial philosophy as  driven by the belief that the role of the  courts and the very purpose of constitutional interpretation is to ‘‘safeguard the interests of people who had  no other champion. The Court existed  primarily to fulfill this mission. . . .  And however much some recent Justices have sniped at that vision, it remains a thing of glory.’’  In 2006, when she was dean of Harvard  Law School, Ms. Kagan praised as her  judicial hero Aharon Barak, who served  on the Supreme Court of  Israel  for  nearly 30 years. She called him ‘‘the  judge or justice in my lifetime whom I  think best represents and has best advanced the values of democracy and  human rights, of the rule of law, and of  justice.’’ That  is  not  simply  high  praise, but the highest praise possible,  for she said that Justice Barak was literally the very best  judge anywhere  during  her  entire  lifetime  in  representing and advancing the rule of  law.  Who is this judge who, for Ms. Kagan  at least, is literally the best representation of the rule of law? Judge Richard Posner has described Justice Barak  as ‘‘one of the most prominent of the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:29 Oct 09, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S24JN0.REC S24JN0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010

Iran poses an interesting threat to  the United States and to our allies in  the Middle East. The Iranian regime is  arguably the most anti-American regime in the world. There may be some  who would put forth North Korea or  some other countries, and I won’t debate with them where on the list they  would be, but Iran is very much at the  top of the list of regimes that hate  America. Ironically, every indication is  that the Iranian people do not support  the position of their government and  that the Iranian people, if they had a  legitimate government;  that  is, one  that was chosen by a legitimate election, would be strongly pro-America.  So we have this very challenging dichotomy here of a regime that is bent  on mischief or worse throughout the  region, and a very clear hatred  for  America, presiding over a population  that is strongly in favor of America.  I make that point because many people will say: Well, it is the people of  Iran who will be punished if this sanctions bill goes forward.  I say it is the people of Iran who are  desiring relief from their own government, and anything we can do to punish that government, make the situation more untenable, and ultimately  help bring it down will be for the benefit of the people of Iran. So I am  standing here as an advocate in favor  of the Iranian population even as I  have harsh things to say about the Iranian Government.  There are those who say: Well, the  Iranians have every right to a nuclear  capability. They are a sovereign nation. They have the right to build a nuclear plant within their borders so they  can have the benefits of nuclear power.  And you, Senator BENNETT, are a supporter of nuclear energy, so why do you  oppose the Iranian effort with respect  to their nuclear program?  I do not oppose a program that would  move toward peaceful exploitation of  nuclear power. Indeed, I would welcome  it and support it. In the world today, it  is certainly possible, and, indeed, many  countries do have nuclear capability  without  creating  the  capacity  to  produce a nuclear weapon. The two are  not necessarily simultaneous and coterminous. A nuclear capacity to provide electricity, to provide power for  the populous as a whole,  is a good  thing, a benign thing, and something I  support.  The Iranians oppose any kind of effort to put limits on their plan, on  their program. They say: We are doing  this just for domestic power purposes.  But they refuse to take the kinds of  steps other nations have taken that  will allow them to have all of the benefits of a domestic nuclear plant and  none of the challenges that go with the  creation of a nuclear weapon.  There was a time—the Cold War and  shortly after the Second World War—  when nuclear weapons were seen as a  very viable part of the military arsenal. We have such an arsenal. The Soviet Union did. Some of our allies  joined us, and nuclear weapons were  seen in the classic power struggle between nation states. Today, however,  the situation has changed, and a nuclear weapon  is seen primarily as a  blackmailing device for one nation to  threaten  another  nation  in  a  circumstance different from the kind of  confrontation we had with the Soviet  Union. If Iran got a nuclear weapon,  they would use it as a destabilizing instrument throughout the Middle East,  which is already one of the least stable  portions of the world, and other countries all around Iran would say: Well, if  they are going to have a nuclear weapon for blackmail purposes within foreign policy discussions, we will have to  have one too. And if Iran is allowed to  get a nuclear weapon, the proliferation  of nuclear weapons in the region will  be enormous.  As long as they just use it as a blackmail weapon and talk about  it, one  could say it is really not that big of a  deal. Inevitably, the creation of such  weapons,  the  proliferation  of  such  weapons in an area as unstable as the  Middle East runs a very high risk that  one of those weapons will be used. Then  we will see the opening of a nuclear  holocaust the likes of which we have  not seen before. The last time a nuclear weapon was used was when we  were in the midst of a horrendous war  where the projections were that if we  stayed in a conventional pattern and  invaded Japan in a conventional way,  the casualties would be overwhelming  on both sides. And by using a nuclear  weapon to bring the Second World War  to an end, we tragically cost tens of  thousands of  lives  in Hiroshima and  Nagasaki, but we  saved millions of  lives on the beaches and in the streets  of Tokyo and in the other places that  would have been lost if the war had  continued with conventional weapons.  We cannot do anything that would  encourage Iran with respect to its nuclear program, and that is why this act  is so important.  People will say: Well, it is economic  sanctions,  it  is  financial  sanctions,  things of that kind. Yes, it is all of  those things, but it is aimed primarily  at and focused entirely on Iran’s efforts  with respect to the creation of a nuclear weapon.  Iran could get out from under these  sanctions  immediately  if they would  say: We will follow the pattern of other  peaceful nations and pursue a nuclear  domestic program for energy purposes  in such a way that it will not lead to  the creation of a capability for nuclear  weapons. I stress again the division between the two: You can have nuclear  power for energy and electricity without producing the kinds of things that  are necessary  to produce a nuclear  weapon. Iran could go down that road  if they choose to, and if the Iranian regime were to make that very wise decision—wise  for  themselves and  their  own ability to remain at the head of a  country whose population hates them;  wise for the region; wise for the world  as a whole—I would be one of the first  to stand and say that this bill of sanctions  for  Iran should be withdrawn.  The  initiative rests with them, not  with us, as to what will happen in the  Middle East.  All right. Some specifics about the  legislation.  If  it  is  implemented,  it  would dramatically raise the price Iran  will have to pay for their activities because it will increase the scope of sanctions already authorized under the Iranian sanctions act by imposing sanctions on foreign companies that sell  Iran goods, services, or know-how that  would assist in its nuclear sector. It includes a provision with respect to refined petroleum being exported to Iran.

1217,114,2010-06-24,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, today,  Congress takes an important and forceful step to address one of our most serious national  security  challenges  to  America  and  our  allies. A nuclear  armed Iran would pose an intolerable  threat to our ally Israel, risk igniting  an arms race in what is already one of  the world’s most dangerous regions,  and undermine our global effort to halt  the spread of nuclear weapons.  These steps to increase pressure are  necessary because  Iran continues to  defy the international community, the  International Atomic Energy Agency,  and the U.N. Security Council. Iran’s  publicly disclosed stocks at its Natanz  enrichment facility now include more  than 2,400 kilograms of reactor-grade  low enriched uranium. It is especially  troubling that Iran has recently begun  enriching small quantities of uranium  to a concentration of around 20 percent,  crossing  yet  another  nuclear  threshold.  That is why, as part of a comprehensive and  international effort to persuade Iran to alter  its current dangerous course, we  in Congress have  worked together to pass tough new  sanctions that will increase the cost  that Iran must pay for its continued  defiance. In particular, this legislation  targets businesses involved in refined  petroleum sales to Iran, support  for  Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, and  Iran’s  nuclear  program.  It  imposes  strong penalties on those in the Iranian government who have abused the  rights of their own people. It tightens  the enforcement of those sanctions already on the books. And it takes important steps to ensure that companies  receiving U.S. Government contracts  are not also doing business that enables, directly or indirectly, Iran’s nuclear program.  This cannot be an American effort  alone and, thankfully, it isn’t. Our own  efforts are now joined by U.N. Security  Council Resolution 1929, as well as a  range of follow-on efforts from European and other allies. It is very important that we work to ensure that all of  these efforts are coordinated  into a  comprehensive strategy—and I am confident that we have done so.  As we  implement these new sanctions, expanding and preserving a muscular international effort must remain  a priority. The joint explanatory statement accompanying the act suggests  that, before exercising the 4(c)(B) waiver, a determination of sanctionability  must be made. We understand  that  some may believe that the closely cooperating waiver may  be  available  without a determination having been  made. While different from the views in  the  joint explanatory statement, we  accept that this may be a fair reading  of the obligations under section 4(c)(B).  In the face of a serious threat, Congress has put aside bipartisan divisions  to act decisively. Even as we negotiated the details, we were united by a  common goal: to bring maximum leverage to bear on Iran to change its behavior and abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions.  It  is  important  to note  that  the  President’s willingness  to explore a  diplomatic solution is a crucial reason  why today it is Iran—not those who  seek to pressure Iran—who is isolated.  Recent experience suggests that neither sanctions nor engagement alone  will convince Iran to abandon its nuclear program. Only by combining both  pressure and diplomacy  into a comprehensive and  coordinated  strategy  will we have a chance at altering Iran’s  behavior.  Finally, we do not seek to punish the  people of Iran, but to persuade the Iranian regime to do what is in their best  interests and the world’s. These sanctions bring us one step closer to peacefully resolving this grave threat.  ",2010
1218,114,2010-06-24,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President,  I rise  today  in strong support of the conference agreement on H.R. 2194, the  Comprehensive  Iran  Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of  2010.  Through both its actions and statements,  the government of  Iran has  proved itself to be a destabilizing and  dangerous regime in an already volatile region. The Iranian government’s  ongoing uranium enrichment program,  its deplorable human rights record, and  its material support of terrorist organizations dictate that we confront the  threat it poses to the world.  Two weeks ago, the United Nations  Security Council voted to approve a  fourth round of sanctions against Iran,  and I commend President Obama and  his Administration  for working with  our partners at the U.N. to send a powerful message about the willingness of  the global community to stand firmly  in the face of Iranian aggression. However, the specter of an Iran which has  the fissile materials necessary to fuel a  nuclear weapon is too great a threat to  leave entirely to multilateral institutions. The United States and other concerned nations must buttress the U.N.  Security Council’s actions individually  to ensure maximum pressure on the  Iranian government.  That is why I am proud to vote today  in support of the conference agreement  on the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions,  Accountability, and Divestment Act.  The bill before us would impose new  economic  penalties  against  foreign  companies  that  sell  Iran goods and  services that assist it in developing its  energy sector, and it would give the  President the tools to hold accountable  those entities linked to Iran’s brutal  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, its  illicit nuclear program, or its support  for terrorism.  By  broadening  the  categories  of  transactions that trigger sanctions and  increasing  the number of  sanctions  available to the President, this legislation will bolster our diplomatic efforts  by targeting the Iranian regime at its  weakest point: its economy, which is  still highly dependent on its petroleum  sector.  Lastly, while  this  legislation  represents a vital step forward in our efforts to constrain the Iranian government’s hostile policies, it is absolutely  crucial that this Congress work closely  with the administration to make certain these new tools are implemented  and applied effectively to achieve our  objectives. Many of our global partners  maintain  trade and  investment  ties  with the Iranian regime, and I implore  the President and  the Secretary of  State to utilize this month’s growing  momentum to ensure the global community  is  speaking with one voice  when it comes to preventing the rise of  a nuclear Iran.  I am proud to join my colleagues in  the Senate in passing the Comprehensive  Iran Sanctions, Accountability,  and Divestment Act, and I am hopeful  this will send a compelling message to  the rest of the world as the global community works together to halt Iran’s  uranium enrichment program.  ",2010
1219,114,2010-06-24,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President, I rise  today to speak in strong support of the  conference report to accompany the  Comprehensive  Iran  Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act.  I  want to thank my colleagues, Chairman DODD, and House Foreign Affairs  Chairman HOWARDBERMANand Ranking Member ILEANAROS-LEHTINEN for  working  cooperatively  to  complete  work on this conference report.  There is general agreement that the  existing Iran Sanctions Act has not  worked either in practice or in its intent to stop Iran’s nuclear program or  its support of terror. Iran, today, is a  more dangerous rogue state than ever  before.  Though not a silver bullet, the Comprehensive  Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act  is undoubtedly one of the toughest sanctions measures that Congress has produced and promises to be more effective than current law.  The act continues to prohibit investments of $20 million in Iran’s energy  sector, but now we have closed an earlier investment loophole that allowed  for sales of petroleum-related goods,  services, and technology to Iran.  The act also broadens the categories  of transactions that trigger sanctions  to include sales to Iran of refined petroleum products and prohibits any assistance to Iran to either increase or  maintain its domestic refining capacity.  In addition to the existing menu of  six  sanctions, we  have  established  three new  sanctions on  foreign  exchange, access to the U.S. banking system,  and  against  property  transactions. Under current law, the President must choose two from a menu of  six sanctions. He now must impose at  least three of the nine sanctions.  Despite dozens of credible reports of  investment violations over successive  administrations,  there has been but  one Presidential determination of a  violation made 12 years ago. In that  particular  instance,  the  President  waived the imposition of sanctions.

1225,121,2010-06-24,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, I  rise to briefly comment on the Iran  sanctions conference report, which we  will be voting on shortly.  I am pleased with the bill before the  Senate, as I have been urging enactment of this legislation for some time.  I brought it up with the President on  numerous occasions over the last 6 to 8  months. I cosponsored it in the last  Congress and in the current one.  Congress has been slow to act as the  Iranian program to enrich uranium has  progressed.  Iran has also taken advantage of the  delay to blunt the impact of this measure.  Just today a headline in the Washington Post read that ‘‘Iran is prepared  for fuel sanctions.’’  But this legislation should be viewed  as only a part of a broader, comprehensive effort by the U.S. to harness the  various means of national power to ensure that Iran does not secure a nuclear weapon.  As  President  Obama  has  stated,  Iran’s ‘‘development of nuclear weapons would be unacceptable’’.  We must work with our allies in the  gulf to make clear to Iran that the cost  of developing a weapon exceed the prestige they think they would gain from  acquiring this capability.  First and foremost, the sanctions in  this legislation need to be implemented  and implemented quickly, not waived.  The time for further delay is past.  The collective strength of the recent  U.N. Security Council resolution and  this conference report must be combined to strike at Iranian shadow companies and the regime’s leaders.  The need for urgency should be obvious because the threat posed to the  U.S. and its allies by the revolutionary  Iranian regime is grave. Its president  has called for Israel to be wiped off the  map.  An  Iranian  nuclear  weapon  threatens to set off an arms race in the  Middle East, and embolden the regime  in its support of terrorist groups.  Passage of Iranian sanctions  is an  important first step, but only a first  step.  I agree with the President that the  U.S. and our allies must make clear to  Iran that the development of a nuclear  weapon is unacceptable.  That is why I urge passage of this  conference report and all other necessary measures to deter the Iranian  regime.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",2010

1233,135,2010-06-24,Mr.  LEMIEUX.," Mr.  President,  I  thank my colleague, the senior Senator  from Florida, for his comments, bringing the proper focus to the issue of  skimmers. It is something I have been  talking about for weeks. I have been  coming to the floor for the past week  to talk about the lack of response from  the Federal Government in keeping oil  off our beaches, out of our intercoastal  waterways, out of our  estuaries  in  Florida. I said earlier this week that I  would come to the floor every day until  we had good answers as to where the  skimmers are. It makes absolutely no  sense that we do not have a more robust effort from the Federal Government to keep the oil from coming onshore. Right now we have not only tar  balls on our beaches, we have  large  swathes of brown oily slop that have  come ashore in Pensacola. It breaks  one’s heart to see it.  When I was there last week meeting  with  the President,  I  talked  to  a  woman who was working at the dock,  right on the pier. She is a woman who  sells food to folks coming to the pier. I  asked her: Are people coming out since  we have had the oilspill to see the  beach?  She said: Yes. The folks who are coming haven’t seen the beach in a long  time. They are coming to see the beach  one last time, as if they are visiting a  family member who is on his or her  deathbed.  We know BP is responsible. We know  they cut corners. We know they are responsible for ultimately paying for all  of the economic damages. But there is  another part of this equation, and that  is the Federal Government. The Federal Government is here to do what  local and State governments cannot do  at a time of disaster, and that is to  marshal unbelievable resources to prevent harm to the people, to the environment, and to the economy.  As I have come to the floor over the  past week, I have talked about the fact  that we can’t get a straight answer as  to how many skimmers are actually off  the coast of Florida. These are ships  that suck the oil off of the water and  keep  the oil  from  coming onshore.  Today we still don’t have a straight answer. The Federal Government tells us  in their shore operations report from  the National Incident Command that  there are 118 skimmers. But yesterday  they told us these reports are not accurate and that there are,  in  fact, 86  skimmers. So we have the number 118  and we have the number 86. We have a  number from the State of Florida that  is different. The number from the State  of Florida was 31, 25 plus 6 additional  skimmers that the State of Florida had  to go out on their own and get. They  took the initiative to get the skimmers  on their own because they were not  getting them from the Federal Government.  Today the report is different. It is  shown  in a different way. When we  called to ask the State of Florida, they  couldn’t tell us how many skimmers  there were. Yesterday it was 31. The  Fed said 118. But then they say the  number is really 86. Whether it is 31, 86,  or 118, it is not enough.  Why is it not enough? There is a huge  area between Pensacola and Panama  City that needs to be treated by the  skimmers, let alone the rest of the area  that goes all the way over to Louisiana. We know there are about 400  skimmers in the Gulf of Mexico, but  there are 2,000 skimmers in the United  States.  Before I talk about domestic skimmers, I want to talk about the offers of  assistance that have been made by foreign countries to help us. We are the  greatest country in the world. When  there are disasters, whether they be in  Southeast Asia with the tsunami or  Haiti with an earthquake or Central or  South America with an earthquake, we  send resources, volunteers, teams of  people, aid. We are there to help them.  The world community has been offering us assistance—some of it free, some  of it they want paid for, but assistance  nonetheless. We are coming to find out  that we are not responding to their offers of help. The State Department has  reported as of last week that we had 56  offers of assistance from 28 countries or  international groups. But we have only  accepted 5 of these offers, 5 offers of assistance out of 56. We have a lot of  great skimmers that are working in  the Gulf of Mexico, but some of them  are pretty small, to be honest. We are  happy they are there. A small skimmer  is better than no skimmer.  But let me show a skimmer that was  offered to the United States that is not  a small skimmer. In fact, it is a huge  vessel. This was offered to us by a  Dutch company called Dockwise. This  ship is called the Swan. It could be outfitted with  skimming arms.  It was  available to go to the gulf. The U.S.  Government didn’t return the call. It  was offered on May 6. Now some 50 days  later, it still has not been responded to.  It  is still under consideration. This  ship is able to take up 20,000 tons of  material, whether it be oil, or an oil/  water mixture, 20,000 tons. This is not  some skimmer that can go on the back  of a train or on a boat or an airplane  and be  flown down  to  the gulf or  trucked or trained down to the gulf. We  are happy to get those too. This is a serious  piece  of  ship  equipment. We  haven’t called them back.  Guess what. This is no longer available. Instead it was replaced by a ship  with one-twentieth of the capacity, a  U.S. ship. I am all for America first. I  am all for using U.S. assets. But this is  not an either/or situation. We should  be using American  ships and  international ships. We gave up a ship with  20 times the capability that could be  out there in the gulf sucking up this  oil, perhaps keeping it off the beaches  of my State, off the beaches of Pensacola, and we didn’t return the phone  call. Nor did we return the phone call  to the other 51 offers of assistance. It is  beyond belief.  Let me go back a second and talk  about  the domestic  skimmers. This  map I have in the Chamber is going to  be a little hard for you to see, but I  want to walk through it. This shows  different parts of the country, broken  up by districts. In each of these districts, there are skimmers.  Where did we get this information?  We got this information from the U.S.  Government, from the Coast Guard because Admiral Allen said, a week ago,  there are 2,000 skimmers in the United  States.  Why are not the vast majority of  those skimmers in the gulf right now?  What  is the holdup? We hear about  legal entanglements. Is  it the Jones  Act, is it Federal law, is it local law, is  it EPA restrictions that are keeping  skimmers  in different parts of  the  country in case there is an oilspill?  I asked the President of the United  States about this last week in Pensacola, and he said: Well, we are trying to  get all the skimmers we can. Obviously, Admiral Allen wants to get all  the  skimmers we can, but  some of  those skimmers need to stay in place  in case there is an oilspill.  Well, Mr. President, there is an oilspill. It is in the Gulf of Mexico. And  saying we are not going to bring skimmers because of legal entanglements or  constraints  from other parts of the  country because there might be an oilspill there is like me saying we are not  going to send the fire engine to your  house that  is on  fire because there  might be another fire someplace else.

We are  United States Senators. The States of  Rhode Island and Nevada are having a  very difficult time.

1236,149,2010-06-24,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President, today I  offer tribute to a true leader and advocate for the rights of women and children in my home State of Idaho who  deserve protection from abusive relationships. Sue Fellen has been executive director for the Idaho Coalition  Against Sexual and Domestic Violence  for more than a decade. She  is announcing a well-deserved retirement at  the end of this month. Her work on behalf of Idaho women, children and family protection is one well worth noting  by all Americans who cherish family  and personal security and freedom.  Sue Fellen’s track record of service  on behalf of Idahoans will remain long  after she leaves active service. While  she has headed the state’s largest advocacy program to stop violence for 16  years now, she has been working nearly  twice that long in other capacities to  stop  domestic  violence  and  protect  families, women and children across  Idaho.  Sue Fellen began her career to stop  domestic violence in the trenches. She  was a shelter manager and director for  the Women and Children’s Association  from 1982 through 1993. When she went  on to head the Idaho Coalition, she  built a statewide network of more than  80 organizations, including law enforcement, prosecutors, health  care providers, victim advocates, victim witness  coordinators,  universities,  and  other professionals dedicated to preventing domestic violence and assisting victims of violence.  She is a trailblazer for Federal legislation protecting women. I know because I worked directly with Sue to  pass the  first-ever Federal  law that  recognizes the rights of dating partners  in abusive  relationships and offered  them Federal assistance for the first  time. We were able to shepherd that  groundbreaking legislation through the  Congress and saw it signed into law in  2004.  ‘‘Cassie’s Law’’ was named  for  Cassie Dehl of  Idaho, who died  following an abusive dating relationship.  Sue Fellen, as a leader of the effort to  stop abusive  relationships  in  Idaho,  was also a member of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. In her  role  in  Idaho  and  nationally, Sue  helped get the word out that this Idaho  legislation should become a national  model  and  I  am  proud  to  have  partnered with her in these efforts.  Sue and I worked with a large group  of Idahoans and found the funding and  commitment to the first one-stop response center for response, treatment  and prosecution in domestic violence  and sexual assault cases in Idaho. I am  proud to say that the FACES Center—  for Family Advocacy Center and Education Services—has now been open  nearly 5 years.  Sue Fellen and I have worked together on many other Federal issues.  Congress has a penchant to want to  spend money and on many occasions,  leaders in both political parties have  seen fit to borrow from the Victims of  Crime Act, or VOCA. This fund is replenished  by  those who  perpetrate  crime and is intended as an ongoing  fund to benefit the victims of crime  and family members who need assistance. By working with advocates like  Sue Fellen and my colleagues here in  the Senate such as the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, my friend PATRICKLEAHYof Vermont, we have been  able to keep that VOCA funding intact,  and away  from being spent on programs for which that money was never  intended.  I have been proud to partner with  Sue and the National Network with  other  Senate  colleagues  as  we  strengthened  the  Violence  Against  Women Act, provided  improved DNA  and rape assistance kits to speed the  conviction of assault cases and worked  with private partners such as the Liz  Claiborne Foundation to broaden the  audience for the critical message that  domestic and sexual violence should  not be tolerated. Not by Congress. Not  by men. Not by anyone.  Surveys show that, out of the teenagers questioned, more than half, 62  percent, know someone who has been  in an abusive relationship with their  boyfriend. Two in five know someone  who has been put down or called stupid, many of them through the social  media on their computers and texts on  their phones.  One in five between the ages of 13 and  14 know of friends and peers who have  been hit, kicked, slapped or punched in  anger. These statistics should alarm all  of us. I have often said men should not  stand by and observe any domestic violence.  Thankfully, there are people who do  not just stand by. They jump in. They  dedicate their lives to improving the  safety of women, children and families.  They are people like Sue Fellen and I  am glad to call Sue my friend and colleague in this effort.  Thank you, Sue. You and your husband Sherm, and even your dog Belle,  can look forward to a most well-deserved retirement.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO JACOB COSTELLO  ∑",2010
1237,149,2010-06-24,Mrs. LINCOLN.," Mr. President, today  I recognize Arkansan Jacob Costello of  Wesley, winner of the Congressional  Award Gold Medal, the highest honor  bestowed upon young people by the  U.S. Congress. It is the first and only  award for youth legislated by the U.S.  Congress. I was proud to meet with  Jacob  in Washington this week and  learn more  about  his  experiences  achieving this great honor.  Earning  the  Congressional Award  Gold Medal requires a significant commitment. Participants must spend 2  years or more completing at least 400  hours of community service, 200 hours  of personal development and physical  fitness activities, and a 4-night ‘‘Expedition or Exploration.’’  Upon completion of  these  requirements, young leaders like Jacob from  across  the United States gather  in  Washington  to honor  their commitment to community service and personal improvement. They also have the  opportunity to learn more about the  federal government and visit Washington’s museums and memorials.  Jacob represents the best of our Arkansas values of hard work and determination.  His  dedication  to  volunteerism and public service is to be  admired by all Arkansans, and I commend him for this tremendous honor.∑  f  RECOGNIZING GAY ISLAND  OYSTER COMPANY  ∑",2010
1238,149,2010-06-24,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, one of  the most beloved summer traditions we  have in coastal Maine is enjoying fresh  seafood  from  our State’s numerous  bays and harbors. While Maine is of  course famous for its exquisite lobster,  parts of our State are also undergoing  a renaissance in oyster harvesting, particularly  in  the midcoast  region.  Today, I rise to recognize one of the  companies involved in this reinvigoration of the industry, the Gay Island  Oyster Company, a small  family-run  business founded in 2000 in the small  seaside town of Cushing by Tara and  Barrett Lynde.  A historic source of food in Maine,  oysters have been gathered off  the  State’s coast for over 5,000 years. Certain excavations have even found piles  of  shucked  oysters,  also known  as  ‘‘middens,’’ over 30 feet deep near the  Damariscotta River near present-day  route 1. Unfortunately, by 1949, climate  changes, development, overfishing, and  pollution  had  all  but  eliminated  Maine’s native oyster population. In  response, Maine’s Department of Sea  and Shore Fisheries began a concerted  effort to return this unique bivalve to  local waters.  The Gay Island Oyster Company is  one of the pioneering small businesses  to take advantage of this reintroduction and has helped to revolutionize  Maine’s  aquaculture  industry.  The  owners of the company, Tara and Barrett Lynde, also hold a special distinction as a dynamic mother-and-son oyster harvesting team. Their oyster farm  is unique in its harvesting methods,  using floating mesh bags which bring  Gay Island’s oysters to the water’s surface  exposing  them  to  tidal water  flows. Tara and Barrett say that by  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:29 Oct 09, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S24JN0.REC S24JN0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010

1240,177,2010-06-24,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.," Madam  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to pay  tribute  to Mr.  Richard Diran Kloian, who passed away on  May 1, 2010. Mr. Kloian was founder of the  Armenian Genocide Resource Center of Richmond, California.  Richard Kloian and  the AGRC were best  known  for  ‘‘The Armenian Genocide: News  Accounts  from  the American Press, 1915–  1922,’’ a landmark 1985 collection of articles  reproduced  from  the New York Times and  other sources. Painstakingly compiled  from  microfilm in the years before digitization and  the Internet made historic newspaper stories  widely  accessible,  this  coverage  of what  America’s  newspaper  of  record  had  once  called ‘‘systematic race extermination’’ made a  powerful impact just as denial of the genocide  was accelerating. Originally published in 1980  and 1981 as ‘‘Armenian Genocide: First 20th  Century Holocaust,’’  the collection’s subsequent editions were expanded  to cover  the  Hamidian massacres of  the 1890s and  the  Adana massacre of 1909.  A  fellow scholar called him  ‘‘an  indispensable bridge’’ between genocide researchers,  historians, educators, and the public. Richard’s  interest in the Genocide was inspired by his  discovery of his father Zakaria’s memoir and  the harrowing story of survival of his grandmother, Khanum Palootzian, which he  recorded in 1972. Realizing the effectiveness of  personal narratives as a  teaching  tool, he  would later encourage others to send family  memoirs  to Armenian studies centers where  the stories could be preserved and shared.  To  facilitate  the  teaching of  the Armenian  Genocide, Richard compiled hundreds of articles  from scholarly  journals and published  scores of booklets and readers. He collected,  edited, produced, and distributed a 400-page  resource manual of maps, web sites, photographs, news  reports, primary-source documents, scholarly articles on the genocide and  its denial, and U.S. state-level curricula  that  mandated teaching about the Armenian Genocide.  Israel Charney, Executive Director of the Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide in Jerusalem wrote, ‘‘I consider him a GIANT on behalf of Armenian Genocide  recognition and  memory. His devotion to his work in enabling  education and memory about  the Armenian  Genocide was immense.’’  May Richard’s life and work live on through  the tremendous contributions he made to the  study and teaching of the first genocide of the  20th century.  f  TRIBUTE TO WILL BAKER  HON.

1241,177,2010-06-24,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today to pay tribute to the late Will Baker  of Hyden, Kentucky, a storied man who lived  102 years and was beloved by his community.  Will Baker loved his country and dedicated  a lifetime of service to his community, to civic  responsibility and honoring fellow military veterans. He was likely the oldest living election  officer in Kentucky, dedicating more than 25  years to the electoral process late in his life,  even past his 100th birthday. However, he  started his service as a young man, proudly  serving during World War  II,  in  the United  States Army. Following his service, he became an active member of the Leslie County  D.A.V. Chapter 133 and  took great pride  in  honoring fallen soldiers. Outside of his military  service, Will Baker was a handy man. He  spent many years as a carpenter, coal miner  and business owner  in Leslie County. Will  shared his heart of gold with everyone he encountered, earning him the respect and love of  hundreds of families across the region.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me in honoring Will Baker for dedicating a lifetime of service to the families of Eastern Kentucky, our Commonwealth and our great Nation.  f  HONORING  RON  GETTELFINGER  FOR HIS LEADERSHIP OF THE  UAW  SPEECHOF  HON.

1242,177,2010-06-24,Ms. LINDA T.," SA´NCHEZ of California. Mr.  Speaker, I rise today for a man who dedicated  his entire life to rising up for hardworking men  and women in this country.  Ron Gettelfinger, known  to many as  ‘‘the  chaplain’’ for his drink-free, smoke-free habits,  started out as a chassis line repairman at a  Ford factory in Indiana. He would later succeed  in  leading automotive employees  for 8  years as president of the United Auto Workers  union.  Mr. Gettelfinger spent a significant amount  of his presidency guiding over 500,000 men  and women through a period of disheartening  job cuts, plant closures, and  financial hardship.  And yet, he never relented in his fight for  others. He never quit standing up for the people and the principles he believed in.  As one of 12 siblings from a small farming  town, President Gettelfinger has always had a  way of bringing people together in solidarity. I  have no doubt that he will, for the rest of his  life, greet his union members as ‘‘brother’’ and  ‘‘sister.’’  He found dignity in all work and refused to  accept the notion, much in fashion these days,  that working men and women don’t deserve a  middle class wage that allows them to own a  home, provide  for  their  families, send  their  children  to college, and afford quality health  care.  His  make-no-apology  approach  saved  countless jobs and even the viability of some  businesses. To his core, he believes  in respect  for  the working men and women of  America.  As President Gettelfinger begins  the next  stage of his life, we should all pay heed to a  motto he lived by: Every job we save is an important job—that is what we are all about.  It is an ideal we should all be about. He is  a man to whom we should all give our gratitude.  I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring  Ron Gettelfinger for his commendable service  to others and leadership in the face of adversity.  f  RAE LANIEL  HON.

Rae  Laniel is an 8th grader at Drake Middle School  and received  this award because her determination and hard work have allowed her to  overcome adversities.  The dedication demonstrated by Rae Laniel  is exemplary of the type of achievement that  can be attained with hard work and perseverance.

We’re proud to remind folks that we’re  the land of the free because of the brave! My  hat is off to the great folks at the City of Allen  and Allen Parks Foundation who make Allen  USA a success year after year. Below is information detailing this worthy celebration. It is  an honor to be a part of it. God bless you all  and I salute you one and all.  Produced as a cooperative effort between  the City of Allen and the Allen Parks Foundation, the Allen USA celebration is Allen’s  largest and most  spectacular  community  event to say the least! Centered around the  theme of being ‘‘First to the Fourth’’, Allen  USA serves as the community’s Fourth of  July celebration, uniquely held the last Saturday of June every year. Being the last Saturday in June allows the event to be a stand  out among area cities’ celebrations and promotes attendance  locally,  regionally and  state-wide.  Allen USA began in 1995, taking place in  the intimate surroundings of Bethany Lakes  Park and Joe Farmer Recreation Center amphitheater. An estimated 5,000 people attended the first event complete with fireworks, a thrilling laser show and entertainment provided by the Allen Civic Chorus and  other local talent.  The phenomenal success from these humble beginnings led the event to move to a  larger venue at Allen Station Park. Attendance grew to more than 20,000 as the entertainment included national recording artists  such as Jerry Jeff Walker, Vince Vance and  the Valiants, and others.  In 2003, Allen USA exploded in attendance  with a move to Allen’s new 106 acre Celebration Park. Since that time, the event has  grown to a regular attendance of up to 65,000  people and has included national recording  artists such as Survivor, JT Taylor  from  Kool and the Gang, Eddie Money, 38 Special  and Three Dog Night to name a few.  There is truly something for everyone at  Allen USA! A number of concessionaires will  be on site selling all of your favorite festival  foods and snacks. The Kids Zone hosts a multitude of bounce houses and play structures  for children to enjoy. The Activity Zone provides  fun and exciting entertainment  for  children and youth of all ages.  This year our Main Stage will be rockin’  with the tunes of the Commodores and, after  what promises to be an exciting performance, the evening ends with one of the largest fireworks shows set to music in North  Texas! And did we mention . . . admission is  FREE!  Allen USA also gives back to the community! A number of civic organizations support the event through countless volunteer  hours to sell soft drinks, souvenirs and assist  with festival activities. The event returns  back to them a portion of the proceeds for  their hard work and support!  Many people have said that it’s the memories they create at Allen USA that keeps  them coming back year after year. The family friendly reputation of this event is what  grabs other’s attention to attend for the first  time! But regardless of why people attend, at  the end of the night, the smiles say it all!

I rise today to honor Ron Gettelfinger as he  retires from the United Auto Workers where he  has served for the last eight years as President.  Thank you President Gettelfinger  for your  service—not only to your membership but to  our Nation.  You have made a difference and you have  made our Nation a stronger and a better  place.  Your efforts have strengthened the middle  class.  In 1964, Ron Gettelfinger became a member of UAW Local 862.  He worked as a chassis line repairman and  was elected by the workers at Ford’s Louisville  Assembly plant to represent them.  agreement  for Korean  Ron served as Director of UAW Region 3,  which includes Indiana and Kentucky . . .  Ron exemplified what it means to be a leader.  Through his leadership, the UAW has navigated the difficult waters of the financial collapse in 2008 and the current recession.  And as unfair trade deals have devastated  U.S. manufacturing  jobs, Ron Gettelfinger  stood strong in the fight for a new approach to  trade.  Fair trade that works with our workers and  businesses, not against them.  Ron Gettelfinger has called  for  fair  trade  agreements  that  include workers’ rights and  environmental provisions.  And Ron Gettelfinger has called for the so-  called Free Trade Agreement with South  Korea to be renegotiated.  This  Bush-negotiated  trade  would allow unfair advantages  automakers to persist.  In 2009, our trade deficit with South Korea  in autos was $7.8 billion.  Korean automakers control 95 percent of  their domestic auto market.  And Ron Gettelfinger led the charge for reciprocity of market access, calling on Korea to  open their market.  Ron knows, as we know, that our workers  are the very best in the world and can compete on a level-playing field.  Ron negotiated deals  for working  families  and our trade representative must also negotiate good deals with our working families in  mind.  Because of Ron’s  leadership during his  eight years as President and his service  to  UAW members since 1964, I am proud to represent 8,700 active and retired UAW members  in my Congressional District.  In Ohio, we have at  least 111,000 active  and retired UAW members.  Thank you again Ron for your outstanding  service  to  the UAW,  to American manufacturing, and to our Nation.  f  SUPPORTING THE REFUGEES AT  CAMP ASHRAF  HON. WM.

I am disturbed by reports of continued  abuse of these Iranian refugees by the same  Iraqi forces that are responsible for ensuring  their safety. In light of the recent announcement of an upcoming U.S.  troop withdrawal  from the camp, I urge Congress to support the  residents at Camp Ashraf by ensuring they receive the protection that they deserve.  These refugees, who have been forced from  their homes in Iran, are exactly the kind of defenseless people the international community  needs to ensure are protected. Unfortunately,  they have been subject to bloody incursions  from the Iraqi army, such as the travesty of  last year’s attack which killed 11 people and  injured over 400. It is critical that the United  States and  international community work  to  ensure  that  the  residents of  this camp are  treated humanely.  I encourage my colleagues  to  join me  supporting the refugees at Camp Ashraf.  in  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:10 Jun 25, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24JN8.033 E24JNPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 C L B Y K 8 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2010
1248,191,2010-06-24,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  join my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives  to  recognize  Juneteenth  Independence Day which we observe with Resolution 546, sponsored by Rep. DANNYDAVISof  Illinois. The House of Representatives notes  the  importance of effectively understanding  our past as  the  foundation of a progressive  and egalitarian future.  We remember June 19, 1865, ‘‘Juneteenth,’’  as the day of the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in the last of the States  in the Union. Though President Abraham Lincoln intended the Emancipation Proclamation  to go into effect on January 1, 1863, slaves in  the last of the slaveholding territories, namely  Texas, did not hear of  their  freedom until  1865. Galveston, Texas is recognized as the  birthplace of Juneteenth and as of this March,  36 states have recognized the day for observance. Now, 145 years  later, we  remember  Juneteenth as a turning point in the history of  Black Americans.  This celebration of freedom and equality is  an important patriotic symbol in the history of  the Nation. Juneteenth is an opportunity for us  to pause and remember the difficult road to  advancement and to reflect on the importance  of  that political organizing  in Galveston by  former slaves to celebrate their freedom and  new status. Juneteenth is one of the earliest  landmarks of the active political involvement of  Black Americans following the sacrifices made  by the more than 200,000 people who fought  and died in the Civil War.  We are also reminded of the many achievements  and  contributions Black Americans  have made  to  the country  in all  fields. We  highlight the work done by civil rights leaders  and activists who have carried on  the spirit  and legacy of emancipation. In particular, we  salute those men and women serving in our  armed forces, who could not serve today without  the rights afforded  them by  the work of  previous generations of Black Americans who  fought  in every conflict since  the Nation’s  founding. Culturally, we must  recognize  the  magnanimous  impact of Black artists, performers and academics in shaping American  identity well beyond the 21st century.  While Juneteenth started in Texas, its impact and  importance  to  the United States’  commitment to independence and liberty is felt  nationwide. Freedom is at the core of the legacy of the United States and of all its citizens,  regardless of race or personal background. I  am proud to celebrate and recognize the significance of Juneteenth today and forever in  our Nation’s history.  f  HONORING STAFF SERGEANT  BRYAN HOOVER  HON. KATHLEEN A.

1249,191,2010-06-24,Mrs. DAHLKEMPER.," Madam Speaker, it is  with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor  the life of a fallen hero from Western Pennsylvania.  Staff  Sergeant  Bryan  Hoover  of  Lyndora, Pennsylvania was only 29 years old  when he made the ultimate sacrifice defending  our nation in Afghanistan.  On June 11th, a suicide bomber detonated  an explosive near the Bullard Bazaar in Zabul  Province in southern Afghanistan where Staff  Sergeant Hoover and his fellow soldier, Sergeant First Class Robert Fike, also of Western  Pennsylvania, were on foot patrol. Both these  brave men were killed in the explosion. They  were members of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard’s Company C,  1st Battalion,  110th Infantry, based in Connellsville.  Staff  Sergeant  Hoover  was  passionate  about his service to his country, and dreamt of  joining the military even as a child. He enlisted  in the Army National Guard in 2005 and previously served in the Marines. Bryan served a  total of  four  tours overseas,  two  in Afghanistan, one in Iraq and one in Kuwait. He truly  lived to serve our nation.  To his fellow soldiers, he was one of them,  but to the students of Elizabeth Forward High  School  in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania, he was  known as Coach Hoover. Bryan was the assistant cross country and track coach at his  alma mater, where he graduated  in 2000.  Bryan loved sports, and was a talented athlete  himself who particularly enjoyed hockey. He  earned a degree in sports management from  California University of Pennsylvania.  For his brave service and sacrifice, Staff  Sergeant Bryan Hoover was awarded the Purple Heart.  Bryan is survived by his father, Melvin Hoover; his brothers, Richard and Ben; his sister,  Samantha; his grandfather, Ray Bradford; his  stepmother, Elaina Evans, and his  fiance´,  Ashley Tack. His mother, Debra Jean, preceded Bryan in death.  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Staff  Sergeant Bryan Hoover in the RECORDof the  United States House of Representatives  for  service, sacrifice, commitment to his country  and to our freedom.  While we struggle  to express our sorrow  over this loss, we can take pride in the example Bryan set as a soldier. Today and always,  he will be remembered by family and friends  as a true American hero, and we cherish the  legacy of his service and his life.  As I search for words to do justice to this  valiant fallen soldier, I recall President Abraham Lincoln’s words as he addressed  the  families of soldiers who died at Gettysburg:  We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,  we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men,  living and dead, who struggled here, have  consecrated it, far above our poor power to  add or detract. The world will little note nor  long remember what we say here, but it can  never forget what they did here.  May God grant strength and peace to those  who mourn, and may God be with all of you,  as I know He is with Bryan.  f  MRS. LUCILLE ROCHS’ 95TH  BIRTHDAY  HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 24, 2010  ",2010
1250,191,2010-06-24,Mr. CONAWAY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  pay  tribute  to  an  extraordinary  woman, Mrs. Lucille Rochs, who has devoted  her life to the service of her friends and neighbors in Texas.  In life, it is rare to come across an individual  who is so dedicated and so driven that one  can  follow  the path of  their  life. Most of us  leave our marks, but only the exceptional, few  leave their footprints. I am humbled and honored to share Lucille’s story and to be able to  brag on her  today, because she  is one of  those rare individuals.  Lucille makes her home in the city of Fredericksburg, Texas. Although she began her  career as a  teacher and educator, she has  continued  in her retirement as an advocate,  philanthropist, fundraiser, and mentor for the  vulnerable and less fortunate. Mrs. Rochs has  focused her time serving seniors and abused  children in numerous organizations throughout  Gillespie County.  She has worked tirelessly for community organizations  like  the Gillespie County Child  Services board, the Region 8 Texas Department of Child Protection Council, and the Gillespie County Committee on Aging. In addition  she has served on organizations like the Hill  Country Community Needs Council, Texas  Retired Teachers, the Gillespie County Cancer  Society, and the Hill Country Higher Education  Initiative.  What makes this lengthy record of service  all the more impressive is that Sunday is Mrs.  Rochs 95th Birthday. To  this day, she continues  her  active  community  service  and  keeps a schedule that puts mine to shame. It  is my great honor to represent Lucille in this  House. She  is a  treasure  to her community  and an inspiration to those of us who have followed behind her.  I wish Lucille a happy and healthy birthday  and hope that she is able to continue her public service for many more years. I know that I  join with everyone  in Fredericksburg when  I  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:10 Jun 25, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K24JN8.034 E24JNPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 C L B Y K 8 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2010
1251,2,2010-07-01,Mr. HEINRICH.," Last night, I hosted a  telephone town hall with thousands of  New Mexicans to discuss what we’ve  been doing to reform Wall Street and  to protect and empower consumers in  the marketplace. During the town hall,  several constituents contacted my office for help with their own financial  problems  like unfair spikes  in their  credit card  interest rates. Just  like  these callers, all New Mexicans have  been negatively impacted by the years  without accountability for Wall Street  banks and big corporations that caused  the financial hardship that we’re dealing with today.  Our working families and our small  businesses deserve better. That’s why I  was proud to vote for the Wall Street  Reform and Consumer Protection Act  yesterday. This legislation will rein in  the Wall Street banks and their big bonuses and put an end to taxpayer bailouts and the idea of ‘‘too big to fail.’’  I’m hopeful the Senate will quickly  pass this bill so that Wall Street banks  will again be held accountable. Hardworking New Mexicans deserve no less.  f  MAIN STREET ON THE HOOK FOR  MANHATTAN’S WALL STREET  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, yesterday, the House passed a  financial regulatory bill, which shows  Washington  liberals once again how  out of touch they are with the needs of  hardworking Americans. Small business owners and community bankers  across South Carolina will be adversely  impacted by this bill.  Justin  Strickland,  president  of  Southern First Bank in Cayce, and father of former House floor page Justin  Strickland, Jr.,  said  that  ‘‘this bill  adds 30 new regulations that will severely limit the ability of small banks  to extend credit to South Carolinians.’’  Hal Stevenson, CEO of Grace Outdoor  in Columbia, explains  that  this big  bank bailout discourages  lending  to  small businesses and reduces job creation. Calling this a reform bill is insulting when it fails to address the giants in the financial collapse, Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac. Failing to tackle  these two cancerous entities  is  like  going in for surgery and keeping the  giant tumor in place.  In conclusion, God bless our troops  and we will never  forget September  11th in the global war on terrorism.  f  POSSIBLE LAWSUIT AGAINST ARIZONA’S NEW IMMIGRATION LAW,  SB 1070  (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2010
1252,2,2010-07-01,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. Speaker, I am  troubled by recent press reports suggesting that the Justice Department  has decided to sue to block Arizona’s  new immigration law, SB 1070. I believe  this is the wrong direction to go. I believe the administration’s time and efforts would be much better spent securing the border and fixing our broken  immigration  system.  If  there’s  one  message that Washington should receive from the enactment of SB 1070, it  is that Arizonans are fed up with waiting for the Federal Government to address this vitally important issue.  A lawsuit won’t solve the problem. It  won’t secure the border and it won’t fix  our broken immigration system. Neither will boycotts, which are shortsighted and detrimental to our economic recovery. The only thing that  protracted  litigation will do  is once  again demonstrate to Arizonans that  Washington just doesn’t get it. It will  embolden those on all sides who prefer  to  grandstand  and  score  political  points, instead of working toward real  solutions.  Arizonans  are  tired  of  grandstanding and tired of waiting for  real help from Washington.  f  KYRGYZSTAN CONSTITUTIONAL  REFERENDUM  (Mr. PITTS asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2010
1253,2,2010-07-01,Mr. PITTS.," Mr. Speaker, a couple of  weeks ago, there was ethnic violence  occurring in the emerging Republic of  Kyrgyzstan. Today, there is good news  about how that nation is progressing  towards democracy. On Sunday, the  people of Kyrgyzstan held a referendum  on the new constitution. Ninety percent voted  to establish a new parliamentary  government. This would  make Kyrgyzstan the only nation in  the region to shift its balance of power  from an authoritarian style of government to representative democracy.  Despite the recent violence, the interim government was able to conduct  the referendum as scheduled and undertook heroic efforts to include as many  citizens as possible, with two-thirds of  the eligible voters participating. Election officials visited hospitals and refugee camps to ensure that the injured  and displaced were not denied the right  to a ballot.  The government  faces many challenges before the general election this  fall  and  much  to  be  done  for  Kyrgyzstan to establish a stable government that protects the rights of all  its citizens. But the referendum is a  good  start,  and  the United States  should stand by with assistance and  support.  f  OILSPILL MEANS NEED TO  DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE FUELS  (Ms.  SCHWARTZ  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2010
1254,2,2010-07-01,Ms. SCHWARTZ.," As a result of the  BP Deepwater Horizon blowout, tens of  millions of gallons of oil have polluted  the gulf coast. This is the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history. It  is also a clarion call to action—an urgent call to develop alternative sources  of energy. Without a determined commitment to alternative fuels, we will  never end our Nation’s addiction to oil,  which demands drilling in deeper and  more dangerous  locations,  increasing  the  potential  for  other  devastating  consequences. I’ve introduced legislation with bipartisan support to encourage the next generation of biofuels—  fuels made  from  living matter  like  plants and algae. Along with incentives  to  expand  other  alternative  energy  sources and promote energy efficiency,  this proposal is exactly what the renewable  fuel  industry needs  to get  biofuel  facilities built  in the United  States. New bio-refineries will produce  clean energy and create new jobs here  at home. The Biotechnology Industry  Organization estimates that direct job  creation from cellulosic biofuels will  create over 200,000 jobs in the next decade. By working with the private sector to advance the next generation of  fuels, we can and we should put our Nation on a path to safer, cleaner, domestically produced energy.  f  b1010  MISGUIDED FINANCIAL  REGULATORY REFORM  (Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)  ",2010
1255,2,2010-07-01,Mr.  COFFMAN  of  Colorado.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to express my  profound disappointment that yesterday, the House passed an  ill-advised  conference report for the financial regulatory reform bill. This  legislation  will create a permanent bailout fund  for financial institutions. It neglects to  reform or place any safeguards on two  of the main culprits in this ongoing  mess, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac;  and the Federal Government guarantees more than $1.7 trillion of their  debt.  This misguided bill would create a  new government bureaucracy providing  unelected  Federal  bureaucrats  the  power  to  determine  the  types  and  terms offered by financial products. I  have severe reservations about such an  action, as it will simply serve to make  obtaining credit more unavailable. Finally, this act would be paid for in part  by  redirecting  $11 billion  in TARP  funds. Unspent TARP funds must be  used to pay down the national debt. Instead, this Congress is attempting to  utilize these moneys  for  further  increased spending at times when Americans continue to struggle to make ends  meet.  I urge the Senate to vote ‘‘no’’ on the  conference committee report.  f  HONORING  THE  60TH  ANNIVERSARY OF THE KOREAN WAR  (Mr. KLEIN of Florida asked and was  given permission to address the House  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:14 Jul 02, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K01JY7.002 H01JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2010
1256,9,2010-07-01,Mr. CARDOZA.," Mr. Speaker, I understand that the gentlelady and her party  don’t understand what’s happening in  Middle America. They don’t appreciate  what’s happening to folks like in my  district. They may not hang out  in  places like my family’s bowling alley,  where a person who loses their job, and  20 percent of my constituents are nearly out of work, there isn’t jobs around  every corner. She may have plenty of  jobs in her home State. She may not  have to worry about that for her constituents.  But in my world, Mr. Speaker, when  someone who comes to our bowling  alley loses their job, they have nothing  else. They don’t have the Wall Street  bonuses. They don’t have the big pension, retirement systems, and the big  401(k) set-aside. They don’t have the  situation that so many of us need.  We have to provide a safety net for  these people, these hardworking Americans.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. KUCINICH).  ",2010
1257,9,2010-07-01,Mr. KUCINICH.," There are some numbers that bear reflection right now that  came out of the marketwatch.com report today that the Labor Department  estimates 3.3 million people could lose  extended unemployment  benefits  by  the end of July if they’re not renewed.  And all together, 9.2 million people  were collecting some type of unemployment benefits in the weekend of  June 12.  It goes on to say that the 4-week average of initial claims rose by 3,250, to  466,500, the highest level in almost 3  months. And then it says the claims  data, however, had little impact on the  U.S. stock market.  So there’s a separation between Wall  Street, which is still doing well, because the taxpayers bailed out Wall  Street, and Main Street, which,  in  many places across the country, is falling apart.  Now,  I’ve  traveled my district at  countless meetings and events, parades  and church services,  festivals; and I  hear the same thing. People are calling  out from crowds asking for help. And  this unemployment compensation issue  is huge because people are having trouble putting food on the table.  We’re going to give them a lecture  about the budget? Who among us, if  our brother asks for a loaf of bread, we  give him a stone instead?  This Congress this afternoon is due  to appropriate $33 billion to keep the  war in Afghanistan going. And yet the  amount of money we’re asking here for  the unemployed workers of America,  for those who are trying to support  their  families,  almost  an  identical  amount, about $34 billion. And we’re  saying, well, we can’t afford that. But  you don’t hear many people saying we  can’t afford the war, because the truth  is we can’t afford the war. We have to  afford to put people back to economic  sustenance and pass the unemployment  compensation bill.  ",2010
1258,9,2010-07-01,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, my colleague from California may have been  trying to be a little humorous in his  comments, but job loss in this economy  is very serious business.  The American people are asking this  Congress controlled by the Democrats,  Where are the jobs?  I yield 5 minutes to my distinguished  colleague from Indiana (Mr. PENCE).  (Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2010
1259,9,2010-07-01,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and to the underlying bill, but it pains me to do so.  As the RECORDwill reflect, I, and  most of my colleagues in this body,  have supported repeated extensions of  unemployment benefits. And as I told  my constituents yesterday, I was anxious to do so again.  American families are hurting. This  economy is struggling in the aftermath  of the worst recession in a quarter of a  century. And as my colleague just suggested, this economy is also struggling  in the midst of the  failed economic  policies of this administration and this  Congress.  Millions of American  families are  struggling to make ends meet. Since  the passage of the so-called stimulus  bill, 2.6 million jobs have been lost, and  unemployment hovers near 10 percent.  So I was anxious to be able to come  to this floor before heading home for  the Independence Day break, having  supported an extension of unemployment benefits. But I rise in opposition  because  I think what the American  people expect us to do is what they’ve  been doing at kitchen tables and sitting around desks and small businesses  and on family farms, and that is making the hard choices.  We can provide an extension of unemployment  insurance benefits  in  this  Congress, and we can make the decisions to pay for it. And I’m sure it is a  mystery to millions of Americans that  will be looking on as to why we didn’t  even  try. This Democrat majority,  after adopting so-called PAYGO rules,  after hearing from so-called fiscal conservative Members of  the Democrat  majority early in this Congress about  how we were going to pay for what we  spent, has waived their own PAYGO  rules to add $34 billion to the national  debt. And I just have to think millions  of Americans are asking why.  b1140  There are any number of actions that  we  could  take,  decisions we  could  make, reordering our priorities to provide for the families at the point of the  need here.  The gentleman from Ohio just said  that many of us in the minority were  saying that we can’t afford to extend  unemployment benefits. We can afford  it. But at my kitchen table when we  say we can afford something, it means  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:18 Jul 02, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K01JY7.018 H01JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2010

1286,44,2010-07-01,Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, I stand  in opposition to this rule and in sincere  but deep opposition to this $63 billion  massive spending bill, and particularly  the war spending component of the bill.  I speak, I believe, on the behalf of the  hundreds of thousands of brave men  and women who serve America in the  Middle East with neither a defined objective nor the ability to assess victory  or defeat; and on behalf of families of  our military  personnel  around  the  world who have lost their fathers or  their mothers or their sons or their  daughters in a valiant but shortsighted  effort and battle that can never be  won; and on behalf of the American  taxpayers who have seen more than $1  trillion poured into an attempt to fight  terror, where there is not even a remote relationship to the welfare of the  American people; and really, also, on  behalf of the  innocent children who  have had the misfortune to simply be  in the ever-changing line of fire and  the vicinity of terrorists who move effortlessly  from  Iraq  to Somalia  to  Yemen  to Paraguay  to Afghanistan  like the Whack-a-Mole at the county  fair in the form of unconventional and  ill-defined  tribal warfare  that  2,000  years have taught us we simply cannot  fight.  I think it was November of 1952, when  I was about 6 years old, that Charles  Schultz and his Peanuts comic strip  came out with the annual saga where,  every year, Charlie Brown comes up to  the  football, and Lucy tells Charlie  Brown year after year, ‘‘Just one more  time we’ll let you kick ball.’’ And each  year, she pulled the football out, only  to find Charlie Brown on his rear end.  I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker  and Members of the House,  in this  somewhat stretched analogy, that a series of Commanders-in-Chief are Lucy,  and we’re Charlie Brown, and the football is the illusive promise of a goal  that we simply cannot reach. We cannot force a culture to accept our values, and we cannot impose Western democracy on a people who don’t understand or accept it and whose leadership  is corrupt and antidemocratic beyond  repair. And we  cannot  continue  to  spend the billions and, arguably, trillions of dollars of the hardworking men  and women in this country in a venture  that has no objective, no end game, and  no proximate connection to the well-  being of our Nation.  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, we cannot afford  economically, we cannot afford militarily, and we cannot afford as a people  to pass this bill. This President who,  frankly, won an election based on his  strong antiwar message, like many of  his predecessors, asked us one more  time to spend a few more billion dollars—in  this case  $38 billion—a  few  thousand more men and women in an  effort to kick the  football  just one  more time. It simply isn’t doable.  I suggest to you, Mr. Speaker and  Members of the House, that this rule  underlies a bill that the vast majority,  I believe, of the American people don’t  want. I represent a district in central  Illinois, and I think I speak in many  ways for middle America. I voted for  the authorization of force in Iraq and,  frankly, Afghanistan; and  I believe,  like many of us, I may have questioned  my vote. But I believe that we’re the  greatest nation on Earth, thanks  in  large part to the generations of fighting men and women who have given  their lives to this great cause and democracy and this great Nation of ours.  As we prepare to celebrate our independence in a few days, I think I speak  on behalf of the average American citizen who says, For what? What is this  money being expended for? Why are we  doing it? And what’s the end game?  And I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, that  there is no end game, and I would respectfully ask that this rule and the  underlying bill be defeated.  ",2010

1288,44,2010-07-01,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, I hope that we will have an  opportunity to do something we have  not been able to do, and that is to debate the Afghan war and the direction  that this war is taking and the impact  on our men and women on the front  lines. I particularly want to say to the  families how much we appreciate the  sacrifice that you’ve made as these  men and women stand on the  front  lines of Afghanistan. But I think we’re  long overdue for a major debate that  has to do with that direction.  I support this underlying rule for the  purpose of allowing us to have this debate, but also that it provides, on the  domestic spending, crucial issues.  Pell Grants will be provided for in  $4.95 billion; border security that impacts the northern and southern border  so that we can stand as we do comprehensive immigration reform and assure the American people that we will  secure our boarders.  In  the most catastrophic oil  spill  from the region that I come, the tsunami of oil spills, we are taking care of  the people by providing $304 million for  the gulf coast oil spill, including moneys for unemployment assistance.  Then, coming from the region I belong to, as well, we had a tragedy at  Fort Hood, and we are now rebuilding  the Fort Hood processing center that  saw a terrible loss of life because of  terrorism.  FEMA disaster. This is the most vigorous season that you could have ever  imagined that is to be expected in hurricanes, and we know, among other disasters, we’ll have the money here.  But we’re also going to say to the  youth of America when we vote on  this, we’re providing money for summer youth jobs, $1 billion in youth jobs  that we  in the Congressional Black  Caucus—and many Members  joined  us—are fighting for. This is a crucial  step forward. We’re providing for black  farmers who have been discriminated  against over the years.  And then, as I have indicated, we will  have an opportunity to question not  the men and women in Afghanistan or  Iraq, but to question whether or not it  is wise to focus on insurgents versus  terrorists so that we send men and  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:27 Jul 02, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K01JY7.106 H01JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2010
1289,51,2010-07-01,Mr. POMEROY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  opposition  to  the rule allowing  for consideration of House amendments to H.R. 4899, the  Supplemental Appropriations Act.  I believe that it is irresponsible of Congress  to leave for the Fourth of July recess without  sending the Senate-passed supplemental appropriations bill to the President’s desk for signature.  Insisting on  inclusion of additional  spending above  the Senate-passed supplemental levels, with absolutely no assurances  that the Senate is willing or even able to pass  this additional spending will do nothing but  delay vitally important emergency funding.  Swift approval of the supplemental is needed not only for the war effort but also for areas  of the United States, like North Dakota, who  have been hit hard by disasters and desperately need Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster relief  funding  owed them. While I do not take issue with the  additional offset spending  that  is being discussed, the current push to add it will result in  Congress failing to enact a supplemental for  several weeks, with  the strong possibility of  ending up right back where we began.  I am submitting, as a part of my statement,  a copy of an editorial that recently ran in the  Bismarck Tribune  titled  ‘‘Congress needs  to  meet its responsibilities’’. Congress’ inability to  complete even its most basic business has the  American people’s patience running thin. The  delay  in passing a supplemental appropriations bill endangers our soldiers fighting overseas and is preventing critical aid from reaching  those who have been hit with disasters  here at home. We must act today to pass the  Senate version of  this bill and avoid  further  delays.  [June 30, 2010]  CONGRESSNEEDSTOMEETITS  RESPONSIBILITIES  Mor-Gran-Sou Electric,  crippled by  the  Good Friday snowstorm, qualified for financial disaster relief from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  The damage to Mor-Gran-Sou poles and  lines was extensive and pricey, upwards of  $30 million.  The feds agreed to pick up 75 percent of the  cost. That’s what disaster relief programs  are all about—financial help when a natural  disaster levels an area.  Except, the check isn’t in the mail.  When the feds, when anyone, says they are  going to do a thing, they ought to do it—and  do it in a timely fashion.  There’s no excuse for FEMA, and really  Congress, holding up Mor-Gran-Sou.  And the phrase ‘‘holding up’’ isn’t just a  metaphor. While waiting  for FEMA, Mor-  Gran-Sou has had to get a $30 million line of  credit, which even at 2.5 percent  interest  could cost the co-op and its electric customers $1 million in interest over a year.  The FEMA disaster funding was placed in  the bill funding the war in Afghanistan and  Iraq.  One has nothing to do with the other.  Lumping these funding efforts together is  just another political tool—like the ‘‘Christmas tree’’ building bills in the North Dakota  Legislature—for forcing lawmakers to vote  in favor of something they do not want in exchange for something they need.  A congressman might not want to fund the  war in Afghanistan or Iraq, but if that congressman wants disaster relief, well . . .  Congress has intentionally become a beast  of complexity and burden, in this case.  Legislation,  rather  than being a clean,  well-written policy or  law with a  single  given purpose, has become incomprehensible  in language, sheer volume and related programming, regulating and funding.  Yes, we live in a complex world and over  simplification can be dangerous, but that’s  not justification for the present level of congressional chaos.  Congress has legislated FEMA’s obligation  in a natural disaster. FEMA has deemed  Mor-Gran-Sou’s  situation as qualified  for  help.  Now Congress must  follow through and  provide funding to do what it said FEMA  would do.  In Washington, a million dollars in interest might not amount to much, but on the  far end of a power line in western North Dakota, with 11,000 downed poles and 550 miles  of tangled line, it’s a very big deal.  In people,  follow-through of  this kind,  speaks to character. The same goes for Congress and its members.  Our delegation needs to push hard to break  this log jam. Will it?  ",2010
1290,51,2010-07-01,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I thank you for the opportunity to explain my  amendment to H.R. 4899—‘‘Supplemental Appropriations Act 2010.’’ H.R. 4899 will provide  funding for the needs of the American people,  from national security, housing, employment,  health, to education. I fully support these efforts and want to stress that we must continue  to provide policies and  funding  that ensure  that the United States remains a global leader  in science and technology, including space exploration, which not only results in knowledge-  building but also in hundreds of thousands of  jobs throughout the nation.  My amendment would ensure: all managed  funding  for  the National Aeronautics Space  Administration  (NASA) NASA Constellation  programs will be maintained  through  fiscal  year 2015 with the assumption that the Constellation  program will  continue:  (2) U.S.  human space flight systems shall be lead by  the U.S. government  to ensure crew safety  and  to ensure skill, capabilities and  institutional knowledge attributable to NASA and ISS  can be retained by the U.S. for the appropriate  time; (3) strengthen partnerships between universities and NASA centers; and (4) ensure a  protocol  for commercial human space  flight  utilization shall be established.  The President’s proposed FY2011 budget  eliminates  funding  for a portion of  the Constellation Program which  includes  the Orion  Crew Capsule,  the Altair Lunar Lander, and  the Ares I and Ares V rockets.  Earlier this year, I introduced H. Res. 1150,  ‘‘Designating  the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration  (NASA) as a national  security Interest and Asset,’’ and stating findings  that  the elimination of  funding  for  the  NASA Constellation program in the President’s  proposed FY 2011 budget presents national  security concerns.  It  is critical  that managed  funding  for  the  NASA Constellation programs  is maintained  through fiscal year 2015 as:  1. Elimination of the Constellation programs  will present Homeland Security implications for  Cyberspace, critical  infrastructure, and  Intelligence community of the United States;  2. Elimination of the Constellation programs  will compromise the effectiveness of the International Space Station as it relates to the strategic  importance of space station  research,  and intelligence; and  3. Continuation of NASA’s Constellation program  is crucial  to maintaining  thousands of  American jobs and the U.S.’s leadership role  and  technological edge as well as securing  valuable knowledge that improves national security, climate, and research  in science and  medicine.  INTERNATIONALLEADERSHIPANDTECHNOLOGICAL  COMPETITIVEEDGE  Eliminating  the Constellation upon  retirement of the Space Shuttle will diminish the nation’s international leadership role and efforts  to advance scientific research in space. The  United States will for the first time, since its  space program began, be without a human  space flight program.  Additionally,  transferring  funds  from  the  Constellation program to the development of  commercial space programs to carry a human  crew  into space  is  taking a chance on an  unproven quantity and is an unnecessary and  unreasonable risk this country must not take  at this time. It is more prudent to establish a  protocol  for commercial human space  flight  utilization at this time.  It  will  take  years  for  the  commercial  spaceflight  industry  to get up  to speed  to  reach the level of competence that exists at  NASA today. Our government has already invested literally years and billions of dollars into  this program. We should build upon these investments and not abandon them. Our country  can support the commercial spaceflight industry, but not at  the expense of our human  spaceflight program, which for years has inspired  future generations and driven  technology that enhances our quality of life.  The retirement of  the Space Shuttles  this  year will  leave  the United States vulnerable  and dependent upon Russia to put U.S. astronauts  in orbit without  the Constellation program.  In May of  last year when  it became  clear the U.S. had no one else to turn to, Russia raised its prices from $48 to $51 million  per launch for each astronaut.  In addition, it is important for us to remember that the Constellation program is not just  about going to the moon, as the U.S. has a  commitment to the International Space Station  (ISS).

1293,86,2010-07-01,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I thank the gentleman for yielding the  time.  I rise to give compliments to Chairman NORMDICKSof the subcommittee  for having worked with the minority  and the majority, as well as the President of the United States, to develop a  very good Defense appropriations supplemental appropriations bill for our  troops who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The bill provides the equipment necessary for those troops to carry out  their mission. The bill provides  for  training. The bill provides for self-protective measures to keep our troops  safe while they fight the war they were  sent to fight.  b2100  The only problem I have is we’re not  going to vote on that bill. Although  this  is supposedly a defense supplemental, that bill is not going to be  voted on. That bill was reported and  approved by the subcommittee back in  May, but yet there has been no consideration beyond  that date. The  subcommittee approved  it back  in May  after the President requested it.  The members of the Appropriations  Committee have not had an opportunity to vote on a Defense supplemental appropriations bill. The Members of the House have not had an opportunity to vote on a Defense appropriations  supplemental  bill. There’s  something wrong with that.  Chairman DICKS did a good job. He  worked with us, as did Chairman Murtha before him, and it was a good bipartisan effort. We’re not only not  going to vote on that good bill, but  we’re not even going to have a chance  to vote on the Senate version of the  bill that’s not quite as good as the  House version, but  it’s better  than  nothing. And it’s time that we provide  the funding for our troops in the field,  deployed and exposed  to danger,  so  that they’re provided with what they  need.  I have a problem with this. I said the  subcommittee approved the bill back  in May. The full committee has not  considered it. As a matter of fact, we  are rapidly approaching the 1-year anniversary of the last time the Appropriations Committee met to consider  an appropriations bill. Now, that’s unusual. It seems to me like it flies in the  face of the Constitution, because Article I, section 9 makes it very clear that  the executive branch of government  cannot spend money from the General  Treasury that has not first been appropriated by Congress. And if the Appropriations Committee doesn’t meet to  approve the bills or to report the bills  to the House, how are we going to meet  that constitutional responsibility? It’s  pretty tough.  July 22 last year was the last time  the Appropriations Committee met to  consider an appropriations bill. So I  compliment Chairman DICKS for creating a good bipartisan product that  the President of the United States supported, and I am just disappointed that  we’re not going to have a chance to  vote on it. Our troops in the field need  to know that we are supporting them  with whatever it is that they need to  carry out their mission.  I am opposed to all of these amendments that we are considering because  none of them do anything to support  our troops in the field, which is what  this bill is supposed to be all about.  These amendments are not good, and  it’s just a real shame that we are not  considering the needs of our troops who  are deployed, to provide what it is that  they need in order to accomplish the  mission that we sent them to accomplish and to protect themselves while  they’re doing it.  Mr. Speaker, typically, I would use my time  talking on a Supplemental as  the Ranking  Member of the Defense Subcommittee to congratulate Chairman DICKSon a fine bi-partisan  package that he and his staff put together. I  would thank him for treating us fairly and listening to the minority’s concerns, and suggest  that we pass the bill as quickly as possible.  Regrettably, I cannot do that today because  the bill before us is the product of such an  abuse of power and process  that we aren’t  even voting on Chairman DICKS’ bill.  Instead, we  find ourselves voting on  the  Senate defense supplemental in the hope of  getting  the Department of Defense  the desperately needed  funds  for on-going Afghanistan operations before they run out.  And I must say that really upsets me. While  this is our best chance of getting badly needed funds to the Department, Chairman DICKS  and his staff had produced a very fine, truly bi-  partisan supplemental bill . . . one that in my  opinion was much better than this Senate bill.  But because of his leadership, that bill never  saw the light of day. Not because it was controversial, or contained something bad, but because procedurally a small group of Members  couldn’t  find a way  to get unrelated, extraneous domestic spending items attached to it.  So instead today, maybe it is in my best interest for me to use this time making a case  for my old spot on the Armed Services Committee.  That may seem odd, but I can only wonder  how much  longer  the Appropriations Committee will exist . . . if it still does.  I do thank Mr. DICKS for his courtesy and  cooperation. I only regret that his leadership  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:45 Jul 02, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K01JY7.144 H01JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2010
1294,93,2010-07-01,Ms. LEE of California.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, as we approach the 10-  year mark in this war, which is the  longest war in U.S. history, we need to  ask when is enough enough? How many  of our brave men and women must be  sacrificed  in  this never-ending war?  How much blood, how much treasure  do we have to spend in Afghanistan?  And, also, we have to ask ourselves do  we need another 10 years to figure it  out. I suggest that we don’t.  It’s time to change course. It’s time  for Congress to assert itself in our responsibilities, in our role. We control  the  purse  strings,  and  enough  is  enough. We need to say today that we  must begin  to  safely withdraw our  young men and women from Afghanistan. No more funds for combat operations.  ",2010

The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Massachusetts.  ",2010
1296,93,2010-07-01,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in strong support of the McGovern-  Obey-Jones amendment. Quite simply,  all this amendment does is make sure  that the President and the Congress be  accountable to the American people,  our troops, and their  families about  what our policy in Afghanistan is going  to be from July 2011 onward.  At this time I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY),  chairman of the Appropriations Committee.  ",2010
1297,93,2010-07-01,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker,  as was  pointed out earlier, those who suggest  that any efforts to add any items to  what is called a military supplemental  are somehow out of  line are simply  wrong. This legislation started out as a  disaster relief bill. It went to the Senate, and they morphed it into a military supplemental, and we’re simply  now responding to that action.  I want to talk about the problems in  Afghanistan. A year ago, I made the  statement that while  I was dubious  about the mission  in Afghanistan, I  would give the President a year to see  whether his policy would bear  fruit.  But I warned at the time that we could  have the best possible policy  in the  world and, if we did not have the tools  to implement it, it would be a failure.  And I would suggest that the only two  tools that we have available to use in  that region of the world are the Pakistan Government and the Afghan Government; and I think it’s safe to say  that both of them have been less than  a spectacular success, to say the least.  Since then, I think it’s also fair to say  that events have gone downhill, especially in Afghanistan.  And  in addition,  since we’re now  spending $167 billion on these two wars,  I think it’s also obvious that we’re having a profoundly negative effect on our  ability to reinvest in and rebuild our  own economy. And I think the time has  come for new consideration.  Now, last December the President indicated that it was his intention to follow a policy which would begin  to  withdraw our troops from Afghanistan  beginning in July of 2011. This amendment is meant to simply buttress that  commitment, and what it says is this:  It requires that in January, a new intelligence estimate be provided, and  that after that is provided, the administration, by April 4, must respond to it  by sending to the Congress an outline  of its plans to follow the policy which  they  have  announced which would  begin to get us out of there starting in  July of next year.  What this amendment also says is, if  the administration decides to follow a  different policy by,  for  instance, extending that date, then they cannot do  that unless  the Congress  explicitly  votes to allow the funds to be used for  that purpose.  What I’m concerned about  is this:  What I can see happening is come next  July, we can be told by the Pentagon,  well, things are marginally better than  we thought they would be and so we’re  going to need more time and that target date will be slipped. On the other  hand, they can also say things are really going badly and so we obviously  can’t get out at this time. We need to  have more time.  I want to know that there is a serious, determined commitment to withdraw our troops beginning in June of  next year. That is more than ample  time for the Pakistani Government and  the  Afghan  Government  to  demonstrate whether they are capable of  doing this mission or not.  I think it is obvious that we are not  going to be able to rebuild our own  country and make the investments we  need here at home so long as we’re continuing this mission  in Afghanistan.  And so I think this provides an orderly,  rational, responsible, thoughtful way  by which we can reach a conclusion to  get out of that country rather than  spending another 9 years before we finally face up to reality.  I thank the gentleman for the time.

1301,100,2010-07-01,Mr. POMEROY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 4899, the Supplemental Appropriations Act.  While I am extremely disappointed that the  House  is not  simply passing  the Senate-  passed version of this bill and clearing it for  the President’s signature, I will ultimately support this bill. It is my belief that voting against  this bill even in its current form would send a  terrible signal  to our  troops  that we do not  support their efforts and that is unacceptable  to me. And, while  I still believe  this  is  the  wrong vehicle for it, I am pleased that the domestic spending that is included in this legislation is offset and will not add to our deficit.  We must act as soon as possible to get critical military and Federal Emergency Management Agency funding legislation to the President for his signature. Our troops in Iraq and  Afghanistan and families across America who  have been affected by disasters cannot afford  anymore delays in funding.  ",2010
1302,100,2010-07-01,Ms. CLARKE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  express my support  for key provisions and  amendment  to H.R. 4899,  the Supplemental  Appropriations Act of 2010. The bill provides a  myriad of critical emergency funding for disaster relief in Haiti, the oil spill in the Gulf of  Mexico, as well as fully paid for investments to  meet domestic needs, such as education jobs  and Pell Grants. Unfortunately, this bill also includes funding for the war in Afghanistan, the  longest war in our nation’s history.  While I am grateful to the men and women  who serve valiantly in our Armed Forces, both  at home and abroad,  I strongly oppose any  additional funding for the war in Afghanistan.  This war has gone on long enough without a  clear and sufficient exit strategy. My constituents and I can no longer bear to see more  Americans die or remain  in harm’s way,  for  this fruitless war. The time is now to bring our  troops home, stop the unnecessary spending  and stabilize our economy. That is why I support the amendments offered by CBC Chairwoman BARBARALEEand JAMESMCGOVERN,  DAVIDOBEYand WALTERJONES.  DAVIDOBEY I commend Chairwoman LEE for working  diligently to bring her important amendment for  a vote. I agree we must begin to end the war  by limiting funds to the safe, timely withdrawal  of US troops and military contractors from Afghanistan. The people in my district demand  it, I morally oppose it, and time is of the essence.  I also want  to  commend  the Chairman  and  the Members of  the Committee on Appropriations for their hard work on  the House Amendment to the Senate bill. In  particular, I want to thank the Committee for  including funding for school districts, like those  in New York City, that are poised to receive  high concentrations of Haitian child refugees.  These children are more likely to settle in already overburdened school districts. Therefore, schools receiving these children will undoubtedly need extra resources to accommodate this new population. In April, I joined my  colleagues on a letter to Chairman OBEY, expressing this very concern. I am grateful that  this language was adopted.  Additionally the Obey amendment provides  major benefits to education for all Americans.  It includes $10 billion in aid to local school districts avert massive teacher layoffs and $5 billion to help close the current shortfall in Pell  Grants  for college students—the absence of  which would seriously imperil education funding for fiscal year 2011. This will affect thousands of teachers and students in my district  and in the Greater New York area.  I strongly believe that H.R. 4899 is a key  tool  for Haiti’s  redevelopment. As  the Representative of the second largest Haitian population of first and second generation Haitians  Americans, I am greatly pleased that the bill  includes $2.93 billion dollars for the U.S. participation in the Haiti disaster relief, $130 million above the President’s request. The people  of Haiti, its government, USAID and the Department of State cannot move forward in their  recovery and reconstruction plans without the  pledged  financial support  from our government.  Mr. Speaker, I support our troops, veterans,  and military families, and in honor of them I  voted to reunite our service members in Afghanistan with their families here at home. My  heart also goes out to the people of Haiti and  will continue to support our reconstruction efforts there. Lastly, I am proud that the advocacy efforts of  the New York congressional  delegation in pushing to save education jobs  in New York City have paid off.  ",2010
1303,100,2010-07-01,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong support of the Senate amendments to  H.R. 4899,  the Supplemental Appropriations  Act for 2010. This legislation is critically important  to providing  funding  to our men and  women in uniform who are serving in harm’s  way.  However, this legislation also provides funding that is important to maintaining our strategic posture  in  the Pacific. The  legislation  contains $50 million in transfer authority of Department of Defense operation and maintenance funding to the Guam Port Improvement  Enterprise Fund at  the Maritime Administration. The $50 million in funding is critical for  the Port of Guam,  in consultation with  the  Maritime Administration,  to begin necessary  infrastructure  improvements and modernization.  The Port of Guam, on many occasions, has  been  identified as a potential chokepoint  for  the delivery of materials and supplies to support the realignment of military forces to Guam  and sustain economic development on the island. Without these improvements the realignment of military forces to Guam would be severely delayed, add additional costs to future  military construction and potentially harm our  civilian  economic  development. Moreover,  these  improvements are needed  to  facilitate  the requirements of being designated a strategic port, in fact America’s most forward located strategic port in the Western Pacific.  The funding for the Port of Guam in this bill  marks an important and very positive step forward for the military build-up on Guam. I thank  the Obama administration for their support and  leadership on  this matter. After Guam was  overlooked  for  important Recovery Act  funding,  the administration acted after  repeated  calls by our office for funding for critical civilian  infrastructure  projects  and  requested  the  transfer authority. I also thank Congressman  DAVIDOBEY, Chairman of  the House Committee on Appropriations; Congressman NORM  DICKS, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Defense, and Congressman JOHNOLVER, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development and Related  Agencies, for their support of this provision.

1312,191,2010-07-01,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen out there in  TV land, I could not go to sleep tonight  until I got off my heart what has been  on it, particularly over the last few  days. What’s on my heart is such pain  and empathy  for the people of this  country who want to work but can’t  find a job, people who have worked all  of their lives only to be caught victimized by the  financial meltdown that  took place in October of 2008.  b2330  The biggest downturn since the Great  Depression. Eight million  jobs  lost.  Those are real jobs affecting real people, affecting their children, affecting  their parents and grandparents; people  who had been accustomed to being a  part of the middle class and now they  find themselves out of a job, out of  work for an extended period of time.  And, by the way, I must tell you that  this portion of today’s proceedings is a  Special Order of the Progressive Caucus.  And  so  these  8 million  jobs were  caused—or the loss of these 8 million  jobs were caused by the shenanigans on  Wall Street. There was an endless, or  what must have seemed like an endless  party  for  the Wall  Street  crowd.  Stocks, bonds, dividends. They couldn’t  be happy just with those profits. They  had to come up with other ways of  making money. They came up with  these hedge funds that enabled someone to sit at a computer without producing anything and make money just  by buying and selling various security  instruments.  And those secured instruments or instruments of securities—or securities—  were largely the product of these 8 million people who lost these jobs. Largely, those securities were generated on  the backs of the middle class people  who had used their money, used their  earnings, used their savings to buy a  home, and they bought a home. Oftentimes, they were steered into what we  call a predatory loan, which is nothing  more than a high-cost loan, a loan with  exorbitant costs. And these loans were  primarily directed to minority communities. And once those targeted communities had been saturated with those  predatory high-cost  loans, then that  industry turned  its attention to another vast market untapped.  It was  middle class America, all over America.  And all of these high-cost loans were  packaged together and sold as securities on Wall Street. These loans featured  such attributes as no money  down  or  low  downpayments. Sometimes no documents required or a no-  doc loan. They had adjustable rates,  adjustable mortgage rates. They had  other features like clauses that prevented you from refinancing without  suffering a penalty. These high-cost  loans, once the requisite amount of  time had gone by, then the loans would  be adjusted upwards. And when that  adjustment was made, the people found  out that they were unable to meet  those new monthly payments. And so,  therefore, they would simply refinance,  pay  another yield  spread  premium,  stripping the equity from their property and giving  it to the mortgage  broker in return for placing them in  another predatory loan.  And everything was going fine, these  high-priced loans packaged as securities being sold on Wall Street, or being  sold by Wall Street to entities and people throughout the world. And it was  all based on the rising home values  that everyone just assumed would continue to go up.  But at some point, people started defaulting on those high-cost predatory  loans all across this Nation. And when  that happened, the people who had purchased the securities that were backed  by those now unperforming loans realized that they had worthless paper in  their hands, and so it became a run on  the bank.  Now, keep in mind, these people and  entities that had bought or purchased  these securities had also purchased insurance from AIG to make sure that, if  the security ended up becoming useless, then AIG, like an insurer should,  would pay them for that loss. And so  AIG was put in a perilous situation.  And so what happened there, then it  became a bailout situation. Are you  going to let AIG fail along with all of  these other  investment banks which  were steeped heavily with these toxic  securities?  So, along came the Bush plan to restabilize the economy through the Wall  Street, the notorious Wall Street bailout, $700 billion. And you would think  that the banks would have used that  money to lend to smaller banks, the  Wall Street banks would have used  that money  to  lend money  to  the  smaller banks, and those smaller banks  then could use that money to lend to  small businesses and  to  large businesses as well; and in that way, we  would have had more job creation to  try to put a dent in this 8 million jobs  lost. But no, they did not do that.  What did those Wall Street banks do?  They didn’t loan money to small businesses to expand and hire new workers.  And, in fact, in 2009, total lending by  U.S. banks fell 7.4 percent, the steepest  drop since 1942. Now, keep  in mind,  they just got $700 billion in October of  2008. 2009, total lending fell 7.4 percent,  the steepest drop since 1942. And the 22  firms that received the most bailout  money cut small business loans by $12  billion in 2009.  b2340  Meanwhile, the top 38 largest financial firms gave out $145 billion in taxpayer money, in record pay, to their  employees—this was in 2009—and an 18  percent increase in pay for their employees over 2008. In the first 3 months  of 2010, four of the leading financial  firms,  including Goldman Sachs, reported profits of $14 billion.  It is time for that money, ladies and  gentlemen,  to be  returned  to Main  Street. What Wall Street has done is  taken that money that should have  been invested in Main Street to create  jobs for the American people. Instead,  they  took  that bailout money, and  they gave record pay to their employees—$145 billion in the year 2009. Nobody is crying about that. Everybody is  crying about  the deficit. Nobody  is  talking about job creation.  Are you a job creator, or are you a  deficit reducer? What is most important? What would be most important  to you?  If you are sitting on your  couch, listening to what I have to say,  and if you have heard all of the stories  about how deficit and spending has to  be cut and if you know the government  is driving us into the ground with deficit spending and then if you’re sitting  there without a job, what is more important to you—deficit reduction or job  creation?  I submit to you that, if you are not a  job creator, then you are barking up  the wrong tree as far as what can be  done to ease the deficit and to eliminate it eventually.

1313,205,2010-07-01,Mr. WILSON of Ohio.," Madam Speaker,  today I rise to recognize the judicial and civic  contributions  of  Judge David  Tobin.  This  month, Columbiana County is losing a great  public servant. Judge Tobin devoted  twenty-  five years of his life to serving on Columbiana  County Court of Common Pleas, the second  longest tenure of any judge on the Court. His  time spent on the bench and prior decade of  service as a Columbiana County Prosecuting  Attorney  greatly  benefited  the  citizens  of  Columbiana County.  During his service, he had  the honor of  serving on  the Ohio State Bar Association’s  Board of Character and Fitness as a Commissioner. He also worked hard to bring the Supreme Court of Ohio to the Columbiana County Courthouse to host a court session. These  are just a few of the examples that illustrate  the professional respect for Judge Tobin exhibited from Lisbon to Columbus.  He was also greatly respected  throughout  the  community.  From  community  service  through the Calcutta Rotary, to his work with  the Calcutta Community Park Committee,  to  his various coaching positions, Judge Tobin  exhibited a strong commitment to his community.  The people of Columbiana County have  been blessed by  the  long service of Judge  Tobin, and upon his retirement this July, he  will be sorely missed.  I ask my colleagues  today to join with me in honoring Judge Tobin,  a respected judge and public servant who has  been and will always be dedicated to the people of Columbiana County.  f  UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD  MAINTAIN FREEDOM OF MEDIA  HON.

1314,205,2010-07-01,Mr. MOLLOHAN.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to draw your attention to a troubling situation occurring in Ukraine. Less than 100 days  ago, President Victor Yanukovich assumed  leadership of the Ukrainian government. During this short period of time, there have been  alarming reports that many of the democratic  achievements of the 2004 Orange Revolution  are being rolled back—including the freedoms  of speech and media.  Some of the reported actions occurring include the Ukrainian Security Service’s, SBU,  agents approaching university deans to warn  them against  their students’ participation  in  pro-opposition rallies, as well as instances of  the new government  intimidating  journalists.  Furthermore, two TV channels with a history  of  independent  coverage—Channel  5  and  TVi—are under threat of imminent closure due  to reported pressure from executive bodies, including SBU.  These  troubling  instances  of  pressure  against Ukraine’s beleaguered opposition and  independent media outlets are arguably part of  a disturbing, coordinated effort by the executive to squelch a healthy political debate and  assure an uncritical coverage of the government’s policies. In fact, these reports are so  widespread  that  the United States Ambassador to Ukraine, John Tefft, even recently expressed his concerns about  the  increasingly  difficult  climate  for Ukraine’s  independent  media and stressed that ‘‘it is essential to protect and even expand the media freedoms that  emerged’’ after  the country’s 2004 Orange  Revolution.  I understand that Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton will visit Kiev, Ukraine on July 2, as  part of her five-day, five-nation tour of Eastern  Europe. I would encourage Secretary Clinton  to  raise  these  issues  with  President  Yanukovich and  reiterate  the  importance of  not returning to Ukraine’s old system of government pressure on  journalists and media  companies.  I am  including a copy of an article  titled,  ‘‘Ukraine  channels  cry  foul as  frequencies  pulled’’ that appeared in the June 8 issue of  The Financial Times, Europe. As such, I urge  my colleagues to follow and engage in this vitally important issue.  [From the Financial Times, June 8, 2010]  UKRAINECHANNELSCRYFOULAS  FREQUENCIESPULLED  (By Roman Olearchyk in Kiev)  Two Ukrainian television channels cried  foul on Tuesday after a high court pulled  crucial broadcasting frequencies away from  them, sparking media freedom activists to  reiterate concerns of an organized attempt  to block objective news coverage.  The development follows weeks of growing  complaints by journalists about the resurgence of censorship and heightens fears that  a Kremlin-styled crackdown on media freedoms could be in the works five months into  the  presidency  of  the Moscow-friendly  Viktor Yanukovich.  Management and journalists from channels  5 and TVi pledged to appeal against the controversial ruling and hope to remain on the  air in the near term. But during a press conference held after Tuesday’s regional administrative court ruling, they openly expressed  fears that media freedoms and democratic  gains made by Ukraine since 2004 could be at  risk under Mr. Yanukovich. He is accused by  oppositionists of setting up an authoritarian  regime.  ‘‘We lived through 2004,’’ said Channel 5 director Ivan Adamchuk, recalling attempts  by authorities to muzzle the channel ahead  of  the pro-democracy Orange Revolution,  which  overturned  a  fraud-marred  presidential vote for Mr. Yanukovich. ‘‘We could  not imagine that those times would return,  but they have,’’ he added.  Oleh Rybachuk, a former presidential administration chief turned civic activist, said  ‘‘censorship is re-emerging, and the opposition is not getting so much coverage. There  are similarities to what [Vladimir] Putin did  when he came to power. We are seeing Putin-  style attempts to monopolise power.’’  With Mr. Yanukovich’s coalition having  swiftly consolidated control over the nation’s  legislative,  executive  and  judicial  branches of power, the channels could face  an uphill battle if he opposes their survival.  Mr. Yanukovich’s administration on Tuesday repeated denials of cracking down on  free press. But media watchdogs warned that  if stripped of the frequencies, the two channels—seen  by media watchdogs  as  rare  sources  of  reports  critical  of  Mr.  Yanukovich’s coalition—would be blacked  out from much of the country.  Such a scenario would preserve the strong  grip over Ukraine’s television airwaves held  by Mr. Yanukovich’s billionaire business  backers.  One of them is Valery Khoroshkovsky, currently head of Kyiv’s SBU spy agency and  owner of UA Inter Media Group, the nation’s  largest television holding. The latter filed  the court appeal asking for the frequencies  to be pulled on grounds  that  they were  wrongfully issued in January.  Both 5 and TVi have repeatedly accused  Mr. Khoroshkovsky of abusing his power and  influence to preserve his monopoly control  over Ukraine’s media airwaves and limit objective news reporting.  Mr. Khoroshkovsky denies wrongdoing and  insists his wife manages his media empire as  he dedicates his time to public service.  But on Tuesday, Mykola Knyazytsky, director of TVi, which was set up by exiled  Russian  businessmen,  blamed  Mr.  Khoroshkovsky for the crack down on the  two channels and described his simultaneous  role as a presidential backer,  intelligence  chief and media mogul as a ‘‘huge and blatant conflict of interest.’’  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:35 Nov 06, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\E01JY0.REC E01JY0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010

It is with both profound sadness, but  also an enduring sense of gratitude that I recognize him for the tremendous inspiration he  provided to the South Florida community.  Mr. Simmons was born on January 31, 1956  in Miami, Florida  to Mrs. Blanche Simmons  and the late Mr. Matthew L. Simmons, Sr. He  was a product of  the Miami-Dade Public  School System and graduated  from Miami  Jackson Senior High School.  Soon thereafter, Mr. Simmons faithfully and  patriotically served his country by joining the  United States Army’s 82nd Airborne Division.  He attained the rank of sergeant before being  honorably discharged in 1979.  Mr. Simmons was blessed with a  loving  family who took pleasure in every aspect of  his life and his interests. I offer my heartfelt  condolences to the Simmons family.  Madam Speaker,  I ask you and all  the  members of this esteemed legislative body to  join me  in recognizing  the extraordinary  life  and accomplishments of Mr. Matthew Leonard  Simmons, Jr. He will be missed by all who  knew him, and I appreciate this opportunity to  pay  tribute  to him before  the United States  House of Representatives. While he will  indeed be missed, his  legacy, as well as  the  outstanding contributions he made  to South  Florida and our nation as a United States  Army veteran will live on.  f  CONGRATULATING  THE  PARK  RIDGE FINE ARTS SOCIETY ON 50  YEARS OF SUMMER CONCERTS  HON.

1316,212,2010-07-01,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to honor the Park Ridge Find Arts Society as  they celebrate 50 years of providing  free summer concerts for the community. The  purpose of the Park Ridge Fine Arts Society is  to provide a musical showcase and the means  for enjoyment of serious music  through  free  community concerts, and  to engage  in such  activities and programs that will foster all of  the  fine arts. The concerts draw crowds of  1,500 to 3,500 people, with a season total of  more than 30,000 concertgoers.  These concerts are a wonderful way not  only to bring beautiful, professional music to  the community, but also to bring neighbors together and build a sense of community. Summer in Park Ridge is enriched by these wonderful weekly concerts in Hodges Park.  Frank York established the Park Ridge Fine  Arts Symphony Orchestra and the Park Ridge  Fine Arts Society 50 years ago and remained  at the helm of the organization, driven by his  vision of excellence, until 2005. Throughout  the organization’s history,  it has maintained  the highest artistic standards. The Park Ridge  Fine Arts Symphony Orchestra  is produced  and coordinated by the Park Ridge Fine Arts  Society to perform the summer concerts. It is  a fully professional orchestra, made up of superb musicians from throughout the Chicago  area, devoted to bringing the excitement and  beauty of great classical music to the northwest suburbs.  I want to recognize the great work of the  people who make sure that the concerts are of  the highest quality and are available  to  the  community each summer: Barbara Schubert,  musical director and conductor; Emily Toy  Kosaka, president; Daniel Aranda, vice president; Dennis Van Mieghem, treasurer; Dawn  Himley-Grandi, secretary; and the board of directors: Ken Boyce, Pam Boyce, Kevin P.  Costello, Doug Crawford, Mike Grandi, Mary  Jersey,  Russ  Jersey,  Jim  Lange,  Paul  Lundberg, Debbie Maggio, Mike Maggio, Jack  Owens, Christel Owens, and Nancy Tordai.  The orchestra and its concert series in Park  Ridge is truly one of the great jewels of the  northwest suburbs.  f  CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4173,  DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT  SPEECHOF  HON.

1317,212,2010-07-01,Ms. SPEIER.," Mr. Speaker, our mission from  the American people was simple: pass Wall  Street Reform that puts consumers first, holds  Wall Street and Big Banks accountable, and  ends the era of taxpayer-funded bailouts and  ‘‘too-big-to-fail’’  institutions. By passing  this  legislation, we have fulfilled that mission.  We ensure that taxpayers are never again  on the hook for Wall Street’s risky decisions.  We enable regulators to shut down ‘‘too big to  fail’’ banks before they take down the system.  We impose tough new rules on the riskiest financial practices that were at the root cause  of the crisis. We place a fiduciary duty on brokers to act in the best interests of their clients.  We create a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and end  the reliance on credit  rating agencies  that gave  triple-A ratings  to  that  risky mortgage-backed  securities  didn’t understand or investigate.  To those who ask: will the Wall Street Reform we passed last night prevent another financial meltdown in the future–I answer with a  firm and resounding yes.  they  f  HONORING CAPTAIN E. LORENZO  DICASAGRANDE  HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 1, 2010  ",2010
1318,212,2010-07-01,Mr. RUPPERSBERGER.," Madam Speaker, I  rise before you today to honor the life of Captain E. Lorenzo DiCasagrande, a shipping executive who helped transform Baltimore into a  nationally recognized container port and thus  contributed  to  the economic vitality of Maryland communities.  Captain DiCasagrande, who passed away  May 21, 2010, was vice president of the Mediterranean Shipping Company for more than 20  years and was an early advocate of the Port  of Baltimore. Within one year of  joining  the  company, he had established weekly service  for the line from East Coast ports, including  Baltimore’s South Locust Point Marine Terminal, which had previously been served by  one ship once every two weeks. The company  brought 8,000 containers each year  to  the  South Locust Point shipping berth.  Captain DiCasagrande then paved the way  for the success of the Seagirt Marine Terminal  in 1990 by being  the  first container  line  to  commit to the then-new terminal. Today, the  company is committed to 150,000 containers a  year and is still growing, with five ship calls  every week to the Seagirt terminal. In fact, the  Mediterranean Shipping Company  is Baltimore’s top container customer.  Earlier  this  year, Captain DiCasagrande  celebrated with Maryland port officials as they  broke ground on a new 50-foot berth for the  Port, a long-time vision for him. The project  will support 5,700 jobs and, when completed,  accommodate  larger ships and attract more  cargo to Baltimore. It will help Baltimore maintain  its current customers and attract new  ones that will come aboard the larger ships of  the future.  A native of  Italy, Captain DiCasagrande  adopted Baltimore as his second home, fiercely defending the city in business negotiations.  He worked hard to win customers and built a  strong  relationship with  the port community,  elected  officials  and  his  employees. His  friends and business associates alike described him as a great leader, well-respected  and well-liked. He was also a dedicated husband, father and grandfather.  Madam Speaker,  I ask  that you  join me  today to honor the life of Captain Lorenzo E.  DiCasagrande. His dedication as a tireless advocate for the Port of Baltimore is deserving of  the utmost gratitude. He deserves credit  for  helping bring more cargo to Baltimore’s piers  and creating thousands of jobs for Maryland  families.

It is with both profound sadness but  also an enduring sense of gratitude that I recognize her for the tremendous inspiration she  provided to both her church and community.  Affectionately known as  ‘‘Mama G,’’ Mrs.  Gordon was born in Riverside, Hanover, Jamaica on November 26, 1916  to  the  late  Jabez Buchanan and Florence Johnson. She  attended Riverside All-Age School, Rusea’s  Comprehensive High School and Bethlehem  Teachers College.  Upon graduation, Mrs. Gordon began her  professional career as a teacher at Riverside,  Wesley, Elletson, and New Providence primary schools in Jamaica and William Gordon  Elementary School in the Bahamas. She was  also a private tutor.  She was a member of  the Meadowbrook  United Church in Jamaica and served as an  elder, member of the Women’s Guild, and participated in the Social Services Outreach Program.  In Miami, Florida, Mrs. Gordon was a member  of Bay Shore  Lutheran Church. She  served as a greeter and member of the Lutheran Women Missionary League. She was  the recipient of the Good Samaritan Award of  Bay  Shore  Lutheran Church, which was  awarded by the Lutheran Services of Florida.  Mrs. Gordon was married to the late Rupert  Carlton Gordon. They had  three daughters:  Yvonne Elaine Hill, Patricia Evadne Ferdinand  and Rose-Marie Gordon-Wallace. She was  blessed with a loving family who took pleasure  in every aspect of her life and her interests. I  offer my heartfelt condolences  to her  three  daughters; sons-in-law, Tyrone Hill, Donald  Ferdinand, Frederick Myers, and Roy Anthony  Wallace;  her  grandchildren,  great-grandchildren, sisters, cousins, nieces, nephews,  and friends.  Madam Speaker,  I ask you and all  the  members of this esteemed legislative body to  join me  in recognizing  the extraordinary  life  and accomplishments of Mrs. Eglantine Melita  Gordon. I am honored to pay tribute to Mrs.  Gordon for her invaluable service and tireless  dedication to both her church and local community.

TODD TIAHRT  OFKANSAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 29, 2010  ",2010
1320,219,2010-07-01,Mr. TIAHRT.," Mr. Speaker, this legislation is  long overdue. For years, there have been inconsistencies in the manner in which manufacturers pay their taxes. Under current law,  firearm and ammunition manufacturers pay excise taxes into the fund on a bi-weekly basis.  All other manufacturers pay on a quarterly  basis. This legislation will change this inconsistency and bring a little commonsense into  our crazy tax system.  I am pleased  to be a cosponsor of H.R.  510, to amend the Internal Revenue Code to  require that the payment of the manufacturers’  excise tax on recreational equipment be paid  quarterly. The frequency of tax payments for  the firearm and ammunition manufacturers is a  burden on the industry. In fact, some manufacturers are forced to secure short-term loans  to pay their taxes, thus incurring additional expenses and adding to administrative overhead.  The end result is that money is diverted away  from core business areas to finance tax payments.  Through this legislation, firearm and ammunition manufacturers will now be able to reinvest more funds into researching and developing new products, purchasing new manufacturing machinery, and  increasing marketing  and outreach to the hunting and sport shooting community. The  federal government will  get their taxes, on a quarterly basis as it does  from every other manufacturer, so no revenue  will be lost.  I urge my colleagues  to support  arms Excise Tax Improvement Act.  the FireRECOGNIZING THE SALTER FAMILY AS THE  2010 SANTA ROSA  COUNTY  OUTSTANDING  FARM  FAMILY OF THE YEAR  HON.

1321,219,2010-07-01,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Madam Speaker, it  is my distinct privilege to recognize the Salter  family for being named the 2010 Santa Rosa  County Outstanding Farm Family of the Year.  The hard work and dedication of  this  family  helps not only feed many in the community,  but also so many throughout the country. For  that reason, Madam Speaker, I am honored to  recognize their accomplishments.  John, Stacy and their daughter Kailee are  fourth generation  farmers. The Salter  family  has been a vital part of the Chumuckla community  since  the  late 1800s. While many  things have changed in the field of agricultural  science since the 1800s, the Salter family has  remained steadfast in their honored tradition of  working hard and providing quality goods  to  market.  In addition  to having a determined work  ethic that is deeply rooted in the Salter family,  they have also begun to sow the seeds of voluntarism in the Northwest Florida community.  Mr. John Salter has served as the Chairman  of the Blackwater Soil and Conservation District  for  the past 12 years and  is currently  Chairman of  the Santa Rosa County Farm  Service Agency County Committee. Furthermore, Mr. Salter serves as a council member  of  the Three Rivers Resource Conservation  and Development Council. He is also a member of Florida Farm Bureau, Florida Peanut  Producers Association and the Southeast Peanut Farmers’ Association.  Madam Speaker, our great nation was built  by  farmers and  their  families. The Salters  serve as an example to all our nation’s family  farmers. On behalf of the entire United States  Congress I applaud their efforts and congratulate  them on being named  the Santa Rosa  County Outstanding Farm Family of the Year.  My wife Vicki and I thank them for their work  and wish them continued success in the future.  f  IN MEMORY OF MR. ROBIN  WHITLEY HOOD  HON.

1323,226,2010-07-01,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.,"  Mr. Speaker, it is with the utmost respect and  admiration  for  the  late  Senator  that  I recognize his passing.  Senator BYRDwas known as a man of  the  people. He dedicated his  life’s work  to  the  CARLYLEBYRD ROBERT  American citizens and his beloved constituency in the Mountain State of West Virginia.  Born  November  20,  1917  in  North  Wilkesboro, North Carolina,  the young BYRD  moved with family to West Virginia where he  grew up and would later meet his soon to be  wife,  Erma  Ora  James.  Their marriage  spanned more  than  six decades until her  death in 2006. Initially, he was unable to afford college, but eventually attended Beckley  College, Concord College, Morris Harvey College, and Marshall College, all  in West Virginia. Senator BYRD’s public service career  began after he won a seat in the West Virginia  House of Delegates in 1946. Six years later,  he was elected to the United States House of  Representatives.  It was during  this  time he  began night classes at American University’s  Washington College of Law in 1953. With a tenacious spirit and made up mind, he would  earn his law degree some ten years later in  1963.  Along  the course of his professional and  academic career, BYRDwas elected  to  the  United States Senate and would serve 51  years making him the longest serving senator  in history. His  time  in office was well-spent  and fruitful where he would serve in a myriad  of  leadership  roles. Most notably: President  Pro Tempore of  the United States Senate;  Democratic Caucus Senate Majority  leader;  Senate Minority leader; and Chairman of the  Senate Committee on Appropriations.  Senator BYRD, like many of us, lived a full  life  filled with high peaks and valleys  low.  I  too, had some reservations about meeting this  one-time member of the Klu Klux Klan who for  14 hours  filibustered  the Civil Rights Act of  1964. But, when our paths crossed,  I soon  learned of the great character of man he truly  was. He  believed whole-heartedly  in  the  United States Constitution and a clear demonstration was the pocket version he always  carried in his coat pocket. Another love he had  was for taking afternoon walks on the West  Front side of the Capitol. It was during that  time of day where  I knew  I could  find him  whenever I needed to seek the voice of wisdom.  Mr. Speaker,  I will miss  those afternoon  strolls with the Historian of the Senate. Senator BYRD loved the American people, loved  his state and loved our great nation. Although  he no longer is with us on the terrestrial, his  legacy will live deeply within the halls of Congress and in the hearts of humanity.

HOLT  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 29, 2010  ",2010
1324,226,2010-07-01,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize  and honor the memory of United States Senator ROBERTC. BYRDof West Virginia.  Born in West Virginia, I have known Senator  BYRDmy whole  life. Senator BYRD faithfully  served West Virginia  in Congress  for more  than 57 years. Throughout his career in the  House and the Senate, he improved the lives  and welfare of the people of West Virginia for  whom he cared so much. He worked endlessly to fight for democratic principles, defend  the Constitution, and ensure that the American  Dream was in reach for all families.  Senator BYRDgrew up in the southern coalfields of West Virginia, first working as a gas  station attendant briefly and  then  in a  local  food market. He started his political career in  the West Virginia House of Delegates, serving  from 1947 to 1950, followed by two years in  the West Virginia Senate. After being elected  to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1952,  he enrolled in night law school classes despite  not having a bachelor’s degree. In 1958, West  Virginia elected him to the U.S. Senate where  he became its longest-serving member.  Senator BYRDwas an energetic defender of  the U.S. Senate as an institution, persistently  seeking to preserve its dignity and traditions.  He literally wrote the book on the Senate—a  four-volume history of the institution that is a  treasure. To read his books and to read his  speeches is to see Senator BYRDas a self-  taught great orator and historian, someone  who could  readily quote  from Shakespeare,  Greek tragedies, and the King James Bible.  I always will remember him for his extraordinary devotion and service to the people of  West Virginia. He paid exceptional attention to  his constituents and their individual concerns.  Staff members  told me  that at night  they  would receive calls at home from the Senator,  quizzing them on people who had signed his  guestbook that day and asking how he could  help  them. He would recognize people  in a  crowd and ask them if his constituent service  to them years before took care of their problem.  My thoughts and condolences go out to his  daughters, his family, and all of his friends and  neighbors  in West Virginia. Senator BYRD  dedicated every day of his service in the U.S.  Congress to strengthening the institution and  the country that he loved so deeply.  He will be greatly missed. May he rest in  peace with his beloved wife Erma.

1325,6,2010-07-12,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Mr. President, I  rise  to discuss  the appointment by  President Obama of Dr. Donald Berwick as Administrator of the Center  for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  I disagree, respectfully, with my distinguished colleague  from Arizona. I  guess I agree that it is regrettable that  this was a recess appointment, but I  believe that on the part of the President it was both prudent and necessary  to make this a recess appointment,  given, A, the urgency of moving forward with health care reform and, B,  the  relentless  blockade  the Republicans have maintained.  Dr. Berwick  is perhaps  the most  qualified person in the country to wield  the  vast  apparatus  of  the Federal  health care bureaucracy  toward  the  comprehensive  change we  need,  to  lower the cost of health care, while improving the quality of health care.  In evaluating this urgency, I ask my  colleague to consider the situation we  are in right now. We are in the midst of  an accelerating and unsustainable rise  in health care expenditures in America.  In 1955—the year I was born—we spent  a little bit over $12 billion a year on  health  care. That was  the  annual  health care expenditure in the United  States in 1955—$12 billion. Last year,  we spent more than $2.5 trillion. The  increase over the previous year was  $134 billion—from 2008 to 2009, an increase of $134 billion, which is the largest year-to-year increase in history, by  the way, and 200 times what we spent  in  1955—200  times. Anybody who  is  looking at this can see both the trend  and the increasing acceleration of this  curve.  It  is  accelerating,  it  is  unsustainable, and it adds up to, at  this point, a stunning 17.3 percent of  our national  domestic  product,  our  GDP, spent on health care every year.  No other nation even comes close to  spending that much of its annual domestic product on health care.  In my home State of Rhode Island,  had we done nothing on health care, by  2016 a family of four would have faced  more than $26,000 in premiums for family health insurance—$26,000 per year  in 2016 average costs. Last year, premiums for Medicare Advantage plans  jumped an average of 14.2 percent nationally—just in 1 year. So there is a  clearly unmistakable  case  that our  health care costs are out of control and  we have to do something about it.  The escalation, as I pointed out, is  unsustainable and accelerating, but it  is not inevitable. Indeed, experts from  across the ideological spectrum agree  that a great deal of health care cost is  simply waste—waste resulting from an  irrational, disorganized status quo that  too often encourages the wrong choices  by patients, payers, and by providers of  health care services. That status quo  has to change.  As you consider our health care system, set aside for a moment the problem of duplicative tests, the problem of  lost medical records, the problem of  unnecessary treatments, and the problem of uncoordinated care for patients  working between multiple doctors. Set  aside all those problems and look just  at the administrative overhead of our  private insurance market.  By way of reference, administrative  costs for Medicare run about 3 to 5 percent. Overhead for private insurers is  an astounding 20 to 27 percent. A Commonwealth Fund report indicates that  the  private  insurer  administrative  costs more than doubled from just 2000  to 2006. In those 6 years, the overhead,  the administrative costs of the private  insurance industry, more than doubled,  up 109 percent. The McKinsey Global  Institute  estimates  that Americans  spend roughly $128 billion annually just  on what the report called ‘‘excess administrative overhead.’’ There is $128  billion that we pay for every year in  excess  administrative  overhead—not  health care but administrative overhead—in our health care system in the  private health insurance market.  On top of that, you have the duplicative tests, lost medical records, unnecessary treatment, and the uncoordinated care for patients with multiple  and chronic conditions. I won’t dwell  on those particular topics because I  have spoken about them so often on  the Senate floor in the past. My point  is that because of all this waste in the  system, the President’s Council of Economic  Advisers  concludes  that  it  should be possible to cut total health  expenditures about 30 percent. Let me  repeat that quote.  It should be possible to cut total health expenditures about 30 percent without worsening outcomes  . . . which would suggest  that savings on the order of 5 percent of GDP  could be feasible.  Five percent of GDP is over $700 billion a year, and other experts agree.  The New England Healthcare Institute  reports as much as $850 billion a year  in excess cost ‘‘can be eliminated without  reducing  the  quality  of  care.’’  Former Bush administration Treasury  Secretary O’Neill has written that the  excess cost is $1 trillion a year in our  health care system. The Lewin Group,  which is often cited in this Chamber on  both sides of the aisle as a respectable  organization  that does authoritative  work in this area, finds that we burn  over $1 trillion a year through excess  cost and waste.  So is it $700 billion a year in excess  cost and waste, is it $850 billion a year,  is it $1 trillion or over a year in excess  cost and waste? Whatever it is, it is a  big number, and we needed to do something about it.

1329,13,2010-07-12,Mr. LEAHY.," First, I am going to  speak a little bit about the process of  her  nomination  through  the  committee. The distinguished Presiding Officer would know about this because he  has had probably the best attendance  of anybody, including the chairman, on  the Senate Judiciary Committee, and  he has handled a number of these nominations.  We are going to proceed today on  only 1 of the 22 judicial nominations  that have been stalled on the Senate  floor by Republican obstruction. This  is a nominee we considered and voted  out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously 3 months ago without objection.  Just so everybody will understand,  even after being nominated to serve on  a court, these well-qualified nominees  have to put their lives on hold. We  have the hearing, they go through the  committee unanimously, but then they  wait and wait on the Senate floor. If  the nominee is practicing law they cannot take on new clients. If they are  with a law firm, they have a hard time  taking new cases as the law firm needs  to avoid any conflict of interest.  I cannot understand why  this obstruction is happening. I have never  seen anything like this in my 36 years  in the Senate. No Republican Senator  on  the  Judiciary Committee  voted  against this nomination. There are another dozen  judicial nominations on  the Senate’s Executive Calendar that  were reported by the Judiciary Committee without objection, but they remain stalled by a Republican refusal to  consent to final Senate action.  I tell people in my home State of  Vermont I am sent here to vote yes or  no, not to vote maybe. It seems to me  everybody wants to vote maybe. There  is no good reason each of these pending  nominations could not be confirmed  immediately. With so many nominations, despite ongoing vacancies and  the need in the Northern District of Illinois for this judge, 3 months have  passed without any explanation.  I predict that when we have the rollcall on this nomination it will be confirmed with virtually no opposition,  which makes it even more tragic. Also,  it hurts the Federal judiciary. It hurts  the credibility of the Federal judiciary.  But I might say, especially on something like this, where the Senate Republican  leadership would not  even  consent to a vote on the nomination  until today, this certainly hurts the  image of the Senate. People cannot understand why, when we have something  on which everybody agrees, why it cannot come to a vote.  We have the Senate Republican leadership  refusing  to  enter  into  time  agreements on pending judicial nominations that have the support  from  both Democrats and Republicans, including nominations with bipartisan  support from North Carolina and Tennessee and South Carolina and California and New York and Delaware and  Virginia  and Utah, Maryland, Minnesota, and Rhode Island. Every single  Democrat is prepared to vote on these  nominations. They could vote on them  tonight and are prepared to vote now.  However, they continue to be held up  by Republicans.  So I tell the people of North Carolina  and Tennessee, South Carolina  and  California and New York and Delaware  and Virginia and Utah and Maryland  and Minnesota and Rhode Island, if you  are wondering where your judges are,  they are being held up not by the  Democrats but by the Republicans.  In fact, the Senate is dramatically  behind the pace  I set  for President  Bush’s judicial nominees in 2001 and  2002. In 2002, the second year of the  Bush administration, the Democratic  Senate majority’s hard work led to the  confirmation of 72 Federal circuit and  district judges nominated by a President from the other party. In this second year of the Obama administration,  we have confirmed just 23 so far—72 for  President  Bush,  23  for  President  Obama.  In the first 2 years of the Bush administration, we confirmed 100 Federal  circuit and district court  judges. So  far, in the first 2 years of the Obama  administration, the Republican leadership has successfully blocked all but 35  of President Obama’s Federal circuit  and district court nominees—100 to 35.  Playing games with the Federal judiciary hurts everybody. During the first  2 years of President Bush’s Presidency,  I had the opportunity to serve for 17  months of as Chairman of the Senate  Judiciary Committee. I knew we had  just come from a time where Republicans had  pocket-filibustered  61  of  President Clinton’s nominees to the judiciary. I said we ought to try stopping  that, so in those 17 months that I had  the privilege to serve as chairman, I  convinced the people in my caucus and  others and we confirmed 100 of President Bush’s nominees.  I mention this because in the first 48  months of President Bush’s Presidency,  actually barely half of that time, 17  months of that 48 months, there were  Democrats in charge. For 31 months of  this time there were Republicans  in  charge.

1330,20,2010-07-12,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. President, as we  celebrate the 147th anniversary of the  Battle of Gettysburg, I celebrate the  contributions Vermont’s brave citizens  made to keep the Union whole.  As the Civil War began, President  Lincoln sent a message to Governor  Erastus Fairbanks: ‘‘Washington is in  grave danger. What may we expect of  Vermont?’’  The  Governor’s  reply:  ‘‘Vermont will do its full duty.’’  Fairbanks called a special session of  the State  legislature and  told  lawmakers,  ‘‘The United States government must be sustained and the rebellion suppressed, at whatever cost of  men and treasure.’’  Vermonters fulfilled that pledge.  During  the Battle  of Gettysburg,  waged  from July 1 to July 3, 1863,  Vermonters  fought heroically. Under  the command of GEN George Stannard,  Vermonters ‘‘broke the back of Pickett’s charge,’’ helping lead the Union  Army to victory in the decisive battle,  says George Gunlock, a local historian  in my State.  Another Vermonter, William Wells,  won the Medal of Honor for leading his  men in a daring cavalry charge against  Confederate lines during the Battle of  Gettysburg. A statue was built in his  honor in both Gettysburg and in Burlington’s Battery Park. Wells, who rose  to  the  rank  of  general,  served  as  Vermont’s adjutant general after the  Civil War.  But it not so much the officers, but  the brave men who served under them,  that we most remember, even at this  historical distance.  Despite its small size, Vermont was a  major contributor to the Union Army.  In all, 33,200 Vermonters fought in  the war, or more than 10 percent of the  State’s population at the time. Twenty-eight thousand Vermonters served  in the State militia and another 5,000  enlisted for Federal service during the  Civil War. At the time, the State’s estimated population was 320,000.  According to historians, nearly half  of the men in Vermont who were of  military age signed on to serve their  Nation.  Great  sacrifice was  exacted  from  these  brave  volunteers. Vermonters  suffered 5,194 deaths, during the Civil  War, including 1,832 Vermonters killed  or mortally wounded  in battle, 2,747  who died of disease or other causes and  615 who died while prisoners. More than  2,200 Vermonters were taken prisoner  during the war.  The history of the Vermonters who  fought during the Civil War lives on.  The Vermont National Guard’s 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, now deployed in Afghanistan, uses a famous  line  from  the Civil War—‘‘Put  the  Vermonters  ahead’’—as  its  motto  today. The line comes from a famous  order by Union GEN John Sedgwick.  When the battle of Gettysburg began  on July  1,  1863, Sedgwick’s  soldiers  were in Maryland, 35 miles from the  battlefield.  ‘‘At dusk orders came to  move, but it was about 10 o’clock at  night before the column started  for  Gettysburg.  It was on this occasion  that General Sedgwick issued his famous  order:  ‘‘Put  the Vermonters  ahead and keep the column well closed  up.’’  As we recognize the dedication of  Vermont’s soldiers in the Civil War, so  should we recognize the dedication and  bravery of Vermont’s soldiers today,  when more than 1,500 members of the  Vermont National Guard are serving in  the war zone in Afghanistan. Approaching July 4th, the day which marks our  Nation’s independence, I want to celebrate the courage of those brave men  from Vermont who fought to preserve  the Nation in the Civil War, and the  brave men and women who are answering our Nation’s call  today  in  the  mountains and valleys of Afghanistan.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO ALICE KUNDERT  ∑",2010
1331,20,2010-07-12,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, today I  wish to recognize the 90th birthday of  Alice Kundert, a valued public servant  in my home State of South Dakota.  Alice’s public service career began  when she was appointed as the deputy  superintendent of schools in Campbell  County. She served on the town board,  school board, and  later took on the  roles as Campbell County’s clerk of  courts and registrar of deeds.  She was convinced by a group of  teenagers that she counseled to run for  political office at the State level. The  first governmental office Alice held  was as State Auditor for three 2-year  terms followed by two 4-year terms as  Secretary of State. She was appointed  by Governor Mickelson to the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs  which allowed her to travel the state  teaching children about the history of  South Dakota. The last political office  Alice held was her 1990 election as a  State representative which she served  for two 2-year terms.  I would  like to send my heartfelt  congratulations to Alice on her 90th  birthday and to thank her for her years  of dedicated public service to the State  of South Dakota.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO PATRICIA LUTZ  ∑",2010

1333,27,2010-07-12,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. President, we are now on the 84th day of the  Deepwater Horizon spill. Along with  the over 175 million gallons of oil and  natural gas that have gushed into the  gulf,  over  1  million  gallons  of  dispersants have been applied, with  700,000 gallons applied under the surface of the water. This is a method of  using dispersants that has been likened  to a science experiment.  With each passing day, we see new  images of oil washing up on the shores,  onto our beaches, into the wetlands,  coating the wildlife. We have all seen it  on television, and it is heartbreaking.  But  I worry more about  something  else, something we do not see. For 2  months now, academics, the media, and  the public have asked about the possibility of vast amounts of oil miles  away from the location of the spill.  Independent scientists from research  institutions in my State, such as the  University of South Florida and Florida State University, took to the water  early on. They sent their own research  vessels out there to find the answers.  What they found confirmed the fears  we have—what we do not see, and that  is detectable amounts of oil and hydrocarbons impacting areas away from the  spill. These hydrocarbons may not look  like what we imagined. We imagined  ominous black clouds. But,  in  fact,  what scientists pulled up from different  depths  in their water samples often  came up clear, but just because you  can’t see the oil doesn’t mean it is not  there and it doesn’t mean it is not having an impact.  A few weeks ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  released its first report on subsea oil.  Our top ocean science agency has been  working to understand the impacts of  subsurface hydrocarbons. While there  is now some publicly available information on subsurface oil, many unanswered questions remain. Is the subsurface oil down there, and especially  that which you can’t see? Is it there  because of the use of dispersants? Does  the large amount of pressure caused by  the weight of the water column at such  depths—as  far as 5,000  feet—lead to  these plumes of oil being subsurface?  What is the effect of having oil and gas  throughout the water column as opposed to the oil floating on the surface?  I believe it took so long to get any  information because this is something  we simply have not seen before. The  last time this country dealt with a  spill even near this magnitude was the  Exxon Valdez spill. But that was a  tanker that leaked in a bay where all  the oil was in the upper layers of the  water column. The oil basically stayed  afloat. Here, we have a situation where  the oil is being released 5,000 feet below  the surface of the gulf.  It  is being  sprayed with  dispersants,  and  that  keeps much of it down in that fragile  environment and away from view. But,  of course, the many organisms that  live down at those depths are the base  of the food web, and the impact of the  dissolved and dispersed hydrocarbons  on these critters is simply unknown.  We haven’t even begun to deal with  the question of the natural gas that is  also spewing out of the well. Some  have estimated that as much as half of  the volume coming out of the well is  actually natural gas. Some of that is  very probably dissolving, and it is possible that most of it is dissolving. But  who knows how these chemicals are  interacting with it? If any of the natural gas is bubbling to the surface, it  could pose a threat to the health and  the safety of wildlife, and it could pose  a health hazard to humans on the surface of the gulf.  As a result of all of this and so that  we  learn  from this situation so we  don’t keep doing this same thing over  and over, I am introducing the Subsea  Hydrocarbon  Imagery  and Planning  Act. This bill will address  some of  these gaps in our knowledge and understanding of what happens when oil and  natural gas are  released under  the  ocean.  This bill will direct NOAA to review  its current protocols for detecting and  mapping subsea hydrocarbons. It would  require them to develop priorities and  to adopt a plan for the future by implementing a program within the Office of  Response and Restoration dedicated to  mapping subsea hydrocarbons and releasing what  their  trajectories  are.  State and local governments and the  American people should have access to  this information so they can plan accordingly. NOAA itself needs this information for incorporation into its protocols for closing and opening fisheries.  And the people in charge of managing  this crisis need this  information so  they  can make  informed  decisions  about how to proceed.  We are in the midst, as we know, of  hurricane season. While we have not  seen this subsea oil with our eyes yet,  a hurricane could make that worst-  case scenario a reality.  Last week, during the recess, I spent  some time with some of Florida’s best  and brightest scientists who are studying this spill.  I spoke with researchers from Florida  Gulf Coast University, Mote Marine  Laboratory, and the University of Miami’s Center for Southeastern Tropical  Advanced Remote Sensing. These institutions might have the technology and  expertise that could be used to detect  and monitor subsea oil and gas and  measure its impact on fragile marine  environments.  As we look to the future and as we  are getting NOAA to adopt a plan, that  is a plan we need. This legislation—the  Subsea Hydrocarbon Imagery and Planning Act—will ensure that days in the  future we will not wonder how much  oil and gas is out there, where it is,  where it is going, and what its impacts  will be because we will know.  I hope my colleagues in the Senate  are going to support this effort. Clearly, with what is going on, this well  needs to be killed. There are 60,000 barrels of oil a day gushing into the gulf,  and this has been going on now closing  in on 3 months.  Until the time the well is killed, they  will continue to try to siphon off as  much as possible, and that is the process they are doing now. They took off  that one cap. All of that oil is gushing.  They are going to try to put on another  cap that will have a tighter seal that  they can get more to the surface.  In the meantime, all that oil on the  surface—we  have  the  skimmers—we  need to skim off and keep  it  from  reaching the shore. If it gets on the  beach, that is one thing. We can get it  off the beach. It harms all of the industries. It harms tourism. Clearly, the  perception that there is oil harms fishing. But the real ecological damage is  when it gets past the beach and it gets  into the bays, the estuaries, and the  marsh grasses. Then it is so difficult to  get out and it all the more compounds  the impact on the critters.  No. 1, kill the well. No. 2, scoop as  much as we can get off the surface to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:17 Jul 13, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A12JY6.023 S12JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2010

I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 126, which recognizes the 50th anniversary of the Title  VI  international education programs  within the Department of Education.  Under the Office of Postsecondary Education,  the  International Education  Programs Service,  IEPS, manages a  total of 14 such programs. These programs provide grants to individuals, institutions  of higher  education,  and  nonprofit organizations to build and  strengthen  international  cooperation  and enrich our students’ cultural experiences.  International  education  has  long  been an  important part of strengthening the capability and performance  of American educational programs in  foreign  languages  and  in  area  and  international study. International education programs also help our Nation’s  students,  teachers,  and  researchers  interact with other cultures and languages, train our specialists, and inform general understanding of peoples  of other countries. On the 50th anniversary of  the Title VI programs, we  honor the contributions and benefits of  international education programs  to  science, culture, government, and business.  International  education  programs  were originally authorized as Title VI  of the National Defense Education Act  of 1958, in part as a response to the  launch of Sputnik and with the recognition that a stronger and broader  engagement with foreign language and  area studies would strengthen American national security.  b1420  Title VI was later incorporated into  the Higher Education Act of 1965 and  has continued to evolve to meet the  needs  of  today’s  students. A well-  rounded international education is also  critically important to a globally competitive workforce. Title VI program  grants help address business needs for  international expertise, strengthen undergraduate education and research at  National Research Centers, and  improve foreign language training and assessment at Language Resource Centers.  In the academic setting, institutions  have used title VI grants to establish  or operate overseas research centers,  support more than 800 graduate fellowships  in  foreign  languages and area  studies, and improve business curriculums, especially as  it concerns U.S.  trade and global competitiveness.  Madam Speaker,  I want to thank  Representative WATSONfor introducing  this resolution, and once again express  support for House Concurrent Resolution 126, which recognizes the 50th anniversary of title VI international education programs within  the Department of Education.  I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010
1338,4,2010-07-19,Mr. GUTHRIE.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of  H. Con. Res. 126, recognizing the 50th  anniversary of title VI  international  education programs within the Department of Education.  Title VI was originally authorized as  title VI of the National Defense Act in  1958 in response to the launch of Sputnik and the U.S. Government’s recognition that a stronger and broader capacity in foreign language and area studies was needed to create a body of experts competent in foreign languages  and cultures who could serve the government, especially our defense and intelligence agencies and  the Foreign  Service.  Three programs that were included in  the original 1958 legislation continue  today as the National Resource Centers  program, the Foreign Language and  Area Studies Fellowship program, and  the International Research and Studies  program. These programs support language area centers  for expansion of  postsecondary instruction in languages  that are less commonly taught, as well  as  foreign  language  fellowships,  research  supporting  language  learning  methodology, and language institutes  to  provide  advanced  language  and  training.  Over time, additional programs have  been added to title VI in order to address the Nation’s growing interest in  international education. Title VI programs also help to address business  needs  for  international  expertise,  strengthening  undergraduate  education, international as well as area  studies,  advancement  of  technology  use, and overall improvement of foreign language training and assessment.  Today, as intended by the program’s  creators, title VI programs help to provide for our national defense by ensuring a Federal investment in ensuring a  supply of citizens with  international  expertise. Title VI programs help to  support American experts in, and citizens’ knowledge about, world regions,  foreign  languages, and  international  affairs, as well as those with a strong  research base in these areas.  Madam Speaker,  I  urge my  leagues to support this resolution.  ",2010

Res. 126, recognizing the  50th anniversary of Title VI international education programs within the Department of Education.  Since the terror attacks of 9/11 it is indispensable that we continue to strive to develop  leaders, educators, foreign policy experts and  individuals in matters of world affairs through  research and specialty training in international  affairs. Moreover, it is imperative that we continue to expand educational programs that will  create opportunities for greater diversity in our  knowledge of other nations. Such advancements will further equip citizens and experts  within  the United States with  the necessary  tools  to contribute  to national security and  world development.  Every day our world changes and Title VI  has played an  important role  in helping  the  United States  respond  to  these  changing  events in a culturally sensitive manner.

1342,11,2010-07-19,Mr. GUTHRIE.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1855, the Strengthening  Employment Clusters to Organize Regional Success, or the SECTORS, Act,  and I appreciate Mr. LOEBSACKand the  bipartisan way in which this is going  to move forward.  H.R. 1855 creates new grants within  the Workforce Investment Act to help  create or increase targeted industry capacity and partnerships within specific  regions. This is an idea that is already  being done in some places across the  country with  success. For  example,  Philadelphia has  created a  regional  program to train nurses for their hospitals and health care industry needs.  I believe Federal policies should also  encourage regional business development and improve worker training, retention, and advancement opportunities. That is why I strongly support not  only this bill but strongly support the  reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act.  b1450  Madam Speaker, the Workforce Investment Act is 8 years overdue in its  reauthorization, and I am disappointed  that we are not engaging in a larger  discussion  of Workforce  Investment  Act reauthorization.  The American people are  facing a  tremendous  economic  challenge  and  there has never been a more critical  time to make sure our workforce has  the opportunity to find new jobs or receive additional training. We need better systems of training and skills development to help move into new industries.  I come from a small business manufacturing background, and I have seen  firsthand  that  unemployed workers  who receive additional training for new  skills can obtain a higher-paying job  which can  radically  transform  their  way of life. We cannot afford to approach the workforce and job needs of  our country in a piecemeal way. The  American people deserve a real, comprehensive job training bill.  I, along with eight of my colleagues,  introduced H.R. 4271, the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2009, to  begin the process of reauthorization of  WIA. But, unfortunately, my bill has  not been taken up by the Education  and Labor Committee.  I do support this bill before us today,  but I do believe it’s a disservice to the  American people not to have an updated, comprehensive workforce development bill, and I urge this Congress to  take action on  full authorization of  WIA as soon as possible. I do urge my  colleagues to support the bill before us,  however.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2010

1346,18,2010-07-19,Mr. JONES.," Madam Speaker, tonight  I would like to bring up the issue of Afghanistan. This weekend in the Raleigh  News and Observer, they published 20  names of our men and women who have  given their lives for this country. As  most of you know, I have written over  9,000 letters to immediate and extended  families of the fallen. Lately, the numbers have dramatically increased. More  and more of our sons and daughters in  uniform are paying the ultimate price.  I would like to reference this poster  beside me. The picture’s of a  flag-  draped coffin being carried off a plane.  This is war. This is the reality of war.  In a recent debate on the floor of the  House regarding Afghanistan, I made  reference to conservative George Will  and  liberal Thomas Friedman. Both  have stated in written editorials that  there is nothing we can accomplish in  Afghanistan. In an article published in  Newsweek yesterday, Richard Haass  shares this opinion. His article is entitled,  ‘‘We’re  not winning.  It’s  not  worth it.’’  In my remaining time I would like to  share some thoughts of a former general who’s my personal adviser on Afghanistan. These are his words, not  mine: ‘‘The basic ’mission’ of defeating  al Qaeda in Afghanistan is a sham. Our  own intelligence tells us that there are  only about 50 al Qaeda members in the  mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan . . . certainly nothing worth sending thousands upon thousands of our  best young men and women to fight. Al  Qaeda is not a geographic entity . . . it  cannot be pinpointed to a single area.  Attacking  them  in Afghanistan  or  Pakistan just pushes them to other locations . . . Yemen is the perfect example. It is like playing the child’s game  ’Whack a Mole.’ Stop al Qaeda in one  area and they will just pop up in another. Bottom Line: the war against  terror is not to be found in the mountains of Afghanistan or Pakistan . . .  as we have vividly seen in Uganda and  the U.S. recently.’’  Madam Speaker, I mention that, and  I have this poster that shows, again, as  I have been repetitive for just one moment, the number of young men and  women coming back from Afghanistan  and Iraq in a flag-draped coffin.  It’s our policy, responsibility on the  House floor and in the Senate to debate  policy. These young men and women  are doing exactly what they joined the  Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air  Force and have sworn they will do for  this country. They will go when their  leaders call upon them to go. It is our  responsibility on the floor of the House  to debate the policy, and the policy on  Afghanistan has been proven from Alexander the Great to the English, to  the Russians, to all the countries: you  are taking a country with over 1,400  tribes and trying to make it a nation.  It just is not going to happen.  And  it’s not  fair to our men and  women in uniform to continue to send  them back 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 deployments. We  had a marine recently down at Camp  Lejeune, which is in my district, a sergeant who  committed  suicide  right  there on the streets of Camp Lejeune.  We are wearing out our military. It’s  time to have another debate on the  floor of the House, and it’s time to  bring these troops home and rebuild  our military and rebuild the equipment  and make America’s military strong  again.  Madam Speaker,  I will close with  this: God, please bless our men and  women  in uniform. Please bless the  families of our men and women in uniform. And, God, in Your loving arms  hold the families who’ve given a child  dying for freedom in Afghanistan and  Iraq. And, God, give the strength to the  House and the Senate that we will do  what is right in the eyes of God and  give strength to Mr. Obama to do what  is right in the eyes of God.  And, God, three times I will ask from  the bottom of my heart, God, please,  God, please, God, please continue to  bless America.  f  ",2010

1349,18,2010-07-19,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Madam Speaker, for  nearly 36 years, the people of Cyprus  have endured an illegal occupation and  massive violations of human rights and  fundamental freedoms by Turkey after  it invaded a sovereign nation 36 years  ago tomorrow. It breaks my heart to  hear the stories of how the occupied  north has been devastated, how the  Turkish  occupiers  have  converted  chapels in Kyrenia into bars and tourist information centers; how once beautiful churches have been converted into  mosques; how the U.N. peacekeepers on  the island have watched for 36 years as  the Turkish Army has laid land mines  and can only sit and note what’s being  done—a peacekeeping force operating  with no mandate to stop the lawlessness.  It breaks my heart that families forcibly removed from their homes had all  of their personal and real property stolen  from  them. More heartbreaking  than anything else are  the persons  missing  since  1974, Madam Speaker,  whose  families  still grieve knowing  they will never be at peace until their  sons, brothers, husbands, and fathers  are accounted  for and whose bones  must be laid to rest.  Yet the Turkish Government still refuses to cooperate. To us, their actions  aren’t acceptable. That is why we will  continue to fight and persist in our efforts to reunify Cyprus and make the  island  whole  again  and  heal  the  wounds. A solution to the Cyprus problem has come from the Cypriots themselves and must serve first and foremost the interests of the Cypriots.  The key to a successful outcome of  the negotiating process and reunification of the island remains in Ankara,  since a solution to the Cyprus problem  cannot be reached without Turkey’s  full and constructive cooperation. Turkey must give the new Turkish Cypriot  leader the freedom to negotiate a solution. Turkey must start with the removal of its occupation troops and illegal settlers from Cyprus.  The role of the U.N. and the international community is to provide assistance and support the process. The  process should not be subjected to false  time  frames.

1354,60,2010-07-19,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President,  I rise  today, along with Senator KERRY, to  introduce comprehensive spectrum reform legislation to modernize our Nation’s radio spectrum planning, management, and coordination activities.  Taking  this  corrective  action will  allow us  to meet  the  future  telecommunications needs of all spectrum  users. For consumers, these fixes will  lead to additional choices, greater innovation, lower prices, and more reliable services.  Over the past year, there has been  growing concern about a looming radio  spectrum crisis. It is not without reason—there has been an explosion of  growth and innovation with spectrum-  based services over the past decade. In  particular, the cellular  industry has  been a prominent driver of this expansion. Currently, there are more than  276 million wireless subscribers in the  U.S.,  and American  consumers  use  more than 6.4 billion minutes of air  time per day.  While  the  foundation  for wireless  services has been voice communication, more subscribers are utilizing it  for broadband. According to the Pew  Research Center, 56 percent of adult  Americans have accessed the Internet  via a wireless device. ABI Research  forecasts there will be 150 million mobile broadband subscribers by 2014—a  2,900 percent increase from 2007. Spectrum is so important the Federal Communications  Commission, FCC,  has  made it a major focal point of its National Broadband Plan in order to meet  the growing broadband demands of consumers and businesses alike.  There are constraints however—spectrum is a finite resource—and we cannot manufacture new spectrum. Making matters worse, the government’s  current spectrum management framework is inefficient and has not kept up  with technological advancements. As  evidence,  the Government Accountability Office, in a series of reports,  concluded ‘‘the current structure and  management of spectrum use  in the  U.S. does not encourage the development and use of some spectrum efficient technologies.’’  The legislation we introduce today  fixes the fundamental deficiencies that  exist in our policy and spectrum management and promotes efforts to improve spectrum efficiency. Specifically,  the Spectrum Measurement and Policy  Reform Act tasks the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, NTIA, to perform much needed spectrum measurements to determine actual usage and  occupancy rates. This data will assist  policymakers and the public in making  informed decisions about future spectrum uses. Also required is a cost-benefit analysis of spectrum relocation opportunities to move certain incumbent  users and services to more efficient  spectrum bands. Many legacy wireless  services  could  employ  newer  technologies to provide more efficient use  of spectrum.  In addition, my bill requires greater  collaboration between  the FCC and  NTIA on spectrum policy and management related issues, implementation of  spectrum sharing and reuse programs,  as well as more market-based incentives  to promote efficient  spectrum  use. It also sets a deadline for the creation of the National Strategic Spectrum Plan, which will provide a long-  term vision for domestic spectrum use  and strategies to meet those needs.  While  the National Broadband Plan  touches on several of these areas, this  legislation will provide greater assistance in developing a 21st Century comprehensive spectrum policy necessary  to meet the future spectrum needs of  all users.  It should be noted that the Spectrum  Measurement and Policy Reform Act is  intended to complement the National  Broadband Plan and the recently announced Presidential Memorandum in  promoting more efficient use of spectrum and ensuring  that  the proper  framework is in place to meet America’s future telecommunications needs.  But it also encourages greater focus on  other areas outside the Plan or Memorandum by promoting technological innovation and more  robust  spectrum  management. For  example,  a  technology known as femtocell, that can  increase capacity by offloading wireless  traffic onto broadband wireline  networks, wasn’t mentioned once  in  the National Broadband Plan  even  though Cisco’s Virtual Network Index  indicated that at least 23 percent of  smartphone traffic could be offloaded  onto fixed wireline networks by 2014  through  femotcells  and  dual-mode  phones. These technologies and spectrum management practices such as  spectrum sharing and reuse need to be  fully explored and this legislation will  assist in doing that.  Senator KERRY and I envision this  legislation as a starting point to initiate an ongoing discussion about how  to make the best use of this national  asset and, in turn, encourage innovation and unleash opportunity. We look  forward to continuing to work with all  stakeholders as this bill advances.  Our Nation’s competitiveness, economy, and national  security demand  that we allocate the necessary attention to this policy shortcoming—it is  the only way we will be able to avert a  looming spectrum crisis and continue  to  realize  the boundless benefits of  spectrum-based services. That is why I  sincerely hope that my colleagues will  join Senator KERRY and me  in supporting this critical legislation.  (for himself  By Mr. SANDERS  and Mr. LEAHY):  S. 3612.

Goldie has made a resounding difference in  her community. For over  forty years, Goldie  was a first grade teacher in Mason City where  she worked with many disadvantaged children.  Goldie also taught Head Start, a program set  up for students who learned English as a second language. When she retired, she left as  principal at McKinley School.  She was married for the first time at the age  of 71 to Arthur Holden. Although Goldie does  not have any children of her own, she is surrounded by many loved ones: five step children, 14 step grandchildren, and 2 step great-  great grandchildren, four nieces and nephews  and eight great-great nieces and nephews.  There have been many changes that have  occurred during the past one hundred years.  Since Goldie’s birth we have revolutionized air  travel and walked on the moon. We have invented  the  television and  the  Internet. We  have fought in wars overseas, seen the rise  and fall of Soviet communism and the birth of  new democracies. Goldie has  lived  through  eighteen United States Presidents and twenty-  two Governors of  Iowa.  In her  lifetime,  the  population of the United States has more than  tripled.  I congratulate Goldie Michalek Holden  for  reaching this milestone of a birthday. I am extremely honored to represent Goldie in Congress, and I wish her happiness, health and  many more dances in her future years.  f  CELEBRATING THE 60TH WEDDING  ANNIVERSARY  OF  ARMANDO  AND BETTY RODRIGUEZ  HON. JIM COSTA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 19, 2010  ",2010
1357,67,2010-07-19,Mr. COSTA.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to Armando an Betty Rodriguez of  Fresno, California, as they celebrate their 60th  Wedding Anniversary.  Over the course of their journey of the past  60  years, Armando and Betty have demonstrated a loving devotion and enduring partnership that continues to make their marriage  a true inspiration for others.  Armando and Betty Rodriguez were both  born and  raised  in Fresno, California, and  were traditional high school sweethearts, having eyes only for each other. They attended  Edison High School and graduated  in 1947.  Three short years later, they were married and  in 1952, Armando joined the United States Air  Force, serving our Great Country  for  four  years, including a tour of duty in Korea, where  he served as a Morse Code operator.  After being discharged, Armando and Betty  resided  in Fresno, while he completed his  studies at Fresno State. Always true partners,  when Armando decided  to pursue his Juris  Doctorate degree, Betty supported both of  them by working in a number of part-time jobs.  Armando became an attorney and,  in 1972,  went on to become the first Hispanic elected  to  the Fresno County Board of Supervisors.  With Betty’s unwavering  support, Armando  helped open the judicial doors for many other  Latinos when he was appointed by then Governor Jerry Brown as a Fresno County Superior Court Judge in 1975. Armando would go  on to serve in his judicial capacity for twenty  years.  Armando Rodriguez is known to be proud of  the many ‘‘firsts’’ in his life—his first marriage  in  its 60th year;  first  lawyer  to work  for  the  California Rural Legal Assistance; first in his  family  to graduate  from college; and one of  the first to be elected as an adviser with el  Instituto de los Mexicanos en el Exterior during Mexico President Vicente Fox’s administration.  Betty Rodriguez has been equally active in  their beloved Fresno community by helping to  found  the  League  of Mexican  American  Women, and participating in the Ladies Aid to  Retarded Citizens, the League of Women Voters,  the Mexican-American Political Association, Friends of  the Library, and countless  other organizations. Despite her  seemingly  endless commitments to the community, Betty  has also been and remains, a devoted caretaker of the Rodriguez home throughout their  60 years of marriage.  Armando and Betty have become known as  local Latino icons and continue to have a tremendous impact on their families, friends and  fellow  community  members.  Furthermore,  each has been a recipient of La Medalla Ohtli,  the highest recognition that the Mexican government bestows on non-Mexican citizens and  both were honored  for  their work with  the  Mexican Consulate, with Fresno’s Sister City  Torreon and with youth from Mexico.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me today in congratulating Armando and Betty  Rodriguez on celebrating  their 60th year of  marriage, and expressing our hope that they  are blessed with many more joyous years together.  RECOGNITION OF AUGUSTA L.  BEVERLY  HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 19, 2010  ",2010
1358,67,2010-07-19,Mr. PALLONE.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in recognition of Augusta L. Beverly, a citizen  of Neptune Township, New Jersey, who on  July 25, 2010 will celebrate her 100th birthday.  As her Representative, I would like to honor  her remarkable life and her upcoming birthday.  ‘‘Gussie Louise,’’ as Mrs. Beverly is affectionately known, has been an influential member of Neptune Township since 1982. She is  an active member of the Neptune Senior Center where  she participates  in  the Forever  Young Club,  the Neptune Seniors Club, ceramics classes, and many special events. Mrs.  Beverly is one of the original members of the  center and helped create many of the center’s  activities and groups.  Mrs. Beverly was born  in 1910  in Jersey  City, New Jersey  to Otto and Katy Ludwig.  She was taken from her parents in 1915 and  separated from her two sisters, Ann and Barbara. An orphan by the age of six, Augusta  had a difficult early life. She worked on a farm  in Locktown and  then served as a maid  in  Matawan and had  little opportunity  for education. After six challenging years, young Augusta was  taken  in by  the Bennett  family  where she served as a companion for the elderly Mrs. Bennett. The family allowed young  Augusta to go to school and travel with them.  Augusta stayed with the Bennett family for 10  years.  In 1932, Mrs. Beverly met her future husband, Joseph Beverly, on the bridge next to  the Old Grist Mill in Tinton Falls. After their  marriage,  the  couple  eventually  settled  in  Eatontown where they had three children—Joseph, Norman, and Virginia. Mr. and Mrs. Beverly were happily married  for 12 years until  1945 when Mr. Beverly lost his life fighting at  the Battle of the Bulge. During the war, Mrs.  Beverly epitomized  ‘‘Rosie  the Riveter’’ and  worked  at  the Steiner’s Factory  in  Long  Branch and then worked the night shift for the  Bendix Corporation. She remains very proud  of this part of her life. After residing in Florida  and  then Pennsylvania, Mrs. Beverly moved  back to New Jersey in 1981 where she could  be near her children and grandchildren. She  has made a lasting impression on all of their  lives and now has nine great-grandchildren  who  love her very much. She  is an adored  family member and  is an  inspiration  to her  community. It is wonderful that Mrs. Beverly  will be celebrating her 100th birthday at the  place that means the most to her, the Neptune  Senior Center.  Madam Speaker, please join me in leading  this body in acknowledging the extraordinary  longevity of Augusta Beverly. She is a highly  valued citizen of the state of New Jersey, and  I am honored to commemorate her life today.

1362,3,2010-07-30,Ms. PINGREE of Maine.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1574  provides for consideration of H.R. 3534,  the Consolidated Land, Energy, and  Aquatic Resources Act of 2010, under a  structured rule; and H.R. 5851, the Offshore Oil and Gas Worker Whistleblower Protection Act of 2010, under a  closed rule.  Mr. Speaker, April 20, 2010, became a  day that will live in history as one of  the worst environmental disasters in  decades. When explosion and fire ripped  through the Deepwater Horizon, the  first priority was saving the lives of  the crew. Sadly, for 11 men it was too  late.  b0920  As the oil flowed out of the well and  as BP unsuccessfully tried to stop it,  the Nation watched, captivated by the  story and by the untold damage to gulf  coast communities. We learned a new  language, the language of the offshore  oil and gas industry. Terms like ‘‘blowout preventer’’ and ‘‘top kill’’ became  common words to the American people,  to news shows and on the House floor.  The evening news was soon filled with  pictures of oil-coated beaches, dead  pelicans,  and  fishermen who were  afraid that their way of life was slipping away.  Today, as we debate these two very  important bills, I wonder why it has  taken us, Congress, so many years to  act on the  issues we are taking up  today. The problems and challenges  facing  the management  of  our  resources, like offshore oil and gas, are  not new. In 2007, before I was elected to  this body, Chairman RAHALL recognized that we needed to reform the dysfunctional system that allowed BP to  run the Deepwater Horizon rig without  regard to the safety of their workers or  to the health of the environment. Additionally, the ideas behind the CLEAR  Act are not new. They are commonsense reforms that should have happened years ago. Maybe, if they had  happened, the workers on the Deepwater Horizon would still be alive and  the gulf would not be soaked in oil.  Mr. Speaker, we need to continue responding to the disaster in the gulf and  not forget that catastrophic environmental damage has been done. We need  to clean up and repair the gulf, to hold  BP accountable  for  its oil  spill,  to  enact stronger environmental, technological, and spill response standards, to  conserve our natural resources, and to  invest in an American clean energy future.  We must also remember that, in addition to cleaning up the mess, repairing  the damage, and cracking down on big  oil companies, we also have to get serious about ending our dependence on oil  and creating new sources of clean energy. If we had a clean energy economy, powered by wind and solar and  tidal power, we probably wouldn’t be  here having this discussion today.  Frankly, it is almost impossible for  me to imagine what would have happened if my State, the State of Maine,  had experienced a massive oil spill that  had polluted the Gulf of Maine. It is almost impossible for me to imagine the  devastation to our fishing families, to  our  tourism,  and  to  our  beautiful  coastline if millions of gallons of crude  oil were to begin washing offshore, but  it is possible for me to imagine the  same Gulf of Maine dotted with floating offshore wind turbines, wind turbines which would create good-paying  jobs and provide an endless source of  clean energy without the risk of environmental disaster.  Today, we are considering two bills  that will help address some of our most  egregious problems. This bill will provide protection for whistleblowers who  alert the government to dangerous violations of Federal law. Nobody should  be forced to choose between his or her  job and reporting unsafe conditions. It  will also improve the leasing process,  making sure all companies follow the  environmental and safety rules, and it  will ensure royalties are paid on all oil  drilled or spilled.  The CLEAR Act reorganizes the Department of the Interior to provide better management of the Nation’s energy  resources located on Federal lands and  water. The act  eliminates  conflicts  that arise when the same agency which  is in charge of the environmental reviews of leases, of issuing leases, and of  making sure the leaseholders and rig  operators are in compliance with safety and environmental laws, then turns  around  and  collects  royalties  from  these same companies.  The disaster  in the gulf makes  it  clear that we should be working to  transition our economy to a clean energy future. Investments in clean energy will help in the recovery of our  economy, and supporting renewable energy projects, like offshore wind, will  strengthen the economy and help create good  jobs that can’t be shipped  overseas.  I am glad that language is included  in the bill that will reform royalty collection. I am proud of the work that we  have done on this issue, and I thank  Chairman RAHALLfor working with me  on language included in this manager’s  amendment that will guarantee that  BP pays royalties on every drop of oil  spilled in the gulf.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010

1381,31,2010-07-30,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," I thank  the  distinguished  chairman  and  I  thank you for your constant forward  thinking on the workers of America.  Coming from the gulf region, I don’t  know if any of you have ever seen an  oil rig, particularly one as  large as  Deepwater Horizon. It is the home of  the workers. It  is their home away  from home. They eat there, they sleep  there, they work very hard there, and  they recreate there. They’re there 24  hours a day. Some may be a cook.  Someone may be a sophisticated engineer. Some may be a seaman and that  is their profession. But they’re working  there; and, therefore, they are looking  to ensure that their home away from  home is safe.  As I’ve listened to administration officials who are now all about the gulf,  I can tell you that the workers who  love their industry and love their jobs  are excited about the call for transparency and protection and increased  safety  for this  industry. They’re excited about what is going on as it relates to those who would engage  in  telling the truth. If you look at the  facts  in  some of  the hearings  that  we’ve been in, you will know that there  have been a lot of conversations with  subordinates trying to talk to supervisors. Something was awry, but no one  listened. We may have even heard that  some companies left the rig early on  because they were disturbed. Or as my  colleague mentioned, the young man  by the name of Jason who even told his  wife, ‘‘Prepare my will.’’ And so it is  important today that we stand up for  the workers.  This is a concise, articulate, whistleblower language and legislation, prohibiting an employer from discharging  or  otherwise  discriminating  against  anyone who talks to State or Federal  officials or anyone else;  telling  the  truth, saving lives. As well, it protects  them if they prepare or testify in front  of any governmental entity  talking  about unsafe conditions. Imagine how  many  lives  that could  save  in any  other industry as well.  The bill establishes a process for an  employee to appeal, giving them the  justice of the Constitution that does  not deny you benefits without due  process. Is that a problem? They live  there. This is their home. It makes an  aggrieved employee eligible  for reinstatement and back pay. Some of these  jobs are the only jobs these men or  women can secure to protect and provide for their family. We live in the  gulf. We’re shrimpers and  fishermen  and oystermen; and yes, we work in  this industry. It requires employers to  post a notice that explains employee  rights and remedies under the act.  I look forward to working with the  chairman as we look at other ways of  helping these employees who are under  stress, providing mental health services and counseling after this terrible  devastation. It may have to continue  even after BP finishes their work. But  this is the right direction to go. This  speaks well of this Congress who will  stand alongside of workers and make a  difference in their lives and the lives of  their families.  I ask you to vote for this legislation.  Today, I rise in support of H.R. 5851—the  Offshore Oil and Gas Worker Whistleblower  Protection Act. We are all well aware of the  disaster  that occurred when  the Deepwater  Horizon rig exploded, but it might have been  prevented  if we had  listened  to voices expressing concern. The men and woman who  bravely come out and expose  the  injustices  and violations that take place at their place of  work are the eyes and ears for the American  public. These people should be able to speak  out freely with no fear of unfair repercussion.  In the aftermath of the disaster, it became  clear that workers on the Deepwater Horizon  rig harbored safety concerns prior to the explosion, but chose not to vocalize them over  fear of retribution. Take, for example, Jason  Anderson, who told both his wife and father  that working conditions were not safe on the  Deepwater Horizon. According  to his wife  Shelley’s testimony before the Senate’s Commerce, Science and Transportation committee,  Jason was reluctant to talk about these concerns while on the rig and told her: ‘‘I can’t  talk about it now. The walls are too thin.’’ Another worker, Dewey Revette, reportedly had  concerns with BPs plans  to begin shutting  down the well on the day it exploded. He continued to work despite his reluctance and lost  his life hours later.  Workers on oil rigs, like the Deepwater Horizon, risk losing their jobs if they report dangerous workplace conditions. The workers performing clean-up activities on the Outer Continental Shelf  similarly  have  no  protections  against employer retaliation for raising health  and safety concerns. It is essential that workers be protected when  they  raise concerns  about unsafe working conditions, and  they  must have the right to stop working if they fear  they could be injured or killed. All workers, especially  those  in dangerous  jobs, are  in  the  best position to discover safety hazards. You  can’t have  inspectors at all  facilities at all  times—these workers are enforcement agencies’ eyes and ears when it comes to safety  compliance.  Currently, there is no Federal law that protects offshore workers for blowing the whistle  on workplace health and safety problems. This  bill extends whistleblower protections to workers regarding Outer Continental Shelf oil and  gas exploration, drilling, production, or cleanup, whose employers are engaged  in  those  activities.  Federal whistleblowers have attempted  to  expose government actions  that violate  the  law or harm  the environment  for decades.  Their disclosures have helped  the Federal  Government improve environmental protection,  nuclear safety, and national security, and their  claims have helped safeguard the welfare of  American  citizens.  Whistleblowers  have  gained credibility  in  recent years  thanks  in  great part  to organizations  like  the National  Whistleblower Center (NWC), the Liberty Coalition,  and  the Government  Accountability  Project. The NWC is a non-profit, tax exempt  educational and advocacy organization dedicated  to helping whistleblowers make  their  case  to  lawmakers and other government  leaders—a modern day safe haven for those  who are willing to put their careers on the line  to improve their government.  The bill is modeled after other modern whistleblower statutes and would prohibit an employer from discharging or otherwise discriminating against an employee who reports to the  employer, or a Federal or State Government  official that he or she reasonably believes the  employer  is violating  the Outer Continental  Shelf Lands Act  (OCSLA). The  legislation  would also protect covered employees who  prepare and/or testify about the alleged violation,  report  injuries or unsafe conditions  related  to  the offshore work,  refuse  to work  based on a good faith belief that the offshore  work could cause  injury or  impairment or a  spill, or refuse  to perform  in a manner  that  they believe violates the OCSLA.  Mr. Speaker, it is essential to protect workers with the courage to speak out when they  see  life-threatening safety-hazards or shortcuts. If we do not, we risk dire consequences.  Whistleblowers are often forced to choose between remaining silent about a dangerous or  illegal situation and  risking  their careers by  telling the truth. We must reverse this unacceptable and unsustainable choice by passing  this legislation.  b1300  ",2010

It is important that it will also clarify and improve  liability  laws  thanks  to ",2010
1387,38,2010-07-30,Mr.  OBERSTAR.,"  Under the current law, BP is responsible for the removal costs of the spill.  They are liable only for $75 million,  however, for economic and natural resource damages. For a spill of this  magnitude, a limit as low as $75 million is laughable.  After the spill began, I led 85 of my  colleagues in introducing the Big Oil  Bailout Prevention Act, which would  raise the liability cap now and retroactively. Of course the polluters should  pay. The escrow account created by the  administration and BP will have a  short-term fix, but the CLEAR Act will  ensure that BP is legally liable for all  economic and natural resource damages  it has caused. The public will  know the buck stops with the oil companies, that the costs will not spill  over to taxpayers.  I urge my colleagues to support this.  The CHAIR. The Committee will rise  informally.  The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. STUPAK) assumed the chair.  f  ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED  Ms. Lorraine C.

1390,38,2010-07-30,Mr. COBLE.," I want to thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill is a horrific tragedy, as we  all know; and I want to make certain  the  responsible parties are held accountable. I also want to ensure that  we understand what went wrong to prevent future tragedies. Although I support domestic energy exploration, we  need legislation that is focused and implements  lessons  learned,  and  the  CLEAR Act, in my opinion, does not  meet these principles.  Specifically, it adds yet another task  to the Coast Guard mission without  providing the tools necessary to get  the job done. I firmly believe the Coast  Guard can do its part, but it is our responsibility to make sure that they  have the personnel, command structure, and resources to meet its multifaceted mission.  The bill also diminishes intellectual  property rights. Its mandatory publication  requirements  for  chemical  dispersants will eviscerate a number of  trade secrets and undermine competitiveness in the chemical industry, it  seems to me. It makes no sense to discard trade secrets in the name of protecting the public when the EPA already has such authority and jurisdiction to test, inspect, and approve these  products.  Finally, this legislation will create  new impediments for tapping into our  domestic energy supply, make us more  reliant upon foreign sources of energy,  and compromise jobs.  Mr. Chairman, I reiterate, we must  address this catastrophe. The CLEAR  Act, however, is the wrong approach  for the gulf coast, our economy, and  my constituents’ wallets.  I thank the gentleman from Florida  again for yielding.  ",2010

ROBERTMENENDEZ,  U.S. Senator, Senate Hart Office Building,  Washington, DC.  DEARSENATORMENENDEZ: Lockton Companies is the largest privately owned insurance  broker in the world, and through Lockton  Marine & Energy in Houston, we service the  insurance needs of many energy companies  operating in the Gulf of Mexico. Specifically,  we specialize in the small to midsize independent exploration and production companies that are very active in drilling wells in  the shallow and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In  fact, two of our clients are in the top 10 largest lease holders and/or most active drillers  in the Gulf of Mexico; however, they are relatively small companies. Exploration and  production companies are supported by thousands of workers all along the Gulf Coast  from their own employees to many small to  midsized service companies’ employees. The  Bureau of Labor and Statistics reported that  there were well over 100,000 petroleum-related workers and greater than $12 billion in  total wages earned in the Gulf Coast Region  alone.  Insurance is critical to our clients and all  small to midsized energy companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. All of the companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico essentially go to the same insurance market to  purchase their liability insurance coverage.  The  insurance market  for offshore operations is relatively small, and prior to the  Macondo well  incident, we estimated the  total market capacity for third-party pollution liability to be $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion.  Following the Macondo well event, we estimate the capacity has dropped to $1 billion  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:47 Nov 05, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\H30JY0.REC H30JY0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010

Here we have got all of these amendments lumped into one so we can’t debate them, and we can’t take one thing  out. That’s not right. And when I heard  my friend from West Virginia saying,  There they go again, apologizing for  BP, I will challenge anybody to find  any comment by anybody on this side  of the aisle in this debate today who  has apologized for, to, or about BP.  Some of us think they ought to be  strung up when we find out who’s most  responsible.  So I know my friend from West Virginia would never  intentionally misrepresent the facts, but whoever prepared that statement that he read sure  did.  ",2010

1396,80,2010-07-30,Mr. BOYD.," I thank Chairman RAHALL  for offering this manager’s amendment  and giving me time to speak.  Mr. Chairman,  in  this manager’s  amendment, there’s a provision that is  very important to the folks in the district I represent in northwest Florida.  Ladies and gentlemen, our local economy has been significantly impacted  by the BP oil spill. Many of our people  are out of work as a result of this man-  made disaster that they had no hand in  creating. Fortunately, we have been  successful  in setting up the BP Oil  Spill  Victims  Compensation  Fund  which will help speed relief to the victims of this tragedy and help respond  to one of  the gulf coast’s greatest  needs.  This amendment that is being offered  by Chairman RAHALLwill ensure that  gulf residents will have the right of  first refusal for the job opportunities  processing the claims filed for the oil  spill.  b1500  It emphasizes the importance of gulf  residents serving their neighbors by  processing these claims and ensuring  that they receive the consideration for  the ramifications of this spill.  I have already spoken with Mr. Ken  Feinberg, the administrator of the BP  Deepwater  Horizon  Victims  Fund,  about  employing  local  residents  to  process claims, and he agrees with me  that there is no one better suited to  perform this essential task. In fact, I  told him that in north Florida we have  a ready and willing workforce ready to  go. These workers, who unfortunately  are  looking  for work as a result of  their corporations’ closing their facility, have the skill and the talent that  directly align with the skills needed to  process oil spill claims. They should be  considered first in line to beef up the  newly established claims fund and ensure a high quality response for fellow  gulf coast residents.  I recommend a  ‘‘yes’’ vote on the  chairman’s manager’s amendment.  ",2010

1398,80,2010-07-30,Mr. RAHALL., I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman  from California  (Mr.  FARR).  ,2010
1399,80,2010-07-30,Mr. FARR.," Thank you, Chairman RAHALL, for yielding.  Mother Earth, wake up. Today’s the  day that Congress  is going to show  some leadership. Leadership is about  getting  results. And  last week,  the  President of the United States enacted,  by Executive  order,  a  government  oceans plan, a governance plan to look  at our oceans in totality. Today, Congress is going to enact the ability to  govern the oceans and to think about  the totality of how this Earth survives  with 73 percent of the Earth being covered by oceans.  Too bad that so many people get up  and talk about, in a crisis, oh, if it was  just a little bit better we could support  half the bill, we could support a little  bit of this, something’s wrong. That’s  not leadership. Leadership’s about getting results. And the only way you get  results today is to vote ‘‘aye.’’ It solves  a lot of problems. Voting ‘‘no’’ solves  nothing. Nothing. The  planet  can’t  stand nothing.  For too long there has not been leadership. That side is the side that gave  us James Watt,  ‘‘Drill, baby drill,’’  gave us Richard Pombo, chair of the  Resources Committee, the Darth Vader  of environmental legislation. Nothing  ever came out of that committee. And  today what do they want? We don’t  want this bill because it’s not perfect.  Ladies and gentlemen, today’s the  day that we respect Mother Earth and  give her a chance to help our dying  oceans stop dying. And the only way to  do that is to vote ‘‘aye.’’  ",2010
1400,80,2010-07-30,Mr. RAHALL.," Madam Chair, I yield  the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MARKEY), who has been so instrumental in  this legislation as well on this issue.  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. JACKSONLEE  of Texas). The gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 2 minutes.  ",2010
1401,80,2010-07-30,Mr. MARKEY of Massachusetts.,"  I  thank Mr. RAHALL for his great leadership working with Chairman WAXMAN  and Chairman STUPAKand I on the Energy and Commerce Committee to include new safety procedures.  This bill takes lessons learned and  will turn them into laws. That’s what  we need to do. Included in this bill is a  provision which is going to collect $53  billion  from the oil  industry, where  they are drilling in American waters  without paying any royalties to the  American people. And in this bill we  reclaim those $53 billion from the oil  companies, and we will reduce the Federal deficit by $53 billion. That’s in this  bill. And it is going to be the dues  which the oil companies should be paying to the American people for using  American waters.  At $80 a barrel, for the American people to be subsidizing Big Oil to drill, it  would be like subsidizing a fish to swim  or a bird to fly, to subsidize the oil industry to drill for oil at $80 a barrel.  You just don’t have to do it.  So with this bill we cut the deficit  and we stop Big Oil from cutting corners on safety. This is BP’s spill, but it  is America’s ocean. That’s what this  bill is all about. That’s what this vote  is on today. Are we going to reclaim  the oceans of America so that they are  not polluted, so that BP and the oil  companies pay the royalties that they  owe to our people and not avoid them,  that we reduce the Federal deficit and  we make sure that we never again see  a day where the American people for  100 days have to watch oil flow into our  oceans?  Vote ‘‘aye’’ on this very important  legislation.  ",2010

1405,87,2010-07-30,Mr. OBERSTAR.," The gentleman from  Washington is mistaken in his understanding or his reading of the amendment that I offer.  It’s an amendment to OPA. It is not  an amendment to the dollar amounts  and does not reference dollar amounts.  Under OPA, of which I was a coauthor  in 1990, quote, the State and local officials designated under this subsection  shall develop and implement a plan for  the  restoration,  rehabilitation,  replacement or acquisition of the equivalent of  the natural  resources under  their trusteeship.  The language of OPA does not clearly  enough refer to the level of replacement resources that may be damaged.  What we do with this language is clarify  the ability  to  restore  those  resources that have been damaged with  an equivalent resource. That’s all it  does. It does not have a dollar amount  in it.  I yield to the gentleman if he has a  question.  ",2010
1406,87,2010-07-30,Mr. HASTINGS  of Washington.,"  thank the gentleman for yielding.  In due  respect, you acknowledged  that this could be used to buy additional land with a damage fund, is that  correct?  ",2010
1407,87,2010-07-30,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Well, it is to replace  what has been destroyed. It’s really  just clarifying what is already available under OPA, but making it clear  that the funds can be used for those resources  that have been damaged  so  badly they can’t be restored.  ",2010
1408,87,2010-07-30,Mr. HASTINGS of Washington.," Yes,  it clarifies, but it adds a very important part. It allows land acquisition.  b1550  ",2010
1409,87,2010-07-30,Mr.  OBERSTAR.,"  Reclaiming my  time, it does not add. That is current  law. That is available under OPA.  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.  ",2010
1410,87,2010-07-30,Mr. HASTINGS of Washington.," Mr.  Chairman, may I  inquire as to how  much time I have remaining?  The CHAIR. The gentleman has 21⁄2  minutes remaining.  ",2010
1411,87,2010-07-30,Mr. HASTINGS of Washington.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself the balance of  my time.  I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota to finish his remark.  ",2010
1412,87,2010-07-30,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Again, the acquisition of replacement land is available  and authorized under OPA 90. What  this amendment does is clarify that in  that replacement you can replace that  part of the ecosystem that has been irresponsibly damaged with better land.  It doesn’t add new acquisition authority.  ",2010
1413,87,2010-07-30,Mr. HASTINGS of Washington.," Reclaiming my time,  I appreciate the  gentleman’s trying to clarify that.  I have to say, in my reading of this,  that this will lend itself to more acquisition, and I will simply say this, reading the language here, ‘‘provides a substantially greater likelihood of improving the resilience of whatever is lost.’’  Now, having said that, let me put this  analogous to at least my part of the  country as it relates to refuges. If a  refuge burns in my area and it might  damage something, the way I envision  the interpretation of this is the refuge  manager can say, boy, this is irreparably lost and there might be some  private land right next door, I think I  will buy that private land.  Now, in due respect, that is the way  I interpret it. Listen, I hope I’m wrong  and I hope you’re right, but I have a  very strong wariness of any attempt—  especially in a bill, I say to my friend,  the Transportation  chairman,  especially when we are authorizing $30 billion of land acquisition. Surely, surely  there must be a way to massage that to  satisfy at least what the gentleman’s  amendment purports to do. But I have  to say, for this Member, I am always  weary when I see we are taking another fund and using that to acquire  even an extension of Federal lands.  ",2010
1414,87,2010-07-30,Mr. OBERSTAR., Will the gentleman  yield?  ,2010
1415,87,2010-07-30,Mr. HASTINGS  of Washington.,  I  yield  to  the  gentleman  from Minnesota.  ,2010
1416,87,2010-07-30,Mr. OBERSTAR.,"  gentleman yielding.  I, too, have natural resources—national forests, national parks, wildlife  refuges. When fire, as it does regularly,  strikes the national forest, that land  regenerates. The oil destroys. It likely  cannot be  restored by  itself or by  human intervention, but replacing it  with other land—and the language is  tailored very narrowly limited to that  purpose of replacing what cannot be replaced.

The text of the amendment is as follows:  At the end of title VII add the following  new section:  SEC. ll. EXTENSION OF LIABILITY TO PERSONS  HAVING OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN  RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.  (a) DEFINITION OFRESPONSIBLEPARTY.—  Section 1001(32) of the Oil Pollution Act of  1990 (33 U.S.C. 2701(32)) is amended by adding  at the end the following:  ‘‘(G) PERSONHAVINGOWNERSHIPINTEREST.—  Any person, other than an individual, having  an ownership interest (directly or indirectly)  in any entity described in any of subparagraphs (A) through (F) of more than 25 percent, in the aggregate, of the total ownership  interests in such entity, if the assets of such  entity are  insufficient to pay the claims  owed by such entity as a responsible party  under this Act.’’.  (b)  DATE.—The  amendment  made by this section shall apply to an incident occurring on or after January 1, 2010.  EFFECTIVE The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1574, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Virginia.  ",2010
1420,87,2010-07-30,Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia.," I want  to thank Chairman RAHALLand Chairman OBERSTAR, in particular, for their  hard work on this bill and for their collaboration on this amendment.  I am  joined by Congressman HOLT  and Congressman WELCH, who co-introduced this amendment to ensure that  oil companies cannot shift oil cleanup  costs onto taxpayers by allowing subsidiary companies to go bankrupt.  Under current  law,  if an oil  subsidiary is responsible for a spill, it can  declare bankruptcy and not sell its assets, in which case the parent company  would not inherit cleanup liabilities. A  profit-maximizing  parent  company  would allow a subsidiary to go bankrupt and not sell liabilities if the value  of cleanup and liability costs exceed  the value of the subsidiary’s assets.  This is a realistic scenario given the  high cost of the cleanup of oil spills.  Even a well capitalized company worth  several billions could be responsible for  an oil spill costing tens of billions. The  Exxon Valdez spill cost more than $2  billion to clean up, and that was just  10.9 million gallons of oil. The Deepwater Horizon spill already has cost $3  billion, with total cleanup cost in the  tens of  billions  at  the  very  least.  Through this act, oil companies could  be responsible for much greater costs.  The fishing industry in the gulf is  worth $5.5 billion annually. Losing 50  percent of western Florida’s tourism  would cost that State $10 billion. If  Congress eliminates the private liability cap under OPA, then an oil company responsible for a spill could be  liable for tens of billions to reimburse  property owners and workers for lost  property and wages.  Given the extraordinarily high cleanup and private  liability costs of oil  spills, we must close this loophole. Our  amendment would ensure that BP and  other oil companies are not able to escape  their  cleanup  responsibilities.  Without passage of this amendment,  BP and other oil companies could avoid  paying for cleanup costs entirely.  I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment.

1434,115,2010-07-30,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, soon I  am going to ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 5900. First, I want to  make a couple of comments.  H.R. 5900 is a piece of legislation sent  to us by the House of Representatives  that will extend for 2 months the FAA  reauthorization act. I regret that we  have another extension. It is extension  after extension after extension. It is so  symbolic of the way this place works  these days.  The reason there is an urgency to get  the FAA reauthorization act done is  that  it  includes so many significant  issues that deal with the safety of the  air traveling public, with the airport  improvement  funds, with substantial  investments in air traffic control modernization—a wide range of issues that  are very important. Despite the fact  that  everybody understands  the urgency, the FAA reauthorization bill is  stuck in the morass of difficulties that  now afflict the Senate and House these  days. It is very difficult to get anything done.  The question will be, Will we now—  extending this for 2 more months—at  the end of this year adjourn sine die  once again without having approved an  FAA reauthorization bill?  The Europeans are moving very aggressively on air traffic control modernization. I have met with Europeans  on these issues. We should be doing the  same, and yet it is held hostage by not  passing an FAA reauthorization bill.  The issue of safety is another very  important issue. I have held hearing  after hearing on the issue of safety.  The question is, Do we have one standard of safety on airplanes these days as  between major carriers and regional  carriers? When you step onto an airplane that  is 32-passenger or 50-passenger—a regional carrier—do you have  the same level of safety as is applied  with respect to the crew, the training,  and all the other issues as exists with  the major carriers? The law requires  that; FAA requires that.  Does it exist? Well, we explored in  great detail the crash of Colgan Air.  We saw, with respect to Colgan Air,  one  flight on one night—one  tragic  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

Celia Froehlig, Carol Phillips,  Sherytha Scaife, Elizabeth Thiels, Ruth Bland  White  and  Jo Walker  Meador  Lifetime  Achievement Award  recipient Frances Williams Preston will be honored at the 8th annual event. ‘‘In the long run, you make your  own  luck—good, bad, or  indifferent.’’ Loretta  Lynn’s words many  triumphs ago speak still  for the women of today’s victories who blaze  the musical trail of their own luck.  Nashville’s music  industry has a dazzled  history of women pioneers. Mother Maybelle  Carter created the Carter scratch. Kitty Wells  was the first female artist to have her own LP.  Patsy Cline paved the way for women to sell  records as well as men. And Loretta Lynn was  the first woman in country music to have 50  Top 10 hits. Paving the way for Dolly Parton’s  songwriting strengths, Tammy Wynette’s sultry  vocals, and Reba McEntire’s awarded success, the women on whose shoulders today’s  stars stand are a present part of Nashville’s  legacy.  The call of women to the varying notes of  the music industry is just as strong today as  when Sarah  ‘‘Minnie Pearl’’ Cannon  first  graced the Grand Old Opry in 1942. Women  have come a long way in the music business,  and Nashville continues to celebrate their success  in paving  the way  for  tomorrow’s high  notes. Founded  in 1991, Source began  the  work to unify women executives and professionals that work and succeed in all facets of  Nashville’s music industry.  With backgrounds as singers, songwriters,  pianists,  producers,  publishers,  mothers,  wives, sisters, and performers, the honored at  the 2010 Source Awards are tied together by  the  love of music and  the stories Nashville  tells  in  the notes she plays.  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the accomplishments, vision, and success of the women  of Nashville’s music industry.

It was recently announced that the USA Diving and the United States Olympic Committee  selected Federal Way to hold the 2012 U.S.  Olympic Diving Trials. This prestigious event  will be made possible through the partnership  with the Seattle Sports Commission, the City  of Federal Way, and King County Parks and  Recreation with USA Diving and  the United  States Olympic Committee. Federal Way also  hosted the diving trials in 2000, in advance of  the Summer Olympic Games held in Sydney,  Australia.  The 2012 U.S. Olympic Diving Trials will  highlight our country’s 100 best divers as they  compete  to advance  to  the 2012 Summer  Olympic Games  in London, England. Taking  place from June 18 to 24, 2012, the trials will  be broadcast by NBC from the Weyerhaeuser  King County Athletic Center, a world-class facility that was first constructed for the swimming and diving events of the 1990 Goodwill  Games and hosts more than 50 competitions  annually.  In addition to bringing many of our nation’s  top athletes  together  in preparation  for  the  2012 Summer Games,  the Diving Trials are  also expected  to bring  increased  tourism  to  the region and will spotlight the City of Federal  Way and the greater Puget Sound Region. In  total, USA Diving expects  the U.S. Olympic  Diving Trials to have an economic impact of  $3.5 million on the Federal Way area.  Madam Speaker, please  join me  in congratulating  the City of Federal Way, Washington on this impressive opportunity, and to  wish our athletes the best as they prepare for  this competition.  f  IN  TRIBUTE  TO  THE  BREEZY  POINT  COOPERATIVE  CELEBRATING THEIR  50TH ANNIVERSARY  HON.

1439,136,2010-07-30,Mr. WEINER.," Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize  the Breezy Point Cooperative  for 50  years of service to the Breezy Point, Roxbury  and Rockaway Point communities, which are  located  on  the  Rockaway  peninsula  in  Queens, New York, the most populous barrier  island in the country.  Though these beachside communities were  founded in the late 19th century, it wasn’t until  1960 that residents banded together to save  the peninsula  from being sold out  to developers. On November 17 of  that year,  the  Breezy Point Cooperative was organized and  a  few months  later purchased  the  land  that  currently comprises Breezy Point. Members of  the community sometimes refer to it as ‘‘Cois  Farraige’’, Gaelic for ‘‘By the Sea.’’  The Cooperative fought tirelessly with and  alongside the federal government and the National Park Service  to preserve  the breathtaking and resplendent scenes of nature that  surrounded  the area, and  the Gateway National Recreation area was developed around  Breezy Point, where Gateway continues to be  one of the greatest treasures Queens County  has to offer.  There are several civic groups  in Breezy  that also deserve recognition at  the  time of  this anniversary. The Roxbury People’s Association, headed by Katherine Sebale, the Point  Breeze Association, headed by Christopher  Stokes, and the Rockaway Point Association,  headed by Tom MacLellan, are all organizations that work tirelessly to better their community and strengthen the heart and soul of  Breezy Point.  The story of the Breezy Point Cooperative is  a story of a community  that  relies on  the  strength of  its  leaders and citizens, and  I  would like to memorialize this great milestone  of 50  years of  service and dedication  to  bettering the community and its neighbors. I  wish the residents of Breezy, as well as the  General Manager of  the cooperative, Arthur  Lighthall, the other members of the cooperative’s management Denise Neibel, Patricia  Kirby, Dennis Dier, Edward Ammirati, and the  Board of Directors of the cooperative, Joseph  Lynch,  Kerry  Schreiner-Cardaio,  Barney  Cassidy, George Donley, Brendan Gallagher,  Martin Ingram, Joseph Kerrigan, Robert Pierson, Matthew Regan, Arthur J. Smith, Thomas  Sullivan, Donatina Trotter, John Tully, Thomas  Wipf and Robert Lee, congratulations on this  important milestone  and wish  them many  happy returns on this happy occasion.  f  TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF  SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS  SPEECHOF  HON.

1440,136,2010-07-30,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  express strong support for House Resolution  5849, which  extends  temporary  programs  under the Small Business Act and the Small  Business Investment Act of 1958.  It is a well known fact that small businesses  drive our economy  in a significant way and  serve as a stimulator for job creation and economic development.

He will be honored  by the National Funeral Directors and Mortician’s Association during its 2010 convention  in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Mr. Range is the  third  Floridian  nominated  for  the  award,  named after Mr. Miller, the first NFDMA executive director. It is because of his outstanding  service and commitment that he undoubtedly  deserves this great honor for his many years  of devotion to the South Florida community.  ‘‘He’s had a significant  role  in supporting  colleagues and in serving the community in a  comparable manner,’’  said Henry  Postell,  president of the Florida Mortician Association.  ‘‘Professionalism  is  there  regardless of  the  families’ financial situation.’’  Mr. Range is the current owner of Range  Funeral Homes of Greater Miami, founded in  1953. He has been in the funeral industry as  a licensed funeral director and embalmer for  over 50 years. He obtained his license in 1965  after matriculating at the New England Institute of Anatomy following the death of his father and  founder of Range Funeral Homes,  Oscar L. Range, Sr., in 1960.  After obtaining his  license, Mr. Range returned to Miami to partner with ‘‘my mentor,  my guide, my inspiration, my mom,’’ M. Athalie  Range,  in a  relationship  that would  last 45  years in the family-owned funeral home. After  his mother’s death in 2006, Mr. Range continued his parents’  legacy as  the principal of  Range Funeral Homes.  A member of the Epsilon Nu Delta Mortuary  Fraternity, Mr. Range also serves on the advisory board of the Miami-Dade College Department of Funeral Service Education. An active  member in a host of other professional organizations, Mr. Range was most recently recognized by his peers as  the  ‘‘Mortician of  the  Year’’ in 2006 by both the First Regional District of Florida and the State of Florida Mortician’s Association. He has done an abundant  of fundraising work for mortuary science scholarships and career-related organizations, such  as 100 Black Women in Funeral Service.  Madam Speaker, Mr. N. Patrick Range, Sr.  is an inspiration not only to the South Florida  community, but to the nation at large. Morticians provide a service like no other. The care  and dedication you provide our loved ones before  their homegoing  services  stay  in our  hearts and minds forever. Please join me in  applauding the achievements of Mr. Range.  f  EXPLANATION  REGARDING  SUBMISSION  OF AMENDMENTS  TO  COMMITTEES  HON.

JIM COOPER  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 30, 2010  ",2010
1445,143,2010-07-30,Mr. COOPER.," Madam Speaker,  to a boy  from Louisiana, the building blocks of life are  food,  faith, and a healthy dose of Southern  hospitality. Joseph Hamilton, grew up to learn  that our world is not so simple.  By January 2010 Hamilton had played a  crucial  role  in an astounding discovery. He  helped find something that no one knew existed. His work was critical in forming a multinational research team, and carrying out the  discovery of Element 117—Ununseptium—the  newest addition to the Periodic Table of Elements.  Hamilton’s life started like that of any southern boy. Born in the humble town of Ferriday,  Louisiana, he stayed  true  to his Baptist upbringing. He attended Christian Mississippi  College, where God’s calling led him to be a  physicist. Hamilton then took his studies to Indiana University, where he studied nuclear  physics and  the elements. Their  tiny atoms  and their nuclei are invisible except to a select  group of scientists with very advanced equipment. For everyone outside  this elite group,  the existence of atoms and  their nuclei  is  purely a matter of faith. The only way to observe individual atoms of elements is through  their impact on the world.  A skeptic may say  that Christianity and  physics, the two most important parts of Hamilton’s  life, cannot coexist, but Hamilton disagrees. He has pursued his passion without  abandoning his beliefs, and has found that the  two go gracefully hand in hand. As a professor  at Vanderbilt University  in Nashville, Tennessee, he and his wife have coauthored  more than twenty papers on the harmony of  physics and religion.  Professor Hamilton has dedicated himself to  the growth of his students. Recognizing that  they will soon  take his place  in  research,  Hamilton has supervised over 60 PhD dissertations and over 100 post-doctoral fellows  at Vanderbilt. He includes his students in almost everything he does. One of his few regrets in his storied career is that he did not intimately involve his students in the discovery  of Element 117.  Hamilton’s  research  career at Vanderbilt  over  the  last  fifty-two years has  taken him  around the world. Russia, China, Sweden, and  Germany have been but a few stops on his  journeys. The  creation of Element 117  in  Dubna, Russia, just north of Moscow, was the  result of a multinational project that Hamilton  helped create. He believes that scientific discovery is a global effort, not a local one. Collaboration  is key because science  is one of  the  few  things  that unite us all  in peaceful  ways. Scientific principles apply around  the  world, regardless of race, creed, and nationality.  The first collaborative project that Hamilton  initiated, the University Isotope Separator, has  been a key operation at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory  for more  than  forty years.  This began as a collaboration of 11 Southeastern universities, ORNL and  the State of  Tennessee. Hamilton is also a founder of the  Joint Institute for Heavy Ion Research, a cooperation of Vanderbilt, the University of Tennessee, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  This Institute has become a world-class scientific  resource.  Moreover,  this  Institute  opened doors  that helped  transform ORNL  through the development of three major new  joint institutes.  By January 2010, Hamilton’s critical role in  a joint Russian-American project came to fruition in the creation of six atoms of Element  117. While this new radioactive element has a  half-life of only 78 milliseconds faster than the  blink of an eye—its discovery points towards a  fascinating possibility.  Its half-life  is  longer  than  that of other recently discovered super  heavy elements, and suggests that we may be  on the path towards finding new, more stable,  super heavy elements.  Hamilton and his coworkers’ discovery will  be forever emblazoned on the walls of chemistry and physics labs worldwide as the newest member of the Periodic Table of Elements.  Generations of scientists will discover Element  117’s properties, but no matter what is learned  about Element 117, this Southern gentleman  will always know that his work added to the  building blocks of our world.  f  CONGRATULATING  MAJOR  GENERAL ROBERT WILLIAMS ON HIS  RETIREMENT  HON.

1447,150,2010-07-30,Mr. CAPUANO.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize the ‘‘100,000 Homes Campaign’’, an effort to address homelessness in  America by providing permanent shelter  for  100,000 homeless persons over the next three  years. In Boston, the Pine Street Inn, a nonprofit organization in my district that has been  fighting homelessness  for over 40 years,  is  acting as  the  lead  local agency  for  this national initiative. Rosanne Haggerty, President  and Founder of the New York based nonprofit  Common Ground, launched the campaign in  Washington, D.C. on July 12th at the Annual  Conference of  the National Alliance  to End  Homelessness. So  far 34 communities have  signed on to participate. In just the short time  since the campaign’s start, over 5,000 people  nationwide have received housing assistance.  The Pine Street Inn was founded in 1969  and provides low-cost permanent housing for  homeless  individuals. The organization also  assists over 10,000 homeless individuals annually by offering emergency shelter, food and  health care  related services. Mental health  and  substance abuse  counseling are also  available through the Pine Street Inn.  Too many Americans are struggling with  homelessness and this initiative will help reduce the ranks of the homeless throughout the  country. I commend the Pine Street Inn and  Common Ground for their tireless efforts and  their compassion. Their combined work and  the efforts of so many dedicated organizations  throughout  the country will help make  the  ‘‘100,000 Homes Campaign’’ a success.  f  WHERE ARE THE JOBS?  HON.

1448,150,2010-07-30,Mr. HENSARLING.," Madam Speaker,  the  American people want to know: where are the  jobs?  I do not understand why the Obama Administration and Congressional Democrats have  pursued jobs-killing policies such as a government take-over of health care, a national energy  tax, a  financial  regulatory bill  that enshrines us as a bailout nation; and are doing  nothing  to stop  the  largest  tax  increase  in  American history scheduled for the end of this  year. These policies have injected uncertainty  into the economy, causing nearly $2 trillion in  private capital to stay on the sidelines.  We just learned this morning that in the 2nd  quarter this year, GDP grew at 2.4%. While  this is better than no growth, it is down from  the 3.7% in the first quarter. This recovery defies conventional wisdom, which is the deeper  the recession, the stronger the recovery.  The Obama Administration and Washington  Democrats have declared  their stimulus bill  and other economic policies a success. However,  the American people have declared  them a failure.  f  RECOGNIZING  CLENET  INTERNATIONAL, LLC FOR RECEIVING  THE MINORITY GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY  FIRM  OF  THE  YEAR  AWARD  HON. PETER J.

JOHN S. TANNER  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 30, 2010  ",2010
1450,150,2010-07-30,Mr. TANNER.," Madam Speaker,  from May  28–June 3, I led a House delegation to NATO  Parliamentary Assembly (NATO PA) meetings  in Riga, Latvia, and  to additional bilateral  meetings in Podgorica, Montenegro. The U.S.  delegation to the NATO PA had a highly successful trip during which we examined a range  of political, economic, and security issues currently confronting  the Alliance, as well as  NATO and U.S. policy in Montenegro and the  Western Balkans.  The NATO Parliamentary Assembly consists  of members of parliament from the 28 NATO  states, as well as members of parliament from  candidate state Macedonia (or Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM), and  other associated states such as Russia, Georgia, and Ukraine. I currently have the honor of  serving as President of the Assembly. In this  capacity, I preside over meetings during which  delegates discuss and debate a  range of  issues of  importance  to  the Alliance. During  the NATO PA’s two annual plenary sessions,  delegates also have the opportunity to listen to  presentations by specialists on NATO affairs  and to offer guidance to NATO leadership in  Brussels. An additional element of the meetings is the opportunity to meet and develop relationships with members of parliament who  play important foreign policy roles in their own  countries. These  responsibilities can  include  setting defense budgets and determining the  operational  restrictions placed on deployed  forces. Some  of  the  acquaintances made  through the NATO PA can last the duration of  a career, and are invaluable for gaining insight  into developments in allied states.  Discussions during the NATO PA’s annual  spring meeting focused on the key issues currently facing the Alliance. These include: the  drafting of a new Strategic Concept for NATO;  NATO’s ongoing stabilization mission  in Afghanistan; NATO’s  evolving  relations with  Russia; and the effects of the global economic  downturn on national security and allied commitments to NATO. More specific issues such  as  the Alliance’s nuclear weapons posture,  missile defense, and emerging security challenges such as piracy and cyber and energy  security were also discussed by the delegates.  At NATO’s 60th anniversary summit in April  2009,  the  leaders of NATO’s 28 member  states  tasked  the NATO Secretary General  with producing a new Strategic Concept  for  the Alliance. The  re-writing of  the Strategic  Concept, which was last updated in 1999, offers NATO a chance to lay out a clarified vision of its role in the 21st century security environment. Heads of state  from  the NATO  member states are expected to approve a new  Strategic Concept at  their November 2010  summit  in Lisbon.  In April 2010, NATO PA  representatives  presented NATO Secretary  General Anders Fogh Rasmussen with the Assembly’s recommendations for a new Strategic  Concept. There is broad agreement within the  NATO PA  that  the new Strategic Concept  should re-affirm NATO’s primary role as a military alliance devoted to ensuring the collective  defense and security of its members. In this  regard, Article 5 of NATO’s founding North Atlantic Treaty—which states that an attack on  one is an attack on all—remains NATO’s core  principle. Our delegation emphasized  that  in  the face of new and emerging security challenges,  the Alliance must also continue  to  broaden  the  traditional Cold War concept of  collective defense  to  include security  threats  such as terrorism, proliferation of weapons of  mass destruction, cyber-security, and energy  security. In this regard, territorial defense can  no longer be separated from ‘‘out-of-area’’ security concerns. Members of our delegation  also highlighted the importance of developing  and maintaining the capabilities necessary to  achieve NATO’s stated objectives.  The key issue facing the Alliance continues  to be NATO’s effort to bring security and stability  to Afghanistan.

Frick, President and Chief  Executive Officer of Independence Blue Cross,  on  receiving  the National Multiple Sclerosis  Society’s Hope Award. Mr. Frick’s work to improve Philadelphia exemplifies his upstanding  character and worthiness of  receiving  the  Hope Award.  A graduate of the University of Notre Dame  and Loyola College, Mr. Frick has a long and  impressive career of working for the people of  Philadelphia. For  several  years, Mr. Frick  worked  at Philadelphia Newspapers  Incorporated, the company that publishes the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Daily News, eventually being promoted to the Vice President of  Human Resources. Currently, Mr. Frick  is  Chairman of the Board of Directors for Leadership Incorporated, a program preparing Philadelphia leaders like Mr. Frick himself, for influential  roles  in  the community. He also has  served on  the Board of Directors  for Blue  Cross Blue Shield Association,  the Greater  Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, LaSalle  University, the Penjerdel Council, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and  the Philadelphia Workforce Investment Board.  On October 22nd, Mr. Frick will be acknowledged by more  than 600 attendees at  the  Greater Delaware Valley Chapter of the National MS Society’s Reception in Philadelphia.  The Hope Award is the National Multiple Sclerosis Society’s highest honor and is only bestowed upon an individual who has taken the  initiative to affect the community through philanthropic service and community  leadership.  Mr. Frick’s philanthropic work has benefitted  more than 13,000 people in the Greater Delaware Valley who live with MS, and he is greatly deserving of this honor.  Mr. Frick’s impressive career proves a long-  standing commitment to the people of Philadelphia. Madam Speaker, I ask that you and  my other distinguished colleagues join me in  honoring my  friend, Joseph A.

1452,157,2010-07-30,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Madam Speaker, 150  years ago, four women from Somerset, Ohio  arrived in Nashville, Tennessee to establish an  Academy  for  the higher education of young  women  in  the Diocese of Nashville. Run by  the Congregation of St. Cecilia, Tennessee’s  only Motherhouse of Dominican Sisters, St.  Cecilia’s Academy boasts 2,500 alumnae from  the oldest continuously operated school  in  Nashville.  I rise  today with gratitude  for  the  hard work and dedication by the Sisters of St.  Cecilia,  and  the  faculty  and  staff  of St.  Cecilia’s Academy.  St. Cecilia’s Academy,  the only all-girls,  Catholic high school in Middle Tennessee, first  opened its doors in October of 1860 in North  Nashville. Borrowing  lanterns  from  local  rail  yards to light the grounds, the first commencement exercises were held  in June of 1862.

1454,164,2010-07-30,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  today  to express my support  for H.R.  5143, the National Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2010.  I want  to commend Representative DELAHUNT for his  leadership on  this legislation and dedication to our nation’s  criminal justice system.  H.R. 5143 establishes the National Criminal  Justice Commission and directs that commission to review all areas of the criminal justice  system,  including costs, practices, and policies. It also directs the commission to make  findings upon their review and recommendations  for changes  to prevent, deter, and reduce crime and violence, reduce recidivism,  improve cost-effectiveness, and ensure interests of justice at every step of the criminal justice system.  As an attorney and former judge, I can say  with confidence that I believe our criminal justice system is flawed. It is an expensive system that is in many ways ineffective. It is important  that  this commission be established  and put  to work  immediately. We can no  longer be satisfied with allowing crime to fester and spread  throughout  the nation, especially among our youth. Real solutions to deter  crime are possible if we only take the time to  invest in them. It’s time we identify the problems in our criminal justice system and make  tangible efforts to ameliorate the system.  In our efforts  to create  ‘‘a more perfect  union’’, we have to take a closer look at our  nation and work to make our nation better for  our children and  the generations  to  follow.  H.R. 5143 gives us an opportunity to do that.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support and pass H.R. 5143, the National Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2010.  f  HONORING THE CHILDREN’S  MUSEUM IN OAK LAWN  HON.

Since it was first established in 2003, the  Museum has become a well-known and much-  loved institution in my District. Drawing 10,000  visitors when it first opened its doors, the Museum attracted over 85,000 visitors from over  36 states in the first year at its new location.  The Museum gives children and their families  an  important place  for  fun and  relaxation,  while also actively immersing children in the  joyful world of  learning. The Museum’s staff  has taken care to align the exhibits with the Illinois Learning Standards required of schools.  As a result, over 150 schools have reached  out  to  the Museum  to enrich  their curricula  and take their students on field trips. At a time  when evidence increasingly demonstrates that  learning environments and enrichment activities in early childhood profoundly affect later  life outcomes, the importance of the Museum’s  work becomes increasingly clear.  From the Museum’s beginnings in a small  space of 900 square feet, it has grown into an  institution that stands as a pillar of Oak Lawn,  Illinois’ 3rd District, and beyond. I look forward  to continuing to work with the Museum’s staff,  volunteers, and supporters to strengthen the  Museum for many years to come. I ask you to  join me  in congratulating  the Children’s Museum in Oak Lawn on its work and the first-  year anniversary of its new facilities, as well  as to wish it many more years of success.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE MAKING  HOME AFFORDABLE ACTS OF 2010  HON. JOHN P. SARBANES  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 30, 2010  ",2010
1456,164,2010-07-30,Mr. SARBANES.," Madam Speaker, I rise to  introduce  the Making Home Affordable  Improvements Act of 2010. For the last eighteen  months,  the Obama Administration has  tried  very hard  to make mortgage modifications  available  to struggling homeowners but  the  program has largely failed to have the impact  we had hoped.  Average homeowners around  the country  are paying  the price  for an  inflated housing  market and a bursting real estate bubble—this  is being felt acutely throughout Central Maryland. For every borrower who defaults, there  are many others on the brink of default who  are looking for a way forward.  And this isn’t a problem that will go away  quickly—an estimated 10 to 15 million Americans own homes that are worth less than they  owe on  their mortgages. These are homeowners with a strong financial incentive to default on their mortgages, irrespective of their  ability to pay.  In a market in which the values of homes  have fallen out of step with mortgage debt, I  strongly believe  that  the best  solution  for  homeowners is a structured bankruptcy process, including a judicial mortgage modification  or ‘‘cramdown.’’ This is the process by which  a bankruptcy  judge  reduces  the value of a  mortgage attached to a home, thereby reducing the monthly payment owed by the homeowner and allowing  families  to stay  in  their  homes.  This would be only available to homeowners  who elect  to  file bankruptcy, a  lengthy and  costly process with  long-term consequences  for individuals and their families—an avenue  of last resort for struggling homeowners, not a  new means for speculators to ‘‘game the system.’’ The House of Representatives passed  legislation  to provide bankruptcy  judges with  this authority, only to watch it die in the Senate. The political reality today is such that judicial mortgage modification may never become  an available option for struggling homeowners,  leading policy makers to search for an alternative.  Absent  judicial modification,  I believe  that  voluntary mortgage modification  holds  the  promise of a better way  forward  for homeowners, but, as it stands today, it has failed to  offer real relief to the millions of homeowners  who are in desperate need of assistance. This  can be attributed  to a widespread unwillingness by banks to do right by their borrowers—  the same borrowers who are acting against  their financial self-interest by continuing to pay  their mortgages each month.  The effort is also hampered, in part, by a  bureaucratic and unwieldy modification process—one that is often overwhelming and unmanageable for the average homeowner. But  working within  the voluntary mortgage modification structure created by the White House  as part of the Making Home Affordable Initiative, there are thousands of experts across the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:02 Aug 01, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A30JY8.078 E30JYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2010
1457,171,2010-07-30,Mr. SMITH of Washington.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today to honor Pearl Harbor survivor and  influential community member, Ardill Wright,  Jr., for his life of service to his community and  country.  Mr. Wright enlisted  in  the U.S. Navy  in  Wichita Falls, Texas on February 14, 1940.  On the morning of December 7, 1941, while  stationed  in Hawaii, Ardill Wright’s peaceful  morning was suddenly disrupted by the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. While  on the deck of the USS Raleigh, Mr. Wright  narrowly survived a Japanese attack on his  ship. Overcoming  the chaos and disaster of  that morning, Mr. Wright valiantly and courageously saved several of his  fellow service  members, most notably rescuing multiple sailors trapped in the USS Utah by cutting a hole  in  the ship’s keel. Following  the attack, Mr.  Wright resumed his service aboard  the Raleigh until the conclusion of World War II.  Following his discharge  from  the Navy  in  1946, Mr. Wright moved to Washington State  and became a member of the American Legion, Kent Post 15. Consistent with the American Legion’s objectives to benefit and serve  the community  through  the organization of  local programs for veterans and their families,  Mr. Wright co-founded  the highly successful  Kent American Legion baseball program  in  1961. Additionally, Mr. Wright contributed  to  the Kent community by serving as team manager well into the 1990s, and ran concessions  at Kent Memorial Park until 2004.

1461,6,2010-09-14,Mr. KUCINICH.," Madam Speaker,  I rise  to  address H. Res. 1610 a resolution to express  remembrance of the victims of, and sorrow for,  the devastating effects the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001 had on our Nation.  I  mourn in remembrance of innocent lives lost.  And I mourn in recognition that our response  to the attacks has only led to more suffering,  countless innocent lives lost abroad and an increasingly divided Nation here at home.  This resolution expresses that the House of  Representatives  ‘‘will continue  to defend  the  people of  the United States and  to  identify,  intercept, and defeat terrorists, including providing  the Armed Forces,  intelligence agencies, the diplomatic service, and the law enforcement and homeland security communities  with the resources and support necessary to  effectively accomplish  this mission.’’ But  the  actions of the U.S. that have been taken in the  name of achieving  this mission have not  brought us ‘‘mission accomplished.’’  As Pentagon and administration officials  continue to tout the supposed end of the war  in Iraq, there is no mention of the continued  systematic use of  the 9/11 attacks  to  justify  sending our armed forces to invade and occupy a country that did not attack us. Almost  8 years later, over 4,200 U.S. soldiers and 1  million Iraqi civilians have been killed.  How can we claim to remember the victims  of 9/11 in good faith after we stood silent as  billions of dollars were poured  into a war  based on lies? Congress continued its support  of the war despite overwhelming evidence that  the leaders or people of Iraq had nothing to do  with 9/11. In the shadow of the policies pursued under the so-called ‘‘War on Terror,’’ our  country  remains more divided, more  fearful  and  less  trustful  than ever. Perhaps even  more  troubling and more detrimental  to our  national security is the long-term damage our  policies have had on our image in the international community. And in July of this year,  the House of Representatives failed the victims of 9/11 yet again when it rejected legislation  to provide health care  for  the  first  responders who rescued survivors of the attacks  and who endure daily reminders of the attacks  in the form of their failing health.  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (now the  longest war in U.S. history) serve as a daily  reminder of  the destructive path we have  taken. We continue to dedicate billions of dollars to prop up a hopelessly corrupt and morally bankrupt central government  in Afghanistan as the people of that country suffer with  little education, access to clean water, health  care and the ability to live a normal life. Here  at home, our  increasingly polarized communities bear the brunt of our missteps through  record high unemployment rates, a continuing  foreclosure crisis and crumbling infrastructure.  How long can the policies we continue to  pursue be justified in the name of the victims  of 9/11?  I oppose  the wars  in  Iraq and Afghanistan, and  the PATRIOT Act because  I  believe  in  the  transformative power of  truth  and reconciliation. Almost ten years after 9/11,  it is past time to pursue a new path forward.  Our country  is  in peril, but our  resolve  to  progress in a positive direction must not be.  We do not need to export democracy around  the world to keep our country safe; we need  to demonstrate that America is a place where  democracy is safe.  ",2010
1462,6,2010-09-14,Mr. BOEHNER.," Madam Speaker, the events  of recent weeks have reminded us how central  the September 11th attacks remain to our national consciousness. The shock and grief we  felt that Tuesday still echo in our hearts, still  reverberate in our minds.  America stands tall as a beacon of freedom  and tolerance because her people have risen  to the occasion each time these values have  been tested. It is with that in mind that we turn  our thoughts today to the police, firefighters,  and  first  responders who  ran  into burning  buildings so others could get out. We renew  our awe for the passengers who dug in rather  than give up and charged the cockpit of Flight  93. We  remember how Americans  from all  walks donated blood, gathered at candlelight  vigils, and organized care packages for relief  workers. The  resilience  that propels us  forward as a people is drawn from the courage  of our heroes and the compassion of our citizens.  Each year on this day, we have the opportunity and the solemn responsibility to honor  the heroes and victims, and to keep faith with  their loved ones. Though these thoughts and  prayers, we can heal, and we can steel ourselves to repeat the words ‘never again’.  Over  the  last year, we have seen  in  the  most immediate way how terrorists still have  innocent Americans  in  their sights, starting  with a plot to blow up the New York City subway system, and continuing with the attacks at  Fort Hood, Times Square, and on board  Northwest Flight 253. Each of  these attacks  represented new strands of  terrorism, new  signs of an enemy ready and willing to adapt.  Now more than ever, as citizens and patriots,  we must remain vigilant in our efforts to confront and defeat  the  terrorist  threat. That  is  why we should also take a moment today to  salute the endurance, discipline, and valor of  our troops, who have volunteered to take the  fight to the enemy and keep the light of freedom burning bright.  ",2010
1463,6,2010-09-14,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today in strong support of H. Res. 1610,  remembering and honoring  those who  lost  their lives in the terrorist attacks of September  11, 2001.  It has been nine years since our Nation was  forever changed by  the horrific events  that  took place on September 11, 2001. The terrorist attacks that occurred at the World Trade  Center, the Pentagon, and on Flight 93 perpetrated one of the darkest moments in our  country’s history. That is why it is so important  that we come together on this day to again  memorialize those who perished on that fateful  late summer day in 2001.  Madam Speaker, September 11th showed  us the very worst of humanity. That day revealed the capabilities of terrorists determined  to murder thousands of innocent people in the  United States, simply for practicing democracy  and enjoying freedom. It gave us a frightening  look at the kind of enemy our country faces in  the 21st Century.  Yet, in the midst of that tragic and horrible  day, we saw the very best of what Americans  have to offer. We saw the courage, sacrifice,  and virtue displayed by our first responders,  including police, firefighters, and heroic individuals who were  traveling on commercial airliners. Regardless of the potential harm they  faced, these brave individuals sacrificed themselves so that others may survive the destruction of the terrorist attacks.  Madam Speaker, equally as  important as  the sacrifices made by those who perished in  the attacks of September 11th, we must also  use this day to celebrate the service of those  in  the military, and mourn  those who have  sacrificed their lives overseas in the defense  of our nation. These brave and selfless individuals have helped keep our great country  secure in the Global War on Terror and have  embodied the very spirit that President George  W. Bush stated  to a Joint Session of Congress on September 20, 2001. He said, ‘‘We  will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not  fail.’’  Our men and women in uniform face an adversary determined to destroy our way of life,  and this enemy presents us with one of the  gravest  challenges  in our Nation’s history.  Each day  that  they wake up  to defend  the  very freedom we enjoy, they honor the very  essence of  the American  spirit and  labor  steadfastly to bring freedom and liberty for all.  They work  tirelessly  in  the defense of our  country, and  they deserve nothing but our  eternal gratitude.  Therefore, Madam Speaker, it is appropriate  that nine years after September 11, 2001, we  continue to come together to mourn and memorialize all of our  fallen country men and  women for making the ultimate sacrifice for us.  Year in and year out, we must honor the solemn promise made  to  the victims and  their  families of this tragedy—we will never forget.  Our presence here  today signifies  the sobering realities about our world  that accompany the horrors that occurred on September  11th. The memories of that day touch us all in  some way, and as our Nation continues  to  heal—even nine years later—we need to take  time each year  to remember what  tragically  occurred in New York City, Arlington, Virginia,  and Somerset County, Pennsylvania. It is critically  important  that we  take  this  time each  year to mourn and honor the legacy of our heroes of September 11th.  Mr. ADLER of New Jersey.

1464,13,2010-09-14,Mr. BISHOP of Utah.," Madam Speaker, before I give my comments on this  particular resolution, I wish to yield  such time as she may consume to the  sponsor of this resolution, as well as  probably  the most  famous alumnus  from Miami Dade College, the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN).  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.  I  thank  the  gentleman  for the time, and  I also  want to thank Ambassador WATSON for  her comments on this wonderful institution.  b1510  Madam Speaker, as a former Florida  certified teacher, as a former educator  and as an alum of Miami Dade College,  I am so proud to be here on the floor,  congratulating Miami Dade College on  its 50th anniversary. I am proud to say  that my father and my brother are also  graduates of this fine institution. I am  infinitely grateful  for the education  that I received from the excellent professors at Miami Dade College, and I  am sure that I would not be in the  same position here tonight were it not  for this excellent education.  Miami Dade College has been an essential part of South Florida  for so  many years—for 50 years since it was  first  established  in  1960.  By  1967,  Madam Speaker, the college had become the largest institution of higher  education in the State of Florida. It  built upon this foundation, and it is  now the largest institution of higher  education in the United States, serving  nearly  170,000  students  every  year.  That  is  just phenomenal. It has enrolled more than 2 million students to  date, and it employs more than 6,000  faculty and staff. Half of the students  have been the first in their families to  attend college.  Madam Speaker, you can  imagine  how proud those family members are at  every graduation that they can say  that someone  from their  family has  graduated college.  Not surprisingly, it is home to one of  the most diverse student populations,  with  students  from  178  countries,  speaking 86 different languages. Miami  Dade College has managed to do all of  this while maintaining an affordable  and accessible course of study for students of all incomes, and it has been instrumental  in  the development and  success of so many in our community  and throughout the United States.  Equally impressive, Madam Speaker,  is the fact that more than a third of its  students are nontraditional. That  is,  they  are  older. They  are working  adults who are looking to further their  education or to, perhaps, retrain for  the jobs that are in demand now and in  the future.  The college is an icon. It is central to  the educational, economic, social, and  cultural fabric that is exciting South  Florida, including hosting the Nation’s  largest literary gathering, the Miami  Book Fair International. It also hosts  the Miami International Film Festival,  and is home to the national historic  landmark, the Miami Freedom Tower,  and to many programs that serve as  the region’s arts anchor.  A large part of Miami Dade College’s  success is due to its dynamic president,  Dr. Eduardo J. Padron, who is also a  graduate of Miami Dade College. Dr.  Padron is widely recognized as one of  the  top  educational  leaders  in  the  world. His time with Miami Dade College has been defined by growth, trailblazing  academic  and  cultural  programs, greater access, and student success. He has produced impressive results in student access, retention, graduation, and overall achievement. President Padron has truly made a positive  difference in the lives of so many individuals, and we must commend him for  all that he continues to do in support  of his college, our college, as this college is a part of our community and  our Nation.  So, Madam Speaker, with that, I urge  all Members to please vote in favor of  this legislation, congratulating one of  America’s finest academic institutions,  Miami Dade College, for its 50th year of  providing quality education for all.  Thank you  for the time, the gentleman from Utah, and thank you as  well, Madam Ambassador,  for  sponsoring this bill.  ",2010

1466,13,2010-09-14,Mr. BISHOP of Utah.," I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker,  I rise to support  House Resolution 1571, acknowledging  and congratulating Miami Dade College on the occasion of its 50th anniversary of service to the students and residents of Florida.  Miami Dade College was founded in  1960, 50 years ago. Only half a decade  later, the college had increased its enrollment by 300 percent. As has been  mentioned, as the first racially integrated junior college in Florida, Miami  Dade College provided an education to  all area residents who wanted to better  their lives and further their education.  Today, almost 100,000 students are enrolled  on  the  eight  campuses year  round, and if you count part-time students, it increases that number significantly. MDC is now the largest institution in the Florida college system, and  it works to educate a diverse student  population by offering 300 majors and  by providing an affordable education to  students from all backgrounds.  The  college  holds  several  annual  events that benefit both students and  members  of  the  community.  The  Miami Dade College’s Miami  International Book Fair and  the Miami  International Film Festival are two  such events that are nationally and  internationally renowned.  I congratulate Miami Dade College  for 50 years of excellence in higher education, and I wish all of its faculty,  staff, students, and alumni continued  success.  I ask my colleagues to support this  resolution.  Mr.  LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART  of  Florida.  Madam Speaker,  I rise  today  to honor and  congratulate Miami-Dade College on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. Since opening its  doors in 1960, it has served as an exemplary  institution of higher learning for the residents  of Miami-Dade County. A leader among Florida’s institutions, it became the first integrated  junior college giving students of all races and  ethnicities  the opportunity  to seek a higher  education. Since implementing these policies,  it has maintained its commitment to diversity,  boasting a student population hailing from 178  countries.  Miami-Dade College’s diversity extends  to  its broad areas of studies offering more than  300 major areas of study and a variety of degrees. Offering students associate, bachelor’s  degrees,  and  short  term  certificates,  the  Miami-Dade College has  the  largest enrollment of any college or university in the United  States, and has awarded more associate degrees than any other college.  Miami-Dade College also stands out by offering  an  affordable,  comprehensive,  education to individuals of all incomes as well as  backgrounds. Thirty-nine percent of its student  body,  lives below  the Federal poverty  level  and 61 are defined as low income. Speaking  to Miami-Dade College’s commitment to students  in  low-income  families,  it currently receives  the  highest  number  of Pell Grant  awards. South Florida, which, I am honored to  represent, owes a debt to Miami-Dade College  for providing quality affordable education  to  our community.  It  is an honor  to  represent  Miami-Dade College and again I congratulate  it on its 50th anniversary.  ",2010
1467,13,2010-09-14,Mr. MICA.," Madam Speaker, I wanted to join  others  in extending my  congratulations  to  Miami Dade College on its 50th anniversary.  For half a century, Miami Dade has been  providing outstanding opportunities  in education to the students of the State of Florida.  As a 1965 graduate of Miami Dade College, I  am proud to recognize the service and accomplishments of  this great  institution of higher  learning.  Since opening  its doors  in 1960, Miami  Dade College has helped make affordable  quality education to the residents of Florida.  We salute the past successful 50 years and  the  faculty and staff  that make  this a great  educational institution.  At the Federal, State and local levels, we  must remain committed in our support of higher education, especially at our colleges and  universities in Florida.

Next week, we have the opportunity  to honor the first responders and rescue workers who  rushed  to Ground  Zero to help in the rescue and recovery  efforts when we vote on the James  Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation  Act. The bill will provide necessary  medical and monitoring treatment to  the first responders and survivors of 9/  11 who were exposed to the debris and  to the dangerous toxins emitted from  the fall of the Twin Towers.  New York’s courageous firefighters,  police officers, EMTs, cleanup workers,  and  the  thousands who  came  from  other States to lend New York a hand  have been waiting for Congress to act.  I thank the House leadership for agreeing to bring this important legislation  up  for  consideration  under  regular  order, and I commend Representatives  MALONEYand NADLER for their unwavering commitment to the 9/11 first responders.  We must always fulfill our solemn  promise to remember September 11 and  those who died, and it is imperative we  care for those brave men and women  who are still affected by its aftermath.

1470,20,2010-09-14,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  most Americans don’t believe the national media’s reporting, according to  a new survey by the Pew Research Center.  Only about 2 in 10 say they ‘‘believe  all or most  information’’  from news  outlets such as the New York Times,  ABC, CBS, and NBC. For the television  networks, this marks a 10-point drop  from a decade ago.  Americans have good reason to be  skeptical of the media. A total of 17  journalists have left a national media  outlet to join either the Obama administration or another liberal organization, according to the Media Research  Center. It is no wonder that, by a margin of 3 to 1, Americans describe the  average reporter as more liberal than  they are rather than more conservative, according to a public opinion  poll.

They were  two of the more than 30 National Collegiate Athletic Association  national  championship  teams  invited  to  the  White House celebration by the President.  Last season, the Penn State women’s  volleyball  team won  their unprecedented third straight NCAA National  Championship. They have won a record  109 matches  in a row. The Nittany  Lions were a perfect 38–0 for the second  consecutive season, and this was their  seventh Big Ten title in a row. The  Penn State fencers won their fifth national title in the last decade on March  28 and their second consecutive NCAA  championship.  These teams carried the mantle of  Penn State  from the court and the  strip to the White House, and I could  not be prouder of my alma mater and  its sensational teams.  I commend the President for his efforts to recognize the various championship teams and individual student  athletes  for  their  contributions  to  their communities and to their schools.  f  GREENWOOD ELEMENTARY NAMED  A BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

1473,27,2010-09-14,Mr. CARTER.," Thank you, and I reclaim my time.  The point is legislation is the proper  way for us to deal with this problem.  This Congress is the place where we  make decisions on how we change our  immigration laws. They are written by  this Congress,  and  they  should  be  changed, if they need to be changed, by  this Congress.  I don’t understand why the President  of the United States thinks he must arbitrarily grant what turns out to be a  de  facto amnesty because his party  controls this House and will until the  end of this year control this House. We  still have weeks left on this session of  Congress, and there is a possibility we  can come back after the elections and  have another session of Congress before  the end of this year. If this immigration  issue needs to be taken up,  it  should have been taken up by the Congress. But there seems to be this idea  that the President of the United States  has the type of powers that he can,  with the stroke of a pen, set aside contracts; and with the stroke of a pen set  aside the laws of this country; and with  the stroke of a pen ignore orders of our  court system. I just don’t think the  world or our laws allow the executive  branch to be able to do that. It is not  like this thing wasn’t telegraphed before.  Recently, we had one of the worst oil  spill disasters  in the history of our  country. And  the President  of  the  United States declared at one time a  gulf-wide moratorium on drilling  in  the gulf. At that time, there were hundreds of drilling rigs  in the Gulf of  Mexico operating. And at that time,  both shallow water and deep water,  they shut it down by the President declaring a moratorium.  Now how do we  learn how we do  things in this country? We either read  them in our laws, we are instructed in  the precedents  that are  set by  the  courts, and we ought to look at the history of how we operated in the past.  That would make common sense. So  before we look at whether the President overstepped his individual authority by declaring a moratorium, the  question would come, has anybody that  was President of the United States ever  declared a moratorium on drilling before? And the answer is, yes. His name  was Richard Nixon, a Republican.  Now let’s look at how Richard Nixon  went about getting a moratorium to  stop drilling off the coast of California.  Did he make an individual dictate from  his own pen and say, I hereby declare  you can no longer drill? No. What did  he do? He went to the Congress of the  United States and said to the Congress,  we need to have a ban or moratorium  on drilling off the coast of California.  And this deliberative body held hearings, I assume. I haven’t delved into it  that much, but I do know that the Congress and the President issued a moratorium on drilling off the coast of California. And  to my knowledge,  that  moratorium  is  still  in  place. And  whether or not it was tested in the  court systems, I have no idea. But I  would assume it was, because if there  was anybody drilling at the time, they  probably felt like their contract rights  were stepped on. And I am sure the  court ruled on it. And the court must  have ruled in favor of the Congress and  the President because the moratorium  is still in place.  So what does that tell us about the  right way to declare a moratorium?  Well, the right way is to go to the Congress, and with the Congress put forth  the Congress declaring a moratorium  and the President enforcing that moratorium. That is the way it is supposed  to operate. If you read this little book,  the Constitution of the United States,  that is what it says.  This is not what we did. The President of the United States unilaterally  said we are declaring a moratorium. He  was joined by his Secretary of Energy,  I believe, but it was taken to court and  a Federal judge overturned the Obama  administration’s  initial  6 months of  moratorium and rejected the government’s bid to have the court challenge  thrown out. The government lawyers  argued that the lawsuit filed by several  offshore service companies on the May  28 moratorium was moot because the  Interior Department  imposed a new  drilling moratorium. What is the Interior Department? Is it a creation, is it  a department of the Congress? Nope. It  is  a  department  of  the  executive  branch of  the Federal Government.  Who appoints the Interior Secretary?  The President of the United States appoints with the advice and consent of  the Senate. That is how we get the  head of the Interior Department.  Now I can’t speak for the Interior  czar because the Interior czar doesn’t  have to go through that vetting process; he must answer only to the President of the United States, but we have  now approaching 40 czars, and I don’t  know what they do except draw a paycheck. But they answer to the President. But U.S. District Judge Martin  Feldman rejected that argument, saying the second moratorium arguably  fashions no substantial changes from  the first.  Now, when a judge grants an injunction and says, one side over the other,  this side is right to seek relief from the  court in the form of an injunctive process, and you are enjoined, you are  stopped from doing the behavior you  were doing. And that is basically what  this court said to the President of the  United States. It said you can’t do this.  But they did it anyway. Where that is  in the court system, I don’t know. But  it is blatantly standing forward. Not  only  is  it bypassing  the  legislative  process, which is the normal way by  precedent to get a moratorium on drilling in America, because that is the way  it has been done in the past, but then  when the court says hey, you can’t do  it, they did it anyway. And now by  playing regulatory games and giving  favors to some and maybe not favors to  others, and  I don’t know anything  about that part of the game playing; I  know that some people seem to be getting permits and some people seem to  be not getting permits, and whether or  not there is a moratorium in shallow  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:23 Sep 15, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K14SE7.066 H14SEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2010

1560,62,2010-09-14,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. President, we are down now to passing what  we have tried to pass so many times,  this  small  business  assistance  bill,  which is going to create a $30 billion  lending facility that will work through  community banks. The small business  lending fund will generate $300 billion  of loans that will specifically be targeted to small businesses to help get  our country moving again economically. This is huge. But right now we  are stuck on this issue of whether businesses are going to have to file these  1099  forms anytime they make purchases of goods.  The Senator from Nebraska wants to  eliminate all of the new information  reporting rules. That is a salutary result. But how does he propose to do it?  He has to come up with a way to pay  for it. The underling law raises about  $17 billion, so he has to come up with a  pay-for  if he  is going to repeal  it.  Where does he get it? He basically goes  directly at the health care bill, the reform bill, and he starts to gut the  health care reform bill.  This Senator does not think that is a  very good idea, particularly since what  the Senator from Nebraska is gutting  is the subsidies that allow people to  purchase health  insurance who presently are uninsured. The amendment of  the Senator would reduce the number  of  people  that  purchase  coverage  through  the  health  insurance  exchange. These are uninsured people  whom we want to have private health  insurance, 2 million of them in this  country who otherwise would go into  their State health insurance exchange  and be able to purchase health insurance with some assistance because of  their income level.  The amendment of the Senator involves a complicated formula. It actually gets at a provision in the current  health reform law that says if your  health premiums are going to be above  8 percent of your annual income, you  do not have a responsibility to purchase health  insurance. The Senator  from Nebraska drops that to 5 percent,  which means that 2 million people in  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:15 Sep 15, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A14SE6.001 S14SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 C L B Y K 8 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2010

This is an important piece of legislation. It is the most significant thing we  have done since the stimulus bill was  passed to create jobs. It is estimated  this will create from 500,000 to 700,000  jobs. It will give community banks the  ability now to compete with the big  banks and loan money to small businesses.

1577,90,2010-09-14,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, on behalf  of my fellow Missourians, I extend my  warmest congratulations to the citizens of Iron County and Ironton upon  their celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Iron County Courthouse.  Courthouses  like  the one  in  Iron  County symbolize the basis of America’s freedoms: a fair and independent  judiciary. America is a nation based on  laws and not men.  While it is not perfect, to be sure, our  system of justice makes it possible for  all Americans to live in relative peace  and prosperity most of the time.  The Iron County Courthouse has long  stood as a mark of this community’s  history. The county  from which the  courthouse  takes  its namesake was  originally established from portions of  the counties of St. Francois, Madison,  Washington,  Dent,  Reynolds,  and  Wayne by an act of the legislature approved February 17, 1857. According to  county records, the Iron County Courthouse was  the product of an order  which called for the construction of a  courthouse and the issuing of county  bonds, bearing 10 percent interest, for  $10,000. The courthouse’s cornerstone  was laid on July 4, 1858, and the structure was completed just 2 years later in  October 1860.  In its 150-year history, the Iron County Courthouse has been the site of  countless hearings and trials in addition to serving as the home of county  offices ranging from soil and water to  university  extensions.  The  circuit  court for Iron County was organized on  May 16, 1858, by Judge John H. Stone.  In September  1864, during  the Civil  War, the courthouse received damage  in the Battle of Pilot Knob.  The courthouse has been featured on  the cover of several local and regional  publications and, even more notably,  has earned the honor of inclusion in  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places.  We recognize the important role the  courthouse has played in Iron County’s  history and congratulate  local  residents on its 150th anniversary.∑  f  REMEMBERING JANET FAIRBANKS  ∑",2010
1578,90,2010-09-14,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, today I  wish to offer a few words in memory of  Janet Fairbanks, a California regional  planner who passed away last month in  her beloved hometown of San Diego.  Janet Fairbanks was  a  visionary  planner who brought people and communities together to plan for sensible,  sustainable  growth while  protecting  the natural environment.  From 1980 until her retirement  in  2006, Ms. Fairbanks helped guide the  development of growth management  and habitat conservation plans, first at  the city of San Diego and later at the  San Diego Association of Governments,  SANDAG. Along with her  technical  skills and expertise, Janet was known  for her outstanding ability to educate  public officials and a wide array of  stakeholders  about  the  virtues  of  smart growth, conservation, and biodiversity—and  then  to  bring  these  often divergent individuals and groups  together to create plans that enabled  communities to grow and thrive while  preserving San Diego County’s unique  natural areas and resources.  As a longtime member of the California Planning Roundtable, Ms. Fairbanks brought city and regional planners together with conservationists to  protect some of California’s most precious and endangered natural areas.  And as an active member of the California  Biodiversity  Council,  she  brought a planner’s comprehensive perspective to the Council’s mission of  protecting California’s fragile biodiversity.  Janet Fairbanks helped to make San  Diego County a nationally recognized  leader in regional planning and conservation. She will be sorely missed,  but her work and legacy will live on in  the beautiful communities she helped  to create and the natural landscapes  she helped to preserve.∑  f  ARKANSAS’S ‘‘BLUE RIBBON  SCHOOLS’’  ∑",2010
1579,90,2010-09-14,Mrs. LINCOLN.," Mr. President, today  I recognize four Arkansas schools that  were recently designated as ‘‘National  Blue Ribbon Schools’’ by the U.S. Department of Education. These schools  represent the best of our State, and I  am proud to congratulate them on this  significant achievement.  Arkansas’s Blue Ribbon Schools for  2010  are Arnold Drive  Elementary  School in Jacksonville, Calico Rock Elementary School in Calico Rock, Kingston Elementary School  in Kingston  and  Salem  Elementary  School  in  Salem.  The national Blue Ribbon designation honors public and private elementary, middle and high schools whose  students achieve at very high levels or  have made  significant progress and  helped close gaps in achievement, especially among disadvantaged and minority students. Nationally, 254 public and  50 private schools received the designation.  I commend Arkansas’s Blue Ribbon  Schools for their extraordinary efforts  helping students receive a high-quality  education and reach their full potential. Education is key to a bright future, and I am proud of these schools  for encouraging  students  to achieve  their dreams and goals through a high-  quality education.∑  f  HONORING ARKANSAS’S WORLD  WAR II HONOR FLIGHT VETERANS  ∑",2010

1581,104,2010-09-14,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor Robert D. Puett and recognize  his contributions  to homeless  families and  adults in Marin County, CA. Mr. Puett is retiring after 23 years of service with Homeward  Bound of Marin.  Born and  raised  in San Francisco, Bob  earned a degree in sociology at San Francisco  State University in 1972 and trained as a disaster shelter manager for the American Red  Cross in 1983.  In 1987, Bob began working as a counselor  in Marin’s winter emergency shelter program  and joined Homeward Bound as a program director the following year. He managed shelters  for the Red Cross following the Loma Prieta  earthquake  in 1989 and  the Oakland Hills  wildfire in 1991.  Always an advocate for those in need, Bob  stayed involved when neighbors of the winter  shelter protested  its  location at  the Marin  County Armory. With authorization from then-  Marin County Supervisor Bob Roumiguiere, he  managed an encampment at the Marin County  Civic Center  from April  to October 1992  to  demonstrate the need for a year-round shelter.  The program moved several  times  in  the  next two years, landing at the former Hamilton  Air Force Base in Novato in 1994. Bob recalls  managing the shelter in a large surplus Army  tent on a site  that  flooded regularly and, at  least once, lost its roof. Eventually the shelter  moved to the warehouse on the site of today’s  Homeward Bound headquarters.  Taking advantage of legislation that authorized homeless services on decommissioned  military bases, Bob helped lead a public education campaign to persuade neighbors of the  Hamilton base to create a year-round shelter.  I am proud to have worked with Bob, the City  of Novato and  the Navy, which  led  to  the  opening of the 80-bed New Beginnings Center  in 2000 with full community support. It was the  first such shelter built in the country on a decommissioned military site.  Bob became deputy director at Homeward  Bound in June 2000, continuing to build on his  desire  to offer homeless people not only  ‘‘a  hot and a cot’’—a meal and a bed—but an avenue out of homelessness. He oversaw development of the Next Key Center, also at Hamilton, which opened in November 2008 with 32  studio apartments, new offices for Homeward  Bound, an expanded kitchen  for  job  training  and an event space for public rental.  The Marin County Human Rights Commission honored Bob’s commitment and contributions to improving opportunities for people in  need with its Martin Luther King, Jr., Award in  2006.  At his  retirement party, Bob accepted a  ‘‘Hair Raising Challenge’’ and allowed his  trademark ponytail to be cut in exchange for a  $30,000 contribution to support shelter and job  training programs at Homeward Bound  In retirement, Mr. Puett plans to join Homeward Bound’s board of directors.  Madam Speaker,  it  is appropriate at  this  time  that we  thank Mr. Robert Puett  for his  many years of service on behalf of the people  of Marin County. He has worked tirelessly to  demonstrate his unwavering belief that people  can overcome great obstacles to change their  lives for the better. For this, he deserves our  appreciation.  f  HONORING EVAN BLASINGAME OF  NAPA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA  HON. MIKE THOMPSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 14, 2010  ",2010

Mr. Blasingame has  taught United States  History and  International Baccalaureate History of  the Americas at St. Helena High  School since 2007. Before his move  to  the  Napa Valley he taught in Mendocino County,  where he was named Laytonville High School  Teacher of the Year.  To Evan, teaching and learning do not stop  at the classroom door. Throughout his teaching career, Evan has volunteered to serve as  Academic Decathlon Coach, National Honor  Society advisor,  Interact Club advisor and  English Club advisor. He has also supported  his peers by serving as St. Helena Teachers  Association Site Representative, WASC Team  Leader, Teacher Representative to the District  Advisory Council and Cofounder of the Vets  Back to School Program.  Mr. Blasingame  is known as one of  the  hardest working teachers in Napa County. His  door is always open to his students to ensure  they reach their fullest potential. He is an engaging speaker who  is  incredibly passionate  about his subject matter and his passion  is  passed onto his students. He makes history  fun and accessible.  A great teacher can have an impact on a  young person that lasts forever. All of us can  remember a teacher who has had a profound  influence on our  lives. Mr. Blasingame has  had this impact on hundreds of students and  is a sterling example of the best his profession  has to offer.  Madam Speaker and colleagues,  it  is my  distinct  pleasure  to  recognize  Evan  Blasingame for the leadership, guidance and  inspiration he has provided  to hundreds of  young people throughout his career.

1583,104,2010-09-14,Mr. BURGESS.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor the life of Robert Paul Neff of  Grapevine, Texas. Robert passed away September 10, 2010 and leaves behind a strong  legacy of public service.  Robert served as manager of the Criminal  Justice Programs, CJP, at the North Central  Texas Council of Governments, NCTCOG,  starting in 1999. The CJP facilitates community-planning groups, provides technical assistance  to develop successful grant programs  and assists local units of government in solutions to common challenges within a 16-county region. Since 2001, he served  the Texas  Association of Regional Councils Criminal Justice Planners Association as  its  secretary,  chair, and communications liaison to local, regional, State, and Federal agencies. He was  also a member of the Advisory Council and  Board of Directors of  the National Criminal  Justice Association and the American Society  for Industrial Security, serving as its president  of the West Michigan Chapter in 1984.  Prior to coming to North Texas, Robert was  a  law  enforcement  officer  in Kalamazoo,  Michigan for almost 22 years, retiring as a detective assigned  to auto  theft, street gangs,  outlaw motorcycle gangs, and militia groups.  He received a master of Social Work degree  in Correctional Administration  from Western  Michigan University, where he also was an adjunct professor  in  the Criminal Justice Program in the Department of Sociology.  Robert  has  been  described  as  ‘‘street  savvy’’ and applied  this knowledge  to  the  criminal justice grant program, helping secure  millions of dollars  for  funding  for programs  used by local governments and nonprofit organizations. He had  the  respect of his peers  throughout Texas, and was sought by many  for his advice.  A believer in service to local governments  and  the criminal  justice community, Robert  brought critical thinking, innovation and grant  funding experience  to enhance  the  level of  public safety expertise and protection to North  Texans. Robert also invested in his community  through the First United Methodist Church of  Grapevine, Texas. He was respected by all  who met him, and will be greatly missed. Robert was also active in pulmonary fibrosis organization and outreach.  Madam Speaker,  it  is with sadness  that  I  rise today to remember Robert Neff. It is my  privilege to have this opportunity to honor his  life and legacy.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

Major Baldwin is a true testament to the remarkable and courageous service that our soldiers provide our nation.  Major Darren R. Baldwin grew up in Worthington, Ohio. After graduating  from high  school, Major Baldwin attended West Point  and dedicated his  life  to  the service of his  country. His first assignment was as a Field  Artillery Officer  to Giessen, Germany during  which he was sent into combat in Kosovo as  part of Task Force Falcon. Returning from his  deployment, Major Baldwin continued his military  training  in  the Special Forces Officer  Qualification School in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. His next tour of duty took him to Iraq in  support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Over the  next two years, he served three tours of duty.  Major Baldwin continues the tradition of excellence and service exhibited by the Green  Berets and other special service members.  Major Baldwin is not only a great soldier, but  also a great son, husband, brother, friend, and  community member. His heroic efforts to help  fight the war on terror have helped to keep his  country and community safe.  During his tour in Iraq on March 9 and 18,  2005, Major Baldwin was wounded by two improvised explosive devices, and suffered a  traumatic brain injury. Currently, Major Baldwin  is on medical convalescent  leave  receiving  physical and neurological  therapeutic  treatment. The service he performed for his country, at great personal cost, has been recognized with a Purple Heart, three Bronze Stars,  a Meritorious Service Medal, as well as being  commended by the Ohio Secretary of State.  Major Baldwin and other wounded soldiers  are our country’s greatest heroes. On September 11, 2010, the Green Beret Foundation  honored Major Darren R.

1589,118,2010-09-14,Mr. CONYERS.," Madam Speaker, in 1990,  the Congress  recognized  the  importance of  jazz  in American culture when  it authorized  the establishment of  the Smithsonian Jazz  Masterworks Orchestra (SJMO).  As  the Nation’s  jazz orchestra,  the SJMO  regularly performs  the great works of  jazz.  Throughout  its 20 years,  the orchestra has  distinguished itself as one of the crown jewels  of the Smithsonian—which is itself, a pre-eminent national treasure.  The band has performed for audiences at  the Smithsonian  Institution, Kennedy Center,  White House, U.S. Capitol, Harlem’s  famed  Apollo Theater, the 1996 Olympic Games in  Atlanta, and prestigious music  festivals  like  Ravinia and the Monterey Jazz Festival. The  ensemble has  traveled prolifically and performed at many American schools and colleges, as well as in Canada, Europe, and the  Middle East. On a 2008 State Department-  sponsored tour of Egypt, the Orchestra won  many new friends for the United States. After  an outdoor performance at the Pyramids and  Sphinx,  the Cairo Daily News  raved,  ‘‘The  backdrop was  incredible,  the band was superb.’’  Other critical reaction has been enthusiastic.  Wrote The New York Times: ‘‘Culturally important.  . . . spectacular musically. After being  embalmed on recordings, the music suddenly  came alive.’’ Syndicated columnist David S.  Broder wrote, ‘‘The impact of these live performances is everything the showmen, scholars, and politicians who brought this small miracle to pass imagined it might be. It is electrifying. . . .’’  While the SJMO is not the only jazz orchestra in America, it is unique. As the only federally-chartered jazz orchestra, it enjoys a position of prestige and  influence. As  the only  such ensemble with resident status at a museum, it’s in a unique position to bring the jazz  legacy to life.  The Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra educates the public about the history and  development of jazz as an art form and means  of entertainment. It promotes a greater appreciation for jazz as a valuable American treasure by performing jazz masterworks, and presenting educational activities that engage the  public with this great music.  Further contributing to its status, the orchestra is led by the internationally famous Maestro David Baker—the world’s leading jazz educator, author of over 70 books and 400 articles, and recent recipient of  the prestigious  American Jazz Masters Award given by  the  National Endowment for the Arts.  Madam Speaker, the orchestra has special  expertise in engaging and educating its audiences—young and old—about this vital part of  American culture. I am pleased to recognize  its service and accomplishments over the past  20 years.  f  IN HONOR OF LANCE CORPORAL  JAMES M. FERRARA  HON. JOHN H.

While on duty  as patrolman at  the Marine Corps Base  in  Quantico, Virginia, Lance Corporal Ferrara  was dispatched to the base motor pool after  he received reports of an injured person. Without hesitation, Lance Corporal Ferrara rushed  off to the scene and quickly identified the victim who was suffering from a severe laceration  with substantial loss of blood. Drawing upon  his  extensive  emergency medical  training,  Lance Corporal Ferrara immediately delivered  first aid, and probably saved the victim’s life.  The men and women of our Armed Forces  serve with an  incomparable sense of duty.  They are willing to sacrifice their lives to keep  our country safe and  free.  In his service,  Lance Corporal Ferrara exemplified the bravery and courage routinely displayed by those  who serve  in our military.

1590,118,2010-09-14,Mr. CARSON of Indiana.," Madam Speaker,  today I rise to recognize the Latino Coalition  Against Domestic and Sexual Violence,  Inc.  for their dedicated service to Latino communities in 92 counties across Indiana.  The Latino Coalition, founded as a nonprofit  corporation in 2004, has worked to eliminate  domestic and sexual violence by focusing on  the  contributing  conditions  affecting  Latino  communities and immigrant populations in Indiana. Today, the Latino Coalition is the only  statewide coalition of  its kind  in  the United  States that addresses the causes of domestic  violence and sexual assault in the Latino community. Due to the tireless efforts of the Latino  Coalition, men and women throughout Indiana  have been able to extricate themselves from  violent relationships, protect their children and  improve their self confidence. This organization serves as a model for other groups seeking to reduce the incidence of domestic and  sexual violence in the United States.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring  the Latino Coalition  for  its distinguished efforts in improving the quality of life  for victims of domestic violence and their families in the Latino community. This organization  serves as an example to community organizations everywhere.  f  FINDINGS OF THE CHAIRMAN OF  THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION  AND LABOR RELATING TO EFFICIENCY AND REFORM PURSUANT  TO H. RES. 1493  HON. GEORGE MILLER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 14, 2010  ",2010
1591,118,2010-09-14,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.," Madam  Speaker,  in  fulfillment of House Committee  chair responsibilities per H. Res. 1493 (111th  Congress), below are  ‘‘findings  that  identify  changes in law that help achieve deficit reduction by reducing waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement, promoting efficiency and reform  of government, and controlling spending within  Government  programs’’  the Committee  on  Education and Labor authorizes. The measures discussed below are pending before Congress.  If enacted,  the  legislation would promote efficient government and allow the agencies and departments within the jurisdiction of  the Committee  to more effectively serve  the  public.  In addition  to  the pending measures discussed below, this Congress has already enacted changes in the law in the Committee’s  jurisdiction  that will significantly  reduce  the  deficit. Specifically, the Student Aid and Fiscal  Responsibility Act, included with health insurance reform  in  last year’s Health Care and  Education Reconciliation Act of 2010  (H.R.  4872), will save billions of taxpayer dollars in  needless subsidies  to banks  lending  to students. The Committee shares jurisdiction over  the health care reform law enacted earlier this  year through H.R. 4872 and H.R. 3590, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  Among other things, these reforms reduce the  rate of increase in government health care expenditures,  encourage  prevention  and  wellness, and shift to new effective health care  payment mechanisms.  The  Congressional  Budget Office reports that they will reduce the  deficit by $143 billion over the next 10 years  and by $1.2 trillion in the following 10 years.  A. MINESAFETY—ROBERTC.

Under current  law, MSHA may only subpoena documents and witnesses as part of an  investigation of a mine disaster if the material  is  to be used  in a public hearing.

The National Association  of Secondary Schools Principals honors  the  secondary  school  principal who  has  succeeded in providing high-quality learning opportunities  for  students  as well  as  demonstrating exemplary contributions to the profession.  Ms. Carnahan believes in the spirit of collaboration and unselfishly credits  the highly-  trained team that she leads. Over the last five  years,  this cooperation has  led  to  increased  test scores and an attendance rate of 95 percent or higher. She and her  team work  together to find strategies to help each student  succeed.  I am privileged to represent Duniway Middle  School in McMinnville, Oregon, and the team  of professionals that provide quality education  to  their students every day. Not only do  I  honor Ms. Carnahan for her contribution to the  noble endeavor of  teaching, but  I commend  her as an example of true leadership. Madam  Speaker,  I ask my colleagues  to  join me  in  congratulating Ms. Carnahan for this important  recognition and her commitment to excellence  in our public schools.  f  HONORING HOWARD S. WEITZMAN  HON. CAROLYN McCARTHY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 14, 2010  Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. Madam  Speaker, I rise in honor of the Nassau County  Comptroller Howard S. Weitzman for his remarkable  contributions  to  the Long  Island  community. As Comptroller, Mr. Weitzman  served as a fiscal watchdog and continuously  worked  to strengthen Nassau County. For  these reasons and many others, I believe he  is worthy of recognition.  As  the  first Certified Public Accountant  (CPA) to be elected to the office of Nassau  County Comptroller, Mr. Weitzman successfully strengthened the Comptroller’s office. He  achieved a  significant  financial  turnaround,  changing deficits into surpluses and providing  balanced budgets without a  tax  increase  for  five years in a row. Mr. Weitzman focused on  audits in the areas of County government with  the  largest expenditures, which  resulted  in  identifying millions of dollars in potential savings. In addition, he has assembled a highly  professional staff and continuously  improved  the office by implementing innovative management techniques.  Under  the  Office  of  Comptroller, Mr.  Weitzman  created  and  implemented  the  NassauRx Card. This  innovative prescription  drug program provides discounts up to 40 percent on commonly prescribed drugs and is accepted at more than 90 percent of the County’s drugstores. Mr. Weitzman successfully implemented this program with no cost to County  taxpayers and the NassauRx Card has saved  Nassau residents more than $12 million.  The work of Mr. Weitzman is inspiring, and  I am grateful to him for all that he has accomplished for Nassau County. It is through his  hard work and determination  that Nassau  County remains prosperous and strong. I ask  my colleagues  to  join me  in expressing  the  gratitude of the U.S. Congress for his contributions to society.  f  RECOGNIZING  CISCO  SYSTEMS,  INC.

The American public recognizes  the company’s internationally famous name and logo  from popular TV shows such as 24 and Rubicon where,  true  to  life, Cisco’s unmatched  technology is used by government agencies to  defend  the Nation against enemies  foreign  and domestic. The company also  leads  the  way in keeping our kids safe as they navigate  the Internet. In fact, Cisco invented key technology that helped shape the Internet—transforming how people  connect,  communicate  and collaborate.  The vision of Len Bosack and Sandy Lemer,  Cisco’s founders, propelled this company into  a multi-billion dollar business. Recognized by  hundreds of magazines and investors as one  of the ‘‘Best Places to Work,’’ Cisco’s commitment to innovation and research is at the company’s core. With over  five billion dollars a  year invested in Research and Development,  R&D, Cisco  represents one of  the biggest  R&D spenders in the world. Their technology  and  innovations have changed  the way  the  United States—and the world—communicates.  It is a privilege to have many of this top-  notch company’s best and brightest living and  working  in North Texas. To  the outstanding  employees of Cisco-Richardson, happy 10th  anniversary, and I salute you.  HONORING SAMES MOTOR  COMPANY’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. HENRY CUELLAR  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 14, 2010  ",2010
1594,125,2010-09-14,Mr. CUELLAR.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor  the Sames Motor Company’s one  hundredth year  in operation. Sames Motor  Company  is Texas’ oldest dealership. This  automotive company has accomplished a century of service  to our community  throughout  the years.  Founded in 1910 by William J. Sames, this  successful and prospering company has been  sustained through five generations of Sames,  traditional values and great work ethic. It continues to be locally owned in Laredo, Texas  and operated by the Sames family. The dealership started with humble beginnings with an  inventory starting with  three Ford Model–Ts.  Today, it sells over 3,000 new vehicles and an  excess of 4,000 used vehicles a year and employs over 400 workers  through  the Sames  Auto Group.  Within 4 years of its founding, a new location was needed for the booming business. By  1919, a new, grander location was established  in downtown Laredo, which sold Ford, Cadillac, and other automobiles. Years later after  World War II, Sames agreed with Ford Motor  Company to be a dealership selling the Ford  brand exclusively. The company continued to  prosper under a succession of  the Sames  family, Harry E. Sames, Sr., son of W.J.  Sames; Harry E. Sames, Jr., son of Harry, Sr.;  and Harry ‘‘Hank’’ E. Sames III. In 1926 the  dealership sold over a thousand Fords. By the  1960s and ’70s, Sames Motor Company expanded to add three more locations in Laredo.  The company, owned by the fourth generation  of Sames,  continued  forward by acquiring  Sames Red Barn, a dealership in Austin and  expanding  to Corpus Christi  locations. Hank  Sames developed the in-house financing division known as Thunderbird Auto Finance and  launched the state of the art Sames Collision  Center. Today, Sames Motor Company  is  owned by the fifth generation of Sames and  thrives on traditional business values and excellent customer service.  Sustaining a business for a century is not  the only accomplishment of  this establishment—community outreach and philanthropic  contributions have come along with the success of Sames Motor Company. The founding  of the Sames Scholars and the Driven to Success Programs is the only program of its kind  for south Texas as an education based initiative. Evelyn Sames, fifth generation owner, implemented a new program called  ‘‘Mission:  Give Laredo,’’ which benefits Bethany House,  a local charity. In 2009, Mission: Give Laredo  raised over $100,000 and contributed  food,  clothing, and goods. Recently, working with  city officials, Evelyn is developing the Tires for  Life recycling and wellness program, which will  commit to the youth to healthy living and recycling. Sames Motor Company has also been  the recipient of numerous awards and recognition.  Madam Speaker, I am honored to have had  this time to recognize Texas’ oldest dealership  and  its  100th  anniversary.  Through  outstanding service and a family owned business,  Sames Motor Company has accomplished a  century of dedication.

1595,132,2010-09-14,Mr. KILDEE.," Madam Speaker, today I would  like to remember my good friend, Gary Alter.  Gary passed away on May 18th, a victim of  cancer and will be honored tonight at the Flint  Jewish Federation’s 21st Annual Donald Riegle Community Service Awards ceremony.  Born  in 1936 at Steubenville, Ohio, Gary  Alter came to Flint 11 years ago to assume  the post of Executive Director of the Flint Jewish Federation. He said he came to Flint because  it was  ‘‘a community  that was active  and had people who cared.’’ The love and respect Gary had for Flint was reflected back to  him by  the community. He was passionate  about developing the community into a place  of strength, vibrancy, and diversity. He believed  that people could get past  their differences and work for the common good. Gary  was an active participant in Congregation Beth  Israel, Temple Beth El, Rotary Club of Flint,  100 Club of Flint, Martin Luther King, Jr. Committee, Genesee County Census 2010 Committee, Michigan Jewish Conference, Genesee  Regional  Chamber  of  Commerce,  Urban  League of Flint, the Hate Crimes Task Force,  Flint Golf Club, and Professional Golf Teacher’s Association of America.  Gary was deeply committed to maintaining  Jewish  traditions and heritage. He was  involved in bringing Soviet Jews to the United  States, he established  the Karen Schneider  Jewish Film Festival  in Flint, and he was a  passionate supporter of Israel. He leaves behind his wife, Emily Alter, and children: Dr.  Carol Alter, Karen Jacobson, Alison Bank, and  Andrew Bank to cherish his memory.  Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to rise with me and remember the  life and work of Gary Alter. I considered Gary  a wonderful friend and an outstanding humanitarian. His compassionate, insight and enthusiasm are deeply missed by all that knew him.  May his memory be a blessing and  to  the  Jewish community,  ‘‘May God console you  among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem,  Ha’makom  yenahem etkhem betokh  she’ar  avelei Tziyonvi’Yerushalayim.’’  f  CELEBRATING THE DESIGNATION  OF  THE  EASTERN  BAND  OF  CHEROKEE AS AN ADVANTAGE  WEST  CERTIFIED  ENTREPRENEURIAL COMMUNITY  HON.

1596,132,2010-09-14,Mr. SHULER.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to congratulate the Eastern Band of Cherokee  in Cherokee, North Carolina on becoming a  Certified Entrepreneurial Community by  the  AdvantageWest  Economic  Development  Group. AdvantageWest, an economic development commission which serves 23 Western  North Carolina counties, created the ‘‘Certified  Entrepreneurial Community Program’’ to train  local communities  to encourage small business start-ups in the mountain region and to  help such businesses thrive.  The Eastern Band of Cherokee, North Carolina has an over 11,000-year history rich with  culture, arts, and a heritage of magnificent storytelling. Being designated as a Certified Entrepreneurial Community is just one example  of the continuation of the remarkable history,  and a tribute to the vision of the Eastern Band  of Cherokee. The  focus on youth and education as integral components of their Certified  Entrepreneurial Community vision ensures that  the future leaders of the community will have  the tools to continue their strong legacy.  The  Certification,  developed  by  the  AdvantageWest Center  for Rural Entrepreneurship  Institute,  contains a  strict  set of  guidelines that highlight a community’s enthusiasm and readiness to support entrepreneurship and small business. While several communities  throughout Western North Carolina  have become certified as entrepreneurial communities, the Eastern Band of Cherokee is the  first nation  to  receive  this designation. This  designation showcases  the Eastern Band of  Cherokee’s foresight in creating and fostering  an environment  in which prosperity can be  achieved. As a Certified Entrepreneurial Community, the Eastern Band will build upon the  success of its marketing campaign to further  promote  the potential of  its people  to  the  United States and abroad.  Madam Speaker,  I  urge my  colleagues  today to celebrate this remarkable honor bestowed on The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in Cherokee, North Carolina, and their  commitment  to  the  future of  their people.  I  urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating  their outstanding achievement.  f  TRIBUTE TO CARLISLE CHRISTIAN  CHURCH  HON.

1597,132,2010-09-14,Mr. LATHAM.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to congratulate the members of Carlisle Christian Church of Carlisle, Iowa, on celebrating  their 150th anniversary as a congregation.  The Carlisle Christian Church was founded  in 1860, shortly after  the pioneer village of  Carlisle was formed. As the town grew, so did  the church, moving to several different locations from the town school to the homes of  members of  the congregation. The Carlisle  Christian Church moved  into a permanent  building in 1868, where it continued to grow  with the community for the next 150 years.  Today, the Carlisle Christian Church serves  the community as a sponsor for the local Boy  Scout troop and acts as a center for holiday  worship  for  the whole  town of Carlisle. The  church, in partnership with other parishes, also  provides for families with special needs in the  Carlisle community through the Christian Community in Action program. In addition to their  service work,  the  congregation  frequently  sponsors a float and a booth during the town’s  annual 4th of July festivities.  The Carlisle Christian Church has been an  integral part of  the surrounding community,  and for this, I offer the congregation my utmost congratulations on a prosperous history.  It is an honor to represent all the parishioners  and the current Pastor, Rev. Karen L. Moore,  in  the United States Congress, and  I wish  them continued success, grace, peace and  celebration as a community.  f  RECOGNIZING SUE THOMPSON FOR  HER SERVICE TO THE CITY OF  HIGHLAND VILLAGE, TEXAS  HON.

The banquet will celebrate his  30 years of ministry and his 23 years as  Pastor of New Life Baptist Church  Ministries.  Since accepting his call to the ministry, Pastor Bradley has persistently  sought to encourage and enlighten his  congregation, and  through  these efforts, has earned the respect and admiration of people throughout Michigan.  His pastoral  leadership and commitment to service is admirable, and The  New Life Baptist Church Ministries has  flourished under his spiritual guidance.  Through his  stewardship and many  community-based efforts such as the  ‘‘Mission in the City Movement,’’ Pastor Bradley has provided much needed  assistance to those most in need in the  greater Saginaw community.  Before becoming pastor of New Life,  Pastor Bradley studied theology under  the tutelage of several well-known religious leaders. He also earned a bachelor’s degree  from the United Theological Seminary in Monroe, LA, and is  a graduate of the Beeson Institute for  Advanced Church Leadership. Pastor  Bradley is a family man and is supported by his wife, Relinda Bradley.

1605,15,2010-09-24,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to introduce Senate Resolution  646, also known as Feed America Day.  Feed America Day began in 2002 as a  small effort in Provo, UT. From that  small beginning, the campaign has received support  from over 1,100  large  and small cities. This includes over 60  cities that have responded with proclamations, covering a population exceeding seven million.  This eighth year of promoting Feed  America Day is held on the Thursday  immediately  preceding Thanksgiving  Day. On that day, each person is encouraged to fast two meals and then to  contribute to a food bank, church, or  charity the equivalent dollar amount  saved.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture  has reported that 35 million Americans, including 12 million children, live  in homes that do not have an adequate  supply of food. This resolution recalls  that selfless sacrifice breeds a genuine  spirit of thanksgiving, both affirming  and restoring  fundamental principles  in our society. In that spirit, I encourage individuals and families to remember to help those in need one week before Thanksgiving.  f  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND  PROPOSED  SA 4658.

1606,22,2010-09-24,Mr. COHEN.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to  recognize  singer  and  songwriter Clare  Burson for her work in bringing awareness to  the  Holocaust  through music.  Chronicled  through research and stories from her family,  her new album ‘‘Silver and Ash’’ remembers  her family and pays tribute to the many Jewish  men, women and children who suffered and  died during this dark period in history.  Clare Burson had always been interested in  learning her family’s history since the young  age of 8 years old. However, her grandmother, Joci Burson, was reluctant to speak  about the events that caused her family to flee  their home  in Germany due  to  the painful  memories. Joci, who lived in Memphis, Tennessee, would receive letters from family that  fled to Latvia updating her on their condition.  Receiving  letters  from only 1938–1941 was  undoubtedly a sign  that  the worst had happened and forced Joci into mourning and silence about the tragedy that befell the family.  Clare Burson spent much of her young adult  life researching her family’s history to gain a  better understanding of how  the Holocaust  changed her family. Her research led her to  move to Germany and to travel to Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine—the homes of her ancestors. As a result of her research and through  her songs, she was able  to convey resemblances of her sister  to  their great-grandmother in ‘‘Look Close.’’ In ‘‘I Will/With You,’’  Ms. Burson encourages her grandmother  to  share her memories so that she and others  will forever remember their history.  In  ‘‘Baby Boy,’’ Clare Burson describes a  metaphorical hole  in her great-great-grandmother’s home after sending her son to Lithuania to escape conscription to military service  in  the German army. Although not  in her  lyrics, Ms. Burson shared a piece of her family’s history saying that her great-great-grandmother sent her son to Lithuania in 1893 with  a trunk of belongings and a wedge of cheese  made by his mother. He then moved to South  Africa and stayed  there  for 10 years before  moving  to Memphis, where he married her  great-grandmother, Clare. They had 4 children  including her grandmother who, when she  passed away, gave her  the  cheese. That  wedge of cheese still exists and is now 117  years old.  Sixty-five  years after  the Holocaust,  the  number of Jewish Holocaust survivors and  those who lived during that time is decreasing.  Like many events  in our history, both good  and bad, we must ensure the fundamental nature of the Holocaust is passed along to future  generations. There must never again be such  a display of intolerance towards any group of  people. Thank you Clare Burson for giving us  such  beautiful music  set  to  your  family’s  memories and our shared history.  f  CONGRATULATING THE WESTERN  WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY VEHICLE RESEARCH INSTITUTE  HON. RICK LARSEN  OFWASHINGTON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 24, 2010  ",2010
1607,22,2010-09-24,Mr. LARSEN of Washington.," Madam Speaker,  I rise  today  to congratulate  the Western  Washington University Vehicle Research Institute for their outstanding achievements in the  X Prize Automotive competition.  The X Prize Competition challenged our  best scientists and engineers  to develop a  new car that could achieve fuel efficiency of  over 100 miles per gallon in real world driving.  To win, the car had to be safe, affordable and  potentially desirable to consumers.  Western Washington’s team, comprised entirely of undergraduate students, developed  and entered a 2-seat car, the Viking 45, in the  ‘‘alternative’’ class. Their car successfully navigated several rounds of testing, becoming the  only American university  team  to  reach  the  finals of the competition.  The success of the Viking 45 continues the  long tradition of excellence at the Vehicle Research Institute. I commend them for their success in the X Prize competition and their continuing outstanding work to develop the next  generation of passenger vehicles.  f  RECOGNIZING THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  FOUNDING  OF  NUESTRA SEN˜ORA DE LOS DOLORES DE LAS VEGAS GRANDES,  NEW MEXICO 1835–2010  HON. BEN RAY LUJA´N  OFNEWMEXICO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 24, 2010  Mr. LUJA´N. Madam Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate  the 175th anniversary of Las  Vegas, New Mexico.  Established by a land grant from the Government of Mexico, the City of Las Vegas was  founded on  the Gallinas River on April 6th,  1835. Las Vegas soon found prosperity as a  trading hub on the Sante Fe Trail, and later as  a stop on the railroad between Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe.  Throughout  its 175 years, Las Vegas has  flourished; becoming a regional center for cultural and social diversity; seeing the establishment of theaters, schools, newspapers, and libraries. As many historic  towns  in America  have experienced,  the people of Las Vegas  have seen challenges throughout their storied  history including epidemics, economic depressions, and political turmoil.  However, with over 900 buildings  recognized by  the National Register of Historic  Places, and  the claim  to  forming  the New  Mexico Militia and the 1st United States Volunteer Calvary, Las Vegas can point  to a  strong and proud history of perseverance and  dedication that is worthy of admiration.  I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing  the celebration of  the people of Las  Vegas as they celebrate their city’s anniversary. The longevity of Las Vegas is a testament  to  the  communal bonds established  there, and it is an inspirational achievement.  f  RECOGNIZING TAIWAN ON THE  OCCASION OF NATIONAL DAY  HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 24, 2010  ",2010
1608,22,2010-09-24,Mr. BUTTERFIELD.," Madam Speaker, I rise  to salute Taiwan on its forthcoming National  Day on October 10, 2010.  Taiwan  is a model of success  in Asia.  Through hard work and ingenuity, Taiwan has  become one of the strongest economies in the  Asia Pacific.  Two years ago, Taiwan was in the midst of  a global economic crisis. After  taking some  notable economic measures, Taiwan  is expected to bring its unemployment rate below 5  percent, and GDP is expected to grow by 4.72  percent this year.  Taiwan is also a showcase democracy and  continues to strengthen its democratic institution. The accomplishments of Taiwan, whether  economic or political, are truly remarkable.  On the occasion of Republic of China’s National Day, I ask my colleagues to join me in  wishing new era of peace and prosperity between Taiwan and mainland China. There  have been many agreements between the two  sides,  including direct air and sea  links,  increased mutual  investments, and exchanges  of peoples.  Also, my congratulations  to Taiwan  for  its  continued participation in the World Health Assembly meetings  last May  in Geneva. We  should also acknowledge Taiwan’s humanitarian assistance to Haiti and Taiwan’s medical and public health missions to Pacific island countries in recent years.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me in congratulating Taiwan.  f  A TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN B. FALEK  HON.

In fact, we have way more government than we had then, and it is too  much. But Republicans have been listening to the American people who  agree with us that we have too much  government,  and we  have made  a  Pledge to America to reduce the role of  the Federal Government in our lives.  We invite you to look at the Pledge  to America that Republicans took last  fall. We believe it has had a major impact on the election that was held in  November. What we promise is that we  are going to fulfill that pledge and reduce the role of the Federal Government in our lives and take our country  back to what it was meant to be.  f  b1410  HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW  ",2010

1623,16,2010-11-29,Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky.," With that  visual, keep in mind I’ve spent the last  26 years of my life traveling in and out  of the Middle East in various capacities—serving there in the military and  being in and out of the region, traveling on business, and now as a Member  of Congress. I’ve had a chance to watch  a system that is virtually flawless, and  it’s based on a series of questions that  is not  intrusive. It’s a  free society.  They’ve maintained their civil liberties  with a dramatically higher threat to  terrorism.  Yet what we have done, if we look at  this, is create the bureaucratization of  security. We’re not going to deal with  the root cause issues; we’re going to  treat the symptoms. Nobody will ever  take down an airplane with a box cutter or a pocketknife the way the hijackers did on 9/11. Now that citizens  who are flying know, there have been  multiple instances in flight where people have had erratic behavior, mainly  trying to get to the lavatory, and they  were tackled by passengers out of concern  for  this. Americans will  fight  back.  The situation has changed, and in effect, we’re  fighting  the  last battle;  we’re fighting the last terrorist attack  as  opposed  to  something  like  the  Israeli system, which really incurs virtually no cost and manages to keep a  very robust flying public that’s very  safe, and it all begins with asking questions.  People bring up the argument, Oh,  well, you can’t do that because that’s  profiling.  I would disagree with the misuse and  misunderstanding of that term related  to the cost. We are driving people away  from traveling right now because of  these intrusions. It’s creating a huge  burden on the flying public, and it’s entirely unnecessary because it’s checking innocent people, and 99 percent of  our capacity  is devoted to checking  people for a threat that any trained security  inspector would know  is not  even there. That’s a poor use of assets.  I’ll go back to the Israeli system. I  was traveling out of Israel, alone, with  a backpack, 17 years ago, on a short  trip that I had had to make into Jerusalem. At the time, because of what I  did and because of where I had been in  the military, I had had lots of stamps  from countries all over  that area—  some areas which weren’t particularly  friendly to Israel. I was asked questions—a  blue-eyed, Caucasian male,  from  the United States, who  spoke  with  an Ohio Valley  accent. They  began asking me a series of questions.  They looked at the passport stamps  and moved me over and said, We’d like  you to talk to this person over here.  The other 200-plus people who were  going on that L–1011 Delta flight, in  fact, were moved right on through. I  was asked questions for over an hour  and a half. There was no cost to those  other people. The airline was able to do  what they did, and they were able to  very quickly verify that I was, A, no  threat and a legitimate customer. That  system works, and it works today, and  it’s almost impossible for somebody to  fool that system.  The other thing that’s important is  we don’t need these billions of dollars  spent on these scanners that are being  overused. Again, it comes down to situation awareness. We can address this  issue with a  lower cost by stepping  back and applying what you and Conhave  been  talking about tonight, which  is  just  bringing some common sense to this.  What is the problem we really want  to solve? Give us the most flexibility  and the most options to deal with this  after the fact.  Again, before regulations  like this  should be implemented, I believe we  need to have a vote of Congress. Let  the will of the people be made known  in this rather than just simply giving  away another set of our liberties without asking that question when, in fact,  it comes at a significant cost. I think if  our taxpayers who don’t travel regularly understood the amount of money  that we spend on hardware, which can  still be penetrated by some type of a  serious threat that was  just outside  that set of assumptions in TSA, we’d  be in a different world.  This doesn’t impugn the motivation  of the folks in the Transportation Security Agency. I know there is an ongoing argument below the senior management levels of what works and what  doesn’t work, and it is by those who  have lived in that world.

1624,23,2010-11-29,Mrs. BACHMANN.," I want to thank  the gentleman from Iowa, STEVEKING.  It was some months ago when STEVE  KINGhad first told me about the situation with Pigford. He has been investigating and looking into this matter  for probably about 3 years now. He is  very interestingly situated by having a  seat on both the Judiciary Committee  and the Agriculture Committee, and  both of those committees have something to do with this case.  I want to go back to basics for just a  moment, if I can, because, as Congressman KINGwas giving me details about  this case, on every level, it just didn’t  add up. He had talked a little bit about  the  reparations angle, and  that, of  course, was an opinion that was written by Judge Friedman  in the very  first  class  certification  case  with  Pigford, Pigford I. That was about $1  billion of tax money that went out to  the claimants.  This is now a situation called Pigford  II. As Congressman KING rightly said,  there is no judgment. This is simply  something negotiated around a table  with, I believe, Attorney General Eric  Holder  and,  I  believe,  with  Tom  Vilsack, Ag Secretary. They got together and came up with an agreement.  They came up with this settlement,  but here is part of the problem.  I am a former Federal tax litigation  attorney, Madam Speaker. In that capacity, when I was working as a Federal tax  lawyer, we had to refer to  something as our standard of measurement. We would use the Bureau of  Labor Statistics. Well, according to the  Bureau  of Labor Statistics,  in  the  years in question, the maximum number of black farmers in the entire period for which we were talking about  giving people money for alleged discrimination claims was about  33,000  black farmers. Now, there is dispute  that even that number is egregiously  high, 33,000. Well, in the Pigford I settlement, there has already been $1 billion that has been paid out. The estimate is something like 15,000 to 18,000  claims that have already been paid out.  So  here  is  the  situation: Under  Pigford II, we now have new claimants  who have come to the fore who have  said they want to have money, too.  Well, just think. If the entire universe  of black  farmers  is 33,000, today we  have 94,000 claimants asking for money  in order to be made whole.  How does this make sense? If you  have a total universe of 33,000 black  farmers, how can you possibly have  94,000 claimants?  You’d have to presume that every  black farmer in the United States applied for a loan to the U.S. Department  of Agriculture. That’s almost statistically impossible. Then you’d have to  assume that every black farmer who  applied for a loan qualified for that  loan. That would also be a statistical  improbability. Then you’d have to assume that every black farmer in the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:29 Nov 30, 2010 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K29NO7.061 H29NOPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2010
1625,30,2010-11-29,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I have  sought recognition principally to urge  my colleagues to ratify the START  treaty with Russia. I ask unanimous  consent at the outset that the text of a  memorandum  from Senator JONKYL  and Senator BOBCORKER, two Republican Members, dated November  24,  2010, regarding progress in defining nuclear modernization requirements be  printed in the RECORDat the conclusion of my statement.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.  (See exhibit 1.)  ",2010
1626,30,2010-11-29,Mr. SPECTER.," I urge my colleagues  to move ahead with the prompt ratification of this treaty.  I have long been interested in the relationship between the United States  and the Soviet Union, predecessor to  Russia, on the issue of arms control,  going back to my college days as a student of international relations.  One of  the  first  items which attracted my concern on election to the  Senate was a Saturday speech made by  then-President Reagan where he said  essentially that the United States had  sufficient weapons to destroy the Soviet Union and, similarly, the Soviet  Union had sufficient weapons to destroy the United States. For decades,  the  two  countries  lived  under  the  truce, so to speak, of mutual assured  destruction. That has given way to  arms control negotiations and the successful negotiation of treaties. For example, the START I treaty in 1992 was  approved by a margin of 93 to 6. The  START II treaty of 1996 was approved  by a margin of 87 to 4. The Moscow  Treaty of 2003 was approved by a vote  of 98 to nothing.  The memorandum I have referenced  raises a number of concerns which I  submit to my colleagues ought not to  stop us from moving ahead with ratification. For example, the memorandum  makes this point on page 5:  Additional funding could be applied to accelerate the construction of these facilities  to ensure on schedule completion. . . .  Well, there is no showing of a problem  on  on-schedule  completion. To  talk about  ‘‘additional funding could  be applied’’ is far from saying it is necessary for our national security.  The memorandum further says:  Further Administration effort to advance  funding is the best path to successful completion of these facilities.  Well, here again, there is no showing  that advance funding is necessary for  successful completion. It simply says it  ‘‘is the best path to successful completion of these facilities,’’ but no showing that the current path is not an adequate path.  The memorandum, in another spot,  makes this statement:  . . . the NNSA is reviewing an updated surveillance plan that could  lead to greater  budget requirements.  ‘‘Could.’’ It does not say  it would  lead to greater budget requirements,  and what  is speculative as to what  could happen ought not to be taken as  any reason for objecting to the ratification.  Still later in the memorandum there  is the statement:  . . . there are still no costs or funding commitments beyond FY 2015.  Well, that is not surprising when we  are in the year 2010. Adequate time to  consider and make commitments beyond 2015  is hardly a reason not to  move ahead with ratification.  Then, on page 5, under the category  of ‘‘Conclusion,’’ there is a statement  about  ‘‘assurances  from  the  appropriate authorizers and appropriators  must be obtained to ensure that the enacted budget reflects the President’s  request.’’  Well, that is unrealistic. There is no  way to get assurances  from authorizers—that is referring to the Armed  Services Committee—or the appropriators, specifically the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee,  a  subcommittee on which I have served during my tenure.  When you talk about getting assurances from legislators, from Senators,  from Members of the House of Representatives, that, simply stated, is unrealistic, I submit.  The concerns I had in the early days  of my tenure in the Senate led me to  propose  a  resolution  for  a  summit  meeting which was contested by Senator Tower, who was then-chairman of  the Armed Services Committee. On  this  floor—I  can  still  see Senator  Tower on the end seat in the third row  back and I in the junior league my first  couple of years in the Senate. Senator  Tower was a tough advocate. We had  quite a protracted debate about the  triad.  I had done my homework. I had been  to Grand Forks, ND, and seen the Minuteman II. It was my first experience  seeing a nuclear weapon, and it was  quite a sight. I recall looking down an  open space—I think it went close to 100  feet, perhaps 90 feet; I would not affirm  exactly what  it was—and seeing the  Minuteman II, and that was, in effect,  small potatoes compared to what we  have had since. I went to the Air Force  base  in California to  look at the B  bomber, the B–1 or the B–2 at that  time, and to South Carolina to Charleston to see the nuclear submarines.

1634,44,2010-11-29,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Nebraska for  his  leadership on this  issue. He has  done a great job advocating on behalf  of small businesses, farmers, ranchers,  and all the people to be impacted by  this onerous provision  in the health  care bill.  I fear this is something we are going  to be doing and repeating quite frequently  in the years ahead as more  Americans  find out what  is  in  the  Democrats’ health care bill. This  is  egregious because it requires various  entities to send suppliers 1099 forms if  they  engage  in  business-to-business  transactions totaling more than $600 in  a single year.  While I believe everyone ought to pay  their  fair share of taxes, I am concerned that the burden of compliance  falls not on the tax delinquents but instead  on  the  countless  businesses,  churches, local governments, and nonprofits that pay their taxes on time  and in full or may not even have a tax  liability.  This means these entities will have  less time to fulfill their core missions,  whether that is building products, administering to the poor, helping students learn or building local infrastructure. Instead, they are going to be filling out  form after  form to become  compliant with this measure.  Because  of  the heavy  compliance  costs associated with this measure, its  repeal is supported by a wide variety of  business organizations and agricultural  organizations across the country, including the Chamber of Commerce, National Federation of Independent Business, and the American Farm Bureau,  to name a few.  It is not just national organizations  that I have heard from. In numerous  constituent meetings across South Dakota, I have heard from the citizens of  South Dakota, whether they be farmers, ranchers, small businesses, CPAs,  and others, about the effect this measure would have on them, their businesses, and their employees.  While this requirement is not set to  take effect until next year, I believe it  is important we act now to give these  types of entities certainty that they  will not have to take steps to comply  with this measure.  I add that our government now has a  debt that is approaching $14 trillion,  and we need to do everything we can to  make sure that debt does not increase.  It is a debt that we continue to pile on  more and more and hand to the next  generation of Americans.  Because of that concern, I am pleased  this amendment is fully offset by rescinding unspent Federal  funds. The  Senator from Nebraska came up with a  way, through rescinding unspent Federal funds, to offset this amendment in  a  commonsense way. Of  course,  it  excepts the Department of Defense and  Department of Veterans Affairs, which  will protect our national security interests and those who have served our  country. I believe the rescissions he  calls for in unspent Federal funds are a  good way to make sure this doesn’t add  to our debt. This amendment perfectly  captures that belief, and I think it is a  belief that is shared by many of my  colleagues in the Senate and by citizens across this country.  We need to be focused on bringing  down our debt, and we will start doing  that by eliminating government spending, not putting new, burdensome requirements on businesses and charities.  Unfortunately, there were numerous  other provisions in the health care bill  and other bills  in the past 2 years  which shifted the burden onto small  businesses and employers. We will have  to revisit each of those to ensure they  don’t slow economic growth and  job  creation, which  is what  the people  want us to be focused on now.  I hope we can take this first step and  support the Senator from Nebraska on  his amendment, which addresses this  critical issue, this egregious provision  that puts a costly burden on small  businesses, and do it in a way that is  fiscally responsible and doesn’t add to  the debt and burden future generations  with more debt.  I think the Senator from Nebraska  came up with a great solution. I hope  colleagues on both sides of the aisle—  Republicans and Democrats—who have  heard, as I have, from their constituents will take this very commonsense  amendment and pass it with a big margin. Let’s get this particular provision  in the health care bill repealed and the  negative impact it would have on economic growth and job creation in this  country.  With that, I withhold the remainder  of my time.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.  ",2010
1635,44,2010-11-29,Mr.  INOUYE.," Mr. President,  the  amendment offered today by Senator  proposes to rescind unobligated balances of appropriated  funds  that are designated  for specific purposes  in various appropriations bills  previously enacted by Congress. The  Senator  offers  these  rescissions  in  order to offset the loss of revenues resulting from his amendment.  Much  like similar amendments offered in the past, this amendment simply provides for a generic rescission of  funds, with the authority and decision-  making  for which programs are  impacted delegated entirely to the executive branch.  Consideration of this amendment is  the first of two attempts this evening  to shift the power of and responsibility  for the Nation’s purse strings from the  legislative  branch  to  the  executive  branch.

1654,79,2010-11-29,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today to congratulate my dear friend, Mr.  Edward L. Blacksheare, Sr., on being honored  by the Crooms Academy Alumni Association,  Inc. at its first-ever ‘‘Legacy of Hope and Love  Banquet.’’  This  ceremony will  honor Mr.  Blacksheare’s distinguished career as an educator and his countless contributions  to  the  Sanford community. Mr. Blacksheare has always welcomed the challenge to serve the underserved, and  it  is  this devotion  that has  earned  him  recognition  from  the Crooms  Academy Alumni Association.  Mr. Blacksheare carries himself with integrity, respect, and dedication in everything he  does for his profession and community. A look  into his background shows just how successful  he has been on both of  these  fronts. As a  Sanford, Florida native, Mr. Blacksheare attended Crooms Academy, graduating in 1943.  After college, Mr. Blacksheare came back to  Sanford and began his career as an educator  at Oviedo High School. In 1948, he returned  home  to Crooms Academy as a  teacher,  which marked the beginning of a long and illustrious  career. Mr. Blacksheare was appointed assistant principal  in 1960 and was  elevated to principal in 1964. After serving as  principal for 21 years, Mr. Blacksheare took a  position with  the Seminole County School  Board before retiring in 1992 with 43 years of  service in education.  In addition, Mr. Blacksheare is also a proud  Kappa man. He was a great role model for me  and others in our community, serving Kappa  Alpha Psi Fraternity in many leadership roles.  In fact, I became a Kappa at Fisk University  because of Mr. Blacksheare. When he found  out that I had pledged Kappa at Fisk University, he was so excited. Years later, when I  was nominated  for Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity’s highest award,  the Laurel Wreath, he  wrote one of  the  first  letters  to  the Laurel  Wreath Committee  on my  behalf. Brother  Blacksheare truly knows the meaning of PHI  NU PI.  Mr. Blacksheare is a man of great faith and  excellent character. He is a man known for his  many good works and his  love  for his students, family, and friends. As a Crooms Academy alumnus,  I am grateful  for  the many  years  of  guidance  and  leadership  Mr.  Blacksheare devoted  to my alma mater. He  has always displayed selfless compassion and  a desire to help those around him. A student  in  the  Class  of  1976  described  Mr.  Blacksheare as, ‘‘a man of great strength and  patience . . . a principal who is interested in  today’s youth, concerned with our welfare and  our school.’’ I can think of no one else more  deserving of this tremendous honor, which will  be bestowed upon him at the ‘‘Legacy of Hope  and Love Banquet.’’  Madam Speaker, it is truly a privilege and  an honor  for me  to  recognize Mr. Edward  Blacksheare, Sr.,  for his dedication  to education, Crooms Academy, its students, and the  Sanford community as a whole.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

Penn won with a perfect  score, and has now won or tied for first place  in  the Class  I Division with perfect scores  since 1999.  Spell Bowl team members included Maddy  Anderson, Maaz Arif, Nitin Arora, Nisha Bhatt,  Alex Cao, Christy Chang, Laura Harmon, Austin Heckaman, Leah Hershberger, Yifei Hu,  Jenny  Huang,  Richard  Jung,  Neena  Kallookulangara,  Marija  Lapkus,  James  McGinness,  Sheena  Shah,  Nithin  Varadharajan,  and Andy Wang. They  are  coached by Peter De Kever.  Mr. De Kever noted that their goal was not  only winning, but doing so with a perfect  score. He said, ‘‘They executed perfectly and  all their hard work came to fruition.’’ The team  practices  centered on  repetition, and  they  wrote an estimated 30,000 words this season  as part of the training. Again, I offer my congratulations to the members of the Penn High  School Spell Bowl team for their accomplishments throughout the competition.  f  TRIBUTE TO WALTER J. BECKERT  III  HON.

1657,79,2010-11-29,Ms. DEGETTE.," Madam Speaker,  I would  like to recognize the wonderful life and exceptional accomplishments of a remarkable man.  This distinguished citizen possessed an  impressive record of civic leadership and invaluable service. His achievements in making our  city and state a better place merit our recognition and gratitude. It is to commend this eminent citizen that I rise to honor Walter ‘‘Uncle  Walt’’ Beckert III.  Walt Beckert, ‘‘Uncle Walt’’ to all, devoted  his time, skill and energy to making our state  and  our  community  a  better  place. Walt  achieved a Masters  in Bilingual Education,  Curriculum Development and Administration  from the University of Colorado. He served in  the Peace Corps where he worked in Ecuador  on bilingual education and curriculum development.  Walt was a labor leader and political activist  who was in the vanguard of those dedicated  to economic and social justice. As an AFL–  CIO  Colorado  executive  board member,  former president of AFSCME Council 76, and  Vice President of local 158; Walt was a union  man through and through. Anyone who knew  him was  impressed by his unending spirit,  drive and determination. Walt was an example  of a true union leader in every sense of the  term. Walt cared about all working people, not  just those of his organization. His dedication  and commitment to the labor movement was  without question.  As a  long  time employee of  the City and  County of Denver as Director of Denver’s Safe  City Office, Walt worked to prevent violence  by and against youth. His work allowed him to  witness  families  that have  fallen on hard  times, whether by drugs, illness, or victimization. These experiences gave him a unique  perspective in helping youth and were a motivating  factor  in his community service  interests. These interests lead him to be appointed  to the Governor’s Commission on Community  Service.  Walt was an  invaluable member of any  committee or endeavor. From labor union, to  political party to the St. Patrick’s Day Parade  committee, he was always there with a smile  and a hug and an attitude that made everyone  want to work harder. He made every job look  easy and fun, and with Uncle Walt it was.  Our thoughts and our prayers are with his  loved ones.

1658,86,2010-11-29,Mr. TOWNS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to offer my congratulations to the Republic of  Turkey on the occasion of the 87th anniversary of Republic Day.  On October 29, 1923, the new republic was  declared in the new capital of Ankara. Mustafa  Kemal Ataturk was the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey, and his leadership proved essential to the foundation for the  secular republic. In recent decades, the republic has strengthened politically and economically.  Turkey’s membership in NATO, beginning in  1952, has been one facet of a strong relationship between Turkey and the United States. It  is important that our two nations continue to  work together toward our common goals.  I extend my best wishes to the citizens of  Turkey, and urge my colleagues to recognize  this important occasion.  f  EMERGENCY  COMPENSATION  ACT  UNEMPLOYMENT  CONTINUATION  SPEECHOF  HON. DAVE CAMP  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 18, 2010  ",2010
1659,86,2010-11-29,Mr. CAMP.," Madam Speaker, on November  18, 2010, U.S. Department of Labor Secretary  Hilda Solis said the fact that the U.S. unemployment  rate was 9.6 percent  in October  2010 (as opposed to 10.1 percent in October  2009)  ‘‘tells you  . . . we are on  the  right  path.’’  The facts show that the U.S. unemployment  rate has been 9.5 percent or above  for 15  consecutive months—the longest period since  the Great Depression of the 1930s.  The unemployment rate hasn’t fallen since  spring—when hundreds of thousands of temporary Census jobs were ‘‘created.’’  And Democrats promised us  if  their 2009  stimulus law passed, the unemployment rate  would be 7 percent by now, which as the chart  below reflects didn’t happen.  All of which suggests unemployment at 9.6  percent  is not  the  right path  for American  workers,  regardless of what Secretary Solis  believes.  This bill reflects a cynical political maneuver  by the Democratic leadership. They know the  Senate has no plans to pass this unpaid-for  bill. So all the claims that today’s legislation  will save Thanksgiving are  just more empty  rhetoric.  The fact is, this is exactly what happened  this summer, when Democrats brought a similar unpaid-for extension bill up under suspensions. That  failed, because enough Republicans and Democrats opposed simply adding  to the deficit. You would think our Democrat  colleagues would have  learned  that  lesson,  and either brought this up for an up or down  vote, or actually paid  for  it.  Instead, we get  more of the same ‘‘our way or the highway’’  approach.  It will not pass, and the other side knows it.  We should reject this bill and work together to  quickly pass a bill to extend federal unemployment benefits while responsibly paying for it.  f  HONORING GEORGE THOMAS  ‘‘MICKEY’’ LELAND  HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, November 29, 2010  ",2010
1660,86,2010-11-29,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.,"  Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Congressman George Thomas  ‘‘Mickey’’ Leland,  who lost his life in a plane crash during a humanitarian mission in Ethiopia. Were he still  with us, he would have turned 66 last week on  November 27.  Congressman Leland was best known  for  his advocacy for low-income families and individuals, both at home and abroad. Before he  even held political office, he was active  in  pressing  for crucial health care  reforms  in  Houston, such as community health clinics. In  1972 he  ran  for  the Texas House of Representatives as a member of  the  ‘‘People’s  Five,’’ a slate of minority candidates in a state  that had not seen an African American state  representative  since  Reconstruction.  Congressman Leland won his election, and  two  subsequent reelections. In his tenure, he was  lauded for his work to allow generic drugs to  be prescribed, lowering costs and increasing  access  to  life-saving medications  for many  Texans.  In 1978, Congressman Leland took over the  seat vacated by Barbara Jordan’s retirement  from the United States House of Representatives. He was reelected to his position as a  United States Congressman  five  times,  typically winning majorities of 90 percent or more.  Initially he drew attention with his unique  sense of style, later for his ability to develop  bipartisan partnerships. Congressman Leland  chaired  the Congressional Black Caucus  in  the 99th Congress,  from 1985  to 1987. He  was an ally  to all minority groups,  including  the many Latinos in his district. He once surprised his colleagues by arguing in Spanish on  the House Floor in favor of preserving the bilingual clauses of the Voting Rights Act.  However, Congressman Leland’s greatest  passion—the fight against world hunger—was  born during a  three-month  trip  through East  Africa. There, he witnessed mobs of people  rubbing their stomachs and pleading for food  in Ethiopian refugee camps. There, he held a  young girl in his arms as she died of starvation. After that fateful visit, Congressman Leland became a dedicated crusader,  raising  awareness of domestic and international hunger. He was instrumental in the creation of the  Select Committee on Hunger, which in 1984  was able to push through Congress a nearly  $800 million aid package for famine relief. He  continued to travel to Africa frequently, often  guiding his Congressional colleagues  to refugee camps so they could see for themselves  the dramatic impact of the aid money.  It was during a trip to Africa, during which  he planned to monitor the delivery of supplies  and  inspect a  refugee camp on August 7,  1989,  that  Congressman  Leland’s  plane  crashed into a mountainside. He and 15 others died  in  the course of  this humanitarian  mission. Many of  the communities he had  touched, both  in Texas and nationally, were  quick to honor his memory with awards, dedications, and outreach projects  in Africa. His  greatest legacy is, of course, his family—he is  survived by his wife Alison and his three children.  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues  join me in recognizing this remarkable man for  his lifetime of service.  f  INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION EXPRESSING  SUPPORT  FOR  THE  REPUBLIC OF  INDIA GAINING A  PERMANENT  SEAT  ON  THE  UNITED  NATIONS  SECURITY  COUNCIL  HON.

1661,86,2010-11-29,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Madam Speaker,  I rise to introduce a resolution in support of  the Republic of  India gaining a permanent  seat on the United Nations Security Council.  Addressing a  joint session of  India’s Parliament  this  past November  8, President  Obama said that ‘‘the United States not only  welcomes India as a rising global power, we  fervently support it.’’ I could not agree more. In  recent years India has proven to be a solid  and supportive ally of the United States. As  the  international community  looks  to  reform  the policies and procedures of  the Security  Council, no nation deserves a seat at the table  more than India.  As the world’s most populous democracy—  and second most-populous nation—India is an  increasingly  influential power, not only  in  its  neighborhood in South Asia but also on the  world’s stage. India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, enjoys the second-largest labor force, and is rapidly becoming a major hub  for high-tech  industry,  telecommunications,  and  automobile manufacturing. As a major export/import nation, India  is an important trading partner for dozens of  countries around the world.

1662,5,2010-12-10,Mr. REED.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to our colleagues  who are departing the Senate after distinguished service on behalf of their  States and on behalf of the Nation. I  have been privileged  to work with  these individuals, to learn from them,  to  collaborate  and  cooperate with  them, and to, in some small way, help  them do what they have done so well—  represent  their States with  fidelity,  with great effort, and to move the  agenda of the Nation forward.  EVANBAYH  EVANBAYH, a colleague and friend.  We served together on the Banking  Committee and  the Armed Services  Committee. His lovely wife Susan and  their two children have contributed extraordinarily to Indiana as a Governor,  and then as a Senator serving the Nation.  I can recall very early on in the operations in Iraq, where it became clear to  Senator BAYH that unless we armored  our humvee vehicles, thousands and  thousands of soldiers would be at risk,  and also marines, sailors, and airmen.  He  fought  tenaciously  to  ensure,  against initial opposition, that we were  able to begin to armor those vehicles,  begin to develop new generations of armored vehicles to protect our soldiers.  So, quite literally, his efforts saved the  lives of thousands of young Americans.  For that alone, we owe him a huge debt  of gratitude.  In every endeavor,  from  issues of  children’s health to education policy,  he brought a thoughtful, measured, and  brilliant mind to bear that is hard to  match. I wish him the very best.  ROBERTBENNETT  BOBBENNETT and I served together  on  the  Banking  Committee.  His  thoughtful questioning and his deep  knowledge of the subjects were critical  on so many different issues. I remember when we were trying to get the extension of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act completed so the markets—  particularly  the markets  for  large  properties—would not freeze up, he was  instrumental  in  getting  that  done.  That is just one example of what he  has done throughout a career of public  service to the people of Utah and of  this Nation. I wish he and Joyce the  very best as they continue to serve, as  I am sure they will, this Nation and  their State of Utah.  KITBOND  KITBONDand Linda Bond have served  with such distinction also. As a member of the Appropriations Committee,  he has made wise and judicious decisions about how we invest in this country. In that process, he never forgot the  obligation  to groups who are often  overlooked.  One of the areas where he has done so  much work, and  so effectively, has  been on the issue of homelessness. His  efforts, joined by our colleagues and  friends, BARBARAMIKULSKIand PATTY  MURRAY, have made a real difference in  providing effective and efficient shelter  for so many in our large communities  and in our rural areas, who otherwise  literally would be on the streets of  America. One of the most disheartening images in this country is to see  people who are  forced to be on the  streets. There are many reasons  for  that. But KITBONDhas done a lot to  ensure there is at least a capacity to  help people who need that kind of help.  I thank him for that and commend him  for so much of what he has done for the  people of Missouri and the people of  this Nation.  SAMBROWNBACK  I congratulate Governor-elect SAM  BROWNBACK. He has decided to leave  the rigors of the Senate for the tranquility of being a Governor. I see our  Presiding Officer, who  enjoyed  the  tranquility of being the Governor of  Virginia. I know SAM is going to do  great, but I think at some moment he  might mop his brow and say that it  wasn’t quite as hectic back in the Senate.  Along with Mary and his family he  has distinguished himself. SAMis someone who is indefatigable when involved  in an issue. He does it from principle  and conscience. We appreciate that.  I was pleased to work with him on  legislation I introduced, the Conquer  Childhood Cancer Act, which became  law. That is one example of his great  skills as a legislator. In foreign affairs  he was someone who kept watch on  areas of  the world which otherwise  might have been neglected. His efforts  with  respect  to Darfur,  striving  to  bring justice and peace to that region,  are particularly commendable. I thank  the Senator for his service and wish  him well as he assumes the daunting  responsibilities  as Governor  of  the  State of Kansas.  JIMBUNNING  Senator JIMBUNNINGand I served together for many years on the Banking  Committee. JIM and Mary Catherine  and their family brought so much to  not only the Senate as an organization,  but to the Senate as a group of individuals. JIMwas one of the first and most  insightful observers and critics of the  growing issues in the securities market. He did it based upon his experience  as a financial stockbroker in the world  of finance. He did it also with his grasp  of common sense and looking at things  carefully and pragmatically, based on  Main Street not on financial centers.  We worked together on the Securities  Committee, and we did it in a way that  I enjoyed the collaboration immensely.  A focus on the issues and their importance to the country was also in the  forefront of his mind. He distinguished  himself immensely. I wish him well.  ROLANDBURRIS  Senator Roland Burris  brought  a  great bit of vitality and energy to the  Senate in his time here. I wish Roland  and Berlean the very best. He has had  a  remarkable  career  in  Illinois  as  someone who was in the banking industry and then public service—been a  pathbreaker in so many different ways.

1663,26,2010-12-10,Mr. SANDERS.," I want to add the idea  that when we think about cutting back  on education—whether it is childcare,  primary school, or college—we are simply cutting off our noses to spite our  faces. The Senator is aware that where,  at one time in this country, we used to  lead the world in the number of our  people who graduated college, we are  now falling very significantly. How do  you become a great economy if you  don’t have  the  scientists,  the engineers, the teachers, the professionals  out there, and many other countries  around the world are having a higher  percentage of their high school graduates going to college? That is something we have to address. Anyone who  comes forward and says cut education  is moving us in exactly the wrong direction.  ",2010
1664,26,2010-12-10,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Exactly. And I am  for more accountability. If some of my  colleagues on  the other  side  think  some of that money is being wasted or  we are not getting our bang for the  buck, don’t come with an across-the-  board cut to Pell grants, come with a  plan to change it, saying these are the  requirements for our universities: You  have to graduate 65 percent of the kids  who start or you have to have certain  benchmarks before you can apply for  these loans or for these grants.  This country is at a crossroads, and I  know the President and his advisers  understand  the  extraordinary  challenges before this country. I hope the  Members understand the economic danger, the minefield we are in here. We  can’t make too many mistakes here.  There is no cushion left. There is no  surplus left. We are down to below bottom. So when we do big things such as  this—and this is a big thing, this $980  billion big package, it is almost $1 trillion—we need to do it the best way we  can do it. We can’t do it recklessly or  frivolously. We can’t do it for ideology,  for gosh almighty’s sakes.  I wish we could have fought harder  for a better package. I have not yet decided how I am going to vote, but I  have said if I vote, I am not voting  quietly. I may vote yes, I may vote no,  but I will vote with a loud voice about  what I am concerned about, what I believe my constituents are concerned  about, and I will try my best to help  them, to support them, and to make  the best decisions we can next week.  But this has been troubling me, and so  I wanted to come to the  floor and  speak about it, and I thank the Senator from Vermont.  I yield the floor.  ",2010
1665,26,2010-12-10,Mr.  SANDERS.,"  I  thank  Senator  LANDRIEUvery much for coming, and I  think she knows that on many issues  her views and mine are different, but  on this issue, I believe we are speaking  for the overwhelming majority of the  people,  not  just  of Louisiana  and  Vermont but all over this country, who  cannot understand why we give tax  breaks to billionaires to drive up the  deficit and the national debt at a time  when the deficit and the debt are so  large.  I  want  to  thank  Senator  LANDRIEUvery much for her very articulate and heartfelt statements. I appreciate that very much.  Mr. President, I was mentioning a  moment ago the great contrast about  what is happening in our economy between the people on top and everybody  else. I indicated that the top 400 families during the Bush Presidency alone  saw their income more than double, at  the same time, by the way, as their income tax rates dropped almost in half.  So that is what is going on for the people on top, who would make out extremely well under this agreement between the President and the Republican leadership.  But I also talked about what is going  on with the middle class and working  families of this country. If you can believe it—and this is quite amazing—  since December of 1999—and this was in  a Washington Post article in January—  there has been a zero net job creation—  a zero net job creation. Middle-income  households made less in 2008, when adjusted for inflation, than they did in  1999, and that number is sure to have  declined further in 2009.  What does that mean? It means that  when you look at a 10-year period—and  people work very hard—in many  instances—actually, in the vast majority  of instances—you will have both husbands and wives working and still not  making enough money to pay the bills.  In  fact, they have  less money than  they used to have.  When I was a kid growing up, the experience was that in the middle class  one person—I know young people will  not believe this, but it is true—years  ago in the United States, before the  great global economy, before robotics,  before  computers, one person  could  work 40 hours a week and earn enough  money to pay the bills for the family.  One person. Today,  in Vermont and  throughout this country, overwhelmingly you have husbands and wives  both working. And in some instances  they are working very long hours. But  here is the rub: Today, a two-income  family has less disposable income than  a one-income family did 30 years ago  because wages have not kept up with  inflation, and because health care costs  have soared, the cost of education has  soared, housing has soared, and basic  necessities have soared. This is a description of a country moving in the  wrong direction.  Thirty years ago, a one-income family had more disposable income than a  two-income  family does  today. And  there are a  lot of reasons  for that.  Maybe we will touch on them a little  bit later. But one of them, in my view,  has to do with our disastrous unfettered free trade policy, which has resulted in the shutdown of tens of thousands  of  factories  in  this  country.  Under President Bush alone, we lost  some 48,000 factories. We went from 19  million manufacturing jobs to 12 million manufacturing jobs, and in many  instances, those were good jobs.  Where did they go? Some shut down  for a variety of reasons. But others  shut down because we have trade laws  that say you have to be a moron not to  shut down in America because if you go  to China, go to Vietnam, go to Mexico,  go to a developing country, you pay  workers there a fraction of what you  are paying the workers  in America.  Why wouldn’t you go? Then you bring  your products  right back  into  this  country.  A couple weeks ago, my wife and I  did some Christmas shopping. Frankly—we went to couple stores—it is very  hard to find a product manufactured in  the United States of America. You do  not have to have a Ph.D. in economics  to understand we are not going to have  a strong economy unless we have a  strong manufacturing capability, unless companies are reinvesting in Colorado or Vermont, creating good jobs  here. You do not have an economic future when virtually everything you are  buying is coming from China or another country.  We are not just talking about low-  end products. These are not sneakers  or a pair of pants. This is increasingly  high-tech stuff.

1666,33,2010-12-10,Mr. SANDERS.," If these tax breaks  for the wealthiest people are extended  for 2 years, there is a strong likelihood  they will be extended for many years  beyond those 2 and perhaps even permanently. That brings us back to the  Bush-era nonsense of believing that tax  breaks for the rich and trickle-down  economics are going to help the middle-class and working families of this  country.  While the personal income tax issue  and extending them for the top 2 percent has received a lot of national attention, what has not gotten a whole  lot of discussion is that that is not the  only unfair and absurd tax proposal out  there. The agreement struck between  the President and the Republican leadership continues the Bush era 15 percent tax rate on capital gains and dividends, meaning those people who make  their  living off of their  investments  will continue to pay a substantially  lower tax rate than firemen, teachers,  and nurses. So if you are a wealthy person and you earn money  from dividends—I believe the overwhelming majority of those capital gains accrue to  the top 1 percent—you are going to be  paying a tax on that income of 15 percent, which is less than you pay if you  are a fireman, a police officer, a teacher, or a nurse. So what we are doing  there is extending not only the personal income tax breaks for the very  rich but a host of other taxes as well.  On top of all of that—and I know  many of my colleagues have picked up  on this and are extremely upset, and I  think that is one of the reasons the  Democrats in the House just yesterday  said they don’t want to bring this proposal  to  the  floor  for a vote—this  agreement includes a horrendous proposal regarding the estate tax.  The estate tax is a proposal Teddy  Roosevelt  talked about  in  the year  1906. It was eventually enacted in 1916.  Here  is what Teddy Roosevelt  said  about this issue in August of 1906—and  it is worth repeating this because what  the proposal struck between the President and  the Republican  leadership  does is lower the estate tax substantially. Here is what Teddy Roosevelt  said in 1906:  The absence of effective State, and, especially,  national,  restraint  upon  unfair  money-getting has tended to create a small  class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful men, whose chief object is to  hold and increase their power. . . .  This is Teddy Roosevelt, who by then  had served as President of the United  States.  He continued:  No man should receive a dollar unless that  dollar has been fairly earned. Every dollar  received should represent a dollar’s worth of  service rendered—not gambling  in stocks,  but service rendered.  This guy was pretty prophetic back  in 1910.  He continues:  The really big fortune, the swollen fortune,  by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities  which differentiated in kind as well as in degree  from what  is passed by men of relatively small means. Therefore, I believe in  a graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes  properly safeguarded against evasion and increasing rapidly in amount with the size of  the estate.  Wow, Teddy Roosevelt hit the nail on  the head. That was 100 years ago. He  was worried that a small group of people with  incredible money would be  able to pass that money on, and what  you would create would be an oligarchic form of government with a small  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:48 Jun 10, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S10DE0.REC S10DE0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2010
1667,54,2010-12-10,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. President, one of  the most solemn obligations of Senators is try impeachments. The Constitution  provides  that  the Senate  shall have the ‘‘sole power to try all  impeachments,’’ and that ‘‘all civil officers of the United States shall be removed  from office on  impeachment’’  for various offenses. Senators also take  a special oath when hearing an  impeachment  case  before  the  Senate  holds an impeachment trial.  I recently heard evidence in the case  of Judge Porteous, who would have  lifetime tenure under the Constitution  unless he resigns or is removed by the  Senate. The House of Representatives  impeached Judge Porteous on four different articles. After deliberation,  I  voted  to convict Judge Porteous of  three of the four articles, but voted  against conviction on one of the articles. I rise to explain my not guilty  vote on one of the articles.  Article I stated that Judge Porteous  engaged in a pattern of conduct that is  incompatible with the trust and confidence placed  in him as a Federal  judge. The Senate voted that Judge  Porteous was guilty on this count by a  unanimous vote of 96 to 0.  Article  IV  stated  that  Judge  Porteous  knowingly made material  false statements about his past both to  the U.S. Senate and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in order to obtain the office of U.S. district court  judge. The Senate voted  to convict  Judge Porteous on this count by a vote  of 90 to 6.  I voted against article IV because, in  my view, it was duplicative of article I.  As a member of the Senate Judiciary  Committee,  I  regularly  review  the  questionnaire and nomination materials for Federal judicial nominees who  are nominated  for  lifetime appointments. One question we ask nominees  on  our  committee  questionnaire—  under oath—is whether there was ‘‘any  unfavorable information that may affect your nomination.’’ Judicial nominees also fill out SF–86 personnel forms  as part of the executive branch’s review of a potential nomination. One  question  on  the  form  asks—under  oath—whether:  There [is] anything in your personal life  that could be used by someone to coerce or  blackmail you? Is there anything in your life  that could cause an embarrassment to you or  to the President if publicly known? If so,  please provide full details . . .  The FBI also asks potential nominees  whether they are concealing any activity or conduct that could be used to influence,  pressure,  coerce  or  compromise them in any way or that would  impact negatively on their character,  reputation,  judgment  or  discretion.  Judge Porteous answered no to all of  these questions.  I am concerned about the vagueness  and catchall nature of these questions  and its responses being the basis of an  Article of Impeachment. I could understand an Article of Impeachment based  on a response that hides information  that if discovered later would be the  basis of impeachment and where a separate Article of  Impeachment using  these specific facts was not presented  to the Senate by the House of Representatives. Also, I would have understood if the statements in article IV  were included as part of article I. Such  was not the case here.  For this reason, I voted not guilty on  article IV.  f  JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS  ",2010
1668,54,2010-12-10,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I have  been urging Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to come together  and take action to begin to end the vacancy crisis that is threatening the administration of justice by our Federal  courts. I asked only that Senators follow the Golden Rule. Regrettably that  has not happened. Now  38  judicial  nominees whose qualifications are well  established are being delayed. They  should be confirmed before we adjourn.  Adherence to the Golden Rule, a simple step, would help us return to our  Senate traditions, and allow the Senate to better fulfill its responsibilities  to the American people and the Federal  judiciary.  I was encouraged  last week when  Senator SESSIONS, the Judiciary Committee’s ranking Republican, provided  assurance that the many judicial nominees who have been stalled for months  and months without Senate action will  be confirmed before we adjourn. He is  in a position to know. As the Republican  leader  on  the  committee, he  works directly with  the Republican  leadership that continues to hold up  virtually all judicial nominees, just as  it has for months and months. At our  Judiciary Committee business meeting  on December 1, Senator SESSIONSsaid:  ‘‘The truth is except for a few nominees, the overwhelming majority have  moved with bipartisan unanimous support and will be confirmed on  the  floor.’’ He went on to predict that a  SESSIONS number ‘‘will clear before the session is  over.’’ I hope this assurance is true. I  look forward to working with Senator  to ensure that the Senate  acts before adjourning.  He is right: The overwhelming majority of the judicial nominees awaiting  final action have strong bipartisan support. This makes the Republican obstruction of their confirmation all the  more mystifying. Twenty-nine of the  judicial nominees whose confirmations  are being stonewalled were not opposed  by any Senator, Republican or Democrat, during Judiciary Committee consideration. Two others had only one or  two votes in opposition. Committee Republicans voted in lockstep to oppose  only 4 of the 38 pending nominations. I  believe that if debated by the Senate,  those nominations, too, would be confirmed.  Had we adhered to the Golden Rule,  the judicial nominees who have been  delayed for weeks and months would  already be confirmed. That had been  our practice and tradition. Democratic  Senators did not stall the nominees of  President Bush in this way. Senate Republicans should end their across the  board blockade of noncontroversial judicial nominees. With 111 vacancies—a  historically high number—plaguing our  Federal courts  today,  the American  people cannot afford this gamesmanship.  Despite  these  skyrocketing vacancies, the Senate has not been permitted  by Republicans to consider a single judicial nomination since September 13,  when we confirmed Jane Stranch of  Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit. Only  after 10 months of delay was the Senate permitted to act. The Stranch nomination was the only nomination we  were permitted to consider that entire  work period. In fact, the Republican  blockade of judicial nominations has  been so complete that the Senate has  been permitted to confirm only  five  Federal  circuit  and  district  court  nominations since the fourth of July  recess. While  one  in  eight Federal  judgeships remains vacant, Senate Republicans consented to confirm only a  single  judicial nomination  in July.  They consented to consider only four  judicial nominations before the August  recess, despite 21 nominations then on  the calendar. We have considered only  the Stranch nomination since returning from that recess. I do not recall a  time when one party so thoroughly  prevented the Senate from acting on  consensus nominees with  bipartisan  support.  I have been trying to end this obstruction, yet it continues. Democratic  Senators have sought agreement on the  floor to debate and consider nominations, but the Republican  leadership  has objected time and time again. The  Democratic cloakroom has sought consent from the Republican cloakroom to  move nominations, but there has been  no consent.  The Judiciary Committee has favorably reported 80 of President Obama’s  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:48 Jun 10, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S10DE0.REC S10DE0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2010
1669,89,2010-12-10,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, the  Whistleblower  Protection  Enhancement Act, S. 372, will strengthen and  modernize  protections  for  Federal  whistleblowers. May I ask the Senator  from Hawaii to clarify the intent of the  provision providing relief for the consequences  of  retaliatory  investigaE N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o tions? Am I correct that this provision  does not in any way reduce or eliminate current protections against retaliatory investigations?  ",2010
1670,89,2010-12-10,Mr. AKAKA.," The Senator from Iowa  is correct. Remedies in S. 372 provide  relief for the consequences of preliminary retaliatory  investigations when  an  employee  prevails  in  litigation  against a prohibited personnel practice. This provision does not in any  way reduce or eliminate jurisdiction to  challenge a retaliatory  investigation  before a formal personnel action occurs.  In legislative history for 1994 amendments to the Whistleblower Protection  Act, Representative McCloskey stated  that  alleged  harassment  can  be  a  threatened personnel action if it  ‘‘is  discriminatory,  or  could  have  a  chilling effect on merit system duties  and responsibilities.’’ Congress specifically  included  retaliatory  investigations initiated because of protected activity  among  the  illustrations  for  ‘‘threatened  personnel  actions,’’  because they can be  ‘‘preludes or preconditions to’’ the entire list of formal  personnel actions in section 2302(a)(2)  of title 5. Jurisdiction to challenge retaliatory investigations as threatened  personnel actions has been upheld repeatedly. The Office of Special Counsel  also has used this authority to avoid  the need for prolonged, costly litigation while employees are off the job  from subsequent termination.  ",2010
1671,89,2010-12-10,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, today,  the Senate will finally pass the bipartisan Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010, S. 372. I thank  Senator AKAKA and Senator COLLINS  for their dedication to this legislation  and for working with me and Senator  GRASSLEYon key changes to make the  bill even stronger in its protection of  whistleblowers. I have worked for years  to protect whistleblowers from retaliation, whether by government or corporate employers, and this bill is an  important step forward in that ongoing  process.  Whistleblowers are  instrumental  in  alerting the public and Congress to  wrongdoing  in Federal  agencies.  In  many cases, their willingness to step  forward has resulted in important governmental reform, and has even saved  lives. Congress must encourage Federal  employees  with  reasonable  beliefs  about government misconduct to report such fraud or abuse by offering  meaningful protection  to  those who  blow the whistle, rather than leaving  them vulnerable to reprisals.  Unfortunately,  whistleblower  laws  have been weakened by many court decisions that have ignored congressional  intent and  eroded  employee protections. The Whistleblower Protection  Enhancement Act will help restore and  expand the protections for Federal employees  envisioned  by  the  original  Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989.  Key provisions of the Whistleblower  Protection Enhancement Act will offer  additional methods to appeal whistleblower cases and provide additional  protections to intelligence community  employees and officers of the Transportation Security Administration. It will  also correct the Federal circuit court’s  repeated misinterpretations  of  the  whistleblower  law and  suspend  that  court’s sole jurisdiction over Federal  employee whistleblower  cases  for  5  years.  Whistleblowers have proven to be important catalysts for much needed government change over the years. From  corporate fraud to governmental misconduct to media  integrity, whistleblowers have played an integral role in  galvanizing reform. In these difficult  financial times, we must be especially  vigilant to ensure that public resources  are not lost to waste, fraud, and abuse.  Restoring credibility to our whistleblower laws is an important part of  that work. Before Congress adjourns, I  hope the House of Representatives will  quickly consider this legislation, and  send it to the President to be signed  into law.  ",2010

Chairman OBEY has honorably served  the  citizens of Wisconsin’s 7th district since 1969.  When Chairman OBEY began his service  in  the Congress—succeeding Mel Laird, who  was appointed Secretary of Defense—he was  the youngest Member of Congress  in  the  United States. He has an impressive record of  legislative accomplishments. He  is now  the  longest-serving member of either House of  Congress in Wisconsin’s history.  His  commitment  to  the  integrity  of  the  House has taught me a great deal about the  legislative process. His respect for the minority, interest in listening to all voices and his  common-sense  leadership have been critical  in ensuring civil debate and productive solutions to extremely difficult problems.  Chairman DAVEOBEY is  the only Democratic Member of the House to have served on  the three major economic committees in the  Congress:  the Budget Committee,  the Joint  Economic Committee and the Committee on  Appropriation.  Chairman OBEYhas been a mentor and a  friend and I will miss his leadership in the U.S.  House. I thank him for his service to the 7th  district of Wisconsin,  the  country and  the  world, and wish him the very best in his retirement.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. PAUL W.
