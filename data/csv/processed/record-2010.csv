0,House,111,-0.582,2,2010-01-13,Mr. KUCINICH.," Yesterday, I  introduced H.R. 4414, a bill that imposes a 75  percent  tax on  the outside bonuses  bankers are paying themselves  from  windfall profits earned  from massive  Federal Government support.  This bill is necessary because bankers are about to pay out some of the  largest bonuses in history. All banking  corporations, whether they received direct assistance or not, received substantial benefits from government bailouts. Bankers’ failures to self-regulate,  let us remember, were the direct result  of the crisis we’re in today. They need  to be told that the money they’re making is a public trust, not something  they’ve earned for good behavior.  Bank profits are the result of a deliberate Federal Government policy to restore banking capital and ultimately  investment  in American  prosperity.  Banking bonuses have nothing to do  with these objectives, and payouts to  bankers are a form of appropriation of  public wealth.  Banks could be using their profits to  do many things to improve the prospects of economic recovery, including  strengthening their capital base, recognizing and writing off their real estate  losses, reducing fees charged to customers,  especially  for  seniors  and  struggling consumers, and  increasing  lending  to  small  and medium-sized  companies.  Support H.R. 1414.  f  PEOPLE MAKING A DIFFERENCE  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2010
1,House,111,0.547,2,2010-01-13,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.," In  South Carolina last week, I met with  people making a difference promoting  jobs by visiting the OneStop employment centers across the district. I visited the directors and staff, desk to  desk, in Columbia, Lexington, Aiken,  Barnwell,  Orangeburg,  Hampton,  Ridgeland, and Beaufort.  I want  to  thank the energetic, optimistic, and  talented employees and commissioners  of the Employment Security Commission for their dedication to helping put  people back to work.  Another  economic  development  is  being announced  for South Carolina  today. The Estill Correctional Facility  is adding 50 more jobs with a biomass  contract with Ameresco. We welcome  the recent economic commitments to  our State from Four Star Industries,  Boeing, DHL,  Scotsman  Ice, Dixie  Narco, Ameresco at SRS, and now Estill Correctional Facility. The combination of low taxes, worker training,  right-to-work protections, and less regulatory redtape is a sound recipe to attract business. This commonsense approach should be applied at the national level.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th in the global war on terrorism.  f  HONORING BOBBY SALCEDO  (Ms. CHU asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)

2,House,111,0.133,2,2010-01-13,Mr. CAO.," Madam Speaker, the New  Orleans Saints are having a historic  season. This success has benefited our  city tremendously. And with their first  playoff game kicking off this Saturday,  I wanted to give constituents a chance  to honor them. Today’s statement is  from Jewelyn Wellborn.  Jewelyn writes: ‘‘The reason we are  proud of the Saints, the reason we rally  behind them, has less to do with the  scoreboard and more to do with the  heart, soul, and fire of the city. Your  average New Orleanian is characterized  by different concepts that seem so opposite of one another. There are those  who have always called New Orleans  home and some who came for only a  few years and fell in love.  ‘‘Watching the Saints helps us escape  from rebuilding, yet reminds us of why  we came home. The Saints are an exact  reflection of us, our city, our home,  and that’s why the Saints are my home  team.’’  HEALTH CARE AND THE ECONOMY  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2010
3,House,111,-0.404,2,2010-01-13,Mr. BUTTERFIELD.," Madam Speaker, the American people continue to  struggle in this difficult economy. One  of the counties in my North Carolina  district  is  now  suffering with  the  State’s highest unemployment  rate.  Yes, people are hurting and need to be  put back to work. The transformation  of our Nation’s health care system represents an enormous opportunity to  create jobs and fuel economic growth.  Each year, our health care reform  plan will create 250,000 to 400,000 jobs.  These reforms will also allow small  business  to add an estimated  80,000  jobs. Without these reforms, the health  care premiums paid by businesses in  coming years will more than double.  Money needlessly spent on health care  premiums by small businesses is really  needed to hire workers, increase salaries, and refuel the economy.  Madam Speaker, Americans cannot  afford the status quo. Doing nothing is  not an option. I urge my colleagues to  join us in improving the health care delivery system.  f  AMERICAN CONSERVATION AND  CLEAN ENERGY ACT  (Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

5,House,111,0.343,9,2010-01-13,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 981,  supporting continued political and economic  development in Ukraine.  It has been 18 years since Ukraine joined  the  family of  free and  independent nations,  much of that due to the commitment shown by  the  people  of  Ukrainian  heritage  living  throughout the world including those in Southeast Michigan.  And today, Ukraine is a great friend and ally  of the United States and a model for nations  who made the transformation from tyranny to  freedom. They have been stalwart partners in  the War on Terror—sending troops to support  International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The U.S.-based  human  rights watchdog  Freedom House designated Ukraine as a free  country for the fourth consecutive year in its  2010 Freedom in the World survey. It is all the  more encouraging because according to Freedom House, 2009 marked the fourth consecutive year in which global freedom suffered a  decline.  It is time that we gave the people of Ukraine  the recognition  they deserve  for  their exemplary economic progress and continued democratic ambitions, especially as  their presidential elections approach next week.  The Ukrainian people bravely demonstrated  their desire for a free, democratic, and prosperous country through nonviolent protest during  the 2004 Orange Revolution and  this  year’s election is a testament to the enduring  strength of the Ukrainian democracy. It is my  sincere hope that the elections are conducted  in a fair, free and transparent manner.  The  Ukrainian  population  in  Southeast  Michigan is one of the largest—if not the largest, in the nation. These Ukrainian Americans  are great citizens and great Patriots, and for  years Ukrainians fought against Soviet oppression on behalf of freedom, so it is my honor  to serve the 10th Congressional District and  the Ukrainian-Americans who live there; and  this Nation is proud to call Ukraine and her  people friends and allies.  A strong, sovereign,  independent, democratic, and economically prosperous Ukraine is  important to the interests of the United States  and  to achieving peace, prosperity and stability in Europe, so I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.  ",2010
6,House,111,0.221,9,2010-01-13,Mr. GERLACH.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today in strong support of H. Res. 981, which  supports the continued political and economic  development in Ukraine. This important resolution represents another step in our continued  efforts to support the Ukrainian people in their  efforts to fully integrate into the Euro-Atlantic  community of democratic nations.  On January 17th, Ukraine will hold its presidential election with a subsequent run-off held  on February 7th. This election represents a  critical moment not only for Ukraine, but for  the region as a whole. As Ukraine continues  along the path of economic and political integration,  it  is my hope  that  the presidential  election will be conducted in a free, fair, and  transparent manner.  As a co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, I believe it is important to encourage closer ties between the United States and  Ukraine. This relationship must be one that is  continually  fostered and strengthened, both  politically and economically. By expressing our  support  for  free and democratic elections,  Congress can assist the Ukrainian people in  their efforts  to  join  the  larger Euro-Atlantic  community of democratic nations.  I would  like  to  thank  the Chairman and  Ranking Member for their continued support of  legislation aimed at strengthening the ties of  the United States with a key ally in Eastern  Europe and encouraging fair and democratic  elections.  In  light of  the  recent economic  struggles of Ukraine, our support and continued friendship is critical.  Madam Speaker,  I urge my colleagues  to  vote in favor of H. Res. 981 and in favor of  continued friendship and support for Ukraine  and  the Ukrainian people  in  their efforts  to  fully integrate into the Euro-Atlantic community  of democratic nations.  b1100  ",2010

Res. 970) congratulating Flint native, University of Alabama  sophomore, and  running back  Mark  Ingram  on winning  the  2009  Heisman Trophy and honoring both his  athletic and academic achievements.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 970  Whereas Mark Ingram was raised in Flint,  Michigan;  Whereas Mark  Ingram  attended Grand  Blanc Community High School and Flint  Southwestern Academy, where he distinguished himself as a running back and cornerback;  Whereas Mark Ingram was a 4-year starter  in high school, and rushed for 4,926 yards and  58 touchdowns in his final 2 seasons;  Whereas, during his high school football  career, Mark Ingram was honored with the  Saginaw Valley MVP Award, named Area  Player of the Year, and was an All-State selection;  Whereas, in 2009, Mark Ingram led the University of Alabama to the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Championship and rushed 113  yards and scored 3 touchdowns in the championship game;  Whereas, in 2009, Mark Ingram broke the  University of Alabama single-season rushing  record with 1,542 yards, was named the SEC  offensive player of the year, scored 18 total  touchdowns, and finished the season with 322  receiving yards;  Whereas, in 2009, Mark Ingram was named  an All SEC First Team Selection, a Walter  Camp 1st team All-American, and an American Football Coaches Association All-American;  Whereas Mark Ingram is the first Heisman  Trophy winner from the University of Alabama;  Whereas Mark Ingram is only the third  sophomore in history to win the Heisman  Trophy;  Whereas Mark Ingram has made the Dean’s  List at the University of Alabama;  Whereas Mark  Ingram’s Heisman win  brings tremendous pride to his hometown of  Flint, Michigan;  Whereas, December 12, 2009, has been declared Mark Ingram Day in the City of Flint;  Whereas the sport of football is an important national  pastime  that helps  foster  teamwork, leadership skills, sportsmanship,  and camaraderie; and  Whereas football can help build self-esteem  and promote exercise and a more active and  healthy lifestyle: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives congratulates Flint native and running  back Mark  Ingram on winning  the  2009  Heisman Trophy and honors both his athletic and academic achievements.

I am honored to join with  the  gentlemen  from Michigan  and  Georgia, and I am certainly delighted  and honored to associate myself with  the remarks of the gentleman  from  California and his work in establishing  the Martin Luther King, Jr. Federal  holiday. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.  ",2010
10,House,111,-0.529,16,2010-01-13,Mr. HONDA.," Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1002, honoring  the  life and  work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and encouraging the continued commitment to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a national day of service.  Through the Martin Luther King, Jr. National  Day of Service, we honor Dr. King’s noble vision of equality and message of compassion.  Dr. King preached peace  in  the  fight  for  equality, shaking the foundations of segregation with  love  for others, even  those who  sought  to oppose his vision. His unyielding  commitment  to  non-violent  resistance  anchored his messages, and his  ‘‘I Have a  Dream’’  speech  changed  America  and  sparked  a movement  that  embraced  civil  rights, justice, equality and human dignity for  all. This is a movement that we must continue  to fight for and protect.  We have celebrated considerable successes  due  to Dr. King’s Dream. Housing, schools  and transportation are now accessible by all  Americans.  Indeed,  in 2008 Americans  took  another great step toward realizing Dr. King’s  vision by electing America’s first African-American  President,  Barack  Obama.  These  achievements were not easily won, but Dr.  King’s Dream has proven resilient and it has  persevered.  As a Representative of Silicon Valley, one  of  the most ethnically diverse areas of  the  country,  I appreciate Dr. King’s message of  equality. As Chair of the Congressional Asian  Pacific American Caucus, CAPAC, I recognize  the great strides that have been made since  Dr. King sparked the historic civil rights movement, and CAPAC has continued to vigilantly  ensure equal opportunity remains accessible  to all. For his vision and sacrifices, we owe Dr.  King a great debt of gratitude for his service  and leadership to our Nation, and there is no  better way  to express  that gratitude  than  through our own personal service to the Nation.  The Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service  will serve to remind Americans that we should  all take the time to contribute to our communities. This day continues to pay tribute to the  life and actions of a great man, as we continue  to  foster  brotherhood  and  service  amongst our friends, neighbors, and communities. Since its designation as a federal holiday in 1994, Americans have Dr. King’s birthday to act on his ideals. It has been a day to  improve  lives,  bridge  social  barriers,  and  change our Nation into the ‘‘Beloved Community’’ that Dr. King had hoped to see during his  life. Thanks  in part  to  the commitment we  have shown  to honor Dr. King,  the Day of  Service continues to grow in popularity as a  chance  for citizens, business  leaders, and  public officials alike to contribute to their communities.  In 2009 alone, over 13,000 Martin  Luther King, Jr. Day of Service projects occurred  throughout  the Nation, honoring  the  Dream of Dr. King.  I am pleased that the constituents of California’s 15th District have answered this call to  service as a tribute to Dr. King’s life. Constituents of all backgrounds volunteer to remove  graffiti, pick up litter, improve parks, and engage in other activities that aim to selflessly  improve the world around them. Though each  individual’s effort may be small, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service provides the medium to combine an individual’s energies with  those of his or her neighbors. The resulting  collaboration is an impactful and tangible celebration of Dr. King’s messages.  As we near  the day of remembrance, we  must  recognize  that  the  fight goes on. Dr.  King’s Dream embodies an ideal for our Nation  to pursue—Americans of all ethnicities  and creeds,  living  together with dignity and  hope. To admire Dr. King’s life requires us to  follow his  legacy. Let us honor his  life by  working together to continue to build an America where every child enjoys all the privileges  of equal opportunity and freedom.

11,House,111,-0.353,23,2010-01-13,Mr. LYNCH.," Madam Speaker, I move  to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 692) to provide that claims of the  United States to certain documents relating to Franklin Delano Roosevelt  shall be treated as waived and relinquished in certain circumstances.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:  S. 692  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN  DOCUMENTS  RELATING  TO  FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT.  (a) INGENERAL.—If any person or entity  makes a gift of any property described in  subsection (b) to the National Archives and  Records Administration, then any claim of  the United States to such property shall be  treated as having been waived and relinquished on the day before the date of such  gift.  (b) PROPERTYDESCRIBED.—Property is described in this subsection if such property—  (1) is a part of the collection of documents,  papers, and memorabilia relating to Franklin Delano Roosevelt or any member of his  family or staff; and  (2) was in the possession of Grace Tully  and retained by her at the time of her death.  (c) DATEOFGIFT.—The date of a gift referred to in subsection (a) is any date specified by the donor so long as such date is subsequent to the physical delivery of the property described in subsection (b) to the National Archives and Records Administration.  ",2010
12,House,111,0.445,23,2010-01-13,Mr. LUETKEMEYER.," Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  S. 692 is identical to House Resolution 1506, which passed the House on  November 16. Therefore, I want to reiterate the points made previously during debate on the House bill. This bill  will waive certain claims of the United  States to specific documents, known as  the  Tully  Collection,  relating  to  Franklin  Delano  Roosevelt.  Grace  Tully served in Franklin Roosevelt’s  secretarial staff  for several decades,  and in 1941, became his personal secretary. After her death, her collection  of papers passed through a number of  hands and finally to the current owners, Sun Times Media, who bought the  collection for $8 million in 2001.  In 2004, the National Archives asserted a claim to a portion of the documents. Sun Times Media wishes to donate the collection to President Roosevelt’s Presidential Library in Hyde  Park, New York, and take a tax deduction. Due to the Archives claim, Sun  Times Media is prevented from receiving a tax deduction on the donation.  This bill waives the legal claims of the  United States and the Archives, thereby clearing the way for the tax deduction and the donation.  I understand the Archives has offered  to support this legislation in a letter to  the committee. Nevertheless, I want to  again highlight two points: The majority moved this bill without a hearing.  We should have had a better understanding of  legislation  relinquishing  the Federal Government’s claims while  benefiting  certain  private  entities  through tax breaks. Given the multiple, ongoing instances of mismanagement of the Archives, we should have  the opportunity on the committee to  review all legislation relating to this  agency.  ",2010
13,,111,0.655,65,2010-01-13,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor  the  life  and  memory  of  Paula  Nowakowski, and  to express my deep sadness over her passing.  Paula, the dedicated chief of staff to House  Republican Leader JOHNBOEHNER, died unexpectedly  last Saturday evening, January 9,  2010, at the young age of 46.  Her death leaves a void on Capitol Hill that  can never be filled. Paula was a true professional and a devoted patriot on behalf of her  country.  During  twenty-five years of public service,  Paula spent fifteen years as a faithful aide to  Leader BOEHNERand proved herself to be a  woman of integrity and compassion.  And as we all know, it is difficult to overstate  the love she held for her home in Michigan.  Paula will not only be remembered for her  work on the Hill, but for her tireless efforts off  the Hill as well.  Paula  worked  extensively,  on  Leader  BOEHNER’s behalf,  in developing an annual  gala  to benefit Catholic schools  in Washington, D.C. Over the last six years, this gala  has offered more than $5 million in support for  local Catholic schools struggling to keep their  doors open.  If further proof was needed of Paula’s impact in the lives of so many, look no further  than a Facebook page that in just a few days  has signed up over 650 individuals to honor  Paula’s memory.  This past weekend, Congress lost a talented  public servant and House Republicans lost a  dear friend.  As one  leadership aide noted, Paula  manded excellence.’’  May we continue our work on behalf of the  American people the way Paula would have  wanted us to—in a manner that promotes excellence.  On behalf of my family and staff, I extend  my sincere  thoughts and prayers  to Paula’s  family, friends and to the entire staff at the Republican Leader’s office, as they cope with this  incalculable loss.  May God comfort them during this difficult  time.  ‘‘deANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2010
14,House,111,-0.686,79,2010-01-13,Ms. LEE of California.," Thank you  very much, Congressman PAYNE. Let  me thank you  for that presentation  and also for putting Haiti in a historical context. It is important that we  recognize and remember the history of  how our foreign policy and our relations with Haiti have been so important  in  the  past, which  now  has  brought us to this day.  So, today, we are talking about how  we can respond in an emergency way  and in a manner that will help the Haitian people take care of the sick and  that will help with these search and  LEE JACKSON rescue efforts. I also thank you for reminding us that we have to help Haiti  to move forward and to rebuild and recover.  Now I would like to ask Congresswoman SHEILAJACKSONLEE to speak.  Congresswoman  is  a  member  of  the Homeland Security  Committee, but also she was very instrumental  in the Katrina response.  She provided many, many ways and vehicles for Katrina survivors to live and  to have a decent place to stay until  they could return home, and she ensured that FEMA was responsive to  their needs. She really took on many,  many issues as it relates to hurricane  survivors. Now she  is working very  hard as it relates to the earthquake in  Haiti.  So thank you again, Congresswoman  JACKSONLEE. Let me just remind you,  and  I was  listening to Congressman  PAYNE, that I come from an area that  is earthquake-prone. It is hard to imagine what a 7.0 or a 7.1 earthquake is on  the Richter scale given our experience  with, maybe, a 4 or a 5 or a 6. So this  is really an earthquake of enormous  magnitude that those of us who come  from earthquake-prone regions recognize and understand.  Thank you, Congresswoman JACKSON  LEE.  ",2010
15,House,111,-0.458,79,2010-01-13,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Let me  thank Congresswoman BARBARALEE,  our chairperson, who raised the red  flag and who let out the siren and gathered us together, and I want to respond  to what she just said about the earthquake.  It rocks you in your soul; 7.0 on the  Richter scale is hair-raising. I would  also argue that it puts your hair on  fire. I still have a sense that I am trembling because it’s unimaginable. As you  have just indicated, we look to California, and we get very nervous about  our friends and family who are there  when we hear of a 2, of a 3 or of a 4. I  recall in the northern California area  when there was an earthquake that impacted the baseball game and the baseball stadium, and it was all over the  news. It was not a 7.0.  So I would just simply say that we  rise here with all solemnness. We are  not speechless, but we are trembling  for those who are now in the eye of  devastation.  I, too, rise to thank the Congressional Black Caucus, of which I am a  member, to thank all of those who  have been in meetings, as we have been  throughout this morning and yesterday, and on a conference call that occurred. Work is going on as we speak  and the concern that we have for those  who we have been able to see only  through, to a certain extent, still pictures, though I know many of our cable  networks in particular have been making their way there, and other networks, to be able to deliver the devastation to us.  I  express my appreciation  to  the  President of the United States, who  moved swiftly. There was no hesitation  on  the  commitment  that President  Barack Obama had. In fact, he quickly  offered his prayers, but he acknowledged the devastation, making note of  the fact that he had seen collapsed hospitals,  crumbled  homes, men  and  women carrying their  injured neighbors to the streets. He acknowledged  that it was truly heart-wrenching, sufficient to make you tremble. So, moving swiftly, he directed his administration  to coordinate  in an aggressive  manner to save lives.  The people of Haiti will have the full  support of the United States in the urgent efforts to rescue those trapped beneath the rubble and to deliver the humanitarian relief—the food, the water,  and  the medicine—the Haitians will  need. He has authorized that USAID  and the Departments of State and Defense work closely together, and he has  mobilized large numbers of individuals,  including our military efforts.  I also want to take note that the Secretary of Homeland Security has indicated that our resources, including the  United States Coast Guard and FEMA,  will be there, which we have jurisdiction over—my committee has jurisdiction  over—and Chairman THOMPSON  will be intimately involved in pushing  the efforts of making sure that FEMA  and the U.S. Coast Guard are there.  Google ‘‘7.0’’ and get a sense of how  deeply devastating that is and that it  hit one of the most populated areas,  Port-au-Prince. It damaged buildings  extensively. We saw the palace collapse, not riddled by bullet holes, but  literally collapse. How  fortunate we  can say we were, the fact that this  came at 6 o’clock when we understand  that many of the workers in the palace  and the government were already gone,  but we know that government officials  may have lost their lives. It is said  that many of the United Nations personnel and peacekeeping troops have  lost their lives, and so we can’t put  this at a level of seriousness by just  our voices and our words.  Let me  thank  the U.S. Southern  Command that is deploying a team of  30 people to Haiti to support U.S. relief  efforts in the aftermath of yesterday’s  devastating earthquake. Let me also  mention that the team will  include  U.S. military  engineers, operational  planners,  a  command-and-control  group, and communications specialists.  They will arrive in Haiti on two C–130  Hercules aircraft. For those who don’t  know or who can’t imagine, those are  huge,  boat-like  aircraft which  can  carry an enormous amount of equipment.  Chairman LEE, I think one of the important  issues that  I am very concerned about and would like to get a  report on is how many aircraft—let me  just use the right terminology—large  ships can carry heavy equipment. We  know in the war zones that there are  large aircraft that can carry heavy  equipment, and the equipment I am  thinking of in particular would be the  Earth-moving machines, the machines  that can assist in finding the loss.

16,House,111,0.628,86,2010-01-13,Mr. NEUGEBAUER.," Well, I thank the  gentleman for pointing out the taxes  that are in this bill. I think the bad  news is that they’re going to have to be  higher tax because they are disguising,  as you know, what this bill actually  costs. Now the stated cost that the  Speaker of the House says is this bill  costs $891 billion. But if you add the  mandated cost of the employer-mandating tax,  it’s another $135 billion.  And if you add the cost of individual  mandate tax for individuals that are  going to be penalized under this plan,  it’s another $33 billion. So the total  cost, the CBO score is $1.06 billion.  You don’t hear the Speaker or the  leadership or  the President  talking  about this number. Now the other piece  is that in the House bill, there is no  provision for what is being called the  ‘‘doc fix.’’ Today we have reimbursement levels that are being projected to  be  reduced  by  a  substantial  level,  which is going to cause more and more  doctors not to see Medicare and Medicaid patients. So this leadership team  has promised and made a deal with the  docs that they will bring a separate  bill. They don’t want to bring it in this  one because, why? It cost $209 billion.  So now instead of $1.06, you have got a  nearly a $1.2 trillion bill.  Now the other piece is that Medicaid  is being transferred to—part of this  cost is going to be Medicaid which is  going to be transferred to States, unless you’re from Nebraska. What is the  cost of that? That’s $34 billion. Now  here is the real sleeper. I hope that the  American people are watching C–SPAN  and the like because the lights are on  here, and the lights are on this chart.  And guess what, this little bill collects  taxes that the gentleman was talking  about for 10 years, but it only has expenses for 7 years.  Now think about all of the businesses  and families all across America that if  you could collect 10 years’ worth of salary but you only had to pay 7 years’  worth of expenses, that’s like the first  3 years you don’t have to make your  house payment, you don’t have to buy  your gasoline, you don’t have to make  your car payment. You just get your  paycheck. Nothing taken out of it, no  Social Security, no withholding. What  a great deal that would be. Well, that’s  the way this bill has been put together  in order to disguise the real cost of  this.  So once  the  3-year period passes,  then on an annualized basis, this bill  costs another $727 billion more than  what is being represented to the American people. So what does that total?  $2.1 trillion. So a bill that this leadership says is $891 billion—it’s not $891  billion. It’s $2.1 trillion. And at a time  in which, as the gentleman was talking  about, small businesses are struggling  to keep their doors open—in my district—and I think the gentleman’s district as well—small businesses play a  huge part  in creating  jobs. Who  is  going to pay this $2.1 trillion? Because  the taxes that they’re talking about  collecting only pay for a bill that costs  $891 billion, but this bill costs $2.1 trillion.  Now here’s the other thing that people have looked at: this bill mandates,  as both of my friends know, mandates  that every American have health insurance. And in fact, if you don’t, there is  a penalty for it. So one of the things,  people say that if the government is requiring to you do something to pay for  health care or to have health care, and  there is a penalty for doing it, it becomes a tax or a cost. Some people who  have kind  of  calculated what  that  means for the economy, GDP and overall, said maybe that’s a $4 trillion number. So possibly what we are looking  at, if we shed light on this bill, as we  should, that really the impact of this is  that it’s a $6 trillion piece of legislation.  Now I don’t know about you, but I  think the American people think that  whether it’s $2 trillion or $6 trillion or  even $891 billion that we should have  had more debate than we did on this  bill. As my colleagues will remember  on the day that we passed this bill,  very  little debate was—I  think one  amendment—there was one amendment  to a $2 trillion—to a $6 trillion bill was  allowed.  These are the kinds of things that  cause me to say, Mr. President, we  have to hit the pause button here because we’re talking about something  that impacts families all across America. We have some numbers here that  are big. We are now spending money  that we don’t have. Every dollar that  the government spends, they have to  go out and borrow nearly 40 cents of  that  from people,  like  in China and  Japan; and  it  is not a  sustainable  thing. Yet now we’re talking about  more taxes and I think potentially bigger deficits because we’ve not had good  discussions on this bill.  Now I will yield some additional time  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania to  reflect on these important issues again.  ",2010
17,House,111,0.307,86,2010-01-13,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.,"  Well, I thank my good friend for yielding. I just want to come back. You hit  on such an incredible point about the  individual mandate to purchase health  insurance. Now I wouldn’t consider myself in any way a constitutional scholar. I’m just an American and a citizen.  But my good friend here has a copy of  the Constitution. And as I’ve read in  the version of the Constitution that I  carry around, which is about 28 pages,  I think that was put together by some  really smart people a long time ago  that has withstood the test of time.  And really our Constitution has become a model for other countries and  emerging countries to base their governing principles on. But to the best of  my knowledge, I can’t recall that there  is anything in that Constitution that  provides a basis  for Congress mandating that every individual American  in this country purchase health insurance.  I will yield to the gentleman with the  pocket Constitution there to just see  what his thoughts are on that.  ",2010

20,,111,-0.343,100,2010-01-13,Ms. SCHWARTZ.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor and congratulate the Honorable  Hyland R. Johns on the occasion of his retirement after 36 years of faithful service to the  borough of Bryn Athyn, a close-knit community  northeast of Philadelphia. I am honored to represent Mayor Johns and the entire Bryn Athyn  community in Congress.  Before being elected to Bryn Athyn borough  council in 1971, Mr. Johns served both as a  volunteer with the Bryn Athyn Fire Company  and as borough zoning officer. He was elected  to the borough council in 1971 and one year  later became vice president. Mr. Johns held  the position of vice president until 1975 when  he became borough council president. His  service as president lasted for nine years until  he was elected mayor. During his tenure as  mayor, the borough of Bryn Athyn prospered.  Bryn Athyn is home to the Bryn Athyn Cathedral, Cairnwood, and Glencairn Museum.  Under Mr. Johns’ leadership, the historic district of Bryn Athyn—which contains these local  landmarks—was officially designated a National Historic Landmark. As Mayor, Mr. Johns  served as a charming, enthusiastic, informed  ambassador to neighboring residents, communities, businesses, organizations, and leaders  in the region, sharing the unique significance  of Bryn Athyn’s architecture and religious heritage.  Before his career as a  local official, Mr.  Johns faithfully served his country during the  Second World War in the Navy’s Construction  Battalion. Mr. Johns went on to earn a graduate degree in Urban Forestry from Michigan  State University. He is an active member of  his church, has served on  the board of  the  Academy of the New Church, and serves on  the board of the Pennypack Ecological Restoration Trust. Under Mayor Johns’ leadership,  the Academy of the New Church has continued  to expand, with  the Mitchell Performing  Arts Center opening in 2002.  Madam Speaker,  once  again  I  applaud  Mayor Johns  for his dedication, service and  accomplishments as an elected official  for  nearly four decades. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to him on the momentous occasion of his retirement from public office.  f  IN HONOR OF CAPTAIN LUTHER H.  SMITH,  JR.,  U.S.  ARMY  AIR  FORCES  HON.

21,,111,-0.271,100,2010-01-13,Mr. SESTAK.," Madam Speaker, I would like  to honor today the memory of a great American hero, Captain Luther H. Smith, Jr., U.S.  Army Air Forces, who will be buried with full  military honors in Arlington National Cemetery  on Friday, 15 January. Captain Smith was one  of  the original Tuskegee Airmen, a highly  decorated World War II prisoner of war, a recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal, the  first  African-American  aerospace  engineer  hired by General Electric  in  its Missile and  Space Operations  in Philadelphia, a  loving  husband and father, and a longtime resident  of Villanova, PA.  Captain Smith was born  in Des Moines,  Iowa  on September  27,  1920. His  early  dreams to serve as a military aviator were fulfilled when he joined the U.S. Army Air Forces  and began  training at Alabama’s Tuskegee  Army Air Field and Tuskegee Institute. One of  the  first African Americans  to become a  licensed pilot, Captain Smith began his military  career in 1943. He flew 133 combat missions  with  the 332nd Fighter Group as a combat  fighter pilot over Europe. He was severely  wounded on his last mission on Friday, 13 October 1944, and spent the next seven months  in enemy hospitals and prison camps before  being  liberated  in May 1945 by  the Allied  forces. During his distinguished military career,  Captain Smith destroyed 2 German aircraft in  aerial conflicts and 10 aircraft in ground strafing attacks. Captain Smith was awarded the  Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with  6 Oak Leaf Clusters,  the Purple Heart,  the  Prisoner of War Medal, and 8 European Theater Campaign Ribbons.  After retiring from the U.S. Army Air Forces,  Captain Smith completed his engineering education at the University of Iowa, earning a B.S.  in mechanical engineering. He was hired by  General Electric where he was  involved  in  projects for the Air Force, the Navy Submarine  Command, and NASA. His work included missile and jet engine design and he published  numerous papers and was awarded two patents.  Following his retirement from GE in 1988,  Captain Smith was active in support of local  civic causes, serving as the vice-chairman of  the Radnor Township (PA) School Board and  on  the Board of  the Delaware County (PA)  Community College.  He also was  instrumental  in capturing  the  history  of  the  Tuskegee Airmen—so  that  present and future generations of Americans  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

I applaud Mr.  Morgan for this monumental achievement.  Currently a partner at Bingham McHale LLP  in Indianapolis, Mr. Rod Morgan’s legal career  has been vast and varied. His career has  touched upon nearly every aspect of jurisprudence from serving as an Army Judge Advocate General, to acting as a legal advisor to  numerous military and political  leaders,  to  teaching law and writing scholarly papers. Mr.  Morgan is also an active member of the community, serving on numerous boards and associations, recently serving as president of the  Indianapolis Black Chamber of Commerce and  chairman of  the Partnership  for Affordable  Housing. His election as president of the Indiana State Bar Association marks yet another  milestone in an exemplary career.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Mr. Rod Morgan and wishing him the  best of luck in his latest endeavor.  f  IN HONOR AND REMEMBRANCE OF  ELIZABETH JOYCE COSSER  HON. DENNIS J.

23,,111,-0.582,107,2010-01-13,Mr. KUCINICH.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today in honor and remembrance of Elizabeth  Joyce Cosser, lovingly known as ‘‘Nan’’ treasured grandmother of my wife, Elizabeth, and  dearest mother and matriarch.  Mrs. Cosser was born  in 1923 and spent  her childhood in the beautiful, rolling farmlands  of Nottinghamshire and  later South Downs,  England. Nan’s unyielding love for the natural  world, great joy of learning, deep commitment  to family and sense of service to others was  deeply rooted in her childhood. Moreover, Nan  was raised to believe that girls were just as  worthy as boys, and her fierce independence,  courage and outspokenness shone throughout  her life—and began during an era when women’s rights and opportunities were still non-existent. A  trailblazer  in so many ways—Nan  was a  feminist and environmentalist before  those words existed in the world’s consciousness.  As a young woman, Nan ventured out on  her own, eventually leaving home to become  a nurse. During WWII, Nan’s  family homestead, Blackcap Farm, was destroyed by Canadian Troops who  leveled  the countryside  with rounds and mortars during training maneuvers. At that same time, Nan worked as a  nurse, tending to wounded soldiers amidst air  raids and heaving bombing,  in Brighton and  the East End. After  the war, Nan continued  her chosen vocation of nursing, specializing in  delivering babies. She became a community  midwife, and delivered 1,265 babies, including  Elizabeth, her namesake and granddaughter.  Nan coveted nature, and was on the forefront of the green movement and animal rights  causes.  In  her  spare  time, Nan  planted  trees—thousands of trees. To this day, thick  groves of chestnut, oak, buckeye and hazelnut  trees grow along the country paths in Belhus  Woods in Essex—all planted by Nan.  Nan taught by example, instilling in her children and grandchild a true love and respect  for the earth and for each other. Beyond her  love of gardening, Nan spent time with family  on numerous outdoor adventures. She guided  her grandchildren  through  the  countryside,  gathering berries which she later transformed  into pies, jams, wine and even vodka. Her artistic talents and interests were extensive and  varied; Nan excelled at painting, embroidery,  knitting and pottery, and her adventurous spirit  led  her  to  journey  to  places  around  the  world—researching  the history of  the culture  wherever she went.  Nan combined her love of history and art,  creating beautiful works depicting momentous  eras and  individuals  in world history. Nan’s  keen  interest  in England’s royal  lineage  led  her  to embark on an extensive project  in  which she researched every king and queen in  England, dating back 1,000 years. Her  research then inspired her to create an incredible series of pottery busts reflecting, in detail,  the likeness and aura of royalty dating back  one thousand years!  Madam Speaker and Colleagues, please  join me in honor and recognition of Elizabeth  Joyce  ‘‘Nan’’ Cosser, whose kind and generous  heart  drew  others  to  her.  Nan’s  strength, integrity, and love for the world and  its  inhabitants, will  forever  live within  the  hearts of all us who knew and loved her well,  and will forever reflect from the branches and  leaves of the towering oak and chestnut trees  along  the English countryside—forever connecting us all in the cycle of life.

These issues include matters of national security,  financial security, economic security,  and the future of our health care system. Last  November, I asked residents of the 10th Congressional District I have the privilege to represent  to share  their  thoughts with me on  these and many other pressing  issues. To  date, more than 31,500 have responded to my  survey which included 26 questions on a wide  range of legislative matters. In addition, almost  half of those who responded provided some  very helpful additional comments about other  matters of interest to them. In order to certify  the accuracy of the results, I had an outside  firm  tabulate  the  surveys before  returning  them to me to review the comments.  Madam Speaker,  following my  remarks,  I  will  include  for  the benefit of my colleagues  the complete results of my Town Hall by Mail  survey.

26,,111,-0.267,114,2010-01-13,Mr. MOORE of Kansas.," Madam Speaker,  before my election to the House of Representatives, I served for several years as an elected member of  the board of  trustees  for  the  Johnson County Community College in Overland Park, Kansas. This excellent community  college is the crown jewel of my home community, and I was very proud to be associated  with this outstanding institution of higher education.  During my board service, I got to know Dr.  Sally Winship who served as dean of the College’s Continuing Education and Community  Services. This month, Dr. Winship is retiring  after working as a community college educator  and administrator for 37 years. She retires as  vice president of  the College’s Workforce,  Community and Economic Development Department, and has also served as president of  the JCCC Center  for Business and Technology.  Sally was originally trained as a dental hygienist and became coordinator of the JCCC  program before becoming assistant dean of  the Science, Health Care and Math Division in  1987. She received her B.S. degree from Armstrong State College, and then obtained her  M.S. degree  from Columbia University, and  her doctorate in education from the University  of Kansas.  During Sally’s time at the college, the outstanding Regnier Center for Technology and  Business was designed, built, and opened.  Her responsibilities included managing over 60  full-time staff and 550 part-time faculty, as well  as managing programs serving over 155,000  participants and 480 area businesses.  Sally worked hard  to make  the Johnson  County Community College this area’s workforce development  resource  for  the greater  Kansas City business community. During her  time at the college, it grew in student population,  course  offerings,  campus  buildings,  prestige and reputation.  Madam Speaker, I join Sally’s many friends  and colleagues in wishing her health, happiness, and prosperity  for  the next chapter of  her life, and in thanking her for her many, important contributions to our community.  f  IN MEMORY OF JAMES TERRELL  JORDAN  HON.

27,,111,-0.201,114,2010-01-13,Mr. ROSS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  honor the memory of James Terrell Jordan of  Monticello, Arkansas, who passed away on  December 27, 2009, at the age of 84. Having  fought  for  freedom  in World War  II, James  then committed his life to the people of Arkansas through public office for over five decades.  James was born in Drew County, Arkansas,  to his  late parents Alvin and Linnie Jordan,  and attended schools in Monticello and California. He was a member of  the 101st Airborne Division in World War II, serving as a  paratrooper  and  receiving  a Purple Heart  Medal.  Following  active  duty  on  the  frontlines,  James returned to serve his community beginning as Drew Country treasurer in 1956. He  then served as county judge for eight years  before becoming mayor of Monticello  for 17  years. Having also given his time and energy  to numerous agencies, councils and committees, James was awarded  the  ‘‘Man of  the  Year’’ award in 1985 from the Drew County  Chamber of Commerce.  James was elected to the Arkansas House  of Representatives in 1986 and served for 12  years. Representing District 92, he served on  the Committee on City, County and Local Affairs and the Committee on Public Transportation. His lifetime love of education led to his  eventual appointment to the University of Arkansas Board of Visitors by Governor Mike  Huckabee.  I had  the distinct privilege of serving with  James during my time in the Arkansas state  legislature and he was someone I respected  and trusted for sincere advice and counsel. As  an  admired  and  respected  public  officer,  James worked tirelessly to better the lives of  those around him.  James was well known  for  far more  than  being a member of the Greatest Generation  who committed himself to the state he loved  so much; he was also known to many as a  good friend and role model.  My thoughts and prayers and those of every  Arkansan are with his wife, Bonnie; two sons,  Terrell and Jerry; daughter, Cindy; his nine  grandchildren, eight great grandchildren and  the rest of his family and friends during this  difficult time. James will be profoundly missed  and the people of Arkansas are deeply grateful to his lifetime of exemplary effort and legacy of community service and leadership.  f  TRIBUTE TO MARIE LOUISE  ANDERSON GREENWOOD  HON.

I ask unanimous consent the pending  amendments be temporarily set aside  so I can call up one of my amendments  under the previous order.  ",2010
29,Senate,111,-0.266,12,2010-01-25,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President,  I  want to speak for a few minutes about  the upcoming  confirmation vote on  Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve Board. I should begin by stating  very clearly that there is no way to  overestimate the severity of the economic downturn  that began  in  this  country in 2007. To date, our Nation  has lost 7.2 million jobs. In my home  State of New Mexico, unemployment is  now 7.8 percent. That  is more than  twice the rate it was 2 years ago. But  even at that it is considerably lower  than the unemployment rate in many  States—in fact, in a majority of States.  American households have  lost $12.6  trillion in wealth; more than 5 million  American  families  have  seen  their  homes foreclosed, many have lost their  businesses, and many have lost their  farms. In short, there are millions of  families across our country who are  and have been experiencing severe economic pain and dislocation. While indicators suggest the recession has officially ended, our economy is hardly out  of the woods.  In the face of such pain, it is tempting to grasp for ways to demonstrate  disapproval of the economic downturn  or to put distance between ourselves as  elected officials and the policies  involved with the economic downturn. It  is tempting, particularly in this political climate, to want to seize on a particular individual to take the brunt of  the criticism.  I rise today to urge my colleagues  not to use Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke’s renomination for any  such exercise. I rise to offer my strong  support  for his reconfirmation. With  the benefit of hindsight, it now seems  the Fed might have done more to prevent  the  economic downturn. Some  have pointed to  financial  institution  bailouts and have argued that the Fed  should not have provided financial support or guarantees to vulnerable financial  institutions.

Professor Peterson has been nominated to be a U.S. District Judge for  the Eastern District of Washington. I  have no doubt that she will be an excellent Federal judge.  It  is  important to ensure that all  branches of our government, including  the judiciary, reflect diversity. If confirmed, Professor Peterson would be  the first woman to serve on the U.S.  District Court for the Eastern District  of Washington.  Rosanna Peterson is currently an Assistant Professor of Law at Gonzaga  University. She teaches Evidence, Federal Jurisdiction, and Trial Advocacy.  She  also  runs  the  law  school’s  externship  program. Previously,  she  worked as an attorney in private practice at a number of Spokane law firms.  She also clerked for U.S. District Court  Judge Fred Van Sickle, whom she will  now replace.  Professor Peterson has long been recognized by her peers for her intellect,  dedication to the law, and commitment  to equal justice.  She has been an active member of  Washington State’s legal community,  having served as President of the Federal Bar Association for Eastern Washington,  President  of  Washington  Women Lawyers State Bar Association  and President of the Spokane County  Washington Women Lawyers Bar Association.

33,Senate,111,-0.166,26,2010-01-25,Mrs. LINCOLN.," Mr. President, today  I recognize Boone and Newton Counties, in my home State of Arkansas, for  their  efforts  to  create  communities  where children and their families have  access to healthy, affordable foods and  safe places to play and exercise. These  counties, through the North Arkansas  Partnership  for  Health  Education,  NAPHE,  recently  received a  $360,000  grant from the Robert Wood Johnson  Foundation’s  ‘‘Healthy Kids: Healthy  Communities’’ program.  The funding will help local officials  and organizations create policies that  encourage active lifestyles for children  and healthier eating habits for all residents in Boone and Newton Counties.  The project will create a walking path  to connect the south side of Lake Harrison to the schools and grocery stores  to the north and will develop a system  to deliver healthy foods to underserved  neighborhoods and more remote parts  of the counties.  According  to  Rick  Hinterthuer,  NAPHE executive director, ‘‘our community model  is extremely efficient  and effective. If we can do it in Harrison, it can be done in other places.  We reach our community best through  the Home Town Health Coalitions of  Boone and Newton Counties.’’  I have had the pleasure of visiting  the Boone County Hometown Health  Improvement Coalition. The program  is a model for the rest of the country  and illustrates how a community can  leverage its resources to address community health  issues  through  local,  State, regional and national partnerships.  As  chairman of  the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and  Forestry,  I have  fought  to  include  funding to provide meals to needy children during summer months, to secure  grants for States to modernize their  school lunch delivery systems, to improve health outcomes for infants participating in the WIC Program, and to  promote the health of young children  in early childhood settings.  I salute the good work going on in  Harrison and North Arkansas to help  keep our youngest citizens healthy.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO JAMES WILSON  ∑",2010
34,Senate,111,-0.517,26,2010-01-25,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to take a moment today to  recognize an armchair explorer who  never left the Northeast but brought  the world to the United States. In 1809–  1810 in the town of Bradford, VT, Mr.  James Wilson fashioned the first terrestrial and celestial globes made in  the United States. In doing so Mr. Wilson gave to all Americans an invaluable tool that would be used for centuries to come.  A self-taught and passionate cartographer, James Wilson started the first  geographic globe factory in Bradford.  He achieved such great success that  soon after he and his sons opened a second  factory  in Albany, NY. Wilson  Globes set the standard by which all  other globes were measured, achieving  such perfection that in 1827 he argued  to Congress there was no longer a need  to import them from abroad.  The accomplishments of James Wilson and his sons are treasured in the  picturesque town of Bradford. So much  so that the Bradford Historical Society  commissioned  the Williamstown Art  Conservator to repair the historical society’s Wilson globe—one of the few remaining in the world. Funds for this  project were received from across the  Nation.  Understandably,  the  town  takes great pride in this small piece of  history that they can call their own.  Although Mr. Wilson only ever saw a  few hundred miles of this great country, he was responsible for bringing the  world to most Americans. We applaud  James Wilson for the legacy he left us.  Furthermore, we applaud the Historical Society and town of Bradford for  recognizing Mr. Wilson’s  remarkable  gift and their dedication to preserving  the past for our future.∑  f  EXECUTIVE AND OTHER  COMMUNICATIONS  The following communications were  laid before the Senate, together with  accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as indicated:  EC–4312.

36,Senate,111,-0.351,22,2010-02-11,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I would  like to take a moment to congratulate  South Union Elementary School in Des  Moines, IA, which was granted the Energy Star Rating in recognition of its  achievements and practices in energy  conservation.  The Energy Star Program is jointly  managed by the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Energy to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas  emissions. This program encourages many  facets of energy efficiency. In order to  attain the Energy Star Rating, schools  must score in the top 25 percent under  EPA’s national rating performance system.  At a time when the United States  leads the world in energy consumption  and  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases,  South Union Elementary is serving as  a role model for schools across the Nation. Under the guidance of the Des  Moines School District, South Union  became an Energy Star Partner in May  2008. South Union has reduced its energy consumption, operating costs, and  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Simple  measures such as turning off  lights,  computers, and convenience appliances  have made a big difference.  It is important that we recognize the  accomplishments of  schools  such as  South Union Elementary. Along with  helping the environment, South Union  is  also  saving  the  school  district  money. During these tough economic  times, with school budgets under extreme pressure, this is more important  than ever. Just as important, these energy conservation actions by the South  Union Elementary community instill a  strong sense of environmental and natural resource stewardship. South Union  Elementary’s students, teachers, and  staff are fostering excellent habits of  conscientious citizenship.  South Union Elementary has proven  that simple changes in daily practices  can make a big difference. By setting  attainable goals and being persistent,  this  school community was able  to  make significant improvements. I offer  my sincere congratulations to everyone at South Union Elementary School  for their commitment to energy efficiency and conservation. They make  the State of Iowa proud.∑  f  RECOGNIZING STOWE  ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  ∑",2010

38,Senate,111,-0.266,43,2010-02-11,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  support the nomination of Ms. Caryn  Wagner to be Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, and  urge my colleagues to confirm her. The  Intelligence Committee unanimously  approved the nomination by voice vote  on December 10, 2009.  The Under Secretary of Intelligence  and Analysis leads the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security, which is  among the youngest elements of the  U.S. intelligence community. The main  responsibilities of the Office are to ensure that information related to homeland security threats is (1) collected,  analyzed, and disseminated to homeland security customers in the Department, at the State, local, and tribal  levels; (2) shared as appropriate with  private sector entities; and (3) provided  to other intelligence community agencies. The Under Secretary of the Office  leads these efforts, provides homeland  security intelligence and advice to the  Secretary and other senior officials in  the Department of Homeland Security,  and serves as the Department’s senior  interagency  intelligence  representative.

39,House,111,0.655,4,2010-02-24,Mr. PENCE.," Well,  tomorrow  the  White House will convene a so-called  summit on health care reform. It’s supposedly an effort  to  find bipartisan  agreement and consensus on reform.  And frankly, if the administration and  Democrats in Congress were willing to  scrap the bill and start over with a  clean sheet of paper, I would be all for  it.  The American people long for health  care reform that will lower the cost of  health care insurance without growing  the size of government. But that is not  what’s  happening  here.  Instead  of  scrapping the bill, the President’s actually produced his own bigger, worse  version of the bills that passed the  House and Senate and then were summarily rejected by the American people: more spending, more taxes, more  government, and coverage for abortion.  Instead of starting over, Democrats  in Congress continue to threaten to  abuse the very rules of this institution  by passing some version of their health  care reform bill by a simple majority  in  the Senate—known  as  reconciliation.  Tomorrow’s summit is looking more  and more like a taxpayer-funded media  event designed to set up passage of  ObamaCare 2.0. The American people  deserve to know it.  f  b1030  THE PRESIDENT’S PROPOSAL ON  HEALTH CARE REFORM  (Mr. PIERLUISI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2010
40,House,111,0.641,4,2010-02-24,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, this administration and Democrats  in Congress  don’t seem to have an answer to the  single most important question workers across  the  country are asking:  ‘‘Where are the jobs?’’ The American  people don’t want more political pandering on the economy and health care;  they want action now that will control  runaway Federal spending and create  jobs.  The third time is not the charm, Mr.  President.  When  government-controlled health care was introduced in  the House, the American people rejected  it. Strike one. When government-controlled health care was introduced in the Senate, the American people rejected it. Strike two. And when  the President puts his government control of health care on the table before  a bipartisan handful on Thursday, the  American people will reject that, too.  Strike three.  The Democrats need to scrap their  job-killing policies, like a government  takeover of health care and national  energy tax, and begin working with Republicans on commonsense solutions to  create jobs and reduce out-of-control  spending. It’s time we work together to  get this economy moving again and to  help put people back to work.  f  RECOVERY ACT IS WORKING  (Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  ",2010
41,House,111,0.425,4,2010-02-24,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  the administration’s health care bill  fails to include a Republican solution  that could actually achieve savings for  patients—lawsuit abuse reform.  Forty percent of medical malpractice  suits against doctors and hospitals are  without merit, according to a study by  the Harvard School of Public Health.  And excess damages add $70 billion to  $126 billion annually to health care  costs, the Department of Health and  Human  Services  has  found.  These  costs, of course, are passed on to patients.  The administration has only  suggested a pilot program for tort reform.  But some States, including my home  State of Texas, have already enacted  tort reform. These States have seen insurance premiums fall and access to  medical care expand.  We don’t need a pilot program. We  need to enact medical malpractice lawsuit abuse reform.  f  HIGH-SPEED RAIL  (Mrs. HALVORSON asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2010
42,House,111,-0.183,4,2010-02-24,Mrs. HALVORSON.," Where are  the  jobs? I think we can answer that every  time we speak. In my district it is happening quite literally.  Recently  I was very proud to announce $1.2 billion  in Recovery Act  funding being invested in Illinois for  high-speed rail lines from Chicago to  St. Louis. Two of the towns in my district happen to be stops along the rail  line—Joliet and Normal.  There are those who have said, and  continue  to  say,  that projects  like  these will not put people to work, that  the stimulus isn’t working. But here is  the reality: These high-speed rail lines  in Illinois alone are going to put 6,000  people to work. This wouldn’t have  been possible without the investment  in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  I am proud that the Recovery Act is  putting these people to work and putting our  communities back on  the  track to recovery. We must continue to  invest  in  American  infrastructure,  build upon the work of the Recovery  Act is doing, and continue working to  create jobs.

Consumers’ health insurance  premiums go up, while coverage gets  worse and worse. In the past six years,  health  insurance premiums have  increased at a rate four times the increase in the average American worker’s wages.  Twenty-seven years ago, as a young  Texas State Senator, I authored the  Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust  Act.

47,House,111,-0.469,18,2010-02-24,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," I thank  the chairman for yielding.  Madam Speaker,  last week  I was  shocked to learn that in the middle of  the great recession, which was caused  by the deregulation, hands-off policies  of the prior administration, and during  this time when families across my district and across the Nation are struggling with rising unemployment and  while health insurance companies have  recently announced that last year was  their best year on record as far as profits are concerned, $12 billion last year  in profits for the insurance industry,  and while that’s the case, they are announcing plans to raise insurance premiums by 40 percent in some markets.  During this time of hurt and pain and  also making money by the insurance  industry off these people who are hurting and  in pain, we are considering  today removing the antitrust exemption that insurance companies have enjoyed for over 60 years. And it’s time  for this protection and immunity from  antitrust law and this anticompetitive  behavior, it’s time for it to come to an  end.  This insurance industry which delivers health care to the people has been  broken for a long time. We all know it,  and it’s time to change it. And this is  a good place to change it. It will help  with competition if we pass this law  today. That will happen only  if we  start applying anticompetitive, antitrust legislation to the insurance industry. There’s simply no reason why  they should continue to benefit from  it.  Don’t listen as the health insurance  industry tries to tell you that they  can’t  live under the antitrust  laws.  Every other  industry does. It’s high  time that they do too. Consumers will  benefit, the economy will benefit, and  health insurance insurers who want to  compete honestly will too.  Let’s give struggling American families an honest health insurance market  by enacting this important bill.  ",2010
48,House,111,-0.266,25,2010-02-24,Mr. POMEROY.," I thank the chairman for yielding for the purpose of a  colloquy.  I would like to thank Chairman CONYERS, Congressman TOMPERRIELLOof  Virginia, Congresswoman BETSYMARKEYof Colorado, and others for their  leadership in bringing to the floor this  important bill aimed at creating greater competition in the health insurance  marketplace in order to promote greater affordability, improve quality, and  greater consumer choice.  In particular, I appreciate that the  bill is narrowly tailored to repeal the  McCarran-Ferguson antitrust  exemption only for the business of health insurance. But despite the clear wording  of the bill, I have heard concerns from  some that courts might somehow interpret the bill broadly to include nonhealth lines of insurance such as life  insurance,  long-term care  insurance,  disability income insurance, even property/casualty insurance.  As one of only two former State insurance  commissioners  in  the U.S.  House  of  Representatives,  I  know  health insurance is different than these  other insurance lines. I would appreciate, Mr. Chairman, your confirmation of my understanding that the bill  we are now debating does not apply to  any insurance except for health insurance, and your expectation that courts  will interpret it properly to not include  nonhealth lines of insurance.  Is the gentleman’s understanding of  my expectation correct?  ",2010

If you  look at those major elements, they do  in fact give the insurance industry the  opportunity to collude, because that is  the data that sets future prices for consumers as well as payments for doctors.  I know this business. I was the Insurance Commissioner in California for 8  years. And I know that if an insurance  company  is able  to collude  in collecting, compiling, classifying, or disseminating historic data and determining a loss development factor, and  finally, using actuarial services, they  have the power to collude. This is an  incredible loophole. It should never be  allowed.  And the final point having to do with  the insurance commissioners collecting  data, nowhere in any antitrust laws are  States precluded from any collection of  data. This ought not be put forth.

We have to reduce  health care costs, and this is a commonsense way to do so. If we do not  control those costs, then any reform effort will fail, as the cost of health care  and, therefore, the cost of insurance  will increase.  Defensive medicine, where doctors  order every possible test under the sun  for fear of being sued, costs us more  than $650 billion each year, or 26 percent of our annual health care spending. These costs increase insurance premiums for doctors, and health care expenses simply get shifted to the patients.

52,House,111,-0.556,39,2010-02-24,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  United States is reaching a bleak milestone in Afghanistan. The death toll  for our troops is now 996, or it was  when this paper was written. It is inevitable  that we will  reach  the  1,000  mark. How much further are we going  to go in this?  Under these circumstances the American people have the right to demand  that the Afghan Government do everything it can to stop violent extremism  in their country and to keep our troops  safe. So  far the Afghan Government  has not lived up to its responsibilities.  Our Ambassador in Afghanistan, Karl  Eikenberry, wrote a cable to the State  Department in November in which he  said that President Karzai ‘‘is not an  adequate strategic partner’’ and ‘‘continues to shun responsibility for any  sovereign  burden,  whether  defense,  governance, or development.’’ He also  wrote that when it comes to corruption, Karzai has a record of ‘‘inaction  and grudging compliance.’’  This is outrageous, Mr. Speaker, because this government corruption undermines our very efforts in Afghanistan and puts our troops at risk.  When the Afghan people see the corruption in their government, they ask,  and they should ask, Why should we  help the Americans defeat the Taliban  when our government isn’t any better  than the Taliban?  The Washington Post just recently,  well, yesterday, I think, revealed a deplorable example of the Afghan Government’s shady dealings. It was Monday that the article came out. It was  written by Andrew Higgins and entitled ‘‘Kabul Bank’s Sherkhan Farnood  Feeds Crony Capitalism  in Afghanistan.’’ The article described the cozy  relationship between the Afghan political elite and the Kabul Bank. The Afghan Government has poured tens of  millions of dollars of public money into  that bank. At the same time, the bank  has made  shady multimillion dollar  loans to members of President Karzai’s  family, his government, and his supporters to buy luxury villas in Dubai.  The article calls this  ‘‘a crony capitalism that enriches politically connected insiders and dismays the Afghan  people.’’  President Karzai’s older brother and  his former Vice President both have  Dubai villas, but  they’re  registered  under the name of Sherkhan Farnood,  the chairman of the bank. Presumably  this is done to hide the goodies that  the political big shots have gotten. The  bank has plenty of money, including  more than $1 billion in deposits from  Afghans. But ‘‘the vast majority of this  money flows into the hands of a tiny  minority, some of it through kickbacks  and insider deals’’—that’s from the article—for the country’s political, security, and business elites.  The bank also helped pay for President Karzai’s recent reelection campaign, which was filled with charges of  fraud. The bank’s support for Karzai  wasn’t surprising. Why should it be?  The bank is partly owned by Karzai’s  older brother and the brother of his  vice presidential running mate.  And at a time when most Afghans are  desperately poor, the Kabul Bank  is  spending $30 million to build a fancy  new headquarters.  Mr. Speaker, the American people  have a right to ask, Is this what our  soldiers are dying  for? Is this what  we’re spending tens of billions of our  tax dollars for? So that well-connected  elites in Afghanistan can enjoy luxury  villas in Dubai?  We cannot allow this to continue. I  have been demanding that we change  our mission in Afghanistan to focus on  SMART Security for a long time now.  One of the cornerstones of SMART Security is an emphasis on better governance. Improving governance in Afghanistan is just as important, Mr. Speaker,  as any military operation. Actually,  it’s more important.  That’s why President Obama must  insist that President Karzai and his  cronies clean up their act and do it  quickly. Without honest government,  we will never defeat violent extremism  in Afghanistan and the death toll for  our troops will not stop.  f  RECOGNIZING KANSAS STATE  UNIVERSITY’S PROUD CAMPAIGN  ",2010
53,House,111,-0.303,46,2010-02-24,Mr. KANJORSKI.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  Jack’s chairman as chairman of the  Appropriations  Committee,  OBEY.  ",2010
54,House,111,-0.45,46,2010-02-24,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, this  is a  very human  institution, and  it’s affected very much by our personal relationships  with  one  another.  Very  frankly, for the first 20 years that Jack  and  I  served on  the Appropriations  Committee, we were often adversaries.  There were some issues that we differed on. He was, as has already been  said, very much old school, and I was  more of a reformer.  In fact, when I ran for the chairmanship of the committee against a senior  member of the committee, Jack managed the campaign of my opponent and,  unfortunately, he did a pretty good job.  After  I was elected, we had pretty  much an arm’s-length relationship for  a couple of years.  But if you care about your country,  and you care about this  institution,  you swallow your differences and you  learn to work with everybody. Jack  and I soon had developed a solid working relationship, and we became allies  on a host of issues. One of our most important was our view of the war in Iraq  and how to get out of it; and another  was our concern about the dubiousness  of our continued  involvement  in Afghanistan if we didn’t have a better  ally in that government to rely upon.  We often talked together, and we  traveled together. We went to the Middle East together. We shared something special as well  in a different  place on this globe. A few years ago, he  and I and Dave Hobson and our staffs  became concerned about the visitors  center at Normandy. It was really pretty much of a cracker box affair, and it  was not at all fitting to the history of  that place. So we determined  that  there ought to be a new visitors’ center  at Normandy. With the three of us  working together with our staffs, that  visitors center was built.  Today, if you visit it—and it’s truly  beautiful—there is a little plaque behind that visitors center in front of a  small tree with the names of Murtha,  OBEYand Hobson on it. I know I am  proud of that, and I know Jack was  proud of that. I think it symbolizes  what happens in this place. Two people  who started out as adversaries became  reasonably good  friends, never  fully  agreeing, because no two people in this  place ever agree on everything, but we  had a solid working relationship.  I learned one thing about Jack a long  time ago. He had the courage of his  convictions, and he fought hard every  way he knew how  for those convictions, and he cared deeply about the  welfare of the men and women who  served in the Armed Forces and defend  this country’s freedom.  I am proud that at Normandy there is  that little note of the three of us having gotten together, all for one purpose, to honor the people who did so  much on those beaches to build and  preserve America’s  freedom and  the  freedom of the world.  ",2010
55,House,111,-0.402,46,2010-02-24,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I would like to take a bit different  tack because I met Chairman Murtha  for the first time in 1977 when I was an  associate staff on Appropriations. My  Member and my mentor, Adam Benjamin, Jr., was a member of the Appropriations Committee  that year. Mr.  Murtha, Mr. CARNEY, Mr. Benjamin and  others were instrumental in that year,  not only in that appropriations process, but in also establishing the Steel  Caucus, because they were very concerned about people who worked  in  their district.  What I took away as a staffer from  that relationship with Mr. Murtha is  the fact that he always treated me and  every other staff he came into contact  with with respect. He always heard  what I had to say and what other staff  had to say, whether, as Mr. OBEY implied, he always agreed with you or  not, and he always treated you very  professionally.  I had no conception during those 6  years working as a staff member that  the time would come that I would serve  as a colleague on the committee with  Mr. Murtha, would serve on the subcommittee,  and  would  be  blessed  enough to call him a friend. He was a  friend to every person he encountered.  He was a good friend to the people he  represented, because he was most concerned with those who worked hard,  who needed a job or who needed a hand  up.  Our country is much richer because  of that attitude that Mr. Murtha carried with him every day, and the world  is certainly a much better place than it  would have been had he not walked  among us.  The fact is, as far as his activities on  the Defense  subcommittee, and my  Member was a former marine as well, I  was always struck that while some  people are very  focused on weapons  systems, Mr. Murtha, while never losing sight of the big picture, was most  concerned about that individual man  or woman who was in the field, who  was risking their life and who was serving our country. As he would suggest,  operation and maintenance, how you  train, how you provide for their safety,  how you equip that person and their  family and those children was the most  important thing for him.  He taught me many valuable life lessons. I am a better person, and we are  all better people because of Mr. Murtha. He will be greatly missed, and I  deeply appreciate the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for this opportunity.  b1745  ",2010

57,House,111,-0.491,53,2010-02-24,Ms. PELOSI.," Madam Speaker, I rise  to  join my  colleagues  to  sing  the  praises of a great man, Jack Murtha.  Many of us had the honor of calling  him colleague  in this Chamber, and  some of us here had the privilege of  calling him friend. And when he was  your friend, you had a true friend.  Last week, many of us traveled to  Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to see Jack  put to rest. It was wonderful to hear  the stories of the thousands of people  who showed up to pay their last respects to him in Johnstown, the people  he knew so well, cared about so much,  fought for in this Chamber. His family  was gathered and surrounded by their  loved ones and people. The  former  President of the United States, Bill  Clinton, was there, the Secretary of  Defense was there, the chairman of the  National Security Council was there,  representatives of the President’s cabinet, and planeloads of his colleagues  who came from Washington or drove  from home.  At  that  time we  laughed and we  cried, and we tried to understand why  this had happened. Jack’s wife Joyce,  who is very strong, said to me, ‘‘Jack  would have wanted  it this way. He  went out at the top of his game.’’  Joyce is very strong. We went there to  console, and we came back consoled by  Jack’s strong family.  I told them  in my remarks about  Jack holding court in the Pennsylvania  Corner in this Chamber. There isn’t another corner that I know of that has its  own name and its own presiding officer.  But Jack held court there, and Members  from  across  the  country  and  across the aisle came to visit him, to  ask his blessing on their endeavors,  and to just be encouraged, and sometimes supported by him. The cluster  around him were Pennsylvanians and  others, but he was never alone. He was  a magnet, a personal magnet. People  were drawn to him. He had this wonderful smile and cheerful, twinkling  eyes.  To see him operate in the Appropriations Committee, many of us served  there, was to see a master at work. But  really to understand his character, it  was more important to see him with  our troops, whether it was just off the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:00 Feb 27, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\H24FE0.REC H24FE0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010
58,House,111,-0.401,60,2010-02-24,Mr. COHEN.," Madam Speaker, many  speakers have preceded me today  in  speaking about Mr. Murtha—and I will  always call him Mr. Murtha because  that’s how I referred to him here in the  House and that’s how I will refer to  him in memory.  I only had the opportunity to serve  with him for 3 years, and I feel certainly inadequate in being the last person to speak, but this man was my  friend. He was like a father figure to  me.  When I was thinking about running  for Congress, I came up here to view  Congress and think about it. I wasn’t  sure if I was going to run or not. I went  up in that gallery and I sat on this left  side of the aisle, Madam Speaker. I  looked at the floor and all the people  down here and I thought about whether  or not I wanted to run. But coming up  here, I was in Rayburn, and I walked up  by the train that comes from Rayburn  to the Capitol. And this man came up  to me, this gentleman—I didn’t know  him—and he put his arm around me  and we  talked on  the way up and  walked all the way down the path. And  he said, Young man, this is going to be  like 1974. It’s going to be a great year  for Democrats.  We got up the elevator—and I was so  proud to be in this building—and we  got to the top and he went to the left  where you enter the Speaker’s lobby  and come onto this floor and I went  around the way to this gallery where  visitors go. He said, Next time you  come up here, I hope you can come in  here with me. And it was the next time  I got to come in here with him.  I was so proud every time I got to go  over—I read about ‘‘Murtha’s Corner’’  in The New York Times, and then I  find myself over  there with mostly  folks from Pennsylvania, but also the  different people that were fond of Mr.  Murtha. I was standing there and I  thought,  I  remember  reading about  Murtha’s Corner, now I’m in Murtha’s  Corner. And I was in his corner and he  was in mine. When I needed help for my  community and learning about appropriations, defense appropriations and  how they could benefit this country  and my community and my universities, he helped me. He always helped  me. And I helped him when he was in  need in his last election.  I made the trip to Johnstown for his  funeral, and I am so happy I did and I  am happy to be here. I could not let  this opportunity pass to speak about  this great American. It has been talked  about he was a marine and he was the  first from Vietnam to be elected—he  was part of that class—and he stood up  and received the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award. All is true. But  the bottom  line  is he was a good  human being.  ‘‘Avuncular’’  is a word  I  learned  when I was in high school, uncle-like  figure, and I guess he was an uncle-like  figure. He was  just  a  grand,  good  human being. I will miss him. This  House will miss him. And I am just fortunate that I passed this way at the  same time he did and got to change  time with him in life.  Thank you, Jack Murtha.  f  FURTHER MESSAGE FROM THE  SENATE  A further message from the Senate  by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed  with amendments in which the concurrence of the House is requested, a bill  of the House of the following title:  H.R. 3961.

59,House,111,0.518,60,2010-02-24,Mr. INGLIS.," Madam Speaker, I am  here to honor one of America’s heroes.  U.S.  Army  Sergeant  Jeremiah  Wittman, age 26, was killed in Afghanistan on Saturday, February 13, 2010.  Sergeant Wittman was from Montana.  His wife, Karyn, is from the Chesnee/  Boiling Springs area of Spartanburg  County, South Carolina.  Sergeant Wittman and Karyn have a  beautiful  3-year-old daughter named  Miah. I got to play in Miah’s doll house  when I visited her grandparents’ home  recently. More on that in a minute.  Sergeant Wittman was doing what  Americans best do—he was protecting  freedom, protecting us, when an improvised explosive device was detonated  near him as he was on foot patrol in  Zhari province in Afghanistan.  I wonder what it means to a 3-year-  old, Madam Speaker, to hear that her  daddy is one of our heroes. I said that  to Miah the other night at her house. I  know she heard it from others because  we are very patriotic people in the upstate of South Carolina, Madam Speaker. Still, I wonder what it means to a 3-  year-old.  Miah’s mom, Karyn, knows what it  means. She knew what it meant when  representatives  of  the  U.S.  Army  showed up at her parents’ front door  dressed in ‘‘Class A’s.’’ She knows that  this Saturday an Army officer will  kneel beside her and  say  that  the  President of the United States and a  grateful Nation stand in appreciation  of the honorable and faithful service of  her husband, Jeremy.  Devoted spouses like Karyn and self-  sacrificing  parents  like  Sergeant  Wittman’s know that service means  the possibility of not coming home safe  and sound, the possibility that the last  full measure of devotion will be given  on a battlefield far from home.  The people of the upstate of South  Carolina and Montana know what it  means. It means that we must live our  lives in gratitude to America’s best;  the ones who come home unscathed,  the ones who come home with scars,  and the ones who come home in solemn  honor.  But what does it mean to Miah? Well,  Madam Speaker,  if you will  indulge  me, I will try to say what it means in  a letter to Miah.  Dear Miah, that’s an awesome dollhouse you have in the living room at  your grandma and grandpa’s house.  Thank you for letting me see the cool  things you’ve got in there. I like the  computer a lot, and the lights over the  door to your doll tent are awesome.  Thank you for showing me the pictures  of you and your daddy.  I guess you’ve noticed by now that  grown-ups like us cry sometimes when  we hear you say that your daddy is in  heaven. It’s not that we’re not happy  for him. You know better  than us  grown-ups that your daddy can trust  God to dry every tear. It’s just that  we’re overwhelmed by the gift you’ve  given. You and your mom and your  grandparents have given the rest of us  the gift of your dad’s life.  He was  in Afghanistan protecting  you and your mom mostly, but he was  also there protecting me and my family and all American families. So if you  see a lot of people crying, it’s the only  way we know to show how much we  care, how much your dad’s sacrifice,  how much your sacrifice means to us.  A sergeant like your dad told me recently,  ‘‘When  I see good things at  risk, I’m inclined to fight for it. I guess  that’s why I’m in the Army.’’ That’s  Sergeant Mennell from Texas. I don’t  know if Sergeant Mennell knew your  dad, but I bet that’s what your dad  thought too. Your dad saw your future  at risk, Miah, so he went to fight for  you and for me and for all of us.

And we are here now on the eve of  the 6-hour meeting that is scheduled at  Blair House that the President has invited both Democrats and Republican  leadership to join. And Mr. Speaker, I  came to the floor to talk about this  issue and help to put it in a perspective  so that as the American people watch  what’s going to happen tomorrow, they  understand it in perhaps a better perspective than they might otherwise.  Now, I would lay it out this way. I  think there are two points, Mr. Speaker, that need to be addressed by Democrats. And these are significant points  of vulnerability where there has been a  persistent criticism  from the public.  They have made the point that of all of  the agonizing national debate that’s  taken place on health care, that the  Democrats have first of all shut Republicans out. They shut Republican out of  the room, shut them out of the negotiations, shut them out of the office.  And the second thing is, the Democrats  haven’t  had  transparency.  They’ve been cooking up these health  care deals in secret.

64,Senate,111,0.429,81,2010-02-24,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, I believe  the first obligation of a government—  or one of the obligations, especially of  Congress—is to live by its own words  and live by its own rules. With great  fanfare a couple weeks ago, the Democratic leadership and its membership  passed a pay-go piece of  legislation  which says that when you bring spending legislation to the floor, it should be  paid for. There was great breast-beating on the other side of the aisle about  how this would discipline the government and make us fiscally responsible.  Now we see, as the first piece of legislation to come forward since the pay-  go resolution passed, a bill which violates that pay-go resolution. This bill  spends $12 billion that is not paid for  under the pay-go rules over the next 5  years. It is in violation of the concepts  and the rules which were put forward  by the other side as the way we would  discipline spending.  I understand—and I think most of us  understand—the issue of the economy  is critical, getting people back to work  is critical, but I don’t think we get people back to work by loading more and  more debt onto the next generation.  Probably we  create  an  atmosphere  where folks who are willing to go out  and invest and create jobs are a little  reticent to do so because they don’t  know how all that debt the Federal  Government is putting on the books  will be paid for. I presume that is one  of the reasons the pay-go legislation  was brought forward a couple of weeks  ago, to try to give some certainty to  the markets and to the American people who were upset with all the deficit  and debt, that we would discipline ourselves.  Now the first bill that comes forward  violates the rules of the Senate by adding $12 billion of spending which is not  paid for, which will be deficit spending,  and which will be added to the debt. I  am not sure how you vote for this bill  when it violates that rule which you  just voted for 2 weeks ago. It seems a  bit of inconsistency that is hard even  for a political institution to justify.  On top of that, this bill has massive  gamesmanship in the outyears. It is a  bill of $15 to $18 billion in spending, but  actually, because of the games played  in the highway accounts, it adds $140  billion of spending that is not paid for  which will be added to the debt if this  bill is passed. That is a hard number.  That is a big number. That is a real  number.  The simple fact is, this bill, in the  classic gamesmanship we see from the  highway committee, spends money we  don’t have and then claims we have the  money. In the end, all that money has  to be borrowed because there are no  revenues to cover it.  If this bill is passed, there will be $140  billion in new debt put on our kids’  backs as a result of this alleged small  number. I forgot what the number is  they claim is actually in the bill. How  does that happen? This bit of gamesmanship ought to be explained because  it keeps being undertaken by the highway committee in the most egregious  way relative to proper fiscal management. In fact, if this were done in an  accounting cycle that was subject to  accounting rules, the people who claim  this sort of sleight of hand would go to  jail. It is that simple. They would go to  jail because this is such a fraud on the  American taxpayer.  What they are claiming is that the  highway fund, on which they have committed  to  spend much more money  than is coming in, and they knew they  would  spend more money  than was  coming  in because  they wanted  to  spend more money than was coming in,  what they are claiming is that highway  fund lent the general fund money 10  years ago and that money should have  had interest paid on it. Of course, at  the time, they actually waived the interest, assuming interest should have  been paid on that. That interest has  been recouped a couple of times now,  allegedly, even  if  it were owed. But  what they claim is that because the  money is coming out of the general  fund to fund the highway fund, they  are calling that an offset so it won’t  score.  Unfortunately,  under  the  present  rules with which we budget around  here, it doesn’t score because it is built  into the baseline. It adds up to $140 billion over the next 10 years, approximately, that is going to come out of  the general fund to fund the highway  fund because the people who run the  highway fund don’t have the courage to  fund what they want to spend. So they  are going to take it out of the general  fund. Where does the general fund get  its money? It borrows it from our children and grandchildren.  It  runs up  debt. That is why, under any scenario,  no matter what gamesmanship you  play around here on naming this event,  it turns out to be the same thing: debt  added to our children’s burden.  Our  children  already have  a  fair  amount of debt coming at them as a result  of  this  Congress’s  profligacy.  Under the President’s budget, the deficit will double in the next 5 years and  triple in the next 10 years. We will add  $11 trillion of new debt to the backs of  our children over the next 10 years  under the President’s initiatives, every  year for the next 10 years. We will average deficits of $1 trillion.  The American people intuitively understand that cannot continue; it can’t  keep up. We are on an unsustainable  course. We are running this Nation  into a ditch on the fiscal side of the  ledger. We are putting this Nation into  financial bankruptcy because of the  fact that we are running up deficits  and debt far beyond our capacity to  repay. In fact, if you look at these deficits and debt just in the context of  what other industrialized nations do—  for example, the European Union—they  don’t allow their states to exceed deficits of 3 percent or a public debt to  GDP ratio of 60 percent. The way this  works out, we are going to run deficits  of about 5 percent every year for the  next 10 years, we will have a public  debt situation of well over 60 percent  next year, and we will get to 80 percent  before the next 10 years are up. Those  are numbers which lead to one conclusion—that we are in deep trouble. We  are in deep, deep trouble. Yet we come  here today with a bill which aggravates  that situation relative to the pay-go  rules by $12 billion and relative to the  highway fund by $140 billion.  ",2010

Representative Wilson was a great statesman who  served the 2nd Congressional District in Texas  from 1972–1996.  Charles was born in a small town in Texas,  where he developed a deep sense of pride as  a Texan and a strong dedication to the American way. As a young man he served in the  United States Navy where he rose through the  ranks and was given the privilege to serve as  part of a Soviet Union nuclear intelligence unit  based out of the Pentagon. While serving in  the military, 27-year-old Charles was able to  effectively run for and win the office of State  Representative  in  his  native  Texas.  This  began a 12-year political career in Texas that  earned him the nickname ‘‘liberal from Lufkin’’.  In 1972, Wilson was elected  to  the U.S.  House of Representatives, where he became  most recognized for his role in the dismantling  of the communist Soviet Union’s occupation of  Afghanistan. He deeply believed  in  the sovereignty of the Afghani people and was able to  use his influence on the House Appropriations  Subcommittee on Defense to help provide the  funding for their liberation. Although the media  has primarily focused on his accomplishments  abroad, Charles always maintained Lufkin,  Texas as one of his number one priorities.  Some of his greatest domestic accomplishments include the creation of the 100,000-acre  Big Thicket National Preserve and the Lufkin  VA Hospital.  Madam Speaker, Charles Wilson was a political giant who brought his Texas-sized gusto  for democracy and his passion for serving the  American people  to our Nation’s capitol. He  will be greatly missed not only by his wife and  sister, but by the American people.  f  HONORING  CHRISTINA  CAPUTO  FOR WINNING  THE  HONORING  OUR  FUTURE  LEADERS  COMPETITION  HON.

69,,111,-0.183,130,2010-02-24,Mrs. HALVORSON.," Madam Speaker, I rise  to recognize Ms. Kelly Reffett’s years of work  in community service and disaster relief and to  wish her well as she retires from her role as  President of  the  Illinois Valley Federation of  Labor.  Ms. Reffett began her career in 1979 as an  operator  for Ameritech  in Canton,  IL. After  working for Ameritech for twenty years, Kelly  joined  the American Red Cross of Greater  Chicago as Director of Partner Relations and  AFL–CIO Labor Participation. For  ten years,  Kelly worked  to expand preparedness education opportunities  to diverse populations,  served  disaster  stricken  communities,  and  broadened partnerships with corporations and  community organizations.  In this position, she directed teams of nearly  100 people at 23 locations, providing executive guidance and program assistance to onsite supervisors and Volunteer  in Service  to  America members. She also served as Partner Services Manager/Officer and Labor Liaison on 25 national relief operations including  Hurricane Katrina and World Trade Center 9/  11 operations. She co-developed  the AFL–  CIO’s 2009 handbook outlining guidelines and  policies for volunteer disaster relief operations.  These accomplishments are only a small sampling of Kelly’s impressive career.  In addition to her national service, Kelly was  also selected to serve at the state and county  level. Since 2003, Kelly has served as a commissioner on the Illinois State Commission on  Volunteerism  and  Community  Service.  In  2008, she was appointed to serve on the LaSalle County Board. Shortly  thereafter, she  was elected to that office.  Throughout her long career, Ms. Reffett has  also remained dedicated to the cause of working families. Serving as President of the Illinois  Valley Federation of Labor for over two decades, she always put the best interests of Illinois Valley workers first.  Ms. Kelly Reffett has had a long and proud  career, one that is not ending as she retires  from the presidency of the Illinois Valley Federation of Labor. Having worked with her over  the years, I am sure she will continue to work  to improve her community, as she has done  over and throughout her long and successful  career.  f  CONGRATULATING  THE  TRANSPORTATION  TRADES  DEPARTMENT  ON  ITS  20TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. JAMES L. OBERSTAR  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 24, 2010  ",2010
70,,111,-0.553,130,2010-02-24,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Madam Speaker, it is my  great pleasure  to congratulate  the Transportation Trades Department, AFL–CIO as  this  strong voice for transportation workers marks  its 20th anniversary.  Transportation  is at  the core of our daily  lives and our economy. From ancient civilization  through  the present day,  the quality of  transportation serves as a true measure of a  society. How well do people  live  their daily  lives? How quickly and efficiently can people  and goods get  from one place  to another?  Does the quality of transportation strengthen  or weaken an economy?  As we map  the vision  for our  future, we  must keep asking  these questions. Are we  doing all we can  to  invest  in modern, safe,  and efficient transportation? Are the workers in  this industry as well-trained, experienced, and  prepared as possible? Are  they  treated with  respect and dignity? Are they trusted and empowered? Do their wages and working conditions help—or hurt—the ability to attract and  retain good men and women for these jobs?  The work of the Transportation Trades Department (TTD), of  the AFL–CIO  lies at  the  heart of these questions. In every major transportation policy debate in Washington over the  past 20 years, TTD has been front and center,  providing  an  honest,  substantive,  and  respected voice on behalf of millions of transportation workers. TTD brings  their voices  to  those in public office, helping forge far better  policy and decision-making than if the organization did not exist.  TTD has always had the courage and conviction to demand accountability, to make sure  that public and private sector  transportation  leaders are  truly placing safety and our national  transportation  network’s  true  needs  ahead of ideology and profit. In an industry—  and world—that has been so turbulent in recent years, the value of TTD’s vigilant watchdog role is priceless.  As the Chairman of the House Committee  on Transportation and  Infrastructure,  I can  count on TTD  to bring  integrity,  intellectual  depth, and refreshing clarity to my Committee  and the entire Congress. I have long valued  TTD as a trusted friend and ally, and its substantive, bipartisan approach has often been  helpful in bringing about consensus on important issues.  As my committee has engaged in enacting  critical legislation—from the surface transportation bill to the FAA reauthorization bill, from  the Coast Guard  reauthorization  to Amtrak  and rail safety reauthorization—TTD has been  a comprehensive and credible  resource.  Its  member unions are on the front lines of our  transportation  network—whether  on  the  ground, in the air or at sea.

71,House,111,0.538,4,2010-03-03,Mr. PITTS.," Mr. Speaker, today we  will hear again  from  the President  about health care  reform. However,  moving forward on another version of  these massive health care bills is not  progress. Raising hundreds of millions  of dollars in new taxes is not progress.  Cutting half a  trillion dollars  from  Medicare is not progress. Putting the  government in charge of health care in  this country is not progress.  We all know how flawed the Senate  health care bill is, how it is full of  backroom deals  like the Cornhusker  Kickback and the Louisiana Purchase  and many others. Some say the American people will appreciate this bill  after it becomes law.  Let’s not pretend that the American  people just don’t know enough about  this bill to make an informed decision.  They are informed, and they reject it.  Let’s scrap this massive bill and start  over,  just  like the American people  would like us to.  f  WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)  ",2010
72,House,111,0.422,4,2010-03-03,Mr. WITTMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  recently during my district work period,  I met with officials  from Matthews  County  Public  Schools.  Matthews  County is representative of many of  the communities  in my district and  around  the Commonwealth  that are  dealing with  difficult  budget  challenges.  The Matthews County school system  is projected to lose $1.2 million in the  2010–2011  budget year. For  a  small  school district, this  is a significant  number. Unfortunately, in these cases,  usually the only place left to trim the  budget is personnel. This would mean  less services and programs for children.  Over the years, the Federal Government has expanded its involvement in  funding and has added requirements on  public education. In some cases, Federal  requirements  leave  school  districts strapped for funding. The Federal requirements and mandates are  not joined with Federal assistance. In  my district, I have  formed an Education Advisory Council  to  look at  these tough issues.  Congress  should  carefully  review  these important programs and implement commonsense reforms to ensure  that we are helping, not hurting, the  education of our children. There are  many counties  like Matthews across  Virginia’s First Congressional District.  We must be mindful of the impacts we  have on their budgets.  f  RECOVERY ACT WORKING  (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.  Speaker, I rise this morning to share  some success stories from the 20th Congressional District  in Florida  that  show that the evidence is clear that  the Recovery Act is working to cushion  the greatest economic crisis since the  Great Depression and lay a new foundation for economic growth.  In my State of Florida, we are creating jobs and investing in the infrastructure of our community. Indeed, in  my district alone, there have been 130  Recovery Act grants that have been  awarded. Even more  importantly,  in  my  congressional  district,  61  small  businesses have received more than $21  million in loans. These loans to small  businesses have allowed companies to  stay open, keep people employed, and  prevented an  even deeper  economic  downturn.  Experts agree that the Recovery Act  is already responsible for saving or creating 2 million jobs, and we remain on  track to create and save at least an additional 31⁄2million jobs by the end of  the year.  The Recovery Act, to be clear, was  never meant to replace dollar for dollar  or job for job what we have lost. But 1  year in, experts ranging from private  forecasters to Governors on both sides  of the aisle say the Recovery Act has  helped pull us back from the brink of  economic disaster and is helping us lay  a firm foundation for our economic recovery.  f  b1030  SCRAP CURRENT HEALTH CARE  BILL  (Mr. FLEMING asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2010
73,House,111,0.59,4,2010-03-03,Mr. FLEMING.," Mr. Speaker,  last  year,  I  introduced House Resolution  615, a resolution that simply says, if  you vote for a government-run health  care  system, you  should be willing  to be subject to it. As of today, over  3 million Americans have  gone  to  fleming.house.gov  in support of this  resolution.  This message continues to resonate  across America for one simple reason:  The people of this country are sick and  tired of being the victims of bad laws  while their elected representatives exempt themselves from the very same  laws. If Congress feels increased taxes,  higher premiums, and government-run  health care are good enough for American families, then it should be good  enough for them as well.  I urge the President and Democrat  leadership  to  listen  to  this  overwhelming uproar  from the American  public. Scrap the current  legislation  and go back to the drawing board to  craft a true bipartisan bill that  increases access and quality of health  care while  driving  down  costs  for  American families.  f  LEGISLATION TO HELP SMALL  BUSINESSES  (Mr. SCHAUER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2010
74,House,111,-0.233,4,2010-03-03,Mr. SCHAUER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  announce new  legislation  I’m  introducing to help small businesses grow  and make it easier for them to put people to work. New jobs mean less government  spending on unemployment  and health care. New employees spend  much of what they earn, also boosting  our local economies.

78,House,111,-0.345,25,2010-03-03,Mr. COURTNEY.," First of all, I want  to thank the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, Mr. MILLER, for his leadership on this legislation.  The hearing which was held at the  Education and Labor Committee was  one of the most stunning, amazing,  eye-opening events,  I think, of this  Congress. The  bipartisanship which  came together after that hearing to  craft this legislation, again, I think is  a testament to your leadership and the  bipartisanship that you have created  on that committee.  Mr. Speaker, back in 1998, The Hartford Courant won a Pulitzer Prize for a  four-part investigation of seclusion and  restraint all across the country. The  name of the series was ‘‘A Nationwide  Pattern of Death,’’ which I’d like to  offer a copy of for the RECORD, and  which, again, in chapter and verse, laid  out the shocking, uneven application of  this type of  force against America’s  schoolchildren. In Connecticut, it actually resulted in action in terms of legislation which was  put  into  place.  Many of the minimum standards which  are included in the legislation we’re  voting on today were incorporated into  that measure. But, clearly, as a Nation, we have much more work to be  done.  [From the Hartford Courant, Oct. 11, 1998]  A NATIONWIDEPATTERNOFDEATH  (By Eric Weiss)  Roshelle Clayborne pleaded for her life.  Slammed  face-down  on  the  floor,  Clayborne’s arms were yanked across her  chest, her wrists gripped from behind by a  mental health aide.  I can’t breathe, the 16-year-old gasped.  Her last words were ignored.  A  syringe  delivered  50 milligrams  of  Thorazine  into her body and, with eight  staffers watching, Clayborne became, suddenly, still. Blood trickled from the corner  of her mouth as she lost control of her bodily  functions. Her limp body was rolled into a  blanket and dumped in an 8-by-10-foot room  used to seclude dangerous patients at the  Laurel Ridge Residential Treatment Center  in San Antonio, Texas.  The door clicked behind her.  No one watched her die.  But Roshelle Clayborne  is  not  alone.  Across the country, hundreds of patients  have died after being  restrained  in psychiatric and mental retardation  facilities,  many of  them  in  strikingly  similar circumstances, a Courant  investigation has  found.  Those who died were disproportionately  young. They entered our health care system  as troubled children. They left in coffins.  All of them died at the hands of those who  are supposed to protect, in places intended to  give sanctuary.  If Roshelle Clayborne’s death last summer  was not an isolated incident, neither were  the recent deaths of Connecticut’s Andrew  McClain or Robert Rollins.  A 50-state survey by The Courant, the first  of its kind ever conducted, has confirmed 142  deaths during or shortly after restraint or  seclusion in the past decade. The survey focused on mental health and mental retardation facilities and group homes nationwide.  But because many of these cases go unreported, the actual number of deaths during  or after restraint is many times higher.  Between 50 and 150 such deaths occur every  year across the country, according to a statistical estimate commissioned by The Courant and conducted by a research specialist  at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis.  That’s one to three deaths every week, 500  to 1,500 in the past decade, the study shows.  ‘‘It’s going on all around the country,’’  said Dr. Jack Zusman, a psychiatrist and author of a book on restraint policy.  The nationwide trail of death leads from a  6-year-old boy in California to a 45-year-old  mother of four in Utah, from a private treatment center in the deserts of Arizona to a  public psychiatric hospital in the pastures of  Wisconsin.  In some cases, patients died in ways and  for reasons that defy common sense: a towel  wrapped around the mouth of a 16-year-old  boy; a 15-year-old girl wrestled to the ground  after she wouldn’t give up a family photograph.  Many of the actions would land a parent in  jail, yet staffers and facilities were rarely  punished.  ‘‘I raised my child for 17 years and I never  had to restrain her, so I don’t know what  gave them the right to do it,’’ said Barbara  Young, whose daughter Kelly died  in the  Brisbane Child Treatment Center  in New  Jersey.  The pattern revealed by The Courant has  gone either unobserved or willfully ignored  by regulators, by health officials, by the  legal system.  The  federal  government—which  closely  monitors the size of eggs—does not collect  data on how many patients are killed by a  procedure that  is used every day  in psyfacilities  retardation  chiatric and mental  across the country.  Neither do state regulators, academics or  accreditation agencies.  ‘‘Right now we don’t have those numbers,’’  said Ken August of the California Department of Health Services, ‘‘and we don’t have  a way to get at them.’’  The regulators don’t ask, and the hospitals  don’t tell.  As more patients with mental disabilities  are moved  from public  institutions  into  smaller, mostly private facilities, the need  for stronger oversight and uniform standards  is greater than ever.  ‘‘Patients increasingly are not in hospitals  but in contract facilities where no one has  the vaguest idea of what is going on,’’ said  Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a nationally prominent  psychiatrist, author and critic of the mental  health care system.  Because nobody is tracking these tragedies, many restraint-related deaths go unreported not only  to  the government, but  sometimes to the families themselves.  ‘‘There is always some reticence on reporting problems because of the litigious nature  of society,’’ acknowledged Dr. Donald M.  Nielsen, a senior vice president of the American Hospital Association. ‘‘I think the question is not one of reporting, but making sure  there are systems in place to prevent these  deaths.’’  Typically,  though, hospitals dismiss  restraint-related deaths as unfortunate flukes,  not as a systemic issue. After all, they say,  these patients are troubled, ill and sometimes violent.  The facility where Roshelle Clayborne died  insists her death had nothing to do with the  restraint. Officials there say it was a heart  condition that killed the 16-year-old on Aug.  18, 1997.  Bexar County Medical Examiner Vincent  DiMaio ruled that Clayborne died of natural  causes, saying that restraint use was a separate ‘‘clinical issue.’’  But that, too, is typical in restraint cases.  Medical examiners rarely connect the circumstances of the restraint to the physical  cause of death, making these cases impossible to track through death certificates.  The  explanations  don’t  wash  with  Clayborne’s grandmother.  ‘‘I’ll picture her lying on that floor until  the  day  I  die,’’  Charlene Miles  said.  ‘‘Roshelle had her share of problems, but  good God, no one deserves to die like that.’’  With nobody tracking, nobody telling, nobody watching, the same deadly errors are  allowed to occur again and again.  Of the 142 restraint-related deaths confirmed by The Courant’s investigation:  Twenty-three people died after being restrained in face-down floor holds.  Another 20 died after they were tied up in  leather wrist and ankle cuffs or vests, and ignored for hours.  Causes of death could be confirmed in 125  cases. Of those patients, 33 percent died of  asphyxia, another 26 percent died of cardiac-  related causes.  Ages could be confirmed in 114 cases. More  than 26 percent of those were children—nearly twice the proportion they constitute in  mental health institutions.  Many of the victims were so mentally or  physically impaired they could not fend for  themselves. Others had to be restrained after  they erupted violently, without warning and  for little reason.  Caring for these patients is a difficult and  dangerous  job,  even  for  the best-trained  workers. Staffers can suddenly find themselves the target of a thrown chair, a punch,  a bite from an HIV-positive patient.  Yet the great tragedy is that many of the  deaths could have been prevented by setting  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:46 Mar 04, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K03MR7.043 H03MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2010

And we deal with it every  day. We had the Secretary in front of  our committee this afternoon. But one  of the things that is right is the higher  education system in America. And I  will tell you that without a system  like California’s, I wouldn’t be standing here today. I was given an opportunity to succeed. And I know so many  students in California that don’t have  the opportunity because of cost to attend a private university, get a great  education in that system. And not only  is the State of California better, America is better because of this. I would  urge my colleagues to support this. I  once again congratulate the CSU system.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2010
84,House,111,0.53,60,2010-03-03,Mr. BISHOP of Utah.," I appreciate  being able to join the gentleman from  Missouri here, and I appreciate his efforts  so  far  in  explaining  the  differences in these particular bills.  I want to echo that I agree with you  that we are in a precarious situation.  There are those who would tell us that  the most important thing we could do  right now is to pass something. A lot of  bad pieces of  legislation and policy  changes have happened when we have  simply  passed  something  that was  there. Our goal on this particular issue  should be to pass the right type of reform, not just something. Until we get  the right type of reform, we should  never actually quit looking to form a  way that is best in providing options  and choices to the American people.  I am assuming, when you started,  that you talked about some of the four  supposed,  alleged,  Republican  proposals  that were added  today. You  know, when I first saw that, I thought  somebody was pulling my leg. It was a  joke. I find it ludicrous and somewhat  insulting to the American people that  there are actually those who believe, if  you take a $1 trillion program which  transfers power  from  the American  people to bureaucrats in Washington,  by adding more spending  for a  few  studies and  for a  few  small,  little  tweaks here and there, that that’s actually better and that that’s going to  buy people’s support.  I think one of the things, maybe, we  have done too long in both Houses of  this Chamber, perhaps with both parties, is we’ve spoken too long about it.  We’ve been giving speech after speech  as if that’s going to convince Americans to go along with this program.  What we should do now is listen to the  reasons Americans  have  complaints  about the core program that is before  us.  I appreciate what you’re doing up  there. You’re going through some of  the core problems  in this particular  bill—that a few little add-ons, which  cost even more money, are not going to  sell this core problem issue.  If I could say just one more thing—go  ahead.  ",2010
85,House,111,0.598,67,2010-03-03,Mr. GOHMERT.," That’s exactly right.  And I know the President before us  mentioned—well, you know, States require you to buy car insurance. The  fact is, you buy insurance for the privilege, as the  law has determined, to  drive on the road. You don’t have to  drive just to live in America. If this  bill passes, you will have to buy insurance just to live in America, or you  will be fined; you will be hammered  with the extra amount of money you  will have to pay.  And let me finish one other thing  about that insurance. There is no State  in the United States of America that  requires anyone to insure their car for  damages to their own car or damages  physically to themselves. The only requirement in any State is for insurance  to cover against the damage you may  do to someone else. So once again, this  will be breaking brand-new ground,  never done in history, not envisioned  by the Constitution, not anywhere in  the enumerated powers. You have to  buy insurance on yourself just to live.  So I yield to my friend.  ",2010

I  will be brief in my strong support for  the Murray amendment to provide $1.5  billion  for  youth  jobs  programs  through the Workforce Investment Act  for summer and year-round employment.  This amendment will help create up  to 500,000 temporary  jobs  for young  people.  We know the youth  jobs program  works. Funds included in the Recovery  Act for youth jobs provided over 300,000  young adults with employment opportunities last summer, stimulating local  economies  all  across  the  country.  Young adults who work not only help  supplement family incomes, they also  spend the money they earn in their  communities. According to the Northeastern University Center  for Labor  Market Studies, every dollar earned by  a young adult returns $3 to the local  economy.  Youth jobs programs also help disadvantaged young adults become active members of their communities.  The many  local workforce  investment groups in my State of California  not only provide disadvantaged young  adults with  short-term employment,  they also offer job training and mentoring programs, help them advance  their careers with educational opportunities, and teach critical life skills.

138,Senate,111,-0.235,116,2010-03-03,Mr. BEGICH.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to have  filed an amendment  that would give Alaska Native corporations, ANCs, parity for an important  tax incentive encouraging the permanent protection of  land through the  charitable donation of a conservation  easement.  America’s wildlife, waters, and land  are an invaluable part of our Nation’s  heritage. It is imperative to preserve  these natural treasures for future generations. Congress long ago concluded  that it was good public policy to encourage the charitable contribution of  conservation easements  to organizations dedicated to maintaining natural  habitats or open spaces help protect  the Nation’s heritage. A conservation  easement creates a legally enforceable  land preservation agreement between a  willing landowner and another organization. The purpose of a conservation  easement  is  to protect permanently  land  from certain  forms of development or use. The property that is the  subject to the easement remains the  private property of the landowner. The  organization  holding  the  easement  must monitor future uses of the land to  ensure compliance with the terms of  the easement and to enforce the terms  if a violation occurs.  In 2006, Congress enhanced the charitable tax deduction  for conservation  easements in order to encourage such  gifts. With the 2006 legislation, Congress temporarily increased the maximum deduction limit for individuals  donating qualified conservation easements from 30 percent to 50 percent of  the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income.  Congress also created an exception for  qualified  farmers or ranchers, which  are nonpublicly traded corporations or  individuals whose gross income from  the trade or business of  farming  is  greater than 50 percent of the taxpayer’s gross income. In the case of a  qualified farmer or rancher, the limitation increased from 30 percent to 100  percent. The 2008  farm bill extended  the temporary rules for 2 additional  years to charitable contributions made  before December 31, 2009.  Unfortunately, the way the law was  crafted has disadvantaged a number of  important  landowners  in my  home  State.  Alaska  Native  corporations,  ANCs, own nearly 90 percent of the private land in Alaska, including some of  the most  scenic and  resource  rich.  However, although they are very similar  to  the  small  communal  family  farms that are eligible, subsistence-  based Alaskan Native communities are  ineligible for these important new tax  incentives. For  thousands  of years,  Alaska has been home to Native communities, whose  rich heritages,  languages, and traditions have thrived in  the region’s unique  landscape. Members of Alaska Native  communities  continue to have a deeply symbiotic relationship with the land even today.  Much like their ancestors, many Native Alaskan communities engage  in  traditional subsistence activities, with  nearly 70 percent of their food coming  from the land or adjacent waters. For  many communities, subsistence is an  economic necessity considering both  the lack of economic development and  the cost and difficulty involved in purchasing food. For example, in Kotzebue  a community in northwestern Alaska,  milk costs nearly $10 per gallon. In  Buckland, a village home to approximately 400 people, a pound of hamburger—when it is actually available—  costs $14.  In Alaska, the Native corporations  have an important role to be stewards  of  the  land. Their  shareholders  see  themselves as the caretakers of the  land and water as their ancestors have  for thousands of years. Nonetheless, in  Alaska today this means they have to  balance the need for resource development and the need to cultivate the  land for subsistence activities. The traditional lifestyles of Native Alaskans  are under increasing stress from outside influences. Population growth and  the pressure to pursue cash-generating  activities have increased the desire for  substantial development, significantly  adding to the ecological stress on already fragile ecosystems. Without permanent protection, their lands could be  developed in a manner that would destroy its ability to support the traditional ways and subsistence lifestyles  crucial  to Alaskan Native  communities. Making use of tax  incentives  available  to  other Americans will  make it easier for Native communities  to make the right decisions for their  shareholders.  Today, Alaska Native communities  are not eligible for the 50 percent deduction available  to  individuals because they are federally chartered as C  corporations under the Alaska Native  Claims Settlement Act of 1971, ANCSA.  This leaves Alaska Natives without the  ability to convert to an eligible entity  as other landowners can. In addition,  most Alaska Native corporations do  not have sufficient gross income from  the trade or business of what is considered traditional farming to be eligible  for the 100 percent deduction available  to qualified farmers or ranchers. This  is in spite of the fact that as a group  the Alaska Native  shareholders  of  Alaska Native corporations receive far  more in subsistence benefits than they  receive in income from the Alaska Native Corporation. As a result, Alaska  Native corporations do not have the  same ability to offset the cost to permanently  protect  their  properties,  which contain important wildlife, fish,  and other habitats, through donations  of qualified conservation easements.  This amendment will allow Alaska  Native corporations to protect these  important wildlife habitats, many used  for subsistence, by providing an enhanced deduction  for qualified  conservation easements. The amendment  modifies section 170(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code by creating a new  subsection that provides Alaska Native  corporations with a deduction for donations of certain qualified conservation  easements. In order to be eligible, a  qualified charitable conservation contribution must:  (1) otherwise qualify  under section 170(h)(1); (2) be made by a  Native corporation; and (3) be land that  was conveyed by ANCSA. The corporations would be limited to 10 percent of  their  land allotment under ANCSA.  Under section 170(b)(2)(iii)(I),  ‘‘Native  Corporation’’ is defined by ANCSA, section 3(m). Under section 170(b)(2)(i), the  maximum deduction limit would be set  at 100 percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. If the taxpayer  has deductions in excess of the applicable  percentage-of-income  limitation,  section  170(b)(2)(ii) would allow  the  taxpayer to carry-forward the deduction for up to 15 years.  Congress must act to assist Alaska  Native  communities  in permanently  protecting  their  culturally,  historically, and ecologically significant land,  preserving the communities and their  rich traditions in the process. I urge  my colleagues to support this important amendment.  f  MORNING BUSINESS  ",2010

Each year, millions of animals, mostly  cats and dogs, are euthanized due to over–  population and  the  lack of people willing  to  adopt them, at the same time that many animals are bred for the sole purpose of being  bought and sold at pet stores.  Lauren, originally from Texas, went to college in West Virginia. She graduated with a  degree in Public Relations. It was there that  she met her Great Dane, Harley. Now 6, Harley is her traveling companion on this cross  country journey.  Beginning on March 1st  in New Jersey,  Lauren, who resigned from her job at a Fortune 10 company in order to pursue her commitment to rescue dogs, will visit over 56 cities  in her travels across the country, organizing  events and benefits to raise money and educate people about Great Danes and rescue  dogs. All of the proceeds that are raised will  be donated  to rescues and shelters around  the country.  She is able to take on this worthy cause because of  the  kindness or her  family and  friends. In addition, complete strangers have  been able to follow Lauren on her adventures  through her Web site and her Twitter account.  Madam Speaker, Lauren O’Connor is venturing on an experience of a lifetime. Her trip  across  the country  to  raise awareness and  money for rescue dogs is inspiring to us all  and I would like to commend Lauren on her  commitment to this very worthy cause.  f  IN TRIBUTE TO REPRESENTATIVE  JOHN P.

Jack Murtha served his country  possible way.  He served  it  in Vietnam as a Marine; he  served in western Pennsylvania as a son, husband and father; and he served it for over 40  years in Harrisburg and in Washington, as a  legislator’s legislator.  He won respect for the honest, plainspoken,  compassionate way he played all of  these  roles.  But  to me, he played  brother.  He spoke often of the strong women in his  family being essential to his success in life.  His great-grandmother, he once  recalled,  told him at age 6, ‘‘You’re put on this Earth to  make a difference.’’  Boy, did he ever.  like a  those  roles  in  the  first  He volunteered as a Marine,  1950s during the Korean war.  He re-enlisted at age 34 and served in Vietnam—earning  the Bronze Star,  two Purple  Hearts, and  the Vietnamese Cross  for Gallantry.  He became the first Vietnam veteran to be  elected to Congress, in a February 1974 special election, starting a legendary Washington  career as a member of  the Appropriations  Committee.  When I came to this chamber for the first  time,  the  ‘‘Pennsylvania Corner’’ was  in  full  flower. We grew close and even though we  didn’t agree on everything, we worked  together often—on  issues ranging  from breast  cancer research  funding  to  the  Intrepid Museum on the Hudson.  When he decided  that  the  Iraq war was  unwinnable in 2005, he earned his stripes all  over again, providing leadership on this crucial  issue. He visited my district, and so many others, explaining how he came to his decision.  Madam Speaker, as a Congressman, Jack  Murtha won respect in these halls and on this  floor . . . but as a man, he earned our love.  We will miss him.  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife  Joyce, and the entire Murtha family.  f  RECOGNIZING DAVE ANDERSON  HON.

A world traveler,  voracious  reader,  exceptional  public  speaker, and a prolific writer, Doug Maloney  loved life!  It was Doug Maloney who led the county’s  legal defense of the ‘‘Marin-only’’ provision in  Ross philanthropist Beryl Buck’s multi-million-  dollar bequest. Maloney took on the San Francisco Foundation’s challenge to spend the millions on needs beyond  the county borders.  With an outstanding legal team, he presented  strong arguments upholding the Buck bequest  and proving  that, despite Marin’s affluence,  there were plenty of needs right in the county  that could use financial assistance. The 1986  court-approved  settlement  transferred  the  Buck Trust to newly formed Marin Community  Foundation  to  focus  funds on  research  into  aging, advocacy against alcohol abuse and research into educational issues. Had that battle  been lost, Marin would be a far different place.  The legal engineer of land-use restrictions  that saved West Marin from suburban sprawl,  Maloney successfully defended  the county’s  1972 zoning restrictions designed to preserve  and protect West Marin  farmland and  the  ranching  lifestyle.  Challenged  in  1989,  Maloney won a federal court decision upholding the zoning restrictions and turning back a  lawsuit by a Chicago  landowner wanting  to  carve up his 561-acre Nicasio ranch. While we  may take our open space and ranch lands for  granted, we owe a huge debt of gratitude to  the vision, political courage and legal skill of  Douglas Maloney.  A man of great personal integrity and not  one to back away from a rousing legal argument, Doug was good humored and a passionate follower of film and stage. He enjoyed  rewriting  fashionable Broadway  shows and  stage musicals, putting on a Marin spin and  political satire  to benefit  local causes, complete with titles like, ‘‘As the Candidate Turns,’’  ‘‘Damn Yuppies’’ and ‘‘Caucus Line.’’ A popular  op-ed  columnist  for  the Marin  Independent Journal, readers enjoyed his musings  and appreciated his skill at weaving literature,  history, politics, opinion and  the proverbial  Marin angle into his biweekly essays.  Doug Maloney was a devoted husband and  father. In addition to his sister, Marion Berger  of Redding, California, Mr. Maloney is survived  by his wife of twenty-two years, Ellen Caulfield  of San Rafael, Marin County, six children, ten  grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, Douglas Maloney will be  missed by so many who shared in his work  and vision. A man of letters and the law, he  practiced what he preached. It is fitting to recognize his extraordinary efforts on behalf of  Marin County and its residents. I join the many  people who will miss Doug Maloney’s inspiration, friendship, bright spirit, and clever quotes  delivered with perfect timing and meaning.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

144,,111,0.392,235,2010-03-03,Mr. BOUSTANY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today in support of LSU and its many achievements over the last 150 years.  As a graduate of LSU medical school, I can  attest to the excellence and professionalism of  the faculty and to the spirited campus atmosphere that is rivaled by few in the world.  LSU continues capturing  the hearts of  its  students just as it was since it first opened its  doors in 1860. It is a place with a unique culture,  rich  in  tradition and quality. Originally  serving as a war college, LSU has grown into  the flagship university of Louisiana.  Through  its  seven  institutions  of  higher  learning, as well as its distinguished faculty,  LSU prepares countless students for the careers of distinction  in Louisiana and around  the world. LSU also celebrates a number of  athletic achievements, including football, basetrack and  field national championball, and  ships.  In addition to its academic and athletic successes, the LSU system goes above and beyond to serve the people of Louisiana. From  its tireless efforts in the aftermath of the 2005  hurricanes to its various community outreach  programs, LSU makes a great deal of difference in the many communities it serves.  Throughout the years, LSU has persevered  to become one of the leading educational institutions in the country. It continues to uphold  excellence at every level and sets a very worthy goal of reaching the upper level of national  prominence by the end of 2010.  It  is my pleasure  to  recognize Louisiana  State University and join with the thousands of  current students and alumni to celebrate 150  years of excellence.

145,,111,-0.401,235,2010-03-03,Mr. COHEN.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor  the  life of physician Linkwood Williams, a famed Tuskegee Flight instructor and  Memphis physician. He was born to Mr. and  Mrs. Elbert and Bessie McNeal Williams on  August 29, 1918 in Bonita, Louisiana. At the  age of  three, he and his  family moved  to  Madison,  Illinois where he attended school  through  the  twelfth grade,  then worked with  his father at a local steel mill.  Having encouragement  from his  father  to  pursue higher education, Dr. Williams applied  and was accepted to study industrial arts at  Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, which was one  of six colleges where pilot training was offered  and the only facility in the country for training  black military pilots. After two years of studying, he decided to pursue full-time training in  the Civilian Pilots Training Program, a program that would prepare him to quickly adapt  to military aviation in the event of a national  emergency. Successfully progressing through  all Civilian Pilots Training courses, Dr. Williams became part of  the Tuskegee Experience and went on to train many of the 450 pilots who served in the 332nd Fighter Group.  The Tuskegee Airmen were the first combat  group of African American pilots and flew with  distinction during World War II.  At the end of the war, Dr. Williams married  Katie Whitney, moved to Cleveland, Ohio, and  became the third African-American to join the  carpenters union. He later enrolled at Western  Reserve University  to complete  the required  pre-med courses for acceptance into medical  school. Afterwards, he applied to and was accepted to Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. During the third year of his  residency, he was hired as a part-time instructor to teach Air Force ROTC cadets at Tennessee State University.  After completing his residency, Dr. Linkwood  Williams moved to Memphis, Tennessee and  began his OB–GYN practice, becoming  the  first African American OB–GYN in the city. He  worked  for 31 years until his  retirement  in  1995.  Dr. Linkwood Williams was a member of  Mississippi Boulevard Christian Center, where  he served in the Community Outreach Group,  the American Medical Association, The Memphians,  Kappa  Alpha  Psi  Fraternity,  and  Sigma Pi Phi (Delta). Dr. Linkwood Williams  passed away surrounded by his family on Saturday, February 20, 2010 and was laid to rest  on Saturday, February 27, 2010. He was 91  years old. Dr. Williams truly left his mark on  the world through his service to the citizens of  Memphis, Tennessee. We are grateful to have  had the pleasure of his dedication and perseverance in the community.  f  REMEMBERING FRANK SARRIS  HON.

And I would like to recognize  her family who is sitting in the gallery  with us this morning.  Madam Speaker, at the young age of  21, Geraldine was one  of  the  first  women in history trained to fly American military aircraft. Her call to serve  did not end after her military career.  Geraldine also prevailed in her second  battle, the one to achieve full veteran  status for her WASP sisters.  Today, I also honor Geraldine as the  mother of nine wonderful children and  a community leader who advocated on  behalf of several worthy causes.  Madam Speaker, later today, Geraldine and other WASP pioneers will be  awarded the Congressional Gold Medal  for their invaluable service more than  60 years ago. Unfortunately, Geraldine  passed away in 2001 and cannot be here  to receive the award in person, but I  am very happy that her family will  proudly represent her at the ceremony.  Madam Speaker, Geraldine is a true  American hero and a great source of  pride for the 17th Congressional District of Illinois, and I can think of no  better recognition of her services to  this country than the Congressional  Gold Medal.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  CUELLAR).

148,House,111,-0.379,8,2010-03-10,Mr. HOYER.," I thank my friend for  yielding, and I thank the ranking Republican for his comments. I thank Mr.  COHEN for his leadership on this issue.  ‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,  that they are endowed by their Creator  with certain unalienable Rights, that  among these are Life, Liberty and the  pursuit of Happiness.’’  So spoke our Founding Fathers. Our  Founding  Fathers  spoke,  however,  without a clear understanding of the  impact of their words. Even as great as  our Founding Fathers were, they did  not live out the promise of those words  in this land. Some were slave owners.  Clearly, the contradiction between our  words and the actions of our day-to-  day lives were a contradiction from our  stated values to our practices.  Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.,  called  America’s attention to that paradox,  to that contradiction, to that schizophrenic life that we had led. Martin  Luther King, Jr., had a lieutenant who  was a giant of a leader in his own right,  and we are honored to serve with him;  in my view, the most historic figure  that serves among the 535 of us who  have been given the privilege to represent our people and defend the Constitution and protect and preserve our  democracy. JOHN is  a  giant  among us; a quiet, self-effacing, humble giant, but a giant nonetheless.  Forty-five years ago, civil rights activists attempted to march from Selma  to Montgomery to demand that their  Governor honor their right to vote and  their God-given equality. Remember  Jefferson’s words, that our rights are  not given by the majority. They are  not given by Congress. They are not  even given by the Constitution. They  are given to us by a power higher than  us. That is the glory of America, that  every individual is an important being,  endowed by their Creator with certain  unalienable rights.  The world knows what happened to  those marchers; how they were stopped  by State  troopers  at  the Edmund  Pettus Bridge in Selma, how they were  savagely beaten with nightsticks, and  how this 23-year-old giant, whose name  was then not known, this young man  from Troy, Alabama, JOHNLEWIS, who  was helping to lead the march from the  front with Hosea Williams, was beaten  to the ground and took life-threatening  injuries.  Today, as a Member of Congress,  JOHNLEWISstill bears those scars, but  he does not bear resentment. What a  lesson  for all of us who suffer the  verbal slings and arrows almost daily  in this public profession which we pursue.  But JOHNLEWIStook more than rhetorical slings and arrows. He was beatLEWIS en, subjected to hate, spit upon, subjected to prejudice and division and  segregation and  rejection. But  still,  Christ-like,  following  Gandhi’s example,  turned  the other  cheek and said, I seek justice, and I  will continue to seek justice for myself  and for others, no matter the opposition.  LEWIS,  JOHN b1100  I will not do so violently. I will not  do so by assaulting those who assault  me. But I will appeal to the conscience  of the Nation.  I will appeal to the  promise in our declaration, in our Constitution, and  in  the principles  for  which this Nation stands. And it was a  powerful appeal.  This weekend, I and others—Mr. CAO  was with us—were privileged to walk  with that giant of a man, JOHNLEWIS,  across that bridge. It is a bridge across  a river, but it is also a bridge to brotherhood; a bridge to a realization of  America’s promise; a bridge to a better  America; a bridge to a better country;  a bridge, as my friend and brother JOHN  LEWISwould say, to the beloved community; a bridge, then, over troubled  waters, who have to some degree been  stilled, but not silenced.  There is still prejudice in this land.  There  is still division  in this  land.  There  is still not the reconciliation  that America still strives for. And that  is why I return almost every year with  my  friend JOHNLEWIS to walk over  that bridge, to remind myself—and I  have taken my granddaughter to remind her as well—that although the  mission of Martin Luther King, Jr.,  was extraordinarily successful, and the  mission of JOHN LEWIS, which continues to this day, has been successful,  it is not over. The mission and the  commitment must continue. That  is  what we must remember on this anniversary of March 7, 1965, when a group  of our fellow citizens peacefully walked  to register to vote. Is there any more  sacred  right  in  a  democracy  than  that—the ability to express your opinion, unbowed by government or unbowed or dissuaded by threats? That  was JOHNLEWIS’s mission then. He was  so successful. But the mission is not  over. And as we vote on this resolution,  we ought to all commit ourselves to  walking with the wind of justice, of  which JOHNLEWIS spoke, of which he  has written. But, much more importantly, the life that he has led teaches  us the power of conscience, the power  of peacefully standing up for the rights  of  which  Jefferson  spoke:  the  unalienable rights of life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness.  God has blessed America through the  life of JOHNLEWISand so many others  whose courage and convictions have  made us better. Support this resolution. But, more than that, live out its  promise for all of our citizens.  ",2010

Mr. Speaker, 45 years ago, on March  7, 1965, Hosea Williams and I led 600  peaceful,  nonviolent  protestors  attempting to march from Selma, Alabama, to the State capitol in Montgomery to dramatize to the world that  people of color wanted to register to  vote. We  left Brown  Chapel AME  Church that afternoon on a sacred mission, prepared to defy the dictates of  man to demonstrate the truth of a  higher law.

Mr.  LINCOLN  DIAZ-BALART  of  Florida. I thank my dear friend Mr.  ROSKAM for the time, and I simply rise  to join my voice in praise and commendation for all those who have made  possible that this resolution come to  the floor. I think it speaks very highly  of this Congress.  Mr. Speaker, there is no more generous nation  in the world than the  American Nation, the American people.  One sees that generosity time and time  again. As Mr. BLUMENAUERmentioned,  we  just  saw  an  extraordinary  outpouring of generosity toward the people of Haiti, and then we have seen another tragedy, and the American people, with regard to Chile, are demonstrating once again  that extraordinary generosity.  So I think it is so appropriate, and  that is why I rise to commend all of  those that have made this resolution  possible, to accelerate the deduction  for the donations that Americans have  made, extend that policy with regard  to Haiti and to make it possible with  regard to the donations that are being  made or have been made or will be  made for those who have suffered in  Chile. Our hearts and our prayers go  out to those who suffer in both of those  neighbor,  friendly nations. They are  wonderful people, great friends of the  United States.  Remembering the victims,  I think  the Congress, by this action today, not  only takes a step that is consistent  with the generosity of the American  people, but I think makes a very commendable act. So I simply wanted to  join my voice of commendation for all  of those who have made this possible.  ",2010
152,House,111,-0.428,22,2010-03-10,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, I  have no further requests for time, and  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2010
153,House,111,-0.404,29,2010-03-10,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition  to  the  resolution, and  I  yield myself 4 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to  say I have quite enjoyed working with  the gentleman from Ohio on this issue  and a number of the issues we have had  dealings with  since  I have become  chairman, and I fundamentally agree  with him and other supporters of the  resolution that it is right for the House  to have an open, honest debate on the  merits of our ongoing military operations  in Afghanistan, and outside,  outside, the context of a defense spending bill or a supplemental appropriations bill. This is a good thing to be  doing.  By vesting the power to declare war  with the Congress, the Founders  intended the United States would go to  war only when absolutely necessary,  and it is incumbent on this body to  consider as thoroughly as possible the  purpose and ongoing necessity of committing U.S. forces to battle.  Now, as a procedural matter, I take  issue with the  invocation of section  5(c) of the War Powers Resolution as  the basis for this debate, because that  section authorizes a privileged resolution, like the one before us today, to  require  the withdrawal  of  combat  forces when Congress has not authorized the use of military force.  There really can’t be any doubt that  Congress authorized U.S. military action in Afghanistan. The authorization  for the use of military force passed by  Congress in late September 2001 explicitly empowers  the President  to use  force against the terrorists responsible  for the 9/11 attacks and those who harbored them. President Obama is doing  just that.  But putting aside procedure, the notion that at this particular moment we  would demand a complete withdrawal  of our troops from Afghanistan by the  end of the year, without regard to the  consequence of our withdrawal, without  regard  to  the  situation on  the  ground,  including efforts to promote  economic development, expand the rule  of law, and without any measurement  of whether the  ‘‘hold’’ strategy now  being implemented is indeed working, I  don’t think is the responsible thing to  do.  Our troops are  fighting a complex  nexus  of  terrorist  organizations—al  Qaeda,  the  Taliban—all  of  which  threaten the stability of the Afghan  Government,  and  they  have  demonstrated their ability to strike our  homeland.  If we withdraw  from Afghanistan before the government there  is capable of providing a basic level of  security for its own people, we face the  prospect that the Taliban once again  will take the reins of power in Kabul  and provide safe haven to al Qaeda.  That would be a national security disaster.

154,House,111,0.3,36,2010-03-10,Mr. FORTENBERRY.,"  I  thank  the  gentlewoman from Florida for her leadership on Foreign Affairs and for the  time.  Madam Speaker, the situation in Afghanistan is complex, and it has been  difficult. And it has serious ramifications for regional and global stability.  Congress understood this in the aftermath of September 11 and authorized  the use of force in Afghanistan. The  situation is no less serious today.  We would all like to see our troops  come home as quickly as possible, leaving Afghanistan a stronger and better  place. And we all deeply care about our  troops, particularly those who are now  wounded, who have fought so valiantly.  But, Madam Speaker, decisions regarding the disposition of our forces in  Afghanistan should be made in concert  with our commanders in the field who  take seriously their responsibility for  our troops and the success of that mission. I have confidence that General  McChrystal,  after  a  thorough  and  painstaking calculus, has provided a  clear plan to increase stability in Afghanistan and allow our troops to withdraw as quickly and as responsibly as  possible. Moreover, now is not the time  to  leave  fledgling civil  society programs more vulnerable to intimidation  and attack.  So, Madam Speaker, I respectfully  submit that we cannot afford to risk  compromising the future of that region  at this most difficult time, and I urge  my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution.  ",2010
155,House,111,0.243,43,2010-03-10,Mr. DENT.," Madam Speaker, I rise in  strong opposition to this House Concurrent Resolution 248 that directs the  President to remove U.S. Armed Forces  from Afghanistan within 30 days of  adoption of this resolution unless the  President determines that it is not safe  to remove U.S. forces before the end of  the 30-day timeline. But even if there is  an identified danger, U.S. forces would  still have to be removed by December  31.  Really, here is the catch: There is a  clear and present danger in removing  our men and women  from the  field  while they are engaged  in the  first  major assault of President Obama’s reaffirmed counterinsurgency strategy in  Afghanistan.  But here is another danger: damaging  the morale of the troops who sacrifice  their safety and well-being to fight to  protect our homeland, our freedoms, by  not providing them with the support  and resources they need to complete  their mission.  This  is a very dangerous business,  moving troops out of a country. I have  sat with Secretary Gates on more than  one occasion over the years talking  about withdrawing troops, in this case  from Iraq, and how complex a situation  this is and how dangerous it is and the  logistical  realities  of moving  this  many people safely.  But don’t take my word  for  it.  I  think we  should also  listen  to  the  words of our Commander  in Chief,  President Barack Obama, who, on December 1 in his address to the Nation,  said, ‘‘I am convinced that our security  is at stake in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent  extremism practiced by al Qaeda. It is  from here that we were attacked on  9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak.’’  President Barack Obama’s words.  He goes on. ‘‘This is no idle danger.  No hypothetical threat. In the last few  months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were  sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new  acts of terror, and this danger will only  grow if the region slides backwards and  al Qaeda can operate with impunity.  We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda,  and to do that we must increase the  stability and capacity of our partners  in the region.’’ Again, that was President Obama.  He goes on  in another address on  March 27 of 2009, where he made another statement. He says, ‘‘And if the  Afghan  Government  falls  to  the  Taliban or allows al Qaeda to go unchallenged, that country will again be  a base for terrorists who want to kill  as many of our people as they possibly  can.’’  Secretary Gates, a very  fine Secretary of Defense, and I am pleased  President Obama has kept him on, said  on February 5 of this year, ‘‘This is a  critical moment in Afghanistan. I am  confident that we can achieve our objectives, but only if the coalition continues to muster the resolve for this  difficult and dangerous mission.’’  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,  on September 23, said, ‘‘Some people  say, well, al Qaeda is no longer in Afghanistan. If Afghanistan were taken  over by the Taliban, I can’t tell you  how fast al Qaeda would be back in Afghanistan.’’ Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton.  I also want to mention what General  Petraeus has said.  ",2010

159,House,111,-0.592,71,2010-03-10,Mr. PAYNE.," Let me begin by commending Mr. MEEKS from New York  and Ms. WATERS from California  for  this very important legislation, H.R.  4573, Debt Relief for Earthquake Recovery in Haiti.  I also would like to acknowledge Mr.  for  his  very  impassioned  speech. Yet I am not surprised.  Mr. BACHUS, you may recall, when we  were fighting the brutal Government of  Sudan, we tried to get capital market  sanctions. You supported our legislation that brought Mr. Greenspan to the  Senate to say, Defeat the Payne-Bachus legislation because it would disrupt  the stock market. So I commend you  again for the great work that you have  done.  Madam Speaker, as we have mentioned, Haiti has had such a tremendous history. Since we know what is in  the bill, I might also mention that it  was during the Revolutionary War that  Haitian soldiers fought in one of the  key battles, the Battle of Savannah,  where just recently a statue was completed  in Savannah.  I spoke at the  dedication a year or so ago. It turned  the tide of the war.  Haitian soldiers fought in a number  of battles to help the original colonies  of  the United States become  independent  from Britain. So they shed  blood for our independence. Many people didn’t know that.  Then, as you know, with the defeat of  Napoleon’s  army  by Haiti,  as was  talked about, the reparations that had  to be paid back caused France to be  cash poor and land rich. It therefore  forced them to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States because it  had lost the cash that Haiti had produced. Over 50 percent of all the commodities of tea and coffee and sugar in  Europe came from Haiti. France lost  that and  therefore needed  the cash  from the Louisiana sale to have  its  treasury  boosted. As  a  result,  the  Lewis and Clark expedition began in  St. Louis, and the United States was  able then to take the rest of this Nation. Once again, Haiti had a tremendous part of this.

Tonight I am joined by several of my  colleagues  from around  the country  who want to talk to you about the  economy and how we are working hard  here  in Congress  to  set  the  record  straight, but also, more importantly,  to put our people back to work.  If you remember when we took office,  Mr. Speaker, we were suffering from  one of the worst recessions since the  Great Depression. In fact, many have  called this the Great Recession. And  ironically, of all commercials, there is  a contemporary insurance commercial  out on the airwaves today that says,  ‘‘How will we remember the time and  our experience? Will we remember this  time as the great recession or the recession that made us great?’’ I think  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:26 Mar 11, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10MR7.163 H10MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2010
162,House,111,0.54,92,2010-03-10,Mr. OLSON.," Thank you  for those  very kind comments, and I couldn’t  agree with you more. One of the problems I have with this decision is how it  was sprung upon all of us.  I am the ranking member on the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over  NASA, and I found out, like probably  all of you, everybody here in the Chamber, by reading the newspaper. No one  ever gave me a heads-up that this was  coming. Nobody ever gave our ranking  member a heads-up this was coming. I  don’t think even the chairman of the  committee had any knowledge  that  this was coming. It seemed to be a  small little cabal in the White House  that made this decision that has a tremendous impact on our society.  You mentioned the loss of jobs. There  are going to be thousands and thousands and thousands of good-paying,  high-tech  jobs, the kind of  jobs we  want here in America, that are going  to go away. As you alluded to, once  those people walk out, they are gone.  ",2010

164,Senate,111,0.377,106,2010-03-10,Mr. WICKER.," I appreciate my colleague from Nebraska getting into the  weeds because it is important that we  know the details of the numbers here.  I think there is also a sort of big-picture aspect to this. There are a lot of  Americans out there who may not have  read the details the Senator from Nebraska just outlined, but they instinctively know you can’t do all this to  one-sixth of our economy and  save  money for the Federal Government at  the  same  time. They  instinctively  know this is going to turn out, as big  entitlement programs always do, to be  more expensive  than has been estimated and it is going to cost the American taxpayer and future generations  in terms of the national debt.  I would like to pivot and talk about  what this is going to do to State governments because that is an additional  aspect over and above  the gigantic  numbers the Senator  from Nebraska  mentioned.  Really, almost half of the additional  coverage in this Senate bill, which the  House is being asked to adopt lock,  stock, and barrel without even changing so much as a semicolon, half of the  coverage is going to be under Medicaid.  We all know Medicaid requires a huge  Federal investment, but Medicaid also  always requires a State match. Under  the provisions of this bill, if it is enacted, States will be told that the magnificent Federal Government has  increased coverage, and now, Mr. State  Legislator, Mr. State Governor, you  figure out a way to pay your part of it.  I know this much: In my State of  Mississippi,  our  legislators  and  our  Governor have had to stay up late 2  years in a row figuring out a way to  pay for the Medicaid match they are  already being asked to pay, much less  this new mandate of additional persons  who would be covered under this Senate  language. There  is no way  the  State of Mississippi can stand this new  Medicaid coverage without an increase  in our taxes at the State level. I don’t  think we can cut teachers enough, although teachers might have to be cut  to pay this Federal mandate. I don’t  think we can cut local law enforcement  enough, although that might have to  be cut too. It is just a huge, unfunded  burden on the States. Quite frankly,  even if all of the promises that are  being made on the Senate side come  true—that we will clean this up in reconciliation, which I frankly doubt can  possibly happen—the States are going  to be faced with this huge unfunded  mandate.  You don’t have to take our word for  it on this side of the aisle. Democratic  Governor after Democratic Governor  has had press conferences, they have  sent letters, they have sent messages,  they have made themselves available  to the press. Governor Bredesen of the  State of Tennessee said this bill is the  ‘‘mother of all unfunded mandates’’  and has urged, even at this late date,  that we not go down this road.  So I appreciate my friend from Nebraska pointing out what this is going  to do to the Federal budget, and  I  would simply commend the bipartisan  State officials who have been talking  to anyone within the sound of their  voices saying that State governments  cannot  afford  this mandate  at  the  State level, and it will inevitably result  in an  increase  in taxes at the  State  level—something we  certainly  don’t need at this time of economic  hardship.

165,Senate,111,-0.395,120,2010-03-10,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, the Senate can take an important step today  in alleviating  the  incredible  strains  this continuing economic crisis is having on thousands of  families  in my  State, and millions of families across  America. In approving the American  Workers, State, and Business Relief  Act of 2010, we can end what has been  an agonizing procession of will-we-or-  won’t-we votes on extending unemployment benefits and COBRA  insurance  subsidies for those who have lost their  jobs. And we can ensure that, by extending enhanced Federal payments to  State  Medicaid  programs,  crucial  health coverage and other vital State  services are not cut.  Those who doubt the wisdom of extending  unemployment  and  COBRA  benefits until  the end of  this year  should hear the phone calls and read  the letters that have come into my office over the past few weeks. As the  Congress has debated, and delayed, on  the question of whether to pass another  short-term  extension,  these  Americans, left jobless by a crisis not  of their own making, wondered if the  economic lifeline that keeps food on  their  tables and  shelter over  their  heads would be severed. By approving  this  legislation, we will ensure that  these families are not left in limbo by  delays in Congress. Giving them some  measure of certainty, at a time when  the economic crisis has turned so much  upside-down, is the right thing to do.  What’s more, continuing these benefits  is one of the most important steps we  can take to nurture the fragile recovery of our economy. These payments  benefit not just families coping with  unemployment, but provide an immediate stimulus to local economies that  have been devastated by the recession.  Likewise, the decision to extend enhanced Federal Medicaid  assistance  percentages,  or FMAP,  funding  to  States,  boosts  the  entire  economy  while helping  those  in  the greatest  need. Michigan and other States have  made clear that without this extension, we would  leave giant holes  in  their budget.  In the absence of enhanced funding, the steps the States  would have to take balance their budgets could mean devastating cuts  to  vital programs that serve the victims  of this crisis. Such cuts would also  dampen the recovery, removing a pillar  that has kept economic activity from  collapsing during the crisis. Extending  these payments gives States, and the  citizens they serve, much-needed certainty.  This legislation also would continue  tax provisions that can provide additional support to economic recovery  and job creation. In extending the research and development tax credit and  other measures, we give our businesses  another tool they can use as they seek  to regain ground, begin growing again  and start putting people back to work.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this important legislation.  ",2010
166,Senate,111,-0.374,120,2010-03-10,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, today,  the Senate is passing the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act,  STELA. This  legislation modernizes  and extends  important provisions of  the Satellite Home Viewer Act, which  contains statutory copyright licenses  and Communications Act authorizations that allow for the retransmission  of broadcast television signals by satellite and cable providers.  Ensuring that Americans have access  to broadcast television content is important, and it is particularly relevant  for consumers in rural areas who might  not otherwise be able to receive these  signals over the air. The  legislation  that the Senate is passing today will  ensure that nobody will be left in the  dark for the foreseeable future.  The Satellite Home Viewer Act provides  cable and  satellite  companies  with statutory licenses to allow them  to retransmit the content of broadcast  television stations. It also contains important authorizations in the Communications Act that facilitate these retransmissions.  Broadcast  television  plays a critical role in cities and towns  across the country, and remains the  primary way in which consumers are  able to access local content such as  news, weather, and sports.  Cable and satellite providers help to  expand the footprint of broadcast stations by allowing them to reach viewers who are unable to receive signals  over the air. Vermont is an example of  how cable and satellite companies can  provide service to consumers in rural  areas who might not otherwise receive  these signals.  Vermonters will see improved service  when this legislation is enacted. As the  act has been  reauthorized over  the  years, I have worked to improve the  service that Vermonters receive from  cable and  satellite companies. Residents in southern Vermont have seen  improvements.  Windham  and  Bennington Counties are not considered part of the Burlington television  market that encompasses the rest of  the State, and for many years those  residents  were  unable  to  receive  Vermont broadcast  stations by  satellite. Congress changed this in 2004,  and DirecTV has been providing these  Vermonters with access to Vermont  stations ever since.  I am also pleased that under this legislation, DISH Network will be able to  provide their subscribers in southern  Vermont with the same service. As  soon as the DISH Network uses this authority,  virtually  everyone  in  the  State will be able to access the news  and information that is truly important to Vermonters, whether it is the  debate over relicensing the Vermont  Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon  or the UVM basketball team’s quest to  make the NCAA Tournament.  One  other  important  way  that  STELA will preserve and improve existing service for consumers is by correcting a flaw in the statutory copyright license for the cable industry. An  unintended  result of current  law  is  that  the  cable  license  requires  the  cable industry to pay copyright holders  for signals that many of their subscribers do not actually receive. This is  often referred to as the phantom signal  problem. The effect of this anomaly in  the law is that Comcast is required to  pay copyright royalties based on their  subscriber base across the northeast  for  the Canadian  television content  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:27 Mar 11, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10MR6.023 S10MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2010

173,,111,-0.519,204,2010-03-10,Mr. TOWNS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to acknowledge  that March  is Red Cross  Month. This is a time for us to officially recognize the essential role that the American Red  Cross plays in our communities helping to ensure our communities are more ready and resilient  in  the  face of  future disasters. March  has been celebrated as ‘‘Red Cross Month’’  since 1943 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt called the wartime fundraising campaign  the ‘‘greatest single crusade of mercy in all of  history.’’ As we celebrate this American Red  Cross Month,  I encourage all  individuals  to  commit  themselves  to strengthen  their own  communities  through service and volunteer  opportunities with the Red Cross. Volunteers  help make our country stronger, and no where  is this more evident than in communities coming together to support each other in times of  need.  From  rebuilding  former adversaries after  World War II, to saving lives after the tragic  earthquake in Haiti, the American people have  an unmatched tradition of responding to challenges at home and abroad with compassion  and generosity. In just over one month since  the earthquake, the Red Cross has provided  assistance to more than 1.3 million people and  will continue  to aid hundreds of  thousands  more in the months ahead. In Chile, the American Red Cross is prepared to mobilize support, including relief supplies and trained personnel. The American Red Cross is also assisting  the Chilean Red Cross,  through  the  International Federation of the Red Cross and  Red Crescent appeal, to assist 75,000 people  for six months in the areas of shelter, water  health  and  telecommuniand  sanitation,  cations.  At home and abroad, one in five Americans  is  touched by  the Red Cross every single  year. The American Red Cross  in Greater  New York responds to an average of 7 emergencies  a  day—fires,  floods,  building  collapses—and provides immediate humanitarian  aid to as many as 100,000 people affected by  these emergencies each year.  In my district  alone in 2009, the Greater New York Chapter  responded  to 264 disasters and  registered  1,337 people for Red Cross assistance.  Whether it is an earthquake or a single family home fire; a call for blood or a call for help,  the American Red Cross is there. I ask that  you and my distinguished colleagues join me  in applauding the hard work of the American  Red Cross volunteers and celebrating March  as American Red Cross Month.  f  MEGAN HELT  HON.

174,,111,-0.487,204,2010-03-10,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, the beginning of March marks the one-month process of one of the most important collective actions that our country partakes in, the national  Census. Thus I want to express my support to  House Resolution 1096, deeming this month  designated as Census Awareness Month. The  Census provides an opportunity  to not only  count how many people live in our great nation, but to also collect valuable data that will  help to provide services to millions of Americans. According to information collected from  the Census, over $400 billion per year in federal funding is distributed to State and local  governments. As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, I want to ensure that all  African Americans are counted as the Census  has significant importance in the black community. The implementation and evaluation of  programs like the Equal Employment Opportunity Act,  the Civil Rights Act and  the Fair  Housing Act are based on Census data.  In  2007 the Black community grew to 40.7 million  from 33.5 million in the year 2000. Underrepresentation of minorities is the leading cause  of underfunding programs that these communities utilize  the most, such as education,  health care, housing and  transportation programs.  The myths  that  further discourage people  from participating in the Census must be dispelled. The Census  is not a  long process;  there are merely 10 questions to answer, making it the shortest Census form in history. By  law  the Census Bureau cannot share  individual  responses with anyone;  that  includes  immigration authorities, IRS, FBI, CIA or any  other government agency. The U.S. Census  preferred method of participation  is  through  forms sent through mail and returned through  mail and Census workers will only visit households that do not return their forms. This snapshot of our nation also effects Congress itself;  the distribution of U.S. House of Representative seats are based on the Census. In order  to have proportional representation as well as  programs and funding that directly serve the  American people, everyone must participate in  the 2010 United States Census. Underrepresentation of our population must be avoided;  thus from March to April, I urge everyone to  go  to www.census.gov  to  find out more on  how you can be  involved  in  the 2010 U.S.  Census.  f  TRIBUTE TO JAMES D.

According  to a report prepared by the Joint Economic Committee, which I chair, an estimated 64 million women in this country  lack adequate health care; over  one-quarter of our daughters between  the ages of 19 and 24 lack health care,  and women between the ages of 55 and  64 are particularly vulnerable. That’s  because  so many women depend on  their spouse’s employer-based health  care, and, all too often, they discover  they are not age eligible for Medicare  when their older husbands retire. A  staggering 39 percent of all low-income  women lack health care.  Ultimately, this is a vote about who  we will be as a country. For our sisters,  our daughters, and our mothers, yes,  vote ‘‘yes’’ for them.  f  HEALTH CARE REFORM  (Mr. DANIEL E.

Mr. Speaker, it occurs to me  that one of the strangest things that  happens on this floor is when you bring  the gavel down and say, The time has  expired, and then people keep on talking and then turn to you and they say,  I yield back the balance of my time.  That is sort of a metaphor for the problem here  in Congress. When we announce a tax cut, we say we are giving  something back to you as if we had the  call on your money  in the  first  instance.  It’s just one of the fictions we deal  with, such as the fiction that this bill  isn’t going to cost us any money, or  the fiction that the American people  don’t know what’s in the bill, or the  fiction that the American people will  love it once we pass it.  Let’s remember August. It did occur.  It’s something that is a manifestation  of the American people and how they  feel. Let’s not  ignore the American  people.

177,House,111,-0.426,11,2010-03-18,Mr. TONKO.," Madam Speaker, I think  it is so important for us to move forward and not be derailed in our efforts  to reform what is important policy in  this country. Health care, obviously, is  something that needs to be provided in  terms of insurance to our working families out there. We know the impact of  delay and the impact of no reforms.  Status quo simply does not cut it. We  cannot afford to allow our families to  continue with such gross injustice.  Obviously,  the  increase  projected,  $1,800 per year for family plans, is a  train wreck waiting to happen. Today  the average of some $13,000 for family  plans would grow in the next decade to  some $31,000. Which small business out  there could afford to pay that or even  a fraction of that for its employees?  We know that what we’re trying to  maintain here  is an employee-based  health care insurance system. Well, the  employer-based  system  needs  some  sort of relief. We need to know that  there are assurances  for  containing  those costs, for making certain that  into the future we’ll have a safety net  for our working families and for our  business community. In the measure  we’re advancing there is assistance for  small businesses. It’s providing them  the opportunity to make this sharing  affordable.  We know that the benefits that come  with reducing the deficit with our bill,  having been scored by CBO, is looking  at $130 billion for the first 10 years and  some  $1.2  trillion  into  the next  10  years. This is progress. This is a step in  the right direction.  We also know of the reforms where  those who are denied,  for whatever  bias—for gender, for preexisting conditions, for acne, almost a laughable concept, but used to deny people. Toddlers  who are denied because of overweight,  individuals who have perhaps been violated, sexually violated, or domestic  violence, have been denied. These reforms are essential, and let’s do them  now.  ",2010
178,House,111,-0.238,25,2010-03-18,Mr. BOSWELL.," I do rise in support.  I understand you had the debate, but  I would feel remiss if I didn’t make a  few comments  for my  fellow airmen  that have served and serve with great  distinction.  It has probably been said, but Congress  established  the Distinguished  Flying Cross 80 years ago, and today it  is America’s oldest military aviation  award. The medal was created to symbolize sacrifice and heroism.  I applaud Mr. CALVERT for  introducing this legislation, which will finally give Distinguished Flying Cross  recipients  the  national  recognition  they deserve. Many may know that I  served in the U.S. Army for 20 years,  including a couple tours in Vietnam. I  had  the  opportunity  to  serve with  many great aviators who were also  awarded  the  Distinguished  Flying  Cross.  I was truly honored to not only serve  with these aviators but, in some cases,  to supervise them. I had the opportunity to recommend brave individuals  for  the Distinguished Flying Cross.  Their heroism and valor oftentimes inspired me and kept me going in the  face of adversity.  This bill today honors my fellow aviators I served with during my 20 years,  in addition to the men and women who  now are protecting us in the skies domestically and abroad. My experience  in the Army has a strong influence on  me and added to many positives in the  rest of my life.  When I look back at that time, I remember those I served with who gave  the ultimate sacrifice to our country,  those who served and gave their lives  for our freedom. And I feel honored I  had the opportunity to serve. Because  of this experience, I truly relish what a  tremendous gift and what a privilege it  is to be an American.  Today  I am extremely pleased  to  honor those aviators and all aviators. I  strongly urge my colleagues to join in  supporting H.R. 2788.  ",2010

His name is Gary Hall.  He was in my office yesterday.  Gary Hall won five gold medals, three  silver medals, and two bronze medals  in  swimming,  over  three  separate  Olympics, really an incredible achievement. He got his medical  insurance  through the Olympic Committee for 12  years, but after that he wasn’t eligible.  And guess what happened? No one  would write him insurance because he  has diabetes.  The  insurance companies  said, we  don’t care if you’ve won gold medals,  silver medals, and bronze medals, we  won’t give you insurance.  Now, that has got to change. We have  to pass a health reform bill. Whether  you’ve won a gold medal in swimming  or you’re just an average Joe or Jane,  you ought to be able to buy insurance,  even if you’ve got diabetes.  We are going to have a bill on the  floor shortly that we are going to vote  on. The vote’s going to be transparent.  It’s going to be recorded. Everybody  knows what it’s going to be. It’s going  to be constitutional. It’s going to be  just the way we’ve voted  for years.  We’re going to make sure people get  health insurance in this country.  f  SIMPLE TRUTHS  (Mr. KINGSTON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

And they  just don’t mention  some of the other things that are going  on, like the budget this year is $3.8 trillion that we don’t have. But the taxpayers are going to have to pay for it.  They’ll have to pay to for it with inflation or higher taxes.  And they don’t mention that there’s  going to be $569.2 billion in new taxes.  What the heck, we can afford that. And  Medicare and Medicare Advantage  is  going to be cut by $520 billion. But  what the heck, the seniors, they don’t  have to worry about that. They can,  you know, ask  their grandkids  for  some of that money.  And of course the total cost is not  $980 billion. It’s going to be about $1.3  or $1.4 trillion, and I really believe it’s  going to be more like $2.5 to $3 trillion.  We don’t have that money, and it’s a  new entitlement, but what the heck,  America. You can handle that. This is  just money, and we can always print  more. Of course it causes inflation and  higher taxes, but who cares.

181,House,111,-0.488,32,2010-03-18,Ms. HIRONO.," Mr. Speaker, it bears  repeating, few Americans have more at  stake  in  health  care  reform  than  women.  Forty States allow private health insurance companies to gender rate their  premiums. As a result, a 25-year-old  woman may pay between 6 percent and  45 percent more than a 25-year-old man  to get the same coverage.  Fifty-two percent of women reported  postponing or forgoing medical care because of cost. Only 39 percent of men  reported having had those experiences.

182,House,111,0.561,46,2010-03-18,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my colleague  from Louisiana, Dr. FLEMING,  for not only yielding a little time to  me but also for being here on the floor  to control the time. Mr. Speaker, as  you know, each side of the aisle gets a  leadership hour, and  it  seems  that  maybe our Democratic friends who had  the previous hour and only took 35  minutes came to the conclusion that  the  less  said  the better about  this  health care bill. That seems to be the  way  things  have  been  going, Mr.  Speaker, in regard to how much we  know about what is in the bill. We will  be talking about that a good little bit  tonight. I can assure you, Mr. Speaker,  on our side of the aisle, we’ve got a lot  to say. I think the more said the better.  The American people need to know.  They need to be informed. Indeed they  know already a lot, know enough to  say, as 70 percent of them do, that they  don’t want this bill. Not this bill. As  Dr. FLEMING said, Mr. Speaker, I was  doing a tele-town hall meeting to my  constituents  in the 11th of Georgia,  northwest Georgia, the nine counties  that  I  represent,  the  700,000 people,  salt-of-the-earth  folks,  just  as Dr.  FLEMING represents the same kind of  folks in Louisiana. Suffering folks, unemployed folks, struggling folks.  I did a poll question on this tele-town  hall call that probably went out maybe  to 25,000 households. And a lot of them  were on the line and listening and asking questions and staying in the queue  for the whole hour and 30 minutes, I  think we went.  Mr. Speaker, the poll question was, if  your greatest concern about this bill,  the so-called Patient Protection and  Health Accountability Act or whatever  it is called, H.R. 3590, the Senate bill  that is going to be deemed passed if the  Democratic majority has their way,  what’s your greatest concern? If it’s  the economy, the effect that this bill  will have on the economy, push ‘‘1’’ on  your keypad. If your greatest concern  is the effect it will have on your health  or the health of your immediate family, press ‘‘2.’’ If your number one concern about this bill is the devastating  effect that it will have on the Medicare  program and our senior citizens, you,  your parents, your grandparents, press  ‘‘3’’ on the keypad. If your concern is  all of the above, press ‘‘4.’’  Well, I am going to tell you, 65 percent of them, Representative FLEMING,  65  percent  of  them, Mr.  Speaker,  pressed ‘‘4.’’ That is what I would have  pressed, too. It was equal, 10, 12 percent  equally divided among the other three.  People are outraged, Mr. Speaker. It  is just unbelievable to me. Let’s refer  to the first slide, this poster that I  have got to my right, your left. What  Americans Want. I wasn’t surprised at  all by the poll that I took tonight because the American people have been  saying this  for months and months.  The first bullet point on the slide, 73  percent of Americans want Congress to  start over on health care reform, or if  they are unwilling to do that, this is a  situation where it’s better to do nothing. They don’t believe we should do  something even if it’s wrong. No, if it’s  wrong, do nothing. Second bullet point,  56 percent of people want the Congress  to tackle health care reform on a step-  by-step basis, not a wholesale government takeover.  b2030  Mr. Speaker, when Senator LAMAR  ALEXANDERa couple weeks ago at the  Blair House went to the health care  summit, when he could finally get a  word in edgewise after our President  finished  filibustering, said the same  thing. Said, Look, we can solve the  problem. We can actually  lower the  cost of health insurance and, indeed,  the cost of health care if we do it in an  incremental, commonsense way.  And then when COBURNgot to speak,  Senator COBURN, Mr. Speaker, he said,  Mr. President, let me just make it brief  here. I know you’re not going to give  me a lot of time, and you’re controlling  the clock and who gets to speak. And  you took already twice the time that  we did in your opening statement. But  that is okay. You’re the President. But  give me a couple of minutes. I will  make two points. One, let’s eliminate  waste,  fraud,  and  abuse. And Dr.  had  some great  suggestions  about that.

195,Senate,111,-0.3,67,2010-03-18,Mr. CASEY.," It is an article, so you  will not be able to see it, but the headline  is  ‘‘Health Tops Pennsylvania  Business Woes.’’ The  subheadline  is  ‘‘State’s Small Businesses Also See the  Recession as a Severe Obstacle.’’  If you are a small business owner in  Pennsylvania, this survey shows, you  are worried about two things: the recession—no question about that having  an adverse impact; that is why the recovery bill and jobs bill are so important  to  these  small businesses—but  also health care.  I am reading an excerpt here:  About 71 percent of the 250 businesses that  responded to the survey said health care  costs were their biggest challenge.  Health care costs. This is not a group  of Democrats sitting around a room in  Pennsylvania saying: Let’s pass health  care. These are small business owners  in Pennsylvania. They might be Democratic, Republican,  Independent,  or  they may not have any affiliation.  Their life is running a small business  and raising their families, and 71 percent of those surveyed describe health  insurance as their ‘‘biggest challenge.’’  We do not need any longer to debate  whether this is an issue we have to deal  with.  I want to walk through some of the  basic provisions of what we have put in  place  in  the Senate bill, what  the  House has been wrestling with all these  months, and what President Obama has  been trying to do. Just a couple of  quick highlights.  First of all, if we are successful in  this opportunity to pass major health  care  reform,  other  issues we  have  talked about for years but do not get a  lot of attention are going to be finally  the law of the land. Quality and prevention—the information and research  on this is irrefutable. If you insist on  prevention and you make  it  free or  very low cost, that person is going to  be healthier because they are going to  take steps that are preventive in nature. They are going to be healthier,  their family is going to be healthier,  they are going to be better on the job  and the economy will be stronger. But  also we are going to strengthen our  health care system in terms of costs.  We are going to reduce costs in a lot of  ways, but one of them is prevention  and elevating the quality of our care.  Sometimes people get the best care in  the world, but in some places that can  be very limited.  The second point on cost and deficit.  I mentioned that before. The deficit reduction in the Democratic health care  bill  is $130 billion over the  first 10  years. We will see if the Congressional  Budget Office alters that.  But from what we are hearing today,  some of the preliminary reports, that  number might hold up. Some thought  that because of the passage of time  that number might go down $130 billion  to $100 billion. But it is a tremendous  deficit reduction over 10 and over 20  years.  Protections. I talked about that before.  I  just want  to highlight  that  quickly. Basic protections  for American families who have health insurance coverage now, families going to  work, paying their premiums, and not  protected. They think they are protected because they have a policy, an  agreement, and they are paying their  premiums. They are doing their part.  Then some insurance company bureaucrat or some other player in this marketplace comes to them and says: We  know you are paying your premiums;  that you are holding up your end of the  bargain. But we, the insurance company, do not think you or your child  should have coverage. Sorry. You are  out of luck.  Well, we are dealing with that in a  couple of ways. First of all, it is important for people to understand what will  happen now  and what will happen  later.  If we get  this bill passed,  6  months after the President would sign  it into law, it would be illegal for an  insurance company to deny a child coverage because of a preexisting condition. That is a tremendous change in  the  first  year—literally,  after  6  months.  In that same time period and beyond  that, if you are an adult, technically  you would not have the legal protection because you cannot do all of this  at once. So we had to decide, do we do  nothing in the short term or do we at  least protect  children. We are protecting children  in  the  first couple  months of the bill. But even though  technically an adult would not have  legal protection until 2014, they will  have recourse. They will have an option to say: I am an adult. I have been  denied  coverage  because  of  a  preexisting condition. I can go into a high-  risk pool and get coverage.  So there is recourse in the first—actually, that is in the first 3 months for  the adult. So that is a very important  protection. We can  talk more  later  about that.  Finally, and I will begin to close, on  children’s health  insurance—I talked  about that before—it is important to  note what the bill does on a great successful program, the Children’s Health  Insurance Program.  For example,  in our State this  is  what children’s health insurance has  meant. It has meant that we have been  able to reduce our rate of uninsured  children down to 5 percent. It is still  not good enough; we still want to go  lower. But our uninsured rate among  children in Pennsylvania is 5 percent.  With regard to adults between the ages  of 18 and 64, it is 12 percent, so more  than double  for the adult uninsured  prior to getting to the age of Medicare.  That is more than double the children’s  uninsured rate. That is good for children that we have made progress—we  need to make more—but it is bad for  adults who have not had a strategy to  help them.  That is part of why we are trying to  pass the bill. At long last we are going  to be helping many adults, tens of millions. The Children’s Health Insurance  Program is extended under the bill for  2 years, until September 30, 2015.  What the President wants to do as  part  of  the  so-called  reconciliation  process is to maintain—he proposes to  require States to maintain eligibility  for children’s health insurance to 2019,  not just 2015, 2019. He wants to fund it  through 2016. I think that is a very important change that the President has  proposed and that we have a chance to  ratify in our debate.  There  is a  lot more we can talk  about, but I am running low on time.  But I think the basic question for the  American people is, Are we going to  have an up-or-down vote on health  care?  Some over there who have used this  process before for other measures over  many years seem to not want us to  have an up-or-down vote on health  care.  I think the American people want  that, even if they disagree with parts  of the bill. But the real question for  our Republican friends is, Will they be  responsive to Trisha Urban? Are they  just going to say that preexisting conditions are a problem; I know recisions  are a problem, I know limits on coverage are a problem for you and your  family; I know that denying a child  health care coverage because of a preexisting condition is a problem, but we  are not going to do anything about it;  the  insurance  companies were  too  strong; we could not beat them; we are  just going to go the way that so many  have gone in Washington.  I do not think that is going to be a  good enough answer for Trisha Urban  VerDate Nov 24 2008  23:34 Mar 18, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A18MR6.001 S18MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S B 2 K S D n o l n o o c d         ",2010
196,Senate,111,-0.199,74,2010-03-18,Mr. PRYOR.," Madam President,  I  wish about 3 minutes to respond to my  colleagues.  I commend both Senator SESSIONS  and Senator MCCASKILL for the work  on their amendment. As I said, I voted  for previous editions of it. I think it  has one major flaw, and that is it only  deals with discretionary  spending.  I  know  it does affect the deficit, and  that is very important. But it focuses  just on the spending.  When we did multiyear discretionary  spending caps—they were a key part of  the 1990, 1993, 1997 deficit reduction  patches—they worked. However, those  deficit reduction patches looked at all  spending—mandatory  and  discretionary—as well as revenues. That is  what our amendment does. It takes the  whole picture.  If we are going to walk the walk on  having our fiscal house in order, we  need to look at the entire picture, and  I think we need to do it in a bipartisan  way, as they did in previous Congresses  when they made serious efforts to get  the deficit under control. It needs to be  bipartisan. One of the problems I have  is, if we fix discretionary spending, it  will be difficult for us to reach a bipartisan agreement on mandatory as well  as the revenue pieces of our budget.  Senator MCCASKILLmentioned this is  a baby step. I don’t know if it is a baby  step. What they are proposing is a very  solid first step to try to get our fiscal  house in order. I am just concerned it  might close the door.  I wish to make this point in closing.  If we look at these purple lines on this  graph, we  see  these years are  the  Obama years. Certainly, he inherited a  lot of things the first year, so the first  year probably is not fair to give to  him.  If you look to these years, to the  President’s credit, he says he wants to  freeze discretionary spending. He says  he wants the purple lines to get shorter. That is good, but it is not enough.  It is not enough. The President’s budget, in his proposal, in my estimation, is  not enough. We need to get this moving  back in the right direction.  If you  look at  just discretionary  spending and throw in the military discretionary spending as well, that  is  about 25 percent of the budget—just  discretionary alone. Domestic discretionary is only about 12 percent. But  put those two together, and let’s say it  is about 25 percent. The real flaw in the  McCaskill-Sessions is that we are using  25 percent of the budget to fix 100 percent of the budget. We need to put 100  percent of everything on the table so  we can then use our good judgment and  make those hard decisions to try to get  us back to a balanced budget.  We are not going to do this in 1 year.  We are probably not going to do it in 5  years. I wish we could do it in 5 years.  But these numbers are not enough, and  we need to move it back in the right direction. My approach actually helps  this picture quite a bit more than their  pictures help.  With that, Madam President, I yield  the floor.  ",2010

201,Senate,111,-0.318,16,2010-03-26,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, when I  have come to the floor over the last  few months,  I have always tried to  focus on ways  to bring parties  together, both sides to work for common  solutions—whether it’s health care, the  new tax reform bill Senator GREGGand  I have introduced, or the Build America Bonds program put  together by  Senator THUNEand I, which has clearly  been a huge success in terms of revolutionizing the system for funding transportation and infrastructure. Senator  CORNYNand I are working on a significant crime bill. So I am always going  to come to this floor and try to be bipartisan and bring both sides together.  On this question of helping folks who  are so desperately hurting today—including so many in my State, where we  have a very high unemployment rate—  I want to suggest a bipartisan path forward that I hope we can look at in the  days ahead. I see my friend from Georgia here, who also wants to work on  these major economic issues in a bipartisan way.  When you listened to colleagues last  night and this morning, it seems to me  there is agreement on two fundamental  principles. One is that it is absolutely  essential to help folks who are hurting  now. We have millions of Americans  walking on an economic tightrope; balancing their food bill against their fuel  bill; trying to pay for essentials; going  to bed every night, whether in Colorado, Oregon, or Georgia, figuring out  if they are going to be able to pay the  bills when they wake up in the morning. So there  is agreement on both  sides that you have to help folks who  are hurting now. There is also agreement that we have to deal with this  deficit, and the spending issue which is  contributing to the deficit for the long  term. So, in effect, we start the possibility of a bipartisan strategy around  agreement in two key areas: We have  to help folks now who are hurting, and  we have to deal with those major deficits, the revenue and spending problems, in the long term.  What there  is disagreement on,  it  seems to me, is the timing of these particular debates. I and others feel very  strongly that it is just not right to  compound the hurt Americans are suffering, even for a few weeks, even for a  few days. That is why we very much  want, before we go home, to have this  worked out and to get this unemployment benefits extension to them.  We also recognize that getting at this  long-term budget  issue quickly  is a  matter of national urgency. I sit on the  Budget Committee.

They all want a health  care system that tackles costs,  improves quality, and puts their needs  first.  I have heard, as I know the Presiding  Officer has in his home State of Delaware, stories of Coloradans who paid a  lifetime of health care premiums  in  order to provide for their families, all  to have an  insurance company drop  their coverage because a wife or a husband or a child became ill.  Visiting with health care providers, I  heard about the waste and abuse in our  system. They have all pleaded with me  to have commonsense reforms that get  them  back  to  the  business  they  thought they were entering years ago—  the business of caring for their fellow  Americans beset by illness and disease.  I heard from small business owners  who continue to see double-digit  increases  in  insurance costs,  in many  cases for the ninth or the tenth or even  more years in a row. These small business owners want to see relief, not for  themselves but because they do not  want to have to choose between laying  off workers and leaving their workers  vulnerable to medical bankruptcies.  Decade after decade, we see how the  fine print of insurance company policies puts shareholder interests above  those of American  families and how  partisanship has prevented the kind of  progress  everyone  agrees  is  sorely  needed.  I have good news. Despite all the  ugly  rhetoric, distortions, and misrepresentations we have heard, Coloradans and the rest of the country can  finally rest assured that someone has  put their interests first.  This week, I watched as President  Obama signed into law the kind of reforms that will free Americans from  the shackles of never-ending cost increases, dropped coverage, and unfair  practices that put profits above the  provision of care.  Throughout this past fall and winter,  I joined you, Mr. President, and the  rest of our freshman class in the Chamber repeatedly to talk about the urgent  need for health care reform. We shot  down  false  claims,  challenged  the  phony reasoning that was out there,  and pointed out where  the  rhetoric  ends and reality begins.  Over the past few days, many more of  our colleagues from this side of the  aisle have compellingly and eloquently  explained  how  important  the  new  health reform law is to both the American people and the American economy. The fact is that this historic bill  signed by the President saves  lives,  saves money, and it saves Medicare.  Bringing this long debate to a close,  I wish to speak directly to the people  of Colorado. It is important that they  know how these health insurance reforms will benefit their families and  the rest of our great State.  As a result of the President signing  the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act into law, the parents of Colorado’s 1.2 million children can sleep  easy starting this year knowing that  insurance companies no  longer have  the right to deny their kids health care  coverage because of a preexisting condition.  Also starting in 2010, almost half a  million, 500,000 young adults in Colorado who would otherwise be kicked off  their parents’ health care policies can  maintain  that  coverage  through  to  their 27th birthday. This  is particularly welcome to me, as I know it is for  many Coloradans, because I have two  college-age kids who fit into the category I just described.  We have 575,000 seniors in our Medicare Program, and for every single one  of them, this new law will protect—I  want to emphasize that—will protect  their guaranteed benefits and  immediately allow them to get preventive  care with absolutely no copay or out-  of-pocket  costs. This added benefit,  contrary to what we have heard, will  increase  their health  care  coverage  under the Medicare Program so that  our seniors can continue to live happy  and healthy lives.  This new law goes to great lengths to  help slow the growth of health care  costs and, by doing so, it is projected  that these lower costs will allow Colorado’s employers to hire up to 6,500 new  employees  in our State. And  for as  many as 68,000 small businesses, health  reform will begin providing millions of  dollars in tax credits so they can afford  to offer health insurance to their employees.  Yesterday, we sat here and cast 56  votes as Democrats to make final improvements to the Patient Protection  and Affordable Care Act. That  reconciliation measure we passed yesterday will provide prescription drug relief as well for our Colorado seniors.  More  than  100,000 Colorado  seniors,  such as my friend Frank Blakely in  Colorado Springs, will pay less for prescription drugs.  Right now, these seniors hit what we  all know here as the Medicare part D  doughnut hole, which means they have  to pay thousands of dollars directly out  of pocket for their medicines. But beginning this year, every one of these  seniors will receive a $250 check to help  them offset those costs, and we will  begin to close the overall gap in Medicare coverage so that we completely  fill this doughnut hole by the year 2020.  I know this will be welcome relief to  those on fixed incomes all across the  United States, because it will free up  scarce retirement dollars to visit family members, help pay a grandchild’s  college tuition or even to help, in some  cases, put food on the table.  I think one of the overriding features  of health reform is the freedom it will  give to Coloradans and hard-working  Americans—the  freedom  to  change  jobs, to launch a business, to even start  a  family while knowing that health  care coverage will be there for them  when they need it. Americans need to  know their country won’t leave them  to fend for themselves when an insurance company denies or drops their  coverage. They deserve peace of mind  to know that someone is on their side.  Over the last few days we have heard  a lot of the same misleading rhetoric  that we did back in August by those  who were dead set on levying accusations rather than working on real reform. Well, health reform has become  the law of the land and the American  people don’t have to wait any longer  for these important reforms. The legislation we passed will establish a sturdy  foundation upon which we will build,  improve,  and  strengthen  access  to  health care in America. Will there be  mistakes made along the way? I don’t  doubt it.

203,Senate,111,0.068,18,2010-04-12,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I have  sought recognition to comment briefly  about the prospective vacancy in the  Supreme Court of the United States  with the resignation of Justice Stevens. I do so to urge the President to  select a nominee without regard to any  threats of a filibuster. I urge the President to make his selection of whomever he believes to be the best qualified  to handle the responsibilities with a  view to academic excellence, professional  experience,  and  intellect  to  carry on the battle, where we have seen  the Supreme Court veer very sharply  to the right.  Let’s be candid about the Supreme  Court  being  an  ideological  battleground today. That happens to be the  fact. When some decry judicial activism, what could be more judicial activism than reversing the 100-year precedent that corporations may not engage  in political advertising, as  the Supreme Court did in Citizens United, in  a  contortion  of  procedural  maneuverings to take a case with an  isolated issue with a predetermined obvious purpose of changing the law on  that very vital subject for the operation of our democracy?  We had Chief Justice Roberts, in the  confirmation proceedings, under oath,  swear he would not, quote, ‘‘jolt the  system.’’ Well, there have been quite a  number of jolts in the system with his  key vote. We had a very extensive  questioning  and  commentary  about  Chief Justice Roberts’  deference  to  congressional  fact-finding. Only Congress has hearings, hears witnesses,  and makes determinations of fact-finding. When the voting rights came up,  all of that seemed to have been forgotten.  We have a situation where it is obvious the Supreme Court makes the cutting-edge decisions on the law of the  land. The Supreme Court, it turns out,  decides who will be President in Bush  v. Gore—a decision strictly along political partisan lines.  The Supreme Court of the United  States decides what will be the  law  with respect to campaign finance reform, as we seek to make a determination as to how we can limit the expenditures in political campaigns—the very  core of the democratic process.  In Buckley v. Valeo, in 1976, the Supreme Court said that, under the First  Amendment, speech equals money. It  seemed to me at the time that was a  farfetched decision. Now, with Citizens  United, we find that corporations are  somehow persons, somehow entitled to  first amendment rights and can advertise in political campaigns.  The Supreme Court decides who will  live and who will die, decides what is  the extent of the death penalty. The  Supreme Court decides the extent of a  woman’s  right  to  choose—Casey  v.  Planned  Parenthood.  The  Supreme  Court decides about the power of the  State to take private property in eminent domain. And so the cases go on  and on and on.  I have sought, for more than a decade  now, to have the Supreme Court televised, and twice during my tenure as  chairman or ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee  the committee  reported out  favorably  legislation to  require the Supreme Court to be televised, unless there was some extraordinary circumstance  invoked by the  Court. More recently, in this Congress,  I have modified that effort with legislation which recommends that the Supreme Court televise its proceedings.  When Bush v. Gore came up, then-  Senator BIDEN and I wrote to Chief  Justice Rehnquist  urging  that  the  Court allow that monumental case to  be televised so the public could see it,  considering the very limited number of  people who could gain access.  When I went over to the Court that  day—being one of the few who could  gain access to the Court—the block  was surrounded with television cameras because of so much public interest. But the cameras could not go inside. That day the Supreme Court, with  the Chief Justice’s order, did change  practice and allowed an audio transcript  to  be  released  immediately  thereafter.  I believe Congress has the authority,  should it choose to do so, to direct the  Supreme Court  to  permit  its  proceedings to be televised. The Supreme  Court, in a series of cases, has said the  public has a right to know what  is  going on  inside the courtroom, and  that was the case which involved Richmond Newspapers. Well,  in an electronic era, where the public gets so  much of its information via television  or via radio, there ought to be that access.  But the Congress has the authority  to determine when the Court starts to  function each year: the first Monday in  October. Congress sets a quorum for  the Court: six. Congress can set the  number of Justices on the Court, as  evidenced by the effort by President  Franklin Roosevelt in the mid to late  1930s to increase the number of the Supreme Court to some 15.  Obviously, we cannot tell the Supreme Court what to decide, how to decide, but we can tell them about administrative matters. And  the Congress has the authority to tell the  Court which cases to take. So there is  a broad range of matters where the  Congress cannot act.  I modified the effort I had to have  the Supreme Court televised—instead  of  ‘‘requiring  it’’ to  ‘‘recommending  it’’—because in the final analysis the  Court can make a determination on  separation of powers if Congress imposes a requirement that can be overruled by the Court.  But if the public had access to what  was going on in the Supreme Court, it  seems to me there would be a clamor to  have more  openness, more  transparency, and greater public appreciation of the fact that the Supreme Court  is a battleground.  When  considerations  are  made  about—as the Sunday talk shows have  filled the airwaves  just yesterday—a  number of Senators from the other side  of the aisle left the filibuster on the  table, would not rule it out, the question of what is judge-made law. Well,  that is very much in the eye of the beholder as to what is judge-made law.  But I would urge the President not to  pay any heed to that. When we start to  engage in the subtleties of a nominee  who will be among the five instead of  the four, I suggest that is a stretch beyond making any determination. That  is, I believe—well, it was candidly said  trying to persuade Justice Kennedy to  be among five, as it is speculated with  some pretty solid foundation that Justice Stevens succeeded in persuading  Justice Kennedy to side on the issue of  habeas corpus.  We had Rasul v. Bush, where Justice  Stevens—in a very  learned opinion,  tracing the authority of detention from  the Magna Carta down through habeas  corpus—made a determination that habeas corpus was a constitutional right.  The case then came to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and  in a contorted opinion—at least contorted  in my  judgment—the Circuit  Court for the District of Columbia said  it was on statutory grounds and not  constitutional  grounds. But  reading  Rasul v. Bush, starting with the Magna  Carta and tracing the constitutional  evolution, it certainly, as a fair reading would say, was on constitutional  grounds.  Then Boumediene v. Bush came up,  and on the petition for cert, only three  Justices voted to hear the case, and  Justice Stevens was not among them.  Had Justice Stevens voted to hear the  case, there would have been four Justices to take up the case and it would  have been docketed and it would have  been heard. But Justice Stevens voted  not to hear the case. It was speculated  at that time widely that Justice Stevens felt if the Court took the case habeas corpus would be rejected.  We had the long fight on the floor of  this body, and I offered an amendment  to restore habeas corpus, which was defeated 51 to 48 on the military commissions act. I predicted at that time the  Supreme Court would eventually overrule the congressional determination  and reinstate habeas corpus as a constitutional right.  Then there came to light information  in  the military  commissions  about  some very questionable practices, and  there was a subsequent petition for reconsideration for a grant of cert. On a  petition for reconsideration on a grant  of cert, it takes five votes. Four votes  are insufficient. You have to have five  votes to have cert granted and cert was  granted. Justice Stevens and Justice  Kennedy joined the other three Justices in the petition for reconsideration  to grant cert.  In Boumediene v. Bush, the Supreme  Court said that habeas corpus, in fact,  was a right. Well, those are speculative  and those are subtleties. But my own  thinking on the subject is the President ought to appoint somebody who  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:38 Jul 08, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S12AP0.REC S12AP0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010
204,Senate,111,-0.473,25,2010-04-12,Mr. MERKLEY.," Madam President,  today I recognize the 50th anniversary  of Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i and its annual lu’au. The Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i  is a culture club at Pacific University  in Forest Grove, OR. For half a century, Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i has been  spreading the culture and traditions of  Hawaii to Pacific University, enriching  the  school and  surrounding communities.  Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i was founded  in 1959 by 16 students from the islands  of Hawaii. Since then, it has expanded  its membership to more than 200 students and includes Native Hawaiians as  well as those  interested  in  learning  more about Hawaiian culture. One of  the ways that Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i  shares the Hawaiian culture with the  local community is through its annual  lu’au. It is the only completely student-run and student-directed lu’au in  the Northwest. Each year, about 2,000  people attend the lu’au and celebrate  the Island heritage, which includes an  authentic lu’au meal and traditional  Polynesian dance, music and entertainment.  Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i has made a  tremendous impact on Pacific University, Oregon, and our Nation. By bringing to the mainland a taste of Hawaii’s  cultural  tapestry,  Oregonians  and  Americans have been able to enjoy the  State’s rich Aloha spirit. I know that  all Oregonians will  join me  in congratulating Na¯Hauma¯na O Hawai’i on  the occasion of  its 50th anniversary  and annual lu’au.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  and withdrawals which were referred to  the appropriate committees.

205,Senate,111,0.304,32,2010-04-12,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, I rise to  honor  the  lives  of President Lech  Kaczynski, his wife, and 94 others who  perished in a plane crash on April 10,  2010. President Kaczynski was a steadfast supporter of advancing  freedom  and prosperity in Poland and throughout Central and Eastern Europe and  was a close friend of the United States.  It is with tragic irony that this devastation has occurred at a time of solemn  remembrance of the massacre of Polish  officers and civilians in the Katyn Forest and elsewhere 70 years ago. Together with  the Polish nation  and  friends of Poland worldwide, I mourn  this  unbelievably  tragic  loss. With  these sentiments in mind, I am introducing  this  resolution honoring  the  lives  of President  of Poland Lech  Kaczynski, his wife, and 94 others who  perished on April 10, 2010 in a plane  crash while en route to memorialize  those Polish officers, officials, and civilians who were massacred by the Soviet Union 70 years ago.  f  SENATE  RESOLUTION  477—HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS  CE´SAR  AND  LEGACY  OF  ESTRADA CHA´VEZ  Mr. MENENDEZ  (for himself, Mr.  REID, Ms. STABENOW, Mr. DURBIN, Mrs.  BOXER, Mr. UDALL of Colorado, Mr.  SCHUMER, Mrs. GILLIBRAND, Mr. BINGAMAN, Mr. BROWNof Ohio, Mr. UDALLof  New Mexico, and Mr. WYDEN)  submitted the following resolution; which  was referred to the Committee on the  Judiciary:  S.

206,House,111,-0.187,4,2010-04-20,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the life and the career of Roy  Isom, a broadcasting legend in the San  Joaquin Valley from California. Known  as the Voice of Agriculture for over 40  years, Roy was a force in the broadcasting industry, relentless in reporting on issues that mattered the most  to our communities.  Roy began his career at KFSN channel 30 and KYNO radio before moving  to KMJ radio, where he spent the last  28 years. He was known as a workhorse,  and his colleagues fondly remembered  how he would begin his days at 1 a.m.,  getting  ready  for  the  farm  report.  Roy’s hard work translated into stories  and reports that were critical to making sense of what was going on in our  valley and the Nation.  Whether  it was reporting the  first  lunar landing or breaking down the agriculture news of  the  region, Roy’s  style and ethics serve as a role model  to our younger generation of reporters  and  broadcasters  because  he  was.  Today, Roy is remembered by his family and friends and colleagues. Everyone who new Roy,  including myself,  had a tremendous respect with him. I  join with all the people of our valley in  celebrating Roy’s  life and contributions to broadcasting.

208,House,111,-0.281,18,2010-04-20,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor the life and the legacy of Rev.  Benjamin Lawson Hooks, who passed away  April 15, 2010, at the age of 85. Rev. Hooks  was more than just an accomplished man; he  was a modern-day pioneer who overcame  modern-day struggles. No matter the obstacle,  Rev. Hooks continued to fight for equal rights,  always believing that tomorrow will be better.  In  fact, Rev. Hooks was often quoted as  saying,  ‘‘you have  to believe  that  tomorrow  somehow can be, and will be, better  than  today.’’ His mission in life was to make this  belief a reality. As the first African-American  commissioner of the Federal Communications  Commission, a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Tennessee’s first  African-American criminal court judge, and, finally, as the Executive Director of the National  Association  for  the Advancement of Colored  People  (NAACP)  from 1977  to 1992, Rev.  Hooks worked  tirelessly  to make America a  fairer, and more just, nation.  Under his  leadership of  the NAACP, he  brought  this storied civil  rights organization  from  the brink of  financial  collapse. Rev.  Hooks returned it to stability, increased membership, and created programs such as  the  NAACP ACT-SO (Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics) competitions,  a major youth  talent and skill  initiative, and  Women in the NAACP.  Rev. Hooks also was a stalwart in the face  of adversity. In 1989, there were several gasoline bomb attacks in the South, resulting in the  murder of a federal judge in Alabama and an  African-American civil rights lawyer in Georgia.  NAACP leaders were threatened with violence  as well. Rev. Hooks responded to these acts  of violence by saying,  ‘‘We believe  that  this  latest incident is an effort to intimidate our association, to strike fear in our hearts. It will not  succeed.’’  This  remarkable American  lived a  life of  honor and purpose, leaving behind a legacy of  equality and  justice. Our nation  is so much  better for his dedication to the idea that ‘‘all  men are created equal.’’ Rev. Hooks is an inspirational figure to us all, and we must continue  to strive  to ensure  that  tomorrow will  continue to be better than today.  ",2010
209,House,111,0.402,25,2010-04-20,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor Mitch McCorkle, who  has devoted his life to protecting the  citizens of West Fork, Arkansas and is  now retiring after 50 years of serving as  the only fire chief in West Fork.  During his time as fire chief, Mitch  has demonstrated his ability to innovate time and time again by building  fire trucks that are uniquely suited to  the landscape of northwest Arkansas.  The longest serving fire chief in all of  Arkansas, Mitch was a visionary  in  terms of what can be done with a volunteer department. Mitch’s pride  in  doing his job and serving his community is an example to be followed and  has made West Fork a better place.  West Fork will undoubtedly be losing  an  amazing  fire  chief.  I  commend  Mitch for his service as the fire chief of  West Fork, his passion for protecting  our citizens, and his continued commitment to our safety. I wish him continued success  in his endeavors and  today I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Mitch McCorkle, a fire chief  whose continued devotion to the Third  District of Arkansas has not gone unnoticed and will never be forgotten.  f  REGARDING THE HEALTH CARE  REFORM BILL  (Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and  to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, I asked if I could  borrow this display here which really  should have minuses  in  front of all  these  numbers  because  essentially  these companies had to file in their financial reports the  losses that they  will incur immediately as a result of  the passage and signing into law of the  health care reform bill.  Now  that’s bad enough, but even  worse was the initial response by this  House to them following the law. And  it was to receive a letter commanding  their CEOs come before a committee of  this House, a  subcommittee of  this  House, with all of their internal documents as to how they could come up  with this position.  Now think about it. This is one of the  concerns many of us expressed about  having the government take over medical care in this country to the extent  this bill allows it: if you criticize the  government, you will be called to heel  before a committee of the House.  Now it is true that that call has been  removed, but they have received a letter which told them the Congress will  continue watching. This is not democracy. This is not independence. This is  what we fought against.  f  SPECIAL ORDERS  ",2010
210,House,111,-0.297,32,2010-04-20,Mr. ANDREWS.," I thank my colleague  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker,  I know that tonight  many Americans are going to put their  head on the pillow and have a very  restless  and maybe  sleepless  night  again because tomorrow’s going to be  another day of trudging around with a  resume that no one seems to want.  Maybe they’re concerned that tomorrow will be the day that the final foreclosure notice arrives in the mail. Tomorrow may be the day that they have  to pull the plug on their small business  that they struggled so hard to sustain.  This problem began to metastasize,  this cancer began to grow in this country in the summer of 2007 when the  days of irresponsibly cheap credit and  easy credit came to an end and the  bubble began to burst. In the part of  the country that I represent, between  Labor Day of 2007 and Labor Day of  2009, we  lost about 36,000  jobs,  just  evaporated, the way eight million jobs  evaporated around this country.  b2015  Now, the President took office  in  January of 2009, inherited what I believe was the worst economic crisis  since the Great Depression, and we decided to act to try to take advantage of  it, put some people back to work building highways and roads and bridges,  cut taxes for small businesses to buy a  laptop or a truck or a piece of equipment. We had a substantial tax cut for  just about every family in the country;  98.5 percent of American families had a  credit so people could buy a home and  get a substantial down payment to buy  a home. And these steps, although I believe they were in the right direction,  opposed unanimously by the other side  of the aisle, have taken us in the better  direction; but they are not enough.  In my area of those 36,000 jobs we  have lost between Labor Day of 2007  and Labor Day of 2009, we have gotten  about 16,000 of those jobs back since  Labor Day of 2009. So between September of 2007 and September of 2009  we lost 36,000 jobs. From Labor Day of  2009 to the present we have gained  about 16,000 of them back.  I worry, Mr. Speaker, tonight, and I  say to my colleague as well, that one of  the reasons we haven’t gotten enough  of those jobs back soon enough is the  credit crunch in this economy. I hear  from entrepreneurs  large and small,  people running stores and factories and  software companies, that they are profitable, they have collateral, they have  a track record of paying their bills on  time, but they cannot get credit. They  cannot get the loans that they need to  make their businesses grow.  This lack of credit is rooted in a lack  of trust, and this lack of trust is rooted  in a lack of confidence, and this lack of  confidence, without a doubt, is rooted  in the failure of the regulatory system  to properly regulate the financial system and assure the investor and the  American people they are getting a fair  deal.  Now, this House late last year passed  legislation that would fix that problem, that would have some even-handed regulators look at whether the system was once again teetering on the  brink of collapse, that would say that  if you lend money, you have to have  some skin in the game. You can’t have  one industry that makes a profit by  originating  loans but doesn’t collect  any of  them, and another  industry  that’s solely responsible for collecting  the loans but doesn’t originate them.  The legislation also said that if these  steps to prevent another catastrophe  failed, the next time there has to be a  bailout of the failure; it won’t be paid  by real estate agents and teachers and  truck drivers. It will be paid by the  people who created the mess  in the  first place.  Now, a version of this legislation is  being considered by the other body,  and I know that the rules do not permit us to comment on the affairs of the  other body, so I will not. I will simply  offer this generic observation. When  the health care bill was in its final  stages of debate, our friends on the Republican side of the aisle loudly insisted, I think correctly insisted, that  there be an up-down vote on all aspects  of the health care bill, and there was.  It was an up-down vote on the underlying text of the Senate bill, and there  was an up-down vote on the fixed bill  that occurred. That’s the right way to  do things.  When there is a major question before the country, that will be an up-  down vote. I would hope that the other  body adheres to that principle. With an  issue this significant, with the stakes  being so high, I think the American  people not only have a right to demand  that the problem be fixed. I think they  have a right to demand they know that  their Representatives go on record and  say yes or no. Mr. GARAMENDI, we say  ‘‘yes’’ to responsible regulation, we say  ‘‘yes’’ to getting credit flowing again  in this economy and we would say ‘‘no’’  to those who would block a vote to  block the will of the American people.

211,Senate,111,-0.468,67,2010-04-20,Mr. BURRIS.," Mr. President, when I  came to Washington over a year ago,  this country faced an economic crisis  greater than anything we have seen in  generations. So my colleagues and I set  out to work. Under President Obama’s  strong  leadership, we passed a  landmark stimulus package that stopped  the bleeding. We did what was necessary to prevent a complete economic  collapse and set America back on the  road to recovery.  Since that time, we have come a long  way. Many key economic  indicators  have started to turn around, but we are  not out of the woods yet. The economy  has started to grow again, but unemployment is still too high, and rampant  foreclosures continue to threaten families in my home State and across the  country. During the first 3 months of  this year, almost 15,000 homeowners  went into foreclosure in Illinois alone.  Despite  our  best  efforts  to modify  mortgages to make them more affordable, that is twice as many foreclosures  as we saw during the same period last  year. This  is unacceptable. We are  making progress, but it simply isn’t  enough.  Today, America no longer stands at  the brink of disaster, but we are still  vulnerable  to  the  same  recklessness  that led to this crisis in the first place.  For years, at big corporations such as  Goldman Sachs, Wall Street bankers  packaged bad mortgages together and  sold  them  to  investors. They knew  these investment vehicles would inevitably fail, so they turned around and  bet against them. They bet against the  American people. They sought to make  a profit off of the misfortunes of their  own customers. They allegedly committed fraud, and that is why they are  currently being sued by the Securities  and Exchange Commission on behalf of  the American  people. As  a  former  banker, I understand the seriousness of  this misconduct. I know it continues to  pose a dramatic threat to the American financial system.  That is why we need to pass strong financial reform to prevent bad behavior  on Wall Street from sinking ordinary  folks on Main Street. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the reform legislation introduced by Senator  DODD. This bill would prevent Goldman  Sachs and other companies from getting us into a mess in the first place,  and it can help ensure that we will  never end up in this position again.  This legislation creates a consumer  protection bureau designed to shield  ordinary Americans from unfair, deceptive, and abusive financial practices. It  would establish an oversight council  tasked with keeping a close eye on  emerging risks so that we are never  taken by surprise again. It would end  so-called too big to fail, protect taxpayers  from unnecessary  risks, and  eliminate the need for future bailouts.  This bill would also increase transparency and accountability for banks,  hedge funds, and the derivative market, so a big company such as Goldman  Sachs would not be able to get away  with their alleged fraud anymore.  These basic  reforms will establish  clear rules of the road for the financial  services industry so we can keep the  market free and fair without risking  another economic collapse. But if we  fail to take action, if we do not pass  this reform bill, then we will be right  back where we started, with no safeguards against this kind of deception  and abuse in the future. I call upon my  colleagues to  join me  in supporting  Senator DODD’s bill when it comes to  the floor this week. I ask my friends on  both sides of the aisle to stand with me  on the side of the American people. Let  us pass  financial reform  legislation,  and let’s do it without delay.  I yield the floor.  f  RECESS  ",2010

213,Senate,111,0.495,81,2010-04-20,Mr. VITTER.," Madam President, I do  object. General Walsh  today, before  any promotion, is one of nine leading  officers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He is part of that leadership. I  am happy my two colleagues are satisfied with his leadership and the corps’  leadership and how  that agency  is  being run. I can tell them, as a Senator  from Louisiana, I am absolutely not  satisfied with their leadership and how  that agency is being run at all.  Since Hurricane Katrina, there were  14 major report deadlines put on the  Corps of Engineers,  required of  the  corps. The corps missed all 14 of those  major deadlines. Today, as we speak,  the corps is still actively missing and  has failed to respond to 13 of the 14,  having accomplished 1 many months  late.  I have brought nine significant issues  before the Corps of Engineers in conversations  with  them,  not minor  projects, major issues with regard to  hurricane recovery and hurricane and  flood protection. I have outlined the  authority they have to do constructive  things under each of those categories.  They have not responded in a positive  or timely way on eight of those nine  issues.  One of those issues is a particularly  good example. That is the Morganza to  the gulf hurricane protection project.  That  is a vital hurricane protection  project that would protect significant  portions of south Louisiana that was  originally proposed in 1992. The Senators want to  talk about authority  from Congress. That project has been  authorized by Congress three different  times  in  three  different water  resources bills. Yet the corps continues  to drag its feet and is still not moving  forward toward full implementation of  that project, after three specific authorizations  by  Congress,  18  years  later.  I am sorry the corps leadership is  frustrated with an 18-day delay or an  18-week delay. But I suggest they try 18  years on for size. That is how long the  people of Lafourche and Terrebonne  Parishes, many folks throughout Louisiana, have been waiting on the Corps  of Engineers.  I yield the floor.  ",2010

Williams, Jr.  I would also like to congratulate John on his  upcoming retirement.  John  is  the president of  the Salt River  Project (SRP), the nation’s third-largest public  power utility and the largest supplier of water  to the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. John  serves as president of both the Salt River Valley Water Users’ Association,  the water distribution side of  the company, and  the Salt  River Project Agricultural  Improvement and  Power District,  the electricity-generating side  of  the company. He began serving on  the  SRP council in 1964 and has served 28 years  with SRP,  including 12 years as vice president. He was elected SRP’s 16th president in  2007.  During his tenure as president, John signed  the largest-ever Indian water rights settlement;  helped SRP expand  its  sustainable-energy  portfolio to approximately seven percent of the  total energy generated, including partnering on  the state’s  first commercial wind  farm; and  presided over a  far-reaching settlement  that  will help ensure the future sustainability of Arizona’s Verde River.  John  is a member of  the Groundwater  Users’ Advisory Council, the American Public  Power Association,  the National Water Resources Association, the Colorado River Water  Users’ Association and the Cowman’s Club. In  addition, President George W. Bush appointed  Infrastructure Advisory  him  to  the National  Council in 2008.  An Arizona native, John is active in numerous community-based efforts,  including serving on the board of the Farmers Gin and as  a committee member of the Maricopa County  Farm Services Administration. He has been involved in many other community activities in  the Laveen area. John, who owns John M.  Williams Farms in Laveen, lives in the West  Valley with his wife, Dawnetta.  I have been  fortunate  to have John as a  friend for many years. I first became familiar  with John’s trademark black cowboy hat when  he came to visit my office in Washington, DC.  Since  that  time,  I have seen him wear  that  same black cowboy hat twice a year at Corona Ranch, where we have enjoyed  the  music and good company together.  Madam speaker, I am honored to recognize  the leadership of John Williams and the friendship he has given me and my family.  f  HONORING  THE  40TH  ANNIVERSARY OF PINE FORGE ATHLETIC  ASSOCIATION  HON.

216,,111,0.221,109,2010-04-20,Mr. GERLACH.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor the Pine Forge Athletic Association as it celebrates 40 years of providing  and promoting baseball and softball  for  the  youth  in  the Boyertown Area School District  and neighboring communities.  The Association formed as a result of the vision and leadership of Merle Harner and Robert ‘‘Skip’’ Trainer, who wanted to create more  opportunities for participating in youth sports.  The Association has thrived since its first team  began practicing and playing on a single,  small field at Pine Forge Elementary School  four decades ago. Today, more than 400 boys  and girls play on more  than 30  teams  that  have access to as many as 15 fields faithfully  maintained by the Association.  While many  things have  changed  since  1970,  the Association remains committed  to  the core principles of teaching the fundamentals of the game, promoting good sportsmanship and helping youth learn the importance of  team work, perseverance and hard work. The  Association’s tremendous success was made  possible thanks to dedicated volunteers who  generously give countless hours each year to  serve as coaches, umpires,  league officials  and in various other roles.  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues  join me today in congratulating the Pine Forge  Athletic Association as it commemorates this  very special milestone and offering best wishes for continued success in enriching the lives  of our youth and strengthening the bonds within our community.  f  TRIBUTE TO BILL AND MAURA  SCULLY  HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR.  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 20, 2010  ",2010
217,,111,-0.366,109,2010-04-20,Mr. PASCRELL.," Madam Speaker,  I would  like to call to your attention the work of two  outstanding individuals, Bill and Maura Scully,  who are being honored by the Frank McGovern Association on Sunday, April 18, 2010, for  their lifetime of friendship and service.  It is only fitting that they be honored in this,  the permanent record of the greatest democracy ever known,  for  they have brought  joy  and comfort to many others through their dedication to community service and the preservation of Irish-American culture.  Bill  was  born  August  14,  1937,  in  Glenamaddy, Co. Galway. His family moved to  Middleton, Co. Cork, in 1950 when he was 13  years old. He is a product of the C.B.S. where  he learned his skills of Human Interaction. Bill  came to America on February 14, 1958, and  started work as a waiter in McGovern’s. Bill  has one brother, Edward and one  sister,  Breda.  Maura  McGovern  was  born  in  Kinawley, Co. Fermanagh. Her family moved  to Swanlinbar, Co. Cavan, where she attended  the National School. She came to America in  April 1955. Maura is the oldest of seven children. She has  two brothers, Eamon and  Freddie, and four sisters, Geraldine, Theresa,  Patricia and Carmel. Bill and Maura are the  proud aunt and uncle of many nieces and  nephews.  Bill worked for Prudential in Newark before  marrying Maura on May 6, 1961. The U.S.  Army called him into service in August of that  year and he headed to Hawaii, where he was  stationed  for  the next 18 months. When he  was discharged he went  to work  for Crown  Furs.  Upon his  retirement, Frank McGovern offered Bill and Maura the tavern and on July  10, 1968, they became the proud owners of  the most popular  Irish Tavern on  the East  Coast of the U.S. In April 2001 they turned the  reins over to Patrick and Sean McGovern and  young Mike Nagle. The boys have made the  Scullys  proud  by  ‘‘Keeping  the  Tradition  Alive.’’  The Scullys have long worked to help keep  their community strong and to keep alive Irish-  American culture. Bill has been honored by  many organizations such as the Independent  Irish, the Peter Smith School of Irish Dancing,  The Giblin Association, The Cryan Association, The Shillelagh Club, The Irish American  Association of the Oranges, Project Children,  the Emerald Society,  the F.O.P. Local #12,  and  the Sheriff’s Department P.B.A. Maura  was honored as the Deputy Grand Marshal of  the Newark Saint Patrick’s Day Parade  in  1971.  Throughout their lives, Bill and Maura have  not only given much of their own time and energy to community efforts, but have also inspired others  through  the example  they set.  Bill and Maura are  the Standard Bearers of  the Frank McGovern Association and members of many civic, social and charitable organizations. They welcome this tribute and thank  everyone for all the love and support over the  last 50 years. It’s their sincere wish for Peace  with Justice for all the people of Ireland, both  North and South.  The job of a United States Congressman involves much  that  is  rewarding, yet nothing  compares  to  learning about and recognizing  individuals like Bill and Maura Scully.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues,  the Scullys’  family and  friends,  the  members of the Frank McGovern Association,  everyone who has enjoyed a visit to McGovern’s, and me in recognizing the contributions  of Bill and Maura Scully.

218,,111,-0.41,116,2010-04-20,Mr. CROWLEY.," Madam Speaker, I rise in  honor of the life, and great works of Dr. Dorothy Height.  Widely recognized as one of the founding  members of  the Civil Rights movement, Dr.  Height served as the president of the National  Council of Negro Women  for  four decades,  stepping down from the position in 1997. In  her position with the Council, which connected  nearly 4 million women worldwide, she tackled  issues  that affected women,  including child  care for working mothers, health and nutrition,  education and adequate housing for families in  need.  While I did not personally know Dr. Height,  I have seen her good works embodied though  the National Council of Negro Women Section  in Co-op City, in the Bronx, New York.  Less than two weeks ago, I was visiting the  National Council of Negro Women Co-op City  Section  to honor  their work  in  the weekend  mentoring of students between 2nd and 6th  grades in the community.  Since 1972, the National Council of Negro  Women Co-op City Section has provided after-  school  educational  support  for  elementary  school students. They have licensed teachers  who work  in small groups with children on  strengthening  their  language and computational skills.  They meet on Saturday mornings, and the  passion showed by the educators, administrators, students and parents is electric.  I have worked with several of the leaders of  the Co-op City Section, including past presidents Maxine Sullivan and Joyce Howard, as  well as the current President of the Co-op City  Section of NCNW, Judith Roberson. These  women  embody  the work  of Dr. Dorothy  Height every day in my community.  Dr. Dorothy Height’s vision and her legacy  are hard at work in Co-op City, New York—  just as it is in the communities of many of my  colleagues.  While her family and friends—as well as our  country—mourn her passing  today, we also  honor her for the contributions she made to  our great nation.  Her legacy will live on for decades to come,  and I hope her family and friends realize that  her  life’s work will continue  to benefit many  more generations to come.  f  HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY  OF BILL STANLEY  HON. JOE COURTNEY  OFCONNECTICUT  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 20, 2010  ",2010
219,,111,-0.345,116,2010-04-20,Mr. COURTNEY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  with a heavy heart today to honor the life and  legacy of Bill Stanley, an icon in eastern Connecticut, who passed away Sunday, April 18,  2010, at the age of 80.  Stanley was a graduate of Norwich Free  Academy and attended the New York School  of Modern Photography before  joining  the  United States Marine Corps. He returned to civilian life and joined with his brother Jim to co-  host the WICH morning radio program. Later  he became a stockbroker and published author.  The impact that Bill Stanley had on Norwich,  Connecticut and  its residents was profound.  He delighted readers with his newspaper columns titled, ‘‘Once Upon A Time’’ which related countless stories of local lore and history  to generations of readers in our area. No one  individual had a better grasp on  the  issues  and shared history  that defined our  region  than Bill Stanley. He was also one of the most  dedicated public  servants of his  time. He  served  two  terms  in  the Connecticut State  Senate and ran, albeit unsuccessfully, for the  Congressional  seat  I am honored  to hold  today. While his career as an elected politician  may have ended early on, his service to his  fellow man continued until the day he died. Bill  was active  in a number of causes,  raising  money and supporting William Backus Hospital, Norwich Free Academy, St. Jude’s Common,  the Norwich Diocese and his beloved  Norwich Historical Society which he founded.  As everyone in Norwich knows, there wasn’t a  single major event in recent memory in which  Bill was not involved.  Along with his love of Norwich, it was his  love of history  that perhaps motivated Bill  most of all. He would regale countless school-  children and adults alike with tales of Benedict  Arnold and Samuel Huntington. Stanley even  gained national attention with his efforts  to  preserve the legacy of Huntington, who served  as President of  the Continental Congress.  While Stanley may have been ultimately unsuccessful in the effort to establish Huntington  as our Nation’s first President, he was able to  raise more than a $100,000 and public awareness about the importance of Huntington’s role  in American history.  Bill Stanley was an institution in the State of  Connecticut and his memory will live on in the  hearts and minds of the people he touched.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to his beloved wife Margaret,  his  children William,  Carol, and Mary, as well as his grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, I ask that all Members of the  House join me in honoring the life and legacy  of Bill Stanley.  HONORING THE HANNA BOYS  CENTER  HON. LYNN C.

In fact,  the useless and dangerous financial instruments  known  as  synthetic  collateralized  debt  obligations,  or  CDOs, shared the spotlight as well.  Fabrice Tourre, one of Goldman’s  hotshot young stars who created and  sold  these  so-called  investments  to  Goldman’s clients, testified yesterday  that they were, quote, ‘‘things which  had no purpose,’’ and likened them to  Frankenstein’s monster. Sadly, he’s  right. These CDOs did nothing for our  economy and spread billions of dollars  in toxic assets, heightened speculation,  and added dangerous risk to our financial system that ultimately was borne  by the U.S. taxpayers.  Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and others reaped millions of dollars in bonuses even as the economy was crashing. These synthetic CDOs were synthetic garbage.  Unscrupulous  individuals  on Wall Street  worsened the financial crisis by creating garbage, selling it and betting against it. Oh, they  drove away with a garbage truck full of cash.  Let’s ban the creation and sale of them, and  prevent this from ever happening again.  f  AMERICANS ABROAD FACE  BANKING ROADBLOCKS  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

223,House,111,0.392,8,2010-04-28,Mr. BILBRAY.," I would like to thank  the coauthor of the bill, Mr. MURPHY,  and especially Chairman TOWNS and  Ranking Member ISSAfor bringing this  item up today. I appreciate the ability  to address it.  Mr. Speaker,  all  across America,  Americans are speaking out loudly. In  fact, there’s a degree of dismay  for  those of us in Washington when we go  home to see the outrage that is coming  out from the average taxpayer in this  country. I think we are just now really  realizing that there is a justification  for the outrage and the strong feelings.  Basically, as we tell the American people that they must give more and that  we are going to take more, they are  saying, No way. You have not earned  the right to be trusted with our tax  money.  Mr. MURPHYand I have been able to  identify one of those items that the  American people have been calling for  for a long time. How do we explain to  our constituents that we are giving  away  inappropriately twice as much  money as we spend to defend their  neighborhoods from terrorism when it  comes to homeland security? How do  we have the gall to ask them to trust  us with more money when we have this  kind  of mismanagement  of  public  funds—not just recently, but historically. And I think this is one place we  can, in a bipartisan effort, admit that  Washington needs to be more responsible, needs to do more and, frankly,  demand more from Washington and the  bureaucracy and less from the American people when it comes to accountability.  We’re talking about the fact that we  need now to lower the thresholds of reporting so the problem can be more  transparent. We need  to make  sure  that we hold those who are trusted in  the Departments with the American  taxpayers’ money to do more, report  more, and be more accountable for the  mismanagement of those funds. Frankly, we need to demand more recovery of  the money when we detect these funds  are being misappropriated.  Frankly, right now, I think the outrage across this country is something  that is healthy for all of us—Democrats, Republicans, Independents. We  should not be asking, Why are the  American people so outraged? We’re  saying, Why didn’t we realize this earlier and sooner so that that outrage did  not just show up in screaming town  hall meetings and protests around this  country?  I want to thank Mr. MURPHYfor joining with me at showing the American  people there are some of us that hear it  loud and clear. We do not blame the  American people  for being outraged.  We blame ourselves and  the Washington establishment for not addressing this issue before and not moving  forward.  So I, again, thank the chairman and  the ranking member. I thank my coauthor on this. And I think, Mr. Speaker, this is more than just money. We’re  talking about we have  taken hard-  earned  resources  from  hardworking  Americans and we have been trusted in  the past; and we have violated that  trust.  ",2010

I am very pleased to join my colleagues Congressman QUIGLEYand Congresswoman GIFFORDS in offering this  amendment. This amendment provides  the Department of Defense the full support of Congress to use energy efficiency as a key tool toward improving  our national security and toward providing more value to taxpayers for our  defense dollars. This amendment will  send an important and strong signal to  defense contractors that their bids will  be more competitive if their products  and services will use less energy.  I urge the support of this bill. I am  very pleased that, among all of the institutions in our country, our Defense  Department is the most aggressive in  pursuing good energy policies. We and  the world face a huge crisis in energy,  so I am pleased that our Defense Department  is  leading the way  in our  country. I am very pleased to be here  to support this good amendment and a  really good bill.  ",2010
228,House,111,-0.363,43,2010-04-28,Mr. GRAYSON.," I yield myself the  balance of my time, and I thank my  colleague for making these points. I’d  like to respond to them briefly.  With regard to the first point, I want  to make it clear that within the literal  wording of this amendment no agency  is ever required to choose the least-  cost product. All that this amendment  says is that in the evaluation scheme,  in order to encourage people who are  offerers to think about how to save  money for DOD, we make the commitment in general, overall, that cost or  price will be considered at  least as  much as all the other  factors combined.  In addition to that, we allow the  head of the agency to suspend the rule  at will, without any condition or limitation in the statute. The head of the  agency can determine  that  for any  item, including mission-critical items,  cost or price can be 40 percent, 30 percent, 10 percent, even 5 percent of the  evaluation factors.  So I think that although the gentleman’s point  is well taken, that we  should not ever bind the hands of the  DOD when DOD needs to get items that  may not be the low cost item, this is  an amendment that does not do that.  This amendment simply says that, in  general, under ordinary circumstances,  particularly  in buying volume commodities  that are  identical  to each  other, we should in fact make 50 percent of the consideration cost or price.  Now, I’ve seen procurements where,  for instance, a commodity like gasoline is being bought by DOD and somehow they determine that two-thirds of  the evaluation factor should be something other than cost or price. Sometimes we waste billions of dollars on  account of decisions like that.  So I think that this is a rule that  really needs to take place. I understand  the gentleman’s point concerning the  study that’s ongoing; but, frankly, I  think that if we do this now, we’ll save  money now. If we do this later, we’ll  save  less money.  I’d rather see the  money saved now, particularly when  we have such great needs abroad and  our defense budget is so great. I think  that this simple rule, this commonsense rule, will help to save billions almost immediately as soon as it’s implemented. I thank the gentleman for  his comments.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2010

You raised a really good point, which  is that this report has shown that this  is going to be a lot more expensive,  that it’s going to raise taxes, that it’s  going to raise health  insurance premiums, that it’s going to make people  drop out of the existing coverage they  have. They will be thrown into the government plan. This is a CMS report,  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services, which is nonpartisan and objective.  What really is outrageous about this  report, Representative AKIN,  is  that  they had it over at DHS before we ever  had the final vote on ObamaCare. They  were sitting on it. Their language now  is, Oh, we didn’t want to influence the  debate.  Isn’t that what a report is all about?  b1700  ",2010
231,House,111,0.559,57,2010-04-28,Mr. SCALISE.," I thank the gentleman  from Missouri. And this latest smoking  gun that’s come out is just yet one  more example of why the American  people are so angry about what happened with this government takeover  of health care, with the way it was  rammed through, with all the broken  promises.  And you can go back to the very beginning when the President was a candidate. He said multiple times all of  these hearings would be on C–SPAN so  you could actually have transparency  and find out what’s going on. In fact,  none of that transparency happened.  None of those meetings were held on C–  SPAN. And now we see this document  that comes out conveniently  just  2  weeks, 3 weeks after the vote that  barely passed by three votes that confirms what we were saying, that this  would actually raise the costs of health  care for most American families at a  time when we should be lowering the  cost of health care, like our bill did  that we filed that actually would have  addressed the real problems in health  care. But in fact their bill does the opposite, and now it’s confirmed that.  What I really want to  find out  is  when  did  the  administration know  about this report? Was this report produced by CMS, a Federal agency, before the vote and then covered up, literally held under wraps so that this  couldn’t become public until after the  vote, when the American people would  once again see that yet another promise by this administration on health  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:17 Apr 29, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K28AP7.108 H28APPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 C L B Y K 8 K S D n o l l e w e s e c i r p c         ",2010

233,House,111,0.584,71,2010-04-28,Mrs. BACHMANN.," Also, remember,  that’s  if  every American  is paying  taxes and paying the debt. But one  thing that we saw from this current filing of income tax is that 47 percent of  Americans paid no taxes. Now, that  doesn’t mean that 47 percent of Americans  are  deadbeats,  because  they  aren’t. Many Americans don’t have income because they’re senior citizens  living off of fixed assets. There are a  number of reasons. But still the number remains true, that 47 percent of  Americans aren’t paying the taxes. An  increasingly smaller group of people  are paying a larger share of the taxes.  And so the debt burden on particular  Americans will be especially egregious.  ",2010
234,Senate,111,-0.382,92,2010-04-28,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Madam President, I think it has been said before,  but here we go again. What we have  just seen tells us what the American  people ought to know. There are fundamental questions being asked of Senators  this week, principal of  those:  Whose side are you on? Whom do you  work for?  On Monday, Tuesday, and yet again  today we got an answer. On the other  side of the aisle they made it clear.  They stand with the big banks. They do  not stand with the infrastructure of everyday people who make this country  the great place we have become. They  do not stand for opportunities such as  the ones that allowed Americans to  come together after World War II to  get an education, get jobs, become the  greatest generation that built our Nation into the greatest on Earth.  Instead, our friends across the aisle  stand with Wall Street lobbyists who  demand that we do not take up this  bill. What an outrage. They stand for  maintaining a banking system that denies people and businesses the funds  they need and sells people mortgages  they cannot afford, while lining executives’ pockets with billions  in compensation. The picture is quite clear. It  is very obvious as to what has taken  place here. After hearing the demands  of the Wall Street lobbyists, the other  side  of  the  aisle  systematically  marches down here and votes no  in  lockstep, not once, not twice but three  times. There is no one bold enough to  say: Yes, we ought to do something  about  this  situation  that hurt our  economy so; that destroyed jobs, lives,  and homes.  What the Republicans voted against  three times this week was simply to  start debating the Wall Street reform  bill, to make it an even fairer system.  The banking lobbyists may not want us  to take up this bill, but everyday people do want  reform. They do want  change. They do want to see capital  flowing into small businesses so they  can get on with work and planning  their families’ and their children’s future.  On behalf of the everyday people,  whose side we are on, we will keep voting to take up this bill until the other  side  understands  that  is what  the  American people want and gives them  a break.  Some say they voted no because they  wanted more time to make a deal. The  reality is, the American people are fed  up with backroom deals  that  leave  them out in the cold. We have carefully  listened to testimony that has been developed these days. We are shocked to  find out how they think hiding the  deals was OK, but they didn’t want it  to be known to the public. They want  us to roll up our sleeves, talk aloud  about  this bill,  tell  the public  the  truth, vote on amendments, and pass a  strong Wall Street reform bill. That is  what the average person in this country wants.  Why don’t the banking lobbyists like  our bill? There are several reasons: Because it puts an end to giant, taxpayer-  funded bailouts by creating a safe, responsible way  to  liquidate  failing  firms. They don’t like it because it will  end the era of too big to fail and stop  protecting  irresponsible  executives  who mismanaged their companies and  because it will help prevent reckless  gambling with  investors’ money by  starting a new consumer protection  watchdog.  They  don’t  want  those  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:45 Jul 08, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S28AP0.REC S28AP0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010
235,Senate,111,0.31,99,2010-04-28,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, I am delighted to join in this debate, and I invite my friends on the other side to listen to what the people in communities  in our home States are saying, who  don’t spend time soliciting  funds on  Wall Street.  Let’s be very clear: We all agree we  need to hold Wall Street accountable  for the havoc wreaked on Main Street.  We all agree we need to enact reform to  prevent another financial crisis. Where  we disagree on is what the responsible  reform looks like. I have real concerns  that, in its current form, the Democrats’ bill, written with  the White  House, is a massive government overreach that will punish Main Street,  hurt families, and cost jobs by stifling  small businesses and entrepreneurs.  To sum  it up, Democrats want to  treat Main Street,  our  community  banks, our farm lenders, and our auto  dealers like they were Goldman Sachs  or others on Wall Street. We Republicans want  to  ensure we  fix Wall  Street, without crippling Main Street.  The only way to do that is to force the  Democrats to listen to the concerns of  Main Street, to open this up and make  it a bipartisan process. It has not been,  and it isn’t going to be until we get  some discussion and real substantive  changes in what I view as a very dangerous bill to the economic climate  and health of our country, our States,  our communities, and the creation of  jobs.  Today, let me share with you some of  the concerns I have heard from Main  Street. Like families in every community and every State, small businesses  were the victims. They weren’t the perpetrators of the financial crisis caused,  among other places, on Wall Street.  Small businesses were not responsible for the financial crisis and should  not be treated as if they were. But that  is exactly what this bill does. This  1,400-page bill reaches far beyond Wall  Street and will impose new costs and  onerous new regulations on small businesses to fix a problem they were not  responsible for causing. In short, this  bill would change the way every American does business.  We are not just talking about changing the way Wall Street banks do business, but also how every community  banker, local dentist, farm lender, and  auto dealer does business. I urge my  colleagues to take time away from the  floor and listen to the people at home.  They have a very different message  than that which we are hearing from  our friends on the other side of the  aisle.  These concerns are not just Republican concerns. I hope my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle are also  hearing from their constituents back  home about disturbing provisions  in  the Democrats’  proposal  and  have  begun  to agree with Senate Republicans that there is a lot of work to be  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:45 Jul 08, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S28AP0.REC S28AP0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010
236,Senate,111,0.356,106,2010-04-28,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Mr. President, I  rise today to speak on the financial  regulatory reform, and particularly the  effect of the Dodd proposal that came  out  of  the Banking Committee  on  which I sit, that we have been voting  on cloture on for this whole week.  I heard Senators from the other side  talk about delay; the Republicans are  delaying this bill. I have heard them  for the last week say it is because we  are siding with Wall Street, Republicans are siding with Wall Street.  That is odd to me because it is the  Wall Street big banks that are for this  bill.  It  is Citigroup,  it  is Goldman  Sachs that are in support of this bill.  They are publicly supporting the bill.  It is the community banks that are  flooding my office and the offices of my  colleagues. It is the community banks  that had nothing to do with the financial meltdown that are hugely concerned with this bill.  That is the issue. The groups that are  opposing Dodd’s bill are the National  Federation of Independent Businesses,  the small businesses of our country;  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Americans for Tax Reform; the Americans for  Limited Government; Freedom Works;  the National Taxpayer Union;  the  United States Automobile Association.  We have had auto dealers in our offices all week who are very concerned  about not being able to get credit from  the little banks and the ability to finance the buying of automobiles. It is  the Military Officers Association that  has concerns with this bill; the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives;  the Farm Credit Council; the National  Association of Home Builders; the Fertilizer Institute.  This is a bill that is going to affect  our economy. So many of the groups I  have named are the groups that are  providing jobs in our country that we  want to encourage to create more jobs,  not discourage in a time such as this.  So, yes, Republicans have been trying  to have input on this bill. There has  not been any Republican input at all. If  we have learned one thing as Republicans, it is that we know what it is  like to be completely shut out. We  were completely shut out of the health  care debate. We had amendments offered day after day after day. Oh, the  process worked. Not one Republican  amendment was passed. Not one. Neither was there one Republican vote in  the House or Senate on the health care  bill. So we have had that experience.  So this time, because we see the dangers in the Dodd bill to our economy  and the small businesses and the small  banks, we are saying we are not going  to let this bill go to the floor if we have  the power to stop it until there is Republican input.  The biggest failure in the bill is that  it still allows taxpayer bailouts. That  is wrong. That is why Republicans are  voting not to bring it up yet, because  we are trying to change the language  in the bill before it comes to the floor  to assure that the taxpayers will not  have the responsibility to bail out big  financial institutions that took gambles with other peoples’ money. That is  the holdup.  This bill is not a bill that is favored  by community and little banks. It is  favored by the big banks. It is favored  by Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. So  let’s be clear about that. As we consider the bill before us, the Dodd bill, it  should focus on the gaps and holes in  regulations that led to our nation’s financial crisis from which we have not  yet recovered, because there are still  millions of people who are unemployed  because of the financial crisis.  We must end too big to fail. We must  end taxpayer bailouts. That is not done  in this bill, and that is why Republicans are saying: Stop this bill from  coming to the floor until it does at  least that one major thing; that is, to  be clear, that we stop too big to fail in  this country.

237,Senate,111,-0.342,113,2010-04-28,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President,  I  thank the Senators from Connecticut  and Alabama for all their hard work on  this issue. I am delighted that after  three votes and 3  full days of pressuring those on the other side of the  aisle to allow us to at least begin debating this critical bill, it appears they  have relented. Finally, it appears they  are willing to listen to not only what  Democrats have been saying about the  importance of a strong new reform bill  for Wall Street but what the American  people have been saying.  What we have been saying is it is  time to hold Wall Street accountable.  It is time to pass strong reforms that  cannot be ignored or sidestepped. It is  time to end bailouts and give Wall  Street the responsibility of cleaning up  their own mess. It is time credit card  statements are  in plain English,  in  loan terms that are spelled out. It is  time for Wall Street to come out of the  shadows and into the light of day. It is  time for negotiations to come out of  the back room and on to the Senate  floor. It is time to put an end to obstruction and begin working for American families.  I am glad we are finally now on this  bill. For most American families, this  debate is not complex; it is simple. It is  not about derivatives or credit default  swaps. It  is about  fundamental  fairness. It is a debate about when they  walk into a bank to sign a mortgage or  apply for a credit card or start a retirement plan, are the rules on their side?  Are they with the big banks or Wall  Street?  For far too long, the financial rules  of the road have not favored the American people. Instead, they favored big  banks and credit card companies and  Wall Street. For too long they have  abused  those  rules. Whether  it was  gambling with the money in our pension funds or making bets they could  never cover or peddling mortgages to  people  they knew  could never  pay  them, Wall  Street made  expensive  choices that came at the expense of  working families. That is exactly the  reason we have all fought so hard to  move forward now with a strong bill.  It is why we have refused to back  down or sit by while it was watered  down, and it is why we were ready to  stay up all night or vote to move forward with this bill all week long. It is  why we have insisted on a bill that includes the strongest protection for consumers ever enacted, an end to taxpayer bailouts, and tools to give individuals  the  resources  they need  to  make smart financial decisions because  each of us knows what the ‘‘anything  goes’’ rules on Wall Street have meant  for our States and our constituents.  Each one of us has talked to people  who have been hurt through no fault of  their own. We have all seen the tremendous cost of Wall Street’s excesses.  In my home State of Washington, it  has cost us over 150,000 jobs. It has cost  small businesses access to credit they  need to grow and hire.  It has cost  workers  their  retirement  accounts  they were counting on to carry them  through their golden years. It has cost  students  their  college  savings  that  would help launch their careers. It has  cost homeowners the value of their  most  important  asset,  as neighborhoods have been decimated by  foreclosures.  It  has  cost  our  schoolteachers, our police officers, and our  communities.  It has cost young people such as  David Corrado of Seattle, whose mother, since he was very young, would  take $400 out of her paycheck and put  it toward David’s education  fund. It  was a long-term, smart investment she  knew would pay off for David’s future.  When the financial crisis occurred, he  lost  one-third  of  his  college  fund,  $10,000.  It has also cost older people such as  Edward Diaz, who is also from Washington State. He was not only laid off  from his job of 21 years due to the recession, he also lost $100,000 from his  401(k) account. On the verge of retirement, Edward tells me he now scours  the classifieds every day searching for  any way to get back to work.  In the days ahead, as we debate this  bill, those are the people we have to remember constantly. We have to keep  them in mind as we work to protect  against this happening ever again; the  people who, through no fault of their  own, paid the price for the risks and irresponsible behavior of Wall Street.  There are people  in my State and  across the country who scrimped and  saved and made right decisions and  were left holding the bag.  Now is not the time for half measures. The American people are looking  to us now for real reform and to put  progress before politics. We have to put  people before Wall Street.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

238,,111,-0.458,134,2010-04-28,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1280, ‘‘Expressing  the support of  the House of Representatives  for  the goals and  ideals of National Healthy Schools Day.’’  Let me begin by  thanking my colleague  Representative PAUL for  introducing  this piece of legislation into the House of Representatives as it is important that we diligently  work towards the improvement of deteriorating  public schools across the nation and also work  towards the improvement of construction techniques in schools.  The  issue  of  environmental  hazards  in  schools has been a growing problem over the  last several decades. It is unfortunate that in  schools across  the nation  investigators can  find  unchecked  renovations,  pesticide  misapplications, unsafe drinking water, and indoor air pollutants such as mold infestations.  It is unreasonable to think that our children  can receive the best possible learning environment when they are expected to learn under  these types of conditions.  There are also a wide range of problems  stemming from poor air quality and ventilation  problems in schools. It has consistently been  shown that these types of air quality problems  can lead to poor concentration, respiratory illnesses, learning difficulties, and even cancer  in students.  Today  there are approximately 55,000,000  children and 7,000,000 adults who spend their  days in the Nation’s more than 125,000 public  and private schools. Students and  teachers  also spend an average of 30 to 50 hours per  week in school.  These numbers equate to nearly 20 percent  of our nation’s population spending their days  in schools across the country—many of which  are currently facing deterioration in the quality  of their buildings while in the face of massive  budget cuts. Therefore  it  is critical  that we  work  together  to seek comprehensive solutions to the trend of deteriorating schools in  our nation.  A recent study showed  that approximately  one-third of public school principals reported  that  some  environmental  factors  in  their  schools have  interfered with classroom  instruction. This report highlights an increasingly  troubling trend among schools of deteriorating  environmental factors.  In  fact school  facilities with poor building  quality can result in lower test scores, poor attendance, and health problems  for students  and staff. These problems are only worsened  for the nearly 9 percent of American students  who are known  to have asthma. Asthma  is  also the leading cause of absence from school  and is aggravated by poor air quality and ventilation problems in schools.  To meet these challenges, I believe that we  should begin working with  school districts  across the nation towards the implementation  of healthy and high performance schools.  These types of schools would be designed  to improve indoor environments while reducing  energy and maintenance costs. They would  also provide for an improvement in the quality  of ambient  light, would reduce exposures  to  toxic  substances  and  would  provide  a  healthier and safer  learning environment  for  children.  Healthy and high performance schools are  designed with specific environmental factors in  mind, such as pollutant source controls, proper ventilation mechanisms, and moisture and  mold controls. It is imperative that school districts in our nation recognize the importance of  these new construction and maintenance techniques and work to ensure the improvement of  student and teacher health across the board.  By officially designating April 26, 2010 as  ‘National Healthy Schools Day,’ we  in Congress will be sending a strong message to students and teachers across the nation that we  intend  to provide healthy and safe buildings  for students to learn in. We will also be sending a message to school districts across the  nation that it is vitally important to build new  schools with  renewable  resource materials  and energy efficient appliances.  We must always ensure  that schools and  children  receive all  the necessary  tools  for  their continued growth. Furthermore it is vitally  important that we continue to work with state  and  local  agencies  including  independent  school districts across the nation for the implementation  of  these measures  in  public  schools.  I would  like  to again  thank my colleague  Representative PAULTONKO for introducing H.  Res. 1280. I ask my colleagues for their support of this legislation as well as their continued support for children, teachers and public  schools across the nation.  Mr. Speaker,  I strongly support H. Res.  1280 and the rule.  f  HONORING  SAUNDERS  OMNIPRESENT  NETWORK  INSPIRING  AMERICA’S  YOUTH,  INC.  FOR  THEIR  EXTRAORDINARY WORK  IN THE COMMUNITY  HON.

239,,111,0.633,141,2010-04-28,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Madam Speaker, it  is with great pleasure I rise to recognize the  50th anniversary the Red Knights of Training  Squadron Three. Through  times of war and  through times of peace, the Red Knights have  served our country with great distinction and  valor.  In  their commitment and  in  their sacrifice, Training Squadron Three rightfully holds  a place in the annals of Naval History as a  squadron that took immense pride in preparing  America’s finest youth for the defense of our  great nation and her ideals. For that reason, I  am proud  to  recognize  the Red Knights of  Squadron Three for their exceptional training  and excellent performance over  the  last 50  years.  With World War II raging in both the Atlantic  and Pacific theaters the demand for trained pilots was at its zenith, and the first squadron to  bear the name Training Squadron Three was  created. Throughout  the costly struggle with  the Axis Alliance that claimed many young pilots, Training Squadron Three continued  to  train pilots for day-to-day operations and for  the units needed to carry out the final campaigns against the Japanese mainland. After  the  terms of surrender were signed by  the  Japanese,  there was  little need  for multiple  training squadrons to train an enormous invasion force and Training Squadron Three was  decommissioned.  The current Red Knights of Training Squadron Three picked up the torch lit by their predecessors on May 1, 1960, and continued the  legacy of ‘‘Training the Best for America’s Defense.’’ On that day, Training Squadron Three  was commissioned with  the  task of utilizing  the T–28 Trojan to prepare a younger generation of student naval aviators in radio instruments, formation flying and air-to-air gunnery.  In 1968, at  the height of  the Vietnam War,  Training Squadron Three was at its peak size;  consisting of 174  instructors, 494 students,  649 enlisted and 162 T–28 aircraft. During  1968, Training Squadron Three had flown almost 110,000 instructional hours and trained  902 students. These impressive figures set the  record for any training squadron in the history  of Naval Air Training command.  In 1980, Training Squadron Three became  the only primary fixed wing training squadron  to be alternately commanded by a Navy and  Marine Corps officer. The Red Knights were  honored once again  in 1994 when  they became  the Navy’s  first and only  joint service  primary flight training squadron. In 1997, the  squadron was  selected as  the  first Navy  squadron  to  transition  to and  fly  the T–6  Texan II.  Madam Speaker, on behalf of  the United  States Congress, I am privileged to recognize  the Red Knights for going above and beyond  the call of duty on their 50th anniversary.

Throughout his athletic career, Carlos  has proven  to be not only an extraordinary  sportsman, but a man of great character as  well.  Carlos was an All-American  linebacker at  Germantown High School in Philadelphia, and  he also earned the distinction of being an All-  American at Wake Forest University. Carlos  then went on  to become a successful NFL  linebacker, playing  for  the San Diego Chargers and, later, the Philadelphia Eagles. Carlos now uses his athletic experience to help  clients as a personal trainer, where he is one  of the most sought after trainers in the country.  In addition to having a spectacular athletic  career, Carlos has worked to help give back to  our youth. As the Executive Vice President of  the  International Student Athlete Academy,  Carlos works  to help young athletes realize  their true athletic and academic potentials.

All President Obama wants is  to have his team in place so they can  start doing their work. But what we  are seeing on the other side over and  again is secret holds and delay.  It is important to remind everybody  that at this particular point in time 107  nominees of the executive branch are  being held up. At this point in time in  the past  for President Bush, only 8  nominees were being held. So 107 are  being held for President Obama, and  for President Bush, there were only 8.  You can only think and draw the conclusion that this is about preventing  the President from getting his team in  place, which is obviously a very important function.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session for the purpose of consideration  of  Calendar  No.  640,  Eric  Hirschhorn, to be Under Secretary of  Commerce for the Export Administration;  that  the nomination  be  confirmed; that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the  table; that no further motions be in  order, the President be  immediately  notified of the Senate’s action, and  that any statements relating to the  nominee be printed in the RECORD, as if  read.

In  1990,  Southwestern  Illinois  College  changed its adult education programming from  a general literacy effort to a program focused  on preparing students for the GED test and  transitioning  them  into postsecondary education. Martha Giordano, Ph.D., who headed  the program then, recalls that ‘‘It was like a  light  coming on. Students wanted a high  school completion so they could move on. We  had to make everything we did relate to this  primary goal.’’ The program revised  its curriculum and course scheduling to accomplish  that goal.  Martha O’Malley, the St. Clair County Regional Superintendent of Education at  the  time, also saw the light and decided to help.  She made GED testing locally available when  she took on the responsibility of testing and  persuaded the other district Regional Superintendents to do likewise. GED tests were administered monthly throughout the district and  registration for testing became an ongoing activity in the regional offices. This practice continues to the present.  ‘‘This combination of  intensive, highly  focused instruction and frequent local testing accounts  for our high numbers,’’ states Giordano. ‘‘When students come to our program,  they know we will take them from where they  are and push  them  forward until  they are  ready for that test.’’  Southwestern Illinois College keeps careful  records of the students who pass, and in October 2009,  it  recorded  its 10,000th GED  ‘‘graduate.’’ This year, at its annual GED Certificate Ceremony—May 19, 2010—the College and District will celebrate this important  milestone.  Southwestern Illinois College has one of the  largest adult education programs in Illinois. It  averages over 500 graduates annually, and  last year 573 of its students earned the GED.  Over the years 42 percent of these GED graduates have enrolled  in undergraduate programs at Southwestern alone.  ‘‘We see our  former adult education students  in  the halls  and classrooms at SWIC and all about town,’’  reports Janice Buchwald, the current GED Director. The program has students who have  finished nursing programs,  transferred  to 4-  year institutions and are working as lab technicians, graphic designers, cafeteria managers,  salespersons and in a host of other occupations. Undoubtedly Southwestern  Illinois College’s adult education efforts are having a significant  impact on  the  lives of many district  residents.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me in congratulating the board, administration,  faculty and students of Southwestern  Illinois  College as they recognize and celebrate the  10,000th GED  ‘‘graduate’’  from  their Adult  Education Program.  f  CELEBRATING MOTHERS AND  MOTHER’S DAY  SPEECHOF  HON.

It’s time to end  ‘‘too big to fail’’ financial firms whose  irresponsible behavior almost crashed  our entire economy. And it’s time to  end predatory lending practices with  tougher enforcement.  We must pass a bill that will end  bailouts and ensure that banks and  taxpayers are never again on the hook  for Wall Street’s risky gambles. We  must act to protect  families’ retirement  funds, college  savings, homes,  and small businesses, and bring transparency and accountability back to a  financial system run amok.  I wasn’t in Congress while some Wall  Street banks were running our financial system into the ground, but I came  here to clean up the mess and get  America’s economy back on track. So I  ask my colleagues, whose side do you  stand on? Do you stand with the reckless Wall Street banks or will you  stand with American families? I urge  my colleagues to pass this bill.  f  FLORIDA IS STILL OPEN FOR  BUSINESS  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  on Wednesday the U.S. Coast Guard announced that the tar balls discovered  on the Florida Keys shoreline were not  linked to the gulf oil spill. What does  this mean? It means that Florida is  still open for business.  Mr. Speaker, public beaches in my  congressional district of Miami Beach  and the Florida Keys are open. Their  waters are warm and inviting. Charter  boat captains eagerly await the opportunity to take tourists deep sea fishing. Similarly, dive shops stand by to  take visitors on a tour of some of the  greatest underwater treasures in this  world, the Florida Keys coral reef.  For those outside of Florida, it is important to note that fresh-caught fish  from our Sunshine State  is  just as  fresh as ever, as are our stone crabs,  spiny lobster, and shrimp. Recent news  reports have caused a premature panic  for visitors. And while it is important  that coastal communities prepare for  the possibility of oil coming ashore,  Florida is open for business.

249,Senate,111,0.342,68,2010-05-20,Mr. GRASSLEY.," The current financial reform bill will not end the cycle  of  financial booms and busts. This  cycle is not the result of green, or capitalism, or animal spirits, or irrational  exuberance. Ultimately, it is caused by  our  failure to recognize and enforce  traditional  legal principles, namely,  the protection of private property.  According to Huerta de Soto: It is a  remarkable fact that three of the most  noted monetary theorists of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries  were  bankers:  John  Law,  Richard  Cantillon, and Henry Thornton. Their  banks all failed.  Law was  involved  in the  infamous  Mississippi scheme, and Cantillon was  involved in a fraudulent stock trading  scheme. Only Thornton escaped controversy because his bank did not fail  until after his death. All of these bankers were  actively  involved  in  convincing their colleagues and customers  of the safety, soundness, and wisdom of  violating traditional legal principles.  Once upon a time, common sense as  well as  the  law  recognized  the difference between a demand deposit and  a loan deposit.  According to Huerta de Soto, ancient  Roman law made it clear that bankers  carried out two different types of operations. On one hand, they accepted demand deposits, which involved no right  to interest and obligated the bank to  maintain the continuous availability of  the money; and the depositor had absolute privilege  in  the case of bankruptcy. On the other hand, bankers  also received loan deposits, which obligated the banker to pay interest on the  money; and the depositor  lacked all  privileges in the case of bankruptcy.  The clear distinction between these  two types of deposits began to break  down with the unfortunate choice of a  penalty for the failure to return a demand deposit. A banker who accepted a  demand deposit and later failed to return the money upon demand was obligated to pay a penalty in the form of  interest.  According to Huerta de Soto, the ban  on usury by the three major monotheistic  religions—Judaism,  Islam,  and  Christianity—did much to complicate  and obscure medieval financial practices. Historically, usury meant charging any interest on a loan. Today, it  means charging excessive interest on a  loan.  Since it was forbidden to pay interest on  loans, it is easy to understand how convenient it was in the Middle Ages to disguise a  loan as a deposit in order to make the payment of interest legal, legitimate and socially acceptable. For this reason, bankers  started to systematically engage  in operations in which the parties openly declared  they were entering into a deposit contract  and not a loan contract.  The method of concealment . ulated [demand] deposit which . . was a sim. was not a  . . true [demand] deposit at all, but rather a  loan [deposit]. At the end of the agreed-upon  term, the supposed depositor claimed his  money. When the [bank] failed to return [the  money], [the bank] was forced to pay a ‘‘penalty’’ in the [form] of interest on [its] presumed ‘‘delay.’’  Disguising loans as deposits became an effective way to get around the canonical ban  on interest and escape severe sanctions, both  secular and spiritual.  It would appear the history of banking consists of a continuous effort to  eliminate  the  distinction  between  these two types of deposits. I do not  mean to criticize modern day bankers.  I suspect they are largely unaware of  this  history.  They  simply  operate  under the rules as they exist today.  Anyone who studies money and banking  in college  is taught about  fractional reserves, deposit insurance, and  the need for a central bank to serve as  lender of last resort. This is standard  fare that passes for higher education  around the world.  As economist John Maynard Keynes  once observed,  ‘‘even the most practical man of affairs is usually in the  thrall of the ideas of some long-dead  economist.’’  Having said all this, the question remains: Where do we go from here?  To answer that question let me return to the topic of money. In a world  of paper currency—without the backing of any tangible commodity—the  supply of money is ultimately determined by the government.  In most countries, the power to create money has been delegated by the  government to a central bank. The central bank in turn controls the money  supply in a number of ways: buying and  selling financial assets—so-called discount window or open-market operations—and requiring banks to keep  deposits at the central bank—so-called  reserve requirements.  As our Nation’s central bank, it is  often suggested that the Federal Reserve controls both interest rates and  the money supply. However, the only  interest rate the Fed controls is the  discount rate. That is the rate the Fed  charges other banks when they borrow  money from the Fed. The Fed generally  prefers that banks borrow from each  other. So, it usually sets the discount  rate higher than the rate banks charge  each other. That rate is called the Federal funds rate.  U.S. banks are required to hold reserves as a percentage of their demand  deposits, but not their loan deposits.  These reserves are designed to cover  daily withdrawals. On any given day,  some banks may have a reserve shortfall, while others may have excess reserves. Thus, banks borrow from each  other on an overnight basis. The Fed  sets a  target  for  the  interest  rate  banks charge each other—the Federal  funds rate—and then  it attempts to  achieve its target.  According  to  the  textbook  explanation, when the Fed wants to lower  the Federal funds rate, it buys financial assets, such as government bonds,  from other banks and pays for them by  creating additional reserves. This  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  creating  money out of thin air. Since the banks  now have more reserves, they are generally willing to lend at a lower rate.  When the Fed wants to raise the Federal funds rate, it sells financial assets  back to the banks and withdraws the  additional reserves. Since the banks  now have fewer reserves, they will usually require borrowers to pay a higher  interest rate.  The Fed can also change the supply  of money by changing the reserve requirement. By raising or lowering the  reserve requirement, the Fed can control how much money banks must hold  in reserve. Higher reserves mean less  money is available for banks to lend,  and lower reserves mean more money  to lend.  Although central banks control the  money supply in the long run, in the  short run individual banks are largely  in control.  As the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago explained in its publication Modern Money Mechanics:  In the real world, a bank’s lending is not  normally constrained by the amount of reserves it has at any given moment. Rather,  loans are made, or not made, depending on  the bank’s credit policies and its expectations about its ability to obtain the funds  necessary to pay its customers’ checks and  maintain required reserves in a timely fashion.  In other words, when banks make  loans, they create new deposits, thereby increasing the money supply. In the  short run, banks are free to make as  many loans as they want based solely  on their expectation of future repayment and their ability to meet required  reserves  and  expected withdrawals,  plus their capital requirements.  In the long run, central banks control reserve requirements and the cost  of borrowing  excess  reserves. Thus,  they can eventually prevent individual  banks  from endlessly expanding  the  money supply.  Money can be defined as the thing  that all other goods and services are  traded for, or as the means to achieve  final settlement of all transactions. As  the means of final payment, money is  uniquely valued above all other assets.  It is considered to be the most liquid  because it is accepted by everyone and  it trades at face value. That is, $1 is always equal to $1.  Because banks have the power to create money—within limits set by the  central bank—they are viewed with a  high degree of suspicion. But banks are  ultimately at the mercy of their customers because they are obligated to  convert deposits into cash. When banks  lose the confidence of their customers,  they are subject to bankruptcy if too  many customers try to withdraw their  money. Banking panics in the past led  to the creation of central banking and  deposit  insurance. These government  safety nets were designed to prevent  the collapse of the banking system.

250,Senate,111,-0.391,82,2010-05-20,Mr. KAUFMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today, as I have many times this Congress, to talk about the role of fraud at  the heart of the financial crisis.  I have previously discussed the urgent need for law enforcement to give  high priority to the investigation and  prosecution of financial fraud, and for  Congress to provide law enforcement  with the tools it needs to do so, including increased funding and stiffer sentences.  I was proud to work with Senator  LEAHY last year on the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. I was proud to  work again with Senator LEAHY, as  well as Senator BAUCUS, the leader, and  many others to include key antifraud  provisions in the health care legislation signed into law in March.  Last month, I, along with the other  members  of  the  Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations, my Senate colleagues, and Americans watching at home, were treated to a truly revelatory series of hearings chaired by  Senator LEVIN.  Chairman LEVINand his staff deserve  high praise for their tenacity and diligence: Beginning in the fall of 2008 and  culminating this spring, the chairman  and his staff reviewed millions of pages  of documents, conducted over 100 interviews, and consulted with dozens of experts.  Thanks to the Levin hearings, we  now have a thorough accounting of  what happened—and what went wrong.  Mortgage origination practices were  rife with fraud, and bank management  and bank regulators failed miserably in  their oversight.  The  practice  of  mortgage  securitization allowed everyone in the  financial  industry  to earn  lucrative  fees  and  commissions,  even  though  banks  knew  that  these  securitized  mortgages were filled with liar’s loans  and  other  fraudulent  products  that  practically guaranteed their eventual  collapse.  At all levels of the industry, compensation  structures  favored  the  riskiest loans and the most minimal  oversight. As a  result, underwriting  standards were laughable. Banks didn’t  care that they were writing bad loans  because  they did not believe  those  loans would stay on their books.  The regulators and ratings agencies  were totally captured by the banks,  due in part to their absolute dependence on the banks for revenue. The Office of Thrift Supervision  relied on  Washington Mutual for 12–15 percent of  its operating budget.  The credit ratings agencies gamed by  investment banks, which had reverse  engineered  their models—bent  over  backwards to stamp AAA and other investment grade ratings on what was  actually junk because they needed the  fees.  Investment  banks marketed  synthetic CDOs, which they had permitted  the ‘‘big shorts’’ to design so that they  were most likely to fail, in some cases  without disclosing that material information to their customers and despite  their own inherent conflict of interest.  As long as the music played, there  was plenty of money to go around. But  when the music stopped, banks were  bailed out and the American taxpayers  were left without a chair.  Fixing the system requires an all out  effort by the bank regulators, the FBI,  the SEC, and the Justice Department.  And Congress should not rest until in  its oversight capacity we are convinced  that  a  systemic,  strategic  and  foundational approach to targeting and  prosecuting fraud is well funded and  well underway.  Bank  regulators,  especially, must  execute a 180-degree cultural turn, assisting the FBI by providing roadmaps  to the fraud that has occurred.  But we still need to do far more than  just add more cops to the beat and ensure that they’re  looking  in all the  right places. We also need to realign  incentives so that banks are encouraged to make sound loans, so that credit ratings agencies can dispense untainted  evaluations  of  creditworthiness, and so regulators aren’t beholden  to those they regulate.  That is why I am proud to support  Senator LEVIN’s package of amendments. Each of the eight proposals in  the package grows directly out of lessons learned through the Levin hearings.  The Levin-Kafuman package will restore regulatory independence by instituting a cooling off period for regulators—putting a stop to the revolving  door between industry and regulator.  The amendment will also guarantee  that the FDIC as secondary regulator  can never again be shut out of an examination by the primary regulator.  To realign bankers’ incentives, the  Levin-Kaufman package will  require  that anybody who securitizes a pool of  loans must maintain at least a 5-percent stake in a representative sampling  of those securities. Other risky lending  practices would be banned outright,  such as synthetic asset-backed securities, which have no purpose other than  speculation.  Finally,  the package will  improve  oversight and operation of the credit  ratings agencies by prohibiting them  from relying on faulty due diligence  and by permitting the SEC to monitor  and regulate the methodologies that  the ratings agencies employ.  The Levin hearings also set in stark  relief the untenable conflicts that rest  at the heart of our financial system.  The Levin hearings focused on the  residential housing market. But conflicts  of  interest  permeate  almost  every corner of our capital markets,  whether in the context of asset backed  securities, or proprietary trading, or a  broker selling private order flow into a  private dark pool, or the prioritization  of trades by a broker ahead of its clients.  We simply cannot  leave  it to the  banks and the brokers to manage conflicts of interest in any way they see  fit. If we can learn one thing from the  financial crisis, surely, it is that.  Under current law, broker-dealers are  not required to disclose conflicts of interest to their clients. They are not required to resolve conflicts in favor of  their clients. They are not required to  act in the best interests of their clients.  In fact, they are permitted to knowingly fleece their clients, provided the  client  is  ‘‘sophisticated’’ enough and  provided the broker has disclosed the  requisite information about the product.  This must change. We can’t expect a  full economic recovery without restoring the public’s trust in markets. This  is why I support, and have cosponsored,  two amendments that would impose a  fiduciary duty on the part of broker-  dealers to their customers, one sponsored by Senator SPECTER and  the  other by Senator AKAKA.  Imposing such a duty would protect  investors and improve the level of integrity  in our  capital markets. No  longer would brokers  like Goldman  Sachs be able to withhold critical information about its conduct from clients and conceal fraud under the cover  of caveat emptor.  Just as important, it would help address the widespread and understandable mistrust  of  the  securitization  process, which in turn makes capital  more expensive and hinders recovery.  I also support Senator SPECTER’s aiding and abetting amendment, which  would reinstate an important deterrent  to the sorts of fraud that contributed  to our current financial crisis.  On March 15, 2010, I came to the Senate floor to discuss the Bankruptcy Examiner’s report on Lehman Brothers  and said—as many of us have suspected  all along—that there was fraud at the  heart of the financial crisis.  Lehman Brothers could not have accomplished  this apparent  fraud—the  use of so-called Repo 105 transactions  to  ‘‘window dress’’  its balance sheet  and mislead  investors—without  the  help of its accounting firm.  And that is true of many sophisticated fraud schemes, where the advice  or analysis of third parties enables or  facilitates the fraud.  Those third parties were answerable  to their victims in court, and therefore  faced a real deterrent, at least until  1994. That year,  in Central Bank of  Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, a divided Supreme Court rejected  years of settled precedent and limited  Federal law in this area to so-called  ‘‘primary violators.’’ The Central Bank  decision, like many others since, reflected the Court’s probusiness bias. It  also left the SEC alone to bring civil  suits against aiders and abettors, and  too often left victims holding the bag.  Regulators will fail. When they do,  however, we must depend on professionals such as accountants and lawyers  to acquit  their  roles as gatekeepers against accounting fraud, not  to materially aid that fraud.

251,,111,0.591,124,2010-05-20,Mr. CONAWAY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to remember and pay tribute to the life  of Grace Stengel Thompson.  Grace was born in Menard, Texas, to a German pioneering  family on August 12, 1916.  Her grandparents were Peter and Emma Jordan, who settled on Upper Willow Creek  in  Mason County  in 1856. Her parents were  George and Louise Stengel, who were prominent members of  the Menard  community.  Grace and her husband, Claude, had  three  children—Toni  Thompson  Hurlbut,  Judith  Thompson Hunter and Claude John Thompson. Grace also has six grandchildren,  ten  great-grandchildren,  one  great-great-grandchild, and many nieces, nephews and cousins.  Grace was proud of her heritage and of her  large extended family; she kept up with many  of her cousins, aunts, uncles, nieces, and  nephews, loved them all, and loved being with  them especially at family gatherings. Her front  door was always open, as was her table. The  family remembers many fine ‘‘spur of the moment’’ meals she  fixed  for whoever showed  up. To say that she was a wonderful cook and  hostess is quite an understatement.  After graduating from Menard High School,  Grace attended Texas Tech University, and it  was at Tech  that Grace met her husband,  Claude, who was President of  the Student  Body while she was Secretary of the Student  Body. They were married in Menard in July of  1937. Grace was a  life-long  supporter of  Texas Tech, and especially  the university’s  athletic programs.  Grace moved  from Menard  to  Lubbock  when son John enrolled at Texas Tech University. While there, she served as administrative assistant to three Deans of Students from  1972 until 1983. Grace belonged to the PEO  Sisterhood and she was also a member of  Delta Delta Delta Sorority. Grace was a lifelong Methodist who  loved  the Lord and all  around her.  Grace passed away on May 13, 2010,  in  Fredericksburg, Texas. Services were held on  May 15, 2010 at  the First United Methodist  Church of Mason, Texas, and the burial followed at Rest Haven Cemetery  in Menard,  Texas.

252,,111,0.422,124,2010-05-20,Mr. WITTMAN.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to Rebecca Acors, a dedicated educator from Spotsylvania County, Virginia, retiring after fifty-two years of teaching  at Robert E. Lee Elementary School.  Mrs. Acors began her  teaching career  in  1957 after graduating from Mary Washington  College with a degree in psychology. Over the  first part of her career, she taught first, second, third, and fifth grades. In 1974 she graduated  from  the University of Virginia’s Curry  School of Education with a Master’s in Education degree. After  receiving her Virginia  state certification as a Reading Specialist, she  began serving as Robert E. Lee’s Reading  Specialist and has served in that position to  the present day. She has taught children and  grandchildren of her early students, and this  year she is teaching her first great-grandchild.  Mrs.  Acors  has  taught  through many  changes—new  trends  in education and  the  ever-increasing use of technology in the classroom. She made it her goal to embrace and  utilize innovative teaching methods in accordance with new research findings. In 2001, she  was named  the University of Virginia’s Elementary Teacher of the Year and in 2008 she  was  named  Robert  E.  Lee  Elementary  School’s Teacher of the Year. To summarize  her outstanding career, Mrs. Rebecca Acors  has had a positive impact on colleagues, parents, community members, and most  importantly, children. As she described  it,  ‘‘To be  able  to help children accept  themselves,  to  challenge each child to reach his/her full potential and to give the gift of reading is invaluable.  I am content  in knowing  that  I have  changed lives and made a difference in this  world.’’  Rebecca Acors devoted her life to the children of Virginia and I congratulate and commend her on this significant achievement.  f  CONGRATULATING  STAFF  SGT.

Jessika Greendeer,  who has been awarded  the Bronze Star  for  her services in the United States Army.  Jessika is a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, and has served  in  the United States  Army since 2004. She  is  the daughter of  Conroy and Janet Greendeer, and the great-  granddaughter of Corporal Mitchell Red Cloud,  Jr. The Ho-Chunk Nation has stated that she  is  the  first Ho-Chunk woman  to have been  awarded the Bronze Star.  Her services during Operation  Iraqi Freedom, and her outstanding performance during  combat operations therein helped to make the  command’s mission a success. For her actions, she was awarded the Bronze Star, one  of  the highest military awards available  to  members of the Armed Services.  I am proud to stand before you today and  commend Staff Sgt. Jessika Greendeer for her  service  to our country. As a citizen of  the  United States,  I am personally grateful  to  Jessika for her excellence in the U.S. Army.  She has demonstrated  the kind of sacrifice  and service to our country that not only makes  her a role model to members of the Ho-Chunk  Nation, but to all Americans.  f  RECOGNIZING MARGARET HUNNICUTT—TEMPE  CHAMBER’S  2010  BUSINESSWOMAN OF THE YEAR  HON.

Ms. Hunnicutt is currently the President and  CEO of Tempe Schools Credit Union, an institution where she has served for nine years as  both CFO and now CEO. Under her leadership, Ms. Hunnicutt has worked to keep the institution successful in both financial terms and  in social responsibility.

257,,111,0.386,131,2010-05-20,Mr. TIBERI.," Madam Speaker, I am pleased  to honor Janet Brenneman on the occasion of  her  retirement  from  the Delaware County  Board of Elections.  Throughout our history, countless individuals  have striven to preserve and expand one of  our most  fundamental rights —  the right of  every American  to cast a ballot.  Informed,  thoughtful participation in our electoral process  by all citizens has been valued by generations  of Americans as the quintessential action helping propel  the United States onto  the world  stage as the foremost example of self-government.  The dedicated men and women working at  our  local boards of election can  trace  their  civic lineage to the suffragettes and freedom  riders of the past. They are the defenders of  our most cherished public act. In this pursuit,  Janet Brenneman has devoted  the  last 35  years of her  life  to  the people of Delaware  County. Whether through long hours on election night or her tireless advocacy to inform  the voters, Janet established an unparalleled  standard of excellence for all other election officers to emulate.  The Delaware Board of Elections stands out  as an example for other counties throughout  Ohio. Janet’s quality of service  is matched  only by the quality of her character. A devoted  friend to colleagues and a trustworthy public  servant to voters, Janet’s many virtues, both  professional and personal, will certainly be  missed and hard to replace.  I  offer  my  congratulations  to  Janet  Brenneman on her  retirement and  join her  friends and  family  in celebrating  this great  milestone. On behalf of the citizens of Delaware County and the 12th Congressional District of Ohio, I offer my thanks and gratitude  for her many years of service.  f  HONORING MS.

258,,111,-0.297,131,2010-05-20,Mr. ANDREWS.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor Gloria Chao for both her service as a  librarian at  the Rutgers School of  Law-Camden and for her infectious positive attitude.  Ms. Chao  received her Bachelor of Arts  from Providence University  in 1967 and a  Master  of  Science  in  Library  Science  (M.S.L.S.) from the Graduate School of Library  and Information Science at Villanova University  in  1970. After  graduation, Ms. Chao  worked with Temple Law Library and Air Asia  in Taiwan.  In 1979, Ms. Chao  joined  the  library staff at Rutgers School of Law in Camden, New Jersey. Upon  joining  the  library  team, she immediately played an integral role  in establishing the cataloging department and  Research Library Information Network (RLIN)  system. By 1984, Ms. Chao was appointed  Head of Technical and Automated Services.  In her 31 years with Rutgers School of Law-  Camden, Ms. Chao has been a model of success, hard work and positivity. She is affectionately referred to as the ‘‘sunshine’’ of the  law library and the law school. Currently she  is using her bravery, optimism and strength to  battle stage 4 lung cancer. She is facing the  disease while keeping her sense of humor intact.  Madam Speaker, Ms. Gloria Chao  has  helped students and  faculty  find and secure  knowledgeable  resources  and  information  while brightening the days of all around her. I  congratulate Ms. Chao on her accomplishments at Rutgers and wish her  the utmost  strength and courage in this time of sickness.

With increasing global competition, it is critically important that we boost our country’s research potential and expand our commitment  to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,  and Mathematics) education. Economic growth  requires innovation; innovation requires robust  research; and effective  research  requires a  broadly educated workforce. I am deeply saddened  that COMPETES  fell victim  to shortsighted Republican political gamesmanship,  and  I  look  forward  to working with House  Science and Technology Chair BARTGORDON  to get COMPETES reauthorized through another legislative vehicle.  f  JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE  MONTH  HON.

260,,111,-0.481,138,2010-05-20,Mr. CLAY.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the rich heritage and invaluable contributions that Jewish Americans have made to  our Nation and  to  the community  that  I am  proud to represent in Missouri’s First Congressional District.  The earliest Jewish immigrants came to St.  Louis over two hundred years ago.  Like most new Americans, they came seeking a refuge from persecution and discrimination, with the hope of building productive lives  and practicing their faith, without fear.  In St. Louis, and across the Nation, Jewish  Americans have excelled in every facet of our  society. From commerce, to the arts, to education, medicine, the law, government, and in  our armed forces.  Jewish Americans have enriched our Nation  and contributed much  to our shared cultural  heritage.  I also want to make special mention of the  long and historic partnership between the African American and the Jewish American communities, in the pursuit of social justice, civil  rights, voting rights and equal protection under  the law.  During  the most  trying  times of  the civil  rights movement, Jewish Americans and African Americans marched  together, stood  together, protested  together, prayed  together,  and even died together, to advance the cause  of full citizenship and real equality for all.  That partnership and common pursuit of justice endures today.  In my district, I am blessed to represent a  large, vibrant Jewish community with many  outstanding  congregations, educational and  cultural groups and social service agencies;  including: the Jewish Federation of St. Louis;  the Jewish Community Center; Jewish Family  and Childrens Services; the Jewish Community Relations Council; the St. Louis Holocaust  Museum and Learning Center, Barnes-Jewish  Hospital, the Central Agency for Jewish Education, and many others.  Jewish Americans have helped shape our  Nation’s history, and  their unending commitment to faith, family, learning and social justice will continue  to strengthen  the United  States.  I am proud  to  join with my colleagues  mark Jewish American Heritage Month.  to  f  COMMENDING DAVID BARTON FOR  EDUCATING  AMERICA  ABOUT  OUR NATION’S RELIGIOUS HERITAGE  HON.

261,,111,0.51,138,2010-05-20,Mr. POSEY.," Madam Speaker,  recently,  I  had the opportunity to tour our nation’s Capitol  building with one of our nation’s leading scholars, David Barton. David Barton is an accomplished author, speaker, and historian who focuses on helping Americans explore and understand our nation’s moral,  religious, and  constitutional heritage. It is critically important  that all of us have a deeper understanding  and appreciation of our nation’s founding.  Mr. Barton has dedicated his life to studying  historical documents  from  the  foundation of  our nation and helping Americans understand  the impact moral and religious teaching and  beliefs had on our nations’ Founding Fathers  and the direction of our nation. Through his  work, he teaches that in addition to a constitutional  foundation, our nation has undeniable  religious and moral underpinnings.  Mr. Barton  is  founder and president of  Wallbuilders, a national organization that presents  ‘‘America’s  forgotten history and heroes.’’ The organization seeks to educate citizens about  the  important  role  that  religious  faith had on our Founding Fathers and our nation’s institutions, including our government.  Mr. Barton has received substantial recognition for his work, including being named ‘‘one  of  the 25 Most  Influential Evangelicals’’ by  TIME magazine and receiving several Angel,  Who’s Who in Education, and Telly Awards,  as well as  the George Washington Honor  medal.  I commend Mr. Barton for his commitment  to  fostering  a  scholarly  understanding  of  America’s heritage and for the important work  he does  in studying and  teaching regarding  the Biblical values that guided our Founders  during the birth of our nation more than 225  years ago.  I have been on several Capitol  tours with Mr. Barton, and his knowledge  about the religious foundation of our country  never ceases to amaze me. It is through this  type of work that Americans gain a better understanding of what  the Founders expected  our nation to be like and what we should expect  from our elected  leaders and  the  laws  they create.  Madam Speaker,  I  encourage my  colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Barton  and the work that he does to educate Americans about our nation’s past so that America  can be a beacon to the world.  f  OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL  DEBT  HON.

263,,111,-0.306,138,2010-05-20,Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Congregation  Olam Tikvah on the occasion of the Dedication Ceremony for their recent expansion.  Congregation Olam Tikvah was  formed  in  1964 by six Fairfax County families who recognized the need for a synagogue that would  serve the Kings Park, Springfield, Fairfax and  Annandale areas. The congregation was  initially led by Reb Jack Frankel who, although  not an ordained rabbi, provided religious leadership and guidance in those early days.  From  these modest  beginnings,  Olam  Tikvah has grown  into a vibrant community  and is the spiritual and religious home to over  620 Jewish  families  in  the Northern Virginia  area. Along with  this growth  in membership  has come an expansion of programs which  now include a preschool, child and adult education classes, ritual support, a Men’s Club, a  Sisterhood and a senior social group.

264,House,111,0.513,3,2010-05-26,Mr. SULLIVAN.," Mr. Speaker, I am  troubled by this administration’s commitment, this lack of commitment of  enforcing  our  national  immigration  laws.  Just last week, John Morton, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security  for the U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement,  said  that  ‘‘his agency  will not necessarily process illegal immigrants referred to them by Arizona  officials,’’ in light of their new State  law.  My district contains two permanent  ICE offices, and I am seriously concerned that one of the top officials in  the Obama administration in charge of  enforcing  our Nation’s  immigration  laws is refusing to do his job. Regardless of his personal feelings on the Arizona immigration law, Assistant Secretary Morton has an obligation to enforce the rule of law and protect U.S.  citizens and legal residents.  Arizona  is under  siege with both  human and drug smuggling, and it is  on the front lines dealing with Mexico’s drug violence that is spilling over  into the United States.  On behalf of my constituents and  millions of Americans, I urge President  Obama and Immigration and Customs  Enforcement Secretary Morton to enforce our immigration laws.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF TAM  NGOC TRAN  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and  to revise and extend her remarks.)

265,House,111,-0.302,10,2010-05-26,Ms. BERKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is plain to see  from the words of my esteemed colleague, it is plain to see Israel’s extraordinary impact on the global economy. Its accession to the OECD will  have a positive impact on our global  economy at a time when our economy  is suffering worldwide.  It would be my hope that the Palestinians, rather than to continue to  refuse to make peace with Israel, to  continue its terrorist attacks on innocent Israelis, its continuance to refuse  face-to-face  negotiations  with  the  Israelis  for peace, to actively  incite  anti-Semitism  and  hatred  towards  Israel, and to continue its attempts to  delegitimize  Israel’s  very  right  to  exist, that perhaps instead it would be  more worthwhile  for the Palestinian  people if its leaders would work with  Israel to improve its own economic situation, to raise the Palestinian people  from the misery, poverty, and squalor  in which they live, and in which they  continue to live, not because of the  Israelis’ success, but because of the  lack of movement on the part of the  Palestinian leadership that continues  to use and abuse their own people and  attempt to delegitimize Israel’s very  right to exist.

I  thank my  I wanted to follow Mr. POLISand just  talk about the Rocky Mountain West,  which really did receive Jewish immigrants with  open  arms. Sometimes  there was discrimination, but generally  it was open arms. In New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming,  ranching,  farming,  mining, construction, you name it, the  Jewish community was involved in it.  Merchants, oil and gas, the Manhattan  Project down in Los Alamos in New  Mexico.  So, my  family, a great-great-great  uncle immigrated from the Ukraine in  the late 1800s, was part of a mining  commune above a  little town called  Center, Colorado,  remained  in  that  mining commune for about 3 years, realized he didn’t  like being at about  11,000 feet in the mountains of Colorado, moved to the Denver area, where  he had a small store, and that uncle  then attracted the others who immigrated from the Ukraine. So the youngest brother came first, then the next  brother, the next brother, and the next  brother. My grandfather was the oldest. He was the last to arrive from the  old country.  But the Denver area in Colorado really did allow people a chance to really  show what they were made of, and the  Jewish community in Colorado, in the  Denver area, has flourished over the  years. It has been very much a part of  the fabric of the community in charitable efforts, as well as education and  those kinds of things. And the heritage  that we are  talking about  tonight,  really at least in the Rocky Mountain  West, the Jewish community and the  Rocky Mountain West are inseparable.

286,Senate,111,-0.352,87,2010-05-26,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, I wish today to mention  the outstanding work of an ambassador  who  is  leaving Washington  after  4  years of distinguished achievement—  Ambassador  Oleh  Shamshur  of  Ukraine.  There  is  little doubt that he has  made a major contribution to strengthening bilateral relations between our  countries. Ambassador Shamshur was  one of the senior negotiators of the  United  States-Ukraine  Charter  on  Strategic Partnership signed on December 19, 2008, which elevated relations between the United States and  Ukraine to a new level. The charter is  a  living document and continues to  guide  cooperation  between  the  two  countries. On April 12, 2010, President  Obama and President Yanukovych reaffirmed  their  commitment  to  the  charter and expressed their intention  to realize its full potential.  Ambassador Shamshur also played an  important role in the establishment of  the United States-Ukrainian Strategic  Partnership Commission and participated in its first inaugural session in  December 2009. The commission has reinvigorated  relations  between  the  United States and Ukraine with an ongoing dialog and program of cooperation on issues of democracy, economic  freedom and prosperity, security and  territorial integrity, energy security,  defense-related cooperation, the rule of  law, and people-to-people contacts.  During Ambassador Shamshur’s tenure in Washington, Ukraine once more  demonstrated its important leadership  on the question of nonproliferation and  arms control  issues. Cooperation on  these issues between Washington and  Kyiv has been significantly enhanced.  These efforts were conspicuous in the  positive outcome of the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington.  While  in Washington, Ambassador  Shamshur’s accomplishments were not  limited to issues of international security or geopolitics. Early on  in his  service here, the United States reinstated tariff preferences  for Ukraine  under the Generalized System of Preferences and granted Ukraine market  economy status. The Ambassador was  instrumental in the efforts that led to  Ukraine’s graduation from the Jackson-Vanick Amendment on 23 March  2006. The United States and Ukraine  were also able to sign a bilateral agreement on market access issues, which  became a key step in Ukraine’s eventual joining the World Trade Organization. The establishment of the United  States-Ukraine Council on Trade and  Investment in March 2008 was also a result of Ambassador Shamshur’s tireless  efforts.  This  year,  Ambassador  Shamshur can also claim credit for the  resolution of difficulties surrounding  the operation of the Overseas Private  Investment Corporation in Ukraine and  its return to the Ukrainian market.  Many of us on Capitol Hill and in the  administration share an appreciation  for  Ambassador  Oleh  Shamshur’s  achievements. He leaves relations between Ukraine and the United States  immeasurably  stronger  for  having  served here these 4 years. We wish him  and the Ukrainian people well on the  occasion of his departure.  f  AMERICA COMPETES ACT  ",2010

I also submit a copy of  the letters referenced therein.  CONGRESSOFTHEUNITEDSTATES,  HOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES,  May 24, 2010.  Hon. BARACKOBAMA,  The President, The White House,  Washington, DC.  DEARMR. PRESIDENT: This is in response to  your actions of December 30, 2009, on House  Joint Resolution 64, a short-term continuing  resolution of appropriations that was presented to you on December 19, 2009. That  measure was intended to accommodate your  review and approval of the regular appropriations but was rendered unnecessary when  you were able to act swiftly on the regular  appropriations. You therefore decided not to  approve the joint resolution. Although you  cited The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655  (1929), you returned the parchment to the  House with a memorandum of disapproval  stating that you wanted to leave no doubt  that the joint resolution was being vetoed as  unnecessary.  You acted on the joint resolution on the  ninth day of the 10-day period during which  you could approve it. The standing rules of  the House made the Clerk available to receive your message. The House and Senate  stood adjourned sine die but with provision  for reassembly of the first session and with  the certainty of reassembly for the second  session of the instant Congress. Thus, each  body was in a position to reconsider the vetoed measure in light of your objections, either in the second session or even in the first  session.  The circumstances surrounding the presentment and return of House Joint Resolution 64 and the readiness of Congress to reconsider the joint resolution in light of Presidential objections compel us to question the  assertion that a pocket veto did or could  have occurred. We think you agree that the  pocket veto and the return veto are available  on mutually exclusive bases and, therefore,  during mutually exclusive periods. We think  you also should agree that the constitutional  concern  that a measure not become  law  without the President’s signature when an  adjournment prevents a return veto does not  arise when the President is able to return  the parchment to the originating House with  a statement of his objections. Accordingly,  we believe that your return of House Joint  Resolution 64 with your objections is absolutely inconsistent with this most essential  characteristic of a pocket veto, to wit: retention of the parchment by the President for  lack of a legislative body to whom he might  return it with his objections. Your successful  return of House Joint Resolution 64 establishes that you were not prevented from returning it.  After an enrolled measure is presented for  Presidential approval, the parchment ultimately meets one of four ends. It might be  tendered to the Archivist by the President  because he signed it or allowed it to become  law without his signature. It might be referred to committee by the first house to  sustain a veto. It might be tendered to the  Archivist by the second house to override a  veto. Or it might be retained by the President because he ‘‘pocketed’’ it. If the President returns a parchment to the Congress,  then he has not pocketed it, and it therefore  is subject to reconsideration. Either the Congress has prevented the President from returning the parchment with a statement of  his objections or it has not. By returning the  parchment a President is admitting that he  is not prevented from returning it.  The House has treated your message of December 30, 2009, on House Joint Resolution 64  as a return veto. On January 12, 2010, the  message—comprising  the  parchment  and  your memorandum of disapproval—was laid  before the House. After the memorandum  was read, your objections were entered in the  Journal and the House obeyed the command  of the Constitution to  ‘‘proceed to reconsider’’ the joint resolution. Rather than immediately considering the ultimate question  of overriding or sustaining the veto, the  House chose as its first mode of reconsideration a postponement until January 13, 2010.  On that day the House reconsidered the joint  resolution in light of your objections and  voted by the yeas and nays on the question  of overriding or sustaining the veto. The  House sustained your return veto.  We enclose for your consideration copies of  previous letters to President George H. W.  Bush, to President Clinton, and to President  George W. Bush, respectively dated November 21, 1989, September 7, 2000, and April 14,  2008. Those letters from Speaker Foley and  Leader Michel,  from Speaker Hastert and  Leader Gephardt, and from the two undersigned, respectively, expressed the profound  concern of the bipartisan leaderships over  similar assertions of pocket vetoes. We echo  those concerns and urge you to give appropriate deference to such judicial resolutions  of this question as have been possible.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

BUSH,  The President, The White House,  Washington, DC.  DEARMR. PRESIDENT: This is in response to  your actions of December 28, 2007, on H.R.  1585, the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2008, which you returned to  the House of Representatives without your  approval. In returning the parchment you  transmitted a memorandum of disapproval  stating your objections to enactment of the  bill. This memorandum of disapproval  included the following paragraph:  ‘‘The adjournment of the Congress has prevented my return of H.R. 1585 within the  meaning of Article I, section 7, clause 2 of  the Constitution. Accordingly, my withholding of approval from the bill precludes  its becoming law. The Pocket Veto Case, 279  U.S. 655 (1929). In addition to withholding my  signature and thereby invoking my constitutional power to ‘pocket veto’ bills during an  adjournment of the Congress, I am also sending H.R. 1585 to the Clerk of the House of  Representatives,  along with  this memorandum setting forth my objections, to avoid  unnecessary litigation about the non-enactment of the bill that results from my withholding approval and to leave no doubt that  the bill is being vetoed.’’  The circumstances surrounding the presentment and return of H.R. 1585 and the  readiness of Congress to reconsider the bill  in light of Presidential objections compel us  to question the assertion that a pocket veto  did or could have occurred. We think you  agree that the pocket veto and the return  veto are available on mutually exclusive  bases and, therefore, during mutually exclusive periods.

Your successful  return of H.R. 1585 establishes that you were  not prevented from returning it.  H.R. 1585 was presented to you on December 19, 2007. You returned the bill on December 28, 2007—the eighth of the ten days allowed under the Constitution. The Clerk was  available pursuant to the standing rules of  the House to receive your message. The Congress was in a position to reconsider the bill  in light of Presidential objections, even in  the first session of the instant Congress. Although the House had adjourned sine die  (without specifying a day of return), it did so  with provision for its reassembly. Moreover,  both houses were to reassemble in due course  for a second session of the instant Congress.  After an enrolled bill is presented for Presidential approval, the parchment ultimately  meets one of four ends. It might be tendered  to the Archivist by the President because he  signed it or allowed it to become law without  his signature.

289,,111,-0.302,129,2010-05-26,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Madam Speaker, I  ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing  the 50th anniversary of the National Council  for  International Visitors, NCIV—a nonprofit  leader  in citizen diplomacy—and supporting  designation of February 16, 2011, as ‘‘Citizen  Diplomacy Day.’’  NCIV  is a membership association, with  members  based  in  congressional  districts  throughout the nation, dedicated to promoting  excellence  in citizen diplomacy—the concept  that individual citizens have the right and responsibility  to help shape U.S.  foreign relations ‘‘one handshake at a time.’’ NCIV’s nationwide network comprises 92 community organizations as well as federal agencies, associate members, and individuals. With leadership and training provided by NCIV, member  organizations create professional connections,  provide cultural activities, and offer home hospitality opportunities  for  foreign  leaders and  specialists. Each year, the aggregate efforts of  NCIV members involve more than 80,000 volunteers.  The NCIV network is the private-sector partner of the U.S. Department of State for the  International  Visitor  Leadership  Program,  IVLP, a long-standing, successful initiative for  strengthening U.S. foreign relations. More than  285 current and former heads of state (including F.W. de Klerk, Anwar Sadat, Manmohan  Singh,  Nicolas  Sarkozy,  and  Morgan  Tsvangarai) and approximately 1,700 cabinet-  level ministers have participated in the IVLP,  which U.S.  ambassadors  have  repeatedly  ranked first among 63 U.S. public diplomacy  initiatives.  Through citizen diplomacy,  the NCIV network and  the  IVLP have positively affected  hundreds of thousands of lives in America and  abroad—among countless other ways, by:  Empowering a key reformer to stand up for  democracy and  freedom  following  the February 2010 coup in Niger;  Introducing high school students  in Reno,  Nevada, to Moroccan journalists and Afghan  women leaders;  Sharing best practices with leaders of Malaysian disaster-relief nonprofits in the wake of  a devastating earthquake and tsunami;  Connecting an environmental and water resources engineering  firm  from Portland, Oregon,  to business opportunities with China;  and  Breaking stereotypes about Americans for a  Yemeni governance and conflict management  expert.  The success of NCIV is based on patriotic  citizens, entrepreneurs, and small businesses  coming  together  to help promote America  abroad while boosting the local economy. By  working with the State Department, NCIV is an  important source of income for many throughout the U.S. based on the increased economic  activity  generated  by  international  visitors.  Nearly the entire IVLP budget is spent within  the United States, where it generates millions  of dollars  in  local economic activity. NCIV  members raise an additional $6 for every dollar they receive in federal funding, all of which  is spent locally. Furthermore, by bringing foreign  leaders  to U.S.  schools, government  agencies, and businesses, the NCIV network  and the IVLP help U.S. communities build a  more globally literate, competitive workforce.  Please  join me  in demonstrating congressional support for this national network of citizen diplomats by recognizing NCIV’s 50th anniversary and  recommending designation of  February 16, 2011, as Citizen Diplomacy Day.

LAURA RICHARDSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 26, 2010  ",2010
290,,111,-0.339,129,2010-05-26,Ms. RICHARDSON.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today in support of H. Res. 1339, which expresses  the House of Representatives’ support  for  the designation of May as National  Foster Care Month and recognizes the important role that foster parents play in the lives of  children across the country. There are nearly  500,000 children in America’s foster care system. Many of these children come from troubled backgrounds and turbulent pasts. America’s foster parents take these children in and  show  them  the care and attention  that  they  deserve as they wait to be reunited with their  families or adopted into new, loving families.  I thank Chairman LEVIN for his leadership in  bringing this bill to the floor. I also thank the  sponsor  of  this  legislation,  Congressman  for working  to  increase public  awareness about the critical role that the foster care system plays in our society.  In my home State of California,  there are  nearly 80,000 children in the foster care system, a majority of whom were placed there by  the State as a result of parental abuse or neglect. Foster parents play a critical role in the  lives of some the most vulnerable youths in  California and across the country. They help  hold our Nation’s social fabric together by ensuring that thousands of young people in this  country stay on track towards successful futures.  Designating May as National Foster Care  Month is a way to encourage responsible and  MCDERMOTT,  caring adults to serve as foster parents. Unfortunately, there is currently a shortage in the  number of foster parents available. There are  less than 3 foster homes for every 10 children  living under the State’s care.  While the foster care system provides a vital  service in our society, children in foster homes  often  face  special  challenges.  In  2008,  123,000 of the 273,000 children in the foster  care system were waiting to be adopted into  new homes. However, by the end of the year,  only 55,000 were adopted out of foster care.  Foster children who are not adopted or reunited with their families often end up ‘‘aging  out’’ of the foster care system. These children  who ‘‘age out’’ of the system are in need of resources to help them afford higher education  opportunities,  find  affordable  housing  and  quality health insurance, and achieve steady  employment. This is a social demand to which  Congress must respond.  Past  legislative  initiatives  to  invest  in our  country’s foster care system include the Adoption Assistance and Safe Families Act of 1980,  the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997,  and  the Fostering Connections  to Success  and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. These  initiatives recognized the need to provide increased  resources  for  foster  families and a  sense of stability for foster children, 65 percent of whom experience a minimum of seven  school changes while in the system. Congress  must continue working to improve the foster  care system, so  that all children within  this  system can develop and mature  in young  adults with bright futures.  I salute the selflessness and hard work that  foster parents demonstrate each day when  they care for a child who had been displaced  from his or her family. I offer my sincere support for dedicating the month of May as National Foster Care Month.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 1339.  f  CELEBRATING ASIAN/PACIFIC  AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH  SPEECHOF  HON. JOE BACA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 25, 2010  ",2010

This is a nation of immigrants and it is always  important  to  take  time, and recognize  the contributions  that different cultures and  ethnicities have made to our society and our  American way of life.

292,Senate,111,-0.203,37,2010-06-07,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President, along  with my distinguished colleague Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, I  rise today to introduce the Section 8(a)  Improvements Act of 2010. As the Chair  of the Committee on Small Business  and Entrepreneurship, I have held a  number of hearings and roundtables on  the  issues affecting small businesses  that contract with the Federal Government. The Committee has repeatedly  heard from small businesses throughout the country that more needs to be  done to level the playing field and help  our small businesses win Federal contracts. The legislation that I am introducing today seeks to improve access  to Federal contracts  for small businesses, particularly  for  socially and  economically  disadvantaged  small  businesses. It also represents the third  in a series of steps that the Committee  is taking to address the disparities and  inequalities that currently exist in the  Federal procurement process.  As I have explained in previous statements before this chamber, as the largest purchaser in the world, the Federal  Government is uniquely positioned to  offer new and reliable business opportunities for our small firms. Government contracts are one of the easiest  and most inexpensive ways the government can help to immediately increase  sales for America’s entrepreneurs, leading to the creation of new jobs and  helping to move our economy forward.  When large businesses get government  contracts, they are able to absorb that  new work  into their existing workforce. When small businesses get government work they must ‘‘staff up’’ to  meet  the  increased demand. By  increasing contracts to small businesses  by just 1 percent, we can create more  than 100,000 new jobs. Today, we need  those jobs more than ever.  But the reality is that small businesses need all the help they can get  when  it comes to accessing Federal  contracts. Small businesses  face significant challenges  in competing  for  these opportunities, including a maze  of complicated  regulations, contract  bundling  issues,  size  standards with  loopholes for big businesses, and a lack  of protections for sub-contractors. Despite the  fact that Federal agencies  have a statutory goal to spend 23 percent of their contract dollars on contracts to small firms, in recent years  the government has often fallen short.  For example, according to the Federal Procurement Data System, in fiscal year 2007 the Federal Government  missed its 23 percent contracting goal  by  .992  percent. That  .992  percent  doesn’t sound like much, but in reality  it represents more than $3.74 billion  and  93,500  jobs  lost  for  small businesses. In fiscal year 2008, the Federal  Procurement Data System  reported  that the government missed its goal by  1.51 percent, meaning more than $6.51  billion and 162,700  jobs  lost  for our  small businesses. At a time when more  than 15 million Americans are still out  of work, merely meeting that 23 percent goal could mean food on the table  for a family struggling to make ends  meet.  Clearly we need to do better when it  comes to helping our small businesses  access Federal contracting opportunities. Even  under  the  best  of  circumstances our small businesses face  significant  challenges when  seeking  Federal contracting opportunities. But  these  challenges  are  further  compounded for small businesses that face  additional obstacles, particularly those  that are socially and economically disadvantaged.  The Section 8(a) Improvements Act  of 2010 attempts to help socially and  economically disadvantaged  firms  in  three ways. First, it makes long overdue and much needed adjustments to  the average annual  income and net  worth thresholds currently  in place.  Since the establishment of the 8(a) program over 30 years ago, these thresholds have not been significantly updated to account for inflation, placing  unrealistic  limits on the number of  small businesses that are eligible to  participate in the program.  Additionally,  this  legislation  requires the SBA to establish maximum  net worth thresholds for socially and  economically  disadvantaged  small  businesses working  in  the manufacturing, construction, professional services, and general services  industries.  Small businesses working in these industries simply face different business  conditions as well as higher business  costs, which prevent them from participating in the 8(a) program. Making  this simple fix will open the program  up to a wide array of qualified small  businesses.  Secondly, this legislation builds upon  the previously mentioned adjustments  to the net worth and income thresholds, by extending the amount of time  under which a business can participate  in the program. For all of the success  that many small businesses experience  while participating  in  the program,  upon graduation as many as 70 percent  see their businesses fail within several  years. By establishing a transition period, businesses that have graduated  from the program can continue receiving developmental assistance for up to  3 years  after  graduation,  providing  them with much needed stability as  they seek to transition their business  operations.  The third way this  legislation attempts to improve contracting opportunities for small businesses is through  the creation of a Surety Bond Pilot  Program. Under the program, the SBA  can guarantee  90 percent of  surety  bonds,  protecting  small  businesses  against  any  loss  resulting  from  a  breach of the terms on a bond. To supplement the guarantee and help put  these small businesses in a stronger position to succeed upon graduation from  the 8(a) program, the legislation also  requires  the  SBA  to  provide  educational training and technical assistance on a wide range of topics. Finally,  the legislation establishes a revolving  fund to support the program, and also  creates an advisory board to oversee  and evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the program.  It is well past time to provide greater  opportunities  for  the  thousands  of  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:23 Oct 09, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S07JN0.REC S07JN0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010

As one who didn’t grow up in wealth  or politics but, really, quite the opposite—very simple beginnings in a single-wide trailer on a tar and gravel  road in the backwoods of north Georgia—I am here now able to pay tribute  to my parents who couldn’t give me  the material things in life but, instead,  they showed me love and they encouraged me to dream big, to work hard,  and achieve much.

And  the message  from  the hills of  north Georgia to the Hill of this great  building is very clear, and that is that  it’s time to curb spending. It’s time to  balance the budget, and it’s time to  empower the people.  While the challenges are great in this  Nation, the will and the Constitution  of her people are greater. And, you  know, my dad was right.  If we, as  Americans, dream big, work hard, we  can achieve much as a Nation.  So on behalf of Georgia Nine, Madam  Speaker, I am here to go to work.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  The SPEAKER.

295,,111,0.303,64,2010-06-14,Mr. WHITFIELD.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize my good friend, Dr. Joe E.  Ellis of Benton, Kentucky.  Dr. Ellis will soon be elected president of  the American Optometric Association during  their 113th annual meeting, where he will be  installed as AOA’s 89th president on Saturday,  June 19th, 2010 in Orlando, Florida.  Dr. Ellis is a graduate of the Southern College of Optometry and has a private practice  in Marshall County. He was named Kentucky  Young Optometrist of  the Year  in 1992 and  has also  received  three President’s Awards  from the Kentucky Optometric Association.  Dr. Ellis’ particular area of interest is advocacy, especially as it relates to patients’ access to optometric care. He has been active in  legislative and government  relations at  the  state and national levels and recently served  as Chairman of the AOA’s State Health Care  Legislation Committee.  Dr. Ellis was instrumental in the passage of  the first state law of its kind that requires that  all Kentucky children entering public schools  receive a diagnostic eye examination. The  Kentucky General Assembly  identified problems with vision as an important factor limiting  children’s  abilities  to  learn  and  succeed.  Through this, they recognized that the early diagnosis and  treatment of  children’s  vision  problems is a necessary component to school  readiness and academic learning and the enactment of this legislation in 2000 ensured that  children in my state are able to meet their developmental potential.  Doctors of optometry serve patients in nearly 6,500 communities across the country, and  in 3,500 of those, they are the only eye doctors. Optometrists provide two-thirds of all primary eye care  in  the United States. The  American Optometric Association  represents  approximately 36,000 doctors of optometry,  optometry students and paraoptometric assistants and technicians.  Dr. Ellis’ enthusiasm for optometry and commitment to excellence in eye and vision care  has earned him this prestigious national office  and public recognition. I am confident that he  will have a very successful term as the American Optometric Association’s president. His  election is a tribute to his years of service to  the profession of optometry in Kentucky and  throughout the nation. I join his family, friends  and colleagues in congratulating him on this  achievement and wishing him the best of luck  in this endeavor.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

298,House,111,0.498,2,2010-06-24,Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado.," Madam  Speaker, the majority has now finally  admitted what we have suspected for  months: They have no intention of fulfilling their obligation to draft and  pass a Federal budget.  This fiscal irresponsibility on display  in Washington  is affecting American  citizens, and it is further damaging our  economy and job growth. It is widely  known  and,  thankfully, widely  reported that the reason we won’t be seeing a budget this year is to evade calling further attention to an addiction to  reckless spending.  The Federal debt has gone up by  nearly $2.4 trillion since January of  2009 and by $240 billion just since the  budget was due back in April of this  year. Undoubtedly and correctly, Democrat leaders fear that the public will  be shocked at this figure, and will be  shocked at the future debt that a budget would show.  So they seek to hide behind a 1-year  ‘‘deeming motion,’’  but  the  consequences of their shame shows a lack  of fiscal discipline and a lack of responsible economic policy. America needs a  reasonable, pro-growth economic policy to promote job growth and business  development.  f  JOBS  (Mr. BACA asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)

It provides prompt and honest disclosure of political  spending by  those  seeking to influence our elections.  A total of six hearings were held in  the House and Senate, with more than  36  expert witnesses  testifying. Concerned citizens have been vocal about  the potential consequences of the Citizens United decision, sending nearly  2,500 emails and making roughly 4,500  phone calls in 1 week to the Committee  on House Administration, urging Congress to quickly consider  legislation  that addresses the loopholes created by  the Citizens United ruling.

300,House,111,-0.429,37,2010-06-24,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Chairman, the  purpose of this bill, as I understand it,  is for transparency and for people to  understand what’s happening out there  as people spend lots of money—other  people’s money, very often—to advocate for or against candidates. In the  case of unions, unions are very transparent in who they’re supporting and  who they’re not supporting when they  decide to take that kind of action.  Union members pay voluntarily with  their dues money, and the unions disclose who they are and who they’re  supporting.  People who  invest  in corporations,  presumably for the purpose of investing money and  furthering America’s  economic and their own economic interest, have a right to know how those  corporations are spending their money  that they thought was being invested  for the purpose of capitalism and free  enterprise rather than to be diverted  into anybody’s personal political agendas. Unions do that because their members vote; corporations do not. And I  would have no idea of a corporation  that I may invest in, whether they’re  spending my initial investment money  to work against my interests or even  your interests—or for them, for that  matter. This is just to let people know.  The  second point,  the amendment  that I offer covers every organization  that is covered under the bill equally.  I yield back the balance of my time.  b1400  The CHAIR. The question is on the  amendment offered by the gentleman  from New York (Mr. ACKERMAN).  The amendment was agreed to.

303,House,111,0.661,65,2010-06-24,Mr. ROYCE.," I thank the gentlelady  for yielding.  And  in  response  to  the  previous  speaker, I will remind my colleagues  that sanctions did work in South Africa, and that South Africa gave up its  atomic weapons program.  The threat, my  friends,  in Iran  is  crystal clear, and its regime closes in  on a nuclear weapon. So a crystal clear  response by us is urgent.  While I support this bill, much of this  legislation, unfortunately, is a muddle.  Good sanctions, good sanctions in this  bill are weakened by delays and by the  possibility of waiver after waiver.  b1800  For this, the Obama administration  gets the main blame. From the beginning, it has insisted on excessive leeway to  implement new sanctions. It  doesn’t want to be forced into dramatic  action. So, yes, we do provide the tools  with this bill. They’re in there. But  there  is  little guarantee that those  tools will be used.  For example, the House-passed bill  aimed to target Iran’s energy sector.  Yet with this conference report, a foreign oil company assisting Iran’s petroleum sector could avoid even the investigation required to sanction it for at  least 1 year. And the many companies  from  China  and  elsewhere  rapidly  building Iran’s energy facilities today  will be surely exempted  from these  sanctions.  This  report’s  aggressive  financial  sanctions rightly aim at Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps. While important,  they too can be waived. The so-called  ‘‘mandatory  financial  sanctions’’  aren’t  even mandatory. This  report  does require a barrage of reports, certifications and other executive branch  paper. Meanwhile, in the real world,  Iran marches on.  I would be less critical if the Obama  administration, or if previous administrations, had applied a single sanction  using existing Iran sanctions legislation. Instead, the Obama administration has naively given Iran time with  its ‘‘engagement policy.’’  I’ll be supporting this bill because it  does give the administration the tools  should it wish to use those tools. More  likely, it will have to be pressured into  action.  Mr. Speaker, even robust sanctions  might not deter  Iran  from nuclear  weapons. We need to give the intelligence  community what  it  needs,  strengthen our missile defense, target  Iran’s human rights abusers, and bolster  its  opposition movement. The  clock is ticking.

320,Senate,111,0.382,100,2010-06-24,Mr. HATCH.," Madam President, next  week  the Judiciary Committee will  hold its hearing on the nomination of  Elena Kagan to replace Supreme Court  Justice John Paul Stevens. The Senate’s role of advice and consent, especially for Supreme Court Justices, is  one of our most important constitutional duties. I wish to share a few  thoughts about how I will approach  this task.  America’s Founders designed the judiciary to be, as Alexander Hamilton  described it, the weakest and least dangerous branch of government. Things  have not worked out as planned. The  judiciary today is, instead, the most  powerful,  and  potentially  the most  dangerous, branch of our government.  Rather than being accountable to the  people by being subject to the people’s  Constitution,  activist  judges  often  make the people accountable to them  by seeking to control the people’s Constitution. My objective  in this confirmation process is to find out which  kind of Justice Ms. Kagan would be if  confirmed to the Supreme Court.  Judicial qualifications fall into two  categories: legal experience and judicial philosophy. Legal experience is a  summary of what a nominee has done  in the past and can be described in a resume or on a questionnaire. Judicial  philosophy describes how a nominee  will approach the task of judging in the  future. It is harder to determine, but I  believe it is much more important.  Let me  first  look at Ms. Kagan’s  legal experience. I have never believed  that  judicial experience  is necessary  for Supreme Court service or, to put it  another way, I have never believed it  to be a disqualification if you do not  have judicial experience. In fact, 39 Supreme  Court  Justices—about  one-  third—had no previous judicial experience. What they did have, however, was  extensive  experience  in  the  actual  practice of  law, an average of more  than 20 years. These are Justices such  as George Sutherland, one of my predecessors as Senator  from Utah, who  practiced for 23 years, or Robert Jackson, who practiced  for 21 years and  served as both Solicitor General and  Attorney General. In other words, Supreme Court Justices have had experience behind the bench as a judge, before the bench as a lawyer, or both.  Ms. Kagan has neither. She spent  only 2 years as a new associate in a  large law firm. She never litigated a  case or argued before any appellate  court before becoming Solicitor General last year.  And her work in the Clinton administration was  focused  on  policy  and  legistation. As the Washington Post  described it recently, Ms. Kagan would  bring to the Court experience ‘‘in the  political  circus  that  often  defines  Washington.’’ Some people may see little difference between the legal and the  political, but I do and am concerned  about blurring the lines even further.  Last week, one of my Democratic  colleagues with whom I serve on the  Judiciary Committee talked about Ms.  Kagan’s  qualifications  and  claimed  that some Senators question her fitness for the Supreme Court solely because she has never been a judge. No  one has made  that argument. This  Democratic colleague  identified Justices Byron White, William Rehnquist,  Louis Brandeis, and Lewis Powell as  among those with no prior judicial experience. These Justices had practiced,  respectively, for 14, 16, 37, and 39 years  and Justice Powell had also been president of the American Bar Association.  There really is no comparison.  So on this first element of legal experience, we have to be honest about  what the record shows. Unlike other  Supreme Court nominees, Ms. Kagan  has no  judicial  experience and virtually no  legal practice  experience.  That leaves her academic and political  experience. The Democratic Senator I  mentioned  identified  as  among Ms.  Kagan’s  strongest  qualifications  for  the  Supreme  Court  her  experience  crafting policy and her ability to build  consensus. Judges, however, are not  supposed to be crafting policy, and consensus-building only begs the question  of what a consensus is being built to  support.  This relatively light record of legal  experience only places more  importance on judicial philosophy, the other  qualification  for  judicial  service.  Frankly, finding reliable clues about  judicial philosophy is often harder in  an academic and political record such  as Ms. Kagan’s  than  in  a  judicial  record. This is especially true when,  like Ms. Kagan, a nominee has rarely  written directly about the topic. This  does not mean that reliable clues do  not exist, just that they are harder to  find. I have to take Ms. Kagan’s record  as it is because I have to base my decision on evidence, not blind faith.  Judicial  philosophy  refers  to  the  process of  interpreting and applying  the law to decide cases. That is what  judges do, but they can do it in radically different ways. Notice I said this  is about the process of deciding cases,  not the results of those cases. Many  people, including some of my Senate  colleagues and many  in  the media,  focus only on the results that judges  reach, apparently believing that the  political  ends  justify  the  judicial  means.  That is the wrong standard for evaluating either judicial decisions or judicial nominees. Politics can  focus on  the results, but the law must focus on  the process of reaching those results.  Rather than the desirable ends justifying  the means,  the proper means  must legitimate the ends. It makes no  difference which side wins, which political  interest comes out on  top, or  whether the result can be labeled liberal or conservative. If the judge correctly interprets and applies the law in  a particular case, then the result is  correct.  So I wish to pin down, as best I can,  what kind of Justice Ms. Kagan would  be. Will the Constitution control her or  will she try to control the Constitution? Will she care more about the judicial process or the political results?  As I said, those clues come primarily  from her record, secondarily from next  week’s hearing. So let me briefly focus  on a few areas of Ms. Kagan’s record  and mention some questions that need  to be answered and some concerns that  need to be addressed.  First, while in graduate school, Ms.  Kagan wrote that the Supreme Court  may overturn previous decisions  ‘‘on  the ground that new times and circumstances demand a different interpretation of the Constitution.’’ Not a  different application, mind you, but a  different  interpretation.  She  wrote  quite candidly  that  it  is  ‘‘not necessarily wrong or invalid’’ for judges to  ‘‘mold and steer the law in order to  promote  certain  ethical  values  and  achieve certain social ends.’’  In a 1995  law  journal article, she  agreed that in most cases that come  before the Supreme Court, the judge’s  own experience and values become the  most important element in the decision. In her words, ‘‘many of the votes  a Supreme Court Justice casts have little to do with technical legal ability  and much to do with conceptions of  value.’’ That sounds a lot like President Obama, who said as a Senator  that judges decide cases based on their  own deepest values, core concerns, the  depth and breadth of their empathy,  and what is in their heart. If that is too  results oriented, Ms. Kagan wrote, so  be it.  While Ms. Kagan has not herself been  a judge, those judges she has singled  out  for particular praise have  this  same activist judicial philosophy. In a  tribute she wrote for her mentor Justice Thurgood Marshall, for example,  she described his judicial philosophy as  driven by the belief that the role of the  courts and the very purpose of constitutional interpretation is to ‘‘safeguard the interests of people who had  no other champion. The Court existed  primarily to fulfill this mission. . . .  And however much some recent Justices have sniped at that vision, it remains a thing of glory.’’  In 2006, when she was dean of Harvard  Law School, Ms. Kagan praised as her  judicial hero Aharon Barak, who served  on the Supreme Court of  Israel  for  nearly 30 years. She called him ‘‘the  judge or justice in my lifetime whom I  think best represents and has best advanced the values of democracy and  human rights, of the rule of law, and of  justice.’’ That  is  not  simply  high  praise, but the highest praise possible,  for she said that Justice Barak was literally the very best  judge anywhere  during  her  entire  lifetime  in  representing and advancing the rule of  law.  Who is this judge who, for Ms. Kagan  at least, is literally the best representation of the rule of law? Judge Richard Posner has described Justice Barak  as ‘‘one of the most prominent of the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:29 Oct 09, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\S24JN0.REC S24JN0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010

322,Senate,111,0.434,114,2010-06-24,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President, I rise  today to speak in strong support of the  conference report to accompany the  Comprehensive  Iran  Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act.  I  want to thank my colleagues, Chairman DODD, and House Foreign Affairs  Chairman HOWARDBERMANand Ranking Member ILEANAROS-LEHTINEN for  working  cooperatively  to  complete  work on this conference report.  There is general agreement that the  existing Iran Sanctions Act has not  worked either in practice or in its intent to stop Iran’s nuclear program or  its support of terror. Iran, today, is a  more dangerous rogue state than ever  before.  Though not a silver bullet, the Comprehensive  Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act  is undoubtedly one of the toughest sanctions measures that Congress has produced and promises to be more effective than current law.  The act continues to prohibit investments of $20 million in Iran’s energy  sector, but now we have closed an earlier investment loophole that allowed  for sales of petroleum-related goods,  services, and technology to Iran.  The act also broadens the categories  of transactions that trigger sanctions  to include sales to Iran of refined petroleum products and prohibits any assistance to Iran to either increase or  maintain its domestic refining capacity.  In addition to the existing menu of  six  sanctions, we  have  established  three new  sanctions on  foreign  exchange, access to the U.S. banking system,  and  against  property  transactions. Under current law, the President must choose two from a menu of  six sanctions. He now must impose at  least three of the nine sanctions.  Despite dozens of credible reports of  investment violations over successive  administrations,  there has been but  one Presidential determination of a  violation made 12 years ago. In that  particular  instance,  the  President  waived the imposition of sanctions.

324,Senate,111,0.509,149,2010-06-24,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President, today I  offer tribute to a true leader and advocate for the rights of women and children in my home State of Idaho who  deserve protection from abusive relationships. Sue Fellen has been executive director for the Idaho Coalition  Against Sexual and Domestic Violence  for more than a decade. She  is announcing a well-deserved retirement at  the end of this month. Her work on behalf of Idaho women, children and family protection is one well worth noting  by all Americans who cherish family  and personal security and freedom.  Sue Fellen’s track record of service  on behalf of Idahoans will remain long  after she leaves active service. While  she has headed the state’s largest advocacy program to stop violence for 16  years now, she has been working nearly  twice that long in other capacities to  stop  domestic  violence  and  protect  families, women and children across  Idaho.  Sue Fellen began her career to stop  domestic violence in the trenches. She  was a shelter manager and director for  the Women and Children’s Association  from 1982 through 1993. When she went  on to head the Idaho Coalition, she  built a statewide network of more than  80 organizations, including law enforcement, prosecutors, health  care providers, victim advocates, victim witness  coordinators,  universities,  and  other professionals dedicated to preventing domestic violence and assisting victims of violence.  She is a trailblazer for Federal legislation protecting women. I know because I worked directly with Sue to  pass the  first-ever Federal  law that  recognizes the rights of dating partners  in abusive  relationships and offered  them Federal assistance for the first  time. We were able to shepherd that  groundbreaking legislation through the  Congress and saw it signed into law in  2004.  ‘‘Cassie’s Law’’ was named  for  Cassie Dehl of  Idaho, who died  following an abusive dating relationship.  Sue Fellen, as a leader of the effort to  stop abusive  relationships  in  Idaho,  was also a member of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. In her  role  in  Idaho  and  nationally, Sue  helped get the word out that this Idaho  legislation should become a national  model  and  I  am  proud  to  have  partnered with her in these efforts.  Sue and I worked with a large group  of Idahoans and found the funding and  commitment to the first one-stop response center for response, treatment  and prosecution in domestic violence  and sexual assault cases in Idaho. I am  proud to say that the FACES Center—  for Family Advocacy Center and Education Services—has now been open  nearly 5 years.  Sue Fellen and I have worked together on many other Federal issues.  Congress has a penchant to want to  spend money and on many occasions,  leaders in both political parties have  seen fit to borrow from the Victims of  Crime Act, or VOCA. This fund is replenished  by  those who  perpetrate  crime and is intended as an ongoing  fund to benefit the victims of crime  and family members who need assistance. By working with advocates like  Sue Fellen and my colleagues here in  the Senate such as the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, my friend PATRICKLEAHYof Vermont, we have been  able to keep that VOCA funding intact,  and away  from being spent on programs for which that money was never  intended.  I have been proud to partner with  Sue and the National Network with  other  Senate  colleagues  as  we  strengthened  the  Violence  Against  Women Act, provided  improved DNA  and rape assistance kits to speed the  conviction of assault cases and worked  with private partners such as the Liz  Claiborne Foundation to broaden the  audience for the critical message that  domestic and sexual violence should  not be tolerated. Not by Congress. Not  by men. Not by anyone.  Surveys show that, out of the teenagers questioned, more than half, 62  percent, know someone who has been  in an abusive relationship with their  boyfriend. Two in five know someone  who has been put down or called stupid, many of them through the social  media on their computers and texts on  their phones.  One in five between the ages of 13 and  14 know of friends and peers who have  been hit, kicked, slapped or punched in  anger. These statistics should alarm all  of us. I have often said men should not  stand by and observe any domestic violence.  Thankfully, there are people who do  not just stand by. They jump in. They  dedicate their lives to improving the  safety of women, children and families.  They are people like Sue Fellen and I  am glad to call Sue my friend and colleague in this effort.  Thank you, Sue. You and your husband Sherm, and even your dog Belle,  can look forward to a most well-deserved retirement.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO JACOB COSTELLO  ∑",2010

326,,111,0.332,177,2010-06-24,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today to pay tribute to the late Will Baker  of Hyden, Kentucky, a storied man who lived  102 years and was beloved by his community.  Will Baker loved his country and dedicated  a lifetime of service to his community, to civic  responsibility and honoring fellow military veterans. He was likely the oldest living election  officer in Kentucky, dedicating more than 25  years to the electoral process late in his life,  even past his 100th birthday. However, he  started his service as a young man, proudly  serving during World War  II,  in  the United  States Army. Following his service, he became an active member of the Leslie County  D.A.V. Chapter 133 and  took great pride  in  honoring fallen soldiers. Outside of his military  service, Will Baker was a handy man. He  spent many years as a carpenter, coal miner  and business owner  in Leslie County. Will  shared his heart of gold with everyone he encountered, earning him the respect and love of  hundreds of families across the region.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me in honoring Will Baker for dedicating a lifetime of service to the families of Eastern Kentucky, our Commonwealth and our great Nation.  f  HONORING  RON  GETTELFINGER  FOR HIS LEADERSHIP OF THE  UAW  SPEECHOF  HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 23, 2010  Ms. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ of California. Mr.  Speaker, I rise today for a man who dedicated  his entire life to rising up for hardworking men  and women in this country.  Ron Gettelfinger, known  to many as  ‘‘the  chaplain’’ for his drink-free, smoke-free habits,  started out as a chassis line repairman at a  Ford factory in Indiana. He would later succeed  in  leading automotive employees  for 8  years as president of the United Auto Workers  union.  Mr. Gettelfinger spent a significant amount  of his presidency guiding over 500,000 men  and women through a period of disheartening  job cuts, plant closures, and  financial hardship.  And yet, he never relented in his fight for  others. He never quit standing up for the people and the principles he believed in.  As one of 12 siblings from a small farming  town, President Gettelfinger has always had a  way of bringing people together in solidarity. I  have no doubt that he will, for the rest of his  life, greet his union members as ‘‘brother’’ and  ‘‘sister.’’  He found dignity in all work and refused to  accept the notion, much in fashion these days,  that working men and women don’t deserve a  middle class wage that allows them to own a  home, provide  for  their  families, send  their  children  to college, and afford quality health  care.  His  make-no-apology  approach  saved  countless jobs and even the viability of some  businesses. To his core, he believes  in respect  for  the working men and women of  America.  As President Gettelfinger begins  the next  stage of his life, we should all pay heed to a  motto he lived by: Every job we save is an important job—that is what we are all about.  It is an ideal we should all be about. He is  a man to whom we should all give our gratitude.  I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring  Ron Gettelfinger for his commendable service  to others and leadership in the face of adversity.  f  RAE LANIEL  HON.

Rae  Laniel is an 8th grader at Drake Middle School  and received  this award because her determination and hard work have allowed her to  overcome adversities.

It is essential students at all levels strive  to make the most of their education and develop a work ethic which will guide them for  the rest of their lives.

328,,111,-0.44,184,2010-06-24,Ms. SUTTON.," Mr. Speaker, thank you, Representative DINGELLand thank you for organizing  this special order hour  to honor Ron  Gettelfinger.  I rise today to honor Ron Gettelfinger as he  retires from the United Auto Workers where he  has served for the last eight years as President.  Thank you President Gettelfinger  for your  service—not only to your membership but to  our Nation.  You have made a difference and you have  made our Nation a stronger and a better  place.  Your efforts have strengthened the middle  class.  In 1964, Ron Gettelfinger became a member of UAW Local 862.  He worked as a chassis line repairman and  was elected by the workers at Ford’s Louisville  Assembly plant to represent them.  agreement  for Korean  Ron served as Director of UAW Region 3,  which includes Indiana and Kentucky . . .  Ron exemplified what it means to be a leader.  Through his leadership, the UAW has navigated the difficult waters of the financial collapse in 2008 and the current recession.  And as unfair trade deals have devastated  U.S. manufacturing  jobs, Ron Gettelfinger  stood strong in the fight for a new approach to  trade.  Fair trade that works with our workers and  businesses, not against them.  Ron Gettelfinger has called  for  fair  trade  agreements  that  include workers’ rights and  environmental provisions.  And Ron Gettelfinger has called for the so-  called Free Trade Agreement with South  Korea to be renegotiated.  This  Bush-negotiated  trade  would allow unfair advantages  automakers to persist.  In 2009, our trade deficit with South Korea  in autos was $7.8 billion.  Korean automakers control 95 percent of  their domestic auto market.  And Ron Gettelfinger led the charge for reciprocity of market access, calling on Korea to  open their market.  Ron knows, as we know, that our workers  are the very best in the world and can compete on a level-playing field.  Ron negotiated deals  for working  families  and our trade representative must also negotiate good deals with our working families in  mind.  Because of Ron’s  leadership during his  eight years as President and his service  to  UAW members since 1964, I am proud to represent 8,700 active and retired UAW members  in my Congressional District.  In Ohio, we have at  least 111,000 active  and retired UAW members.  Thank you again Ron for your outstanding  service  to  the UAW,  to American manufacturing, and to our Nation.  f  SUPPORTING THE REFUGEES AT  CAMP ASHRAF  HON. WM.

329,,111,-0.514,191,2010-06-24,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  join my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives  to  recognize  Juneteenth  Independence Day which we observe with Resolution 546, sponsored by Rep. DANNYDAVISof  Illinois. The House of Representatives notes  the  importance of effectively understanding  our past as  the  foundation of a progressive  and egalitarian future.  We remember June 19, 1865, ‘‘Juneteenth,’’  as the day of the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in the last of the States  in the Union. Though President Abraham Lincoln intended the Emancipation Proclamation  to go into effect on January 1, 1863, slaves in  the last of the slaveholding territories, namely  Texas, did not hear of  their  freedom until  1865. Galveston, Texas is recognized as the  birthplace of Juneteenth and as of this March,  36 states have recognized the day for observance. Now, 145 years  later, we  remember  Juneteenth as a turning point in the history of  Black Americans.  This celebration of freedom and equality is  an important patriotic symbol in the history of  the Nation. Juneteenth is an opportunity for us  to pause and remember the difficult road to  advancement and to reflect on the importance  of  that political organizing  in Galveston by  former slaves to celebrate their freedom and  new status. Juneteenth is one of the earliest  landmarks of the active political involvement of  Black Americans following the sacrifices made  by the more than 200,000 people who fought  and died in the Civil War.  We are also reminded of the many achievements  and  contributions Black Americans  have made  to  the country  in all  fields. We  highlight the work done by civil rights leaders  and activists who have carried on  the spirit  and legacy of emancipation. In particular, we  salute those men and women serving in our  armed forces, who could not serve today without  the rights afforded  them by  the work of  previous generations of Black Americans who  fought  in every conflict since  the Nation’s  founding. Culturally, we must  recognize  the  magnanimous  impact of Black artists, performers and academics in shaping American  identity well beyond the 21st century.  While Juneteenth started in Texas, its impact and  importance  to  the United States’  commitment to independence and liberty is felt  nationwide. Freedom is at the core of the legacy of the United States and of all its citizens,  regardless of race or personal background. I  am proud to celebrate and recognize the significance of Juneteenth today and forever in  our Nation’s history.  f  HONORING STAFF SERGEANT  BRYAN HOOVER  HON. KATHLEEN A.

330,,111,-0.178,191,2010-06-24,Mrs. DAHLKEMPER.," Madam Speaker, it is  with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor  the life of a fallen hero from Western Pennsylvania.  Staff  Sergeant  Bryan  Hoover  of  Lyndora, Pennsylvania was only 29 years old  when he made the ultimate sacrifice defending  our nation in Afghanistan.  On June 11th, a suicide bomber detonated  an explosive near the Bullard Bazaar in Zabul  Province in southern Afghanistan where Staff  Sergeant Hoover and his fellow soldier, Sergeant First Class Robert Fike, also of Western  Pennsylvania, were on foot patrol. Both these  brave men were killed in the explosion. They  were members of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard’s Company C,  1st Battalion,  110th Infantry, based in Connellsville.  Staff  Sergeant  Hoover  was  passionate  about his service to his country, and dreamt of  joining the military even as a child. He enlisted  in the Army National Guard in 2005 and previously served in the Marines. Bryan served a  total of  four  tours overseas,  two  in Afghanistan, one in Iraq and one in Kuwait. He truly  lived to serve our nation.  To his fellow soldiers, he was one of them,  but to the students of Elizabeth Forward High  School  in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania, he was  known as Coach Hoover. Bryan was the assistant cross country and track coach at his  alma mater, where he graduated  in 2000.  Bryan loved sports, and was a talented athlete  himself who particularly enjoyed hockey. He  earned a degree in sports management from  California University of Pennsylvania.  For his brave service and sacrifice, Staff  Sergeant Bryan Hoover was awarded the Purple Heart.  Bryan is survived by his father, Melvin Hoover; his brothers, Richard and Ben; his sister,  Samantha; his grandfather, Ray Bradford; his  stepmother, Elaina Evans, and his  fiance´,  Ashley Tack. His mother, Debra Jean, preceded Bryan in death.  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Staff  Sergeant Bryan Hoover in the RECORDof the  United States House of Representatives  for  service, sacrifice, commitment to his country  and to our freedom.  While we struggle  to express our sorrow  over this loss, we can take pride in the example Bryan set as a soldier. Today and always,  he will be remembered by family and friends  as a true American hero, and we cherish the  legacy of his service and his life.  As I search for words to do justice to this  valiant fallen soldier, I recall President Abraham Lincoln’s words as he addressed  the  families of soldiers who died at Gettysburg:  We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,  we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men,  living and dead, who struggled here, have  consecrated it, far above our poor power to  add or detract. The world will little note nor  long remember what we say here, but it can  never forget what they did here.  May God grant strength and peace to those  who mourn, and may God be with all of you,  as I know He is with Bryan.  f  MRS. LUCILLE ROCHS’ 95TH  BIRTHDAY  HON. K.

331,House,111,-0.294,2,2010-07-01,Mr. HEINRICH.," Last night, I hosted a  telephone town hall with thousands of  New Mexicans to discuss what we’ve  been doing to reform Wall Street and  to protect and empower consumers in  the marketplace. During the town hall,  several constituents contacted my office for help with their own financial  problems  like unfair spikes  in their  credit card  interest rates. Just  like  these callers, all New Mexicans have  been negatively impacted by the years  without accountability for Wall Street  banks and big corporations that caused  the financial hardship that we’re dealing with today.  Our working families and our small  businesses deserve better. That’s why I  was proud to vote for the Wall Street  Reform and Consumer Protection Act  yesterday. This legislation will rein in  the Wall Street banks and their big bonuses and put an end to taxpayer bailouts and the idea of ‘‘too big to fail.’’  I’m hopeful the Senate will quickly  pass this bill so that Wall Street banks  will again be held accountable. Hardworking New Mexicans deserve no less.  f  MAIN STREET ON THE HOOK FOR  MANHATTAN’S WALL STREET  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

332,House,111,-0.056,2,2010-07-01,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. Speaker, I am  troubled by recent press reports suggesting that the Justice Department  has decided to sue to block Arizona’s  new immigration law, SB 1070. I believe  this is the wrong direction to go. I believe the administration’s time and efforts would be much better spent securing the border and fixing our broken  immigration  system.  If  there’s  one  message that Washington should receive from the enactment of SB 1070, it  is that Arizonans are fed up with waiting for the Federal Government to address this vitally important issue.  A lawsuit won’t solve the problem. It  won’t secure the border and it won’t fix  our broken immigration system. Neither will boycotts, which are shortsighted and detrimental to our economic recovery. The only thing that  protracted  litigation will do  is once  again demonstrate to Arizonans that  Washington just doesn’t get it. It will  embolden those on all sides who prefer  to  grandstand  and  score  political  points, instead of working toward real  solutions.  Arizonans  are  tired  of  grandstanding and tired of waiting for  real help from Washington.  f  KYRGYZSTAN CONSTITUTIONAL  REFERENDUM  (Mr. PITTS asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

334,House,111,0.264,44,2010-07-01,Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, I stand  in opposition to this rule and in sincere  but deep opposition to this $63 billion  massive spending bill, and particularly  the war spending component of the bill.  I speak, I believe, on the behalf of the  hundreds of thousands of brave men  and women who serve America in the  Middle East with neither a defined objective nor the ability to assess victory  or defeat; and on behalf of families of  our military  personnel  around  the  world who have lost their fathers or  their mothers or their sons or their  daughters in a valiant but shortsighted  effort and battle that can never be  won; and on behalf of the American  taxpayers who have seen more than $1  trillion poured into an attempt to fight  terror, where there is not even a remote relationship to the welfare of the  American people; and really, also, on  behalf of the  innocent children who  have had the misfortune to simply be  in the ever-changing line of fire and  the vicinity of terrorists who move effortlessly  from  Iraq  to Somalia  to  Yemen  to Paraguay  to Afghanistan  like the Whack-a-Mole at the county  fair in the form of unconventional and  ill-defined  tribal warfare  that  2,000  years have taught us we simply cannot  fight.  I think it was November of 1952, when  I was about 6 years old, that Charles  Schultz and his Peanuts comic strip  came out with the annual saga where,  every year, Charlie Brown comes up to  the  football, and Lucy tells Charlie  Brown year after year, ‘‘Just one more  time we’ll let you kick ball.’’ And each  year, she pulled the football out, only  to find Charlie Brown on his rear end.  I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker  and Members of the House,  in this  somewhat stretched analogy, that a series of Commanders-in-Chief are Lucy,  and we’re Charlie Brown, and the football is the illusive promise of a goal  that we simply cannot reach. We cannot force a culture to accept our values, and we cannot impose Western democracy on a people who don’t understand or accept it and whose leadership  is corrupt and antidemocratic beyond  repair. And we  cannot  continue  to  spend the billions and, arguably, trillions of dollars of the hardworking men  and women in this country in a venture  that has no objective, no end game, and  no proximate connection to the well-  being of our Nation.  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, we cannot afford  economically, we cannot afford militarily, and we cannot afford as a people  to pass this bill. This President who,  frankly, won an election based on his  strong antiwar message, like many of  his predecessors, asked us one more  time to spend a few more billion dollars—in  this case  $38 billion—a  few  thousand more men and women in an  effort to kick the  football  just one  more time. It simply isn’t doable.  I suggest to you, Mr. Speaker and  Members of the House, that this rule  underlies a bill that the vast majority,  I believe, of the American people don’t  want. I represent a district in central  Illinois, and I think I speak in many  ways for middle America. I voted for  the authorization of force in Iraq and,  frankly, Afghanistan; and  I believe,  like many of us, I may have questioned  my vote. But I believe that we’re the  greatest nation on Earth, thanks  in  large part to the generations of fighting men and women who have given  their lives to this great cause and democracy and this great Nation of ours.  As we prepare to celebrate our independence in a few days, I think I speak  on behalf of the average American citizen who says, For what? What is this  money being expended for? Why are we  doing it? And what’s the end game?  And I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, that  there is no end game, and I would respectfully ask that this rule and the  underlying bill be defeated.  ",2010

The  subcommittee approved  it back  in May  after the President requested it.  The members of the Appropriations  Committee have not had an opportunity to vote on a Defense supplemental appropriations bill. The Members of the House have not had an opportunity to vote on a Defense appropriations  supplemental  bill. There’s  something wrong with that.  Chairman DICKS did a good job. He  worked with us, as did Chairman Murtha before him, and it was a good bipartisan effort. We’re not only not  going to vote on that good bill, but  we’re not even going to have a chance  to vote on the Senate version of the  bill that’s not quite as good as the  House version, but  it’s better  than  nothing. And it’s time that we provide  the funding for our troops in the field,  deployed and exposed  to danger,  so  that they’re provided with what they  need.  I have a problem with this. I said the  subcommittee approved the bill back  in May. The full committee has not  considered it. As a matter of fact, we  are rapidly approaching the 1-year anniversary of the last time the Appropriations Committee met to consider  an appropriations bill. Now, that’s unusual. It seems to me like it flies in the  face of the Constitution, because Article I, section 9 makes it very clear that  the executive branch of government  cannot spend money from the General  Treasury that has not first been appropriated by Congress. And if the Appropriations Committee doesn’t meet to  approve the bills or to report the bills  to the House, how are we going to meet  that constitutional responsibility? It’s  pretty tough.  July 22 last year was the last time  the Appropriations Committee met to  consider an appropriations bill. So I  compliment Chairman DICKS for creating a good bipartisan product that  the President of the United States supported, and I am just disappointed that  we’re not going to have a chance to  vote on it. Our troops in the field need  to know that we are supporting them  with whatever it is that they need to  carry out their mission.  I am opposed to all of these amendments that we are considering because  none of them do anything to support  our troops in the field, which is what  this bill is supposed to be all about.  These amendments are not good, and  it’s just a real shame that we are not  considering the needs of our troops who  are deployed, to provide what it is that  they need in order to accomplish the  mission that we sent them to accomplish and to protect themselves while  they’re doing it.  Mr. Speaker, typically, I would use my time  talking on a Supplemental as  the Ranking  Member of the Defense Subcommittee to congratulate Chairman DICKSon a fine bi-partisan  package that he and his staff put together. I  would thank him for treating us fairly and listening to the minority’s concerns, and suggest  that we pass the bill as quickly as possible.  Regrettably, I cannot do that today because  the bill before us is the product of such an  abuse of power and process  that we aren’t  even voting on Chairman DICKS’ bill.  Instead, we  find ourselves voting on  the  Senate defense supplemental in the hope of  getting  the Department of Defense  the desperately needed  funds  for on-going Afghanistan operations before they run out.  And I must say that really upsets me. While  this is our best chance of getting badly needed funds to the Department, Chairman DICKS  and his staff had produced a very fine, truly bi-  partisan supplemental bill . . . one that in my  opinion was much better than this Senate bill.  But because of his leadership, that bill never  saw the light of day. Not because it was controversial, or contained something bad, but because procedurally a small group of Members  couldn’t  find a way  to get unrelated, extraneous domestic spending items attached to it.  So instead today, maybe it is in my best interest for me to use this time making a case  for my old spot on the Armed Services Committee.  That may seem odd, but I can only wonder  how much  longer  the Appropriations Committee will exist . . . if it still does.  I do thank Mr. DICKS for his courtesy and  cooperation. I only regret that his leadership  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:45 Jul 02, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K01JY7.144 H01JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2010

Dan’s Papers was first published on July 1,  1960, by Dan Rattiner, who was at the time a  junior at the University of Rochester. Dan’s impetus for creating Dan’s Papers stemmed from  a desire  to create a  fun,  light-hearted, and  welcoming publication for tourists visiting Suffolk County, New York.  Gathering a devoted  following, Dan’s Papers was instrumental during a 1967 protest to  prevent the U.S. Coast Guard from allowing  the historic Montauk Point Lighthouse to fall  victim  to  the eroding cliffs on which  it  is  perched. Through  the efforts organized by  Dan’s Papers, not only was  the  lighthouse  saved, but  the community was united  in a  common cause.  Dan worked individually for the first six summers of Dan’s Papers, writing, editing, and  crafting his newspaper to entertain residents  and  tourists alike. As populations grew and  the demographics of the South Fork began to  shift, so too did the scope of Dan’s Papers,  providing articles, editorials, and updates on  the visitors and inhabitants of the East End.  Madam Speaker, Dan’s Papers has played  an  important role  in helping  to promote  the  iconic culture of Long Island’s South Fork and  has personified the American spirit of creativity  and community for five decades. I am proud to  congratulate Dan’s Papers on its 50th anniversary and join eastern Long Island in wishing  the publication success in the future.  f  RECOGNIZING  THE  CONTRIBUTIONS OF JUDGE DAVID TOBIN  HON.

339,,111,-0.321,205,2010-07-01,Mr. WILSON of Ohio.," Madam Speaker,  today I rise to recognize the judicial and civic  contributions  of  Judge David  Tobin.  This  month, Columbiana County is losing a great  public servant. Judge Tobin devoted  twenty-  five years of his life to serving on Columbiana  County Court of Common Pleas, the second  longest tenure of any judge on the Court. His  time spent on the bench and prior decade of  service as a Columbiana County Prosecuting  Attorney  greatly  benefited  the  citizens  of  Columbiana County.  During his service, he had  the honor of  serving on  the Ohio State Bar Association’s  Board of Character and Fitness as a Commissioner. He also worked hard to bring the Supreme Court of Ohio to the Columbiana County Courthouse to host a court session. These  are just a few of the examples that illustrate  the professional respect for Judge Tobin exhibited from Lisbon to Columbus.  He was also greatly respected  throughout  the  community.  From  community  service  through the Calcutta Rotary, to his work with  the Calcutta Community Park Committee,  to  his various coaching positions, Judge Tobin  exhibited a strong commitment to his community.  The people of Columbiana County have  been blessed by  the  long service of Judge  Tobin, and upon his retirement this July, he  will be sorely missed.  I ask my colleagues  today to join with me in honoring Judge Tobin,  a respected judge and public servant who has  been and will always be dedicated to the people of Columbiana County.  f  UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD  MAINTAIN FREEDOM OF MEDIA  HON.

340,,111,-0.292,205,2010-07-01,Mr. MOLLOHAN.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to draw your attention to a troubling situation occurring in Ukraine. Less than 100 days  ago, President Victor Yanukovich assumed  leadership of the Ukrainian government. During this short period of time, there have been  alarming reports that many of the democratic  achievements of the 2004 Orange Revolution  are being rolled back—including the freedoms  of speech and media.  Some of the reported actions occurring include the Ukrainian Security Service’s, SBU,  agents approaching university deans to warn  them against  their students’ participation  in  pro-opposition rallies, as well as instances of  the new government  intimidating  journalists.  Furthermore, two TV channels with a history  of  independent  coverage—Channel  5  and  TVi—are under threat of imminent closure due  to reported pressure from executive bodies, including SBU.  These  troubling  instances  of  pressure  against Ukraine’s beleaguered opposition and  independent media outlets are arguably part of  a disturbing, coordinated effort by the executive to squelch a healthy political debate and  assure an uncritical coverage of the government’s policies. In fact, these reports are so  widespread  that  the United States Ambassador to Ukraine, John Tefft, even recently expressed his concerns about  the  increasingly  difficult  climate  for Ukraine’s  independent  media and stressed that ‘‘it is essential to protect and even expand the media freedoms that  emerged’’ after  the country’s 2004 Orange  Revolution.  I understand that Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton will visit Kiev, Ukraine on July 2, as  part of her five-day, five-nation tour of Eastern  Europe. I would encourage Secretary Clinton  to  raise  these  issues  with  President  Yanukovich and  reiterate  the  importance of  not returning to Ukraine’s old system of government pressure on  journalists and media  companies.  I am  including a copy of an article  titled,  ‘‘Ukraine  channels  cry  foul as  frequencies  pulled’’ that appeared in the June 8 issue of  The Financial Times, Europe. As such, I urge  my colleagues to follow and engage in this vitally important issue.  [From the Financial Times, June 8, 2010]  UKRAINECHANNELSCRYFOULAS  FREQUENCIESPULLED  (By Roman Olearchyk in Kiev)  Two Ukrainian television channels cried  foul on Tuesday after a high court pulled  crucial broadcasting frequencies away from  them, sparking media freedom activists to  reiterate concerns of an organized attempt  to block objective news coverage.  The development follows weeks of growing  complaints by journalists about the resurgence of censorship and heightens fears that  a Kremlin-styled crackdown on media freedoms could be in the works five months into  the  presidency  of  the Moscow-friendly  Viktor Yanukovich.  Management and journalists from channels  5 and TVi pledged to appeal against the controversial ruling and hope to remain on the  air in the near term. But during a press conference held after Tuesday’s regional administrative court ruling, they openly expressed  fears that media freedoms and democratic  gains made by Ukraine since 2004 could be at  risk under Mr. Yanukovich. He is accused by  oppositionists of setting up an authoritarian  regime.  ‘‘We lived through 2004,’’ said Channel 5 director Ivan Adamchuk, recalling attempts  by authorities to muzzle the channel ahead  of  the pro-democracy Orange Revolution,  which  overturned  a  fraud-marred  presidential vote for Mr. Yanukovich. ‘‘We could  not imagine that those times would return,  but they have,’’ he added.  Oleh Rybachuk, a former presidential administration chief turned civic activist, said  ‘‘censorship is re-emerging, and the opposition is not getting so much coverage. There  are similarities to what [Vladimir] Putin did  when he came to power. We are seeing Putin-  style attempts to monopolise power.’’  With Mr. Yanukovich’s coalition having  swiftly consolidated control over the nation’s  legislative,  executive  and  judicial  branches of power, the channels could face  an uphill battle if he opposes their survival.  Mr. Yanukovich’s administration on Tuesday repeated denials of cracking down on  free press. But media watchdogs warned that  if stripped of the frequencies, the two channels—seen  by media watchdogs  as  rare  sources  of  reports  critical  of  Mr.  Yanukovich’s coalition—would be blacked  out from much of the country.  Such a scenario would preserve the strong  grip over Ukraine’s television airwaves held  by Mr. Yanukovich’s billionaire business  backers.  One of them is Valery Khoroshkovsky, currently head of Kyiv’s SBU spy agency and  owner of UA Inter Media Group, the nation’s  largest television holding. The latter filed  the court appeal asking for the frequencies  to be pulled on grounds  that  they were  wrongfully issued in January.  Both 5 and TVi have repeatedly accused  Mr. Khoroshkovsky of abusing his power and  influence to preserve his monopoly control  over Ukraine’s media airwaves and limit objective news reporting.  Mr. Khoroshkovsky denies wrongdoing and  insists his wife manages his media empire as  he dedicates his time to public service.  But on Tuesday, Mykola Knyazytsky, director of TVi, which was set up by exiled  Russian  businessmen,  blamed  Mr.  Khoroshkovsky for the crack down on the  two channels and described his simultaneous  role as a presidential backer,  intelligence  chief and media mogul as a ‘‘huge and blatant conflict of interest.’’  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:35 Nov 06, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD10\RECFILES\E01JY0.REC E01JY0 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2010

Soon thereafter, Mr. Simmons faithfully and  patriotically served his country by joining the  United States Army’s 82nd Airborne Division.  He attained the rank of sergeant before being  honorably discharged in 1979.  Mr. Simmons was blessed with a  loving  family who took pleasure in every aspect of  his life and his interests. I offer my heartfelt  condolences to the Simmons family.  Madam Speaker,  I ask you and all  the  members of this esteemed legislative body to  join me  in recognizing  the extraordinary  life  and accomplishments of Mr. Matthew Leonard  Simmons, Jr. He will be missed by all who  knew him, and I appreciate this opportunity to  pay  tribute  to him before  the United States  House of Representatives.

The  purpose of the Park Ridge Fine Arts Society is  to provide a musical showcase and the means  for enjoyment of serious music  through  free  community concerts, and  to engage  in such  activities and programs that will foster all of  the  fine arts. The concerts draw crowds of  1,500 to 3,500 people, with a season total of  more than 30,000 concertgoers.  These concerts are a wonderful way not  only to bring beautiful, professional music to  the community, but also to bring neighbors together and build a sense of community. Summer in Park Ridge is enriched by these wonderful weekly concerts in Hodges Park.  Frank York established the Park Ridge Fine  Arts Symphony Orchestra and the Park Ridge  Fine Arts Society 50 years ago and remained  at the helm of the organization, driven by his  vision of excellence, until 2005. Throughout  the organization’s history,  it has maintained  the highest artistic standards. The Park Ridge  Fine Arts Symphony Orchestra  is produced  and coordinated by the Park Ridge Fine Arts  Society to perform the summer concerts. It is  a fully professional orchestra, made up of superb musicians from throughout the Chicago  area, devoted to bringing the excitement and  beauty of great classical music to the northwest suburbs.  I want to recognize the great work of the  people who make sure that the concerts are of  the highest quality and are available  to  the  community each summer: Barbara Schubert,  musical director and conductor; Emily Toy  Kosaka, president; Daniel Aranda, vice president; Dennis Van Mieghem, treasurer; Dawn  Himley-Grandi, secretary; and the board of directors: Ken Boyce, Pam Boyce, Kevin P.

343,,111,-0.296,212,2010-07-01,Mr. RUPPERSBERGER.," Madam Speaker, I  rise before you today to honor the life of Captain E. Lorenzo DiCasagrande, a shipping executive who helped transform Baltimore into a  nationally recognized container port and thus  contributed  to  the economic vitality of Maryland communities.  Captain DiCasagrande, who passed away  May 21, 2010, was vice president of the Mediterranean Shipping Company for more than 20  years and was an early advocate of the Port  of Baltimore. Within one year of  joining  the  company, he had established weekly service  for the line from East Coast ports, including  Baltimore’s South Locust Point Marine Terminal, which had previously been served by  one ship once every two weeks. The company  brought 8,000 containers each year  to  the  South Locust Point shipping berth.  Captain DiCasagrande then paved the way  for the success of the Seagirt Marine Terminal  in 1990 by being  the  first container  line  to  commit to the then-new terminal. Today, the  company is committed to 150,000 containers a  year and is still growing, with five ship calls  every week to the Seagirt terminal. In fact, the  Mediterranean Shipping Company  is Baltimore’s top container customer.  Earlier  this  year, Captain DiCasagrande  celebrated with Maryland port officials as they  broke ground on a new 50-foot berth for the  Port, a long-time vision for him. The project  will support 5,700 jobs and, when completed,  accommodate  larger ships and attract more  cargo to Baltimore. It will help Baltimore maintain  its current customers and attract new  ones that will come aboard the larger ships of  the future.  A native of  Italy, Captain DiCasagrande  adopted Baltimore as his second home, fiercely defending the city in business negotiations.  He worked hard to win customers and built a  strong  relationship with  the port community,  elected  officials  and  his  employees. His  friends and business associates alike described him as a great leader, well-respected  and well-liked. He was also a dedicated husband, father and grandfather.  Madam Speaker,  I ask  that you  join me  today to honor the life of Captain Lorenzo E.  DiCasagrande. His dedication as a tireless advocate for the Port of Baltimore is deserving of  the utmost gratitude. He deserves credit  for  helping bring more cargo to Baltimore’s piers  and creating thousands of jobs for Maryland  families.

345,,111,0.449,219,2010-07-01,Mr. TIAHRT.," Mr. Speaker, this legislation is  long overdue. For years, there have been inconsistencies in the manner in which manufacturers pay their taxes. Under current law,  firearm and ammunition manufacturers pay excise taxes into the fund on a bi-weekly basis.  All other manufacturers pay on a quarterly  basis. This legislation will change this inconsistency and bring a little commonsense into  our crazy tax system.  I am pleased  to be a cosponsor of H.R.  510, to amend the Internal Revenue Code to  require that the payment of the manufacturers’  excise tax on recreational equipment be paid  quarterly. The frequency of tax payments for  the firearm and ammunition manufacturers is a  burden on the industry. In fact, some manufacturers are forced to secure short-term loans  to pay their taxes, thus incurring additional expenses and adding to administrative overhead.  The end result is that money is diverted away  from core business areas to finance tax payments.  Through this legislation, firearm and ammunition manufacturers will now be able to reinvest more funds into researching and developing new products, purchasing new manufacturing machinery, and  increasing marketing  and outreach to the hunting and sport shooting community. The  federal government will  get their taxes, on a quarterly basis as it does  from every other manufacturer, so no revenue  will be lost.  I urge my colleagues  to support  arms Excise Tax Improvement Act.  the FireRECOGNIZING THE SALTER FAMILY AS THE  2010 SANTA ROSA  COUNTY  OUTSTANDING  FARM  FAMILY OF THE YEAR  HON.

Alice’s public service career began  when she was appointed as the deputy  superintendent of schools in Campbell  County. She served on the town board,  school board, and  later took on the  roles as Campbell County’s clerk of  courts and registrar of deeds.  She was convinced by a group of  teenagers that she counseled to run for  political office at the State level. The  first governmental office Alice held  was as State Auditor for three 2-year  terms followed by two 4-year terms as  Secretary of State. She was appointed  by Governor Mickelson to the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs  which allowed her to travel the state  teaching children about the history of  South Dakota. The last political office  Alice held was her 1990 election as a  State representative which she served  for two 2-year terms.

348,Senate,111,-0.194,27,2010-07-12,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. President, we are now on the 84th day of the  Deepwater Horizon spill. Along with  the over 175 million gallons of oil and  natural gas that have gushed into the  gulf,  over  1  million  gallons  of  dispersants have been applied, with  700,000 gallons applied under the surface of the water. This is a method of  using dispersants that has been likened  to a science experiment.  With each passing day, we see new  images of oil washing up on the shores,  onto our beaches, into the wetlands,  coating the wildlife. We have all seen it  on television, and it is heartbreaking.  But  I worry more about  something  else, something we do not see. For 2  months now, academics, the media, and  the public have asked about the possibility of vast amounts of oil miles  away from the location of the spill.  Independent scientists from research  institutions in my State, such as the  University of South Florida and Florida State University, took to the water  early on. They sent their own research  vessels out there to find the answers.  What they found confirmed the fears  we have—what we do not see, and that  is detectable amounts of oil and hydrocarbons impacting areas away from the  spill. These hydrocarbons may not look  like what we imagined. We imagined  ominous black clouds. But,  in  fact,  what scientists pulled up from different  depths  in their water samples often  came up clear, but just because you  can’t see the oil doesn’t mean it is not  there and it doesn’t mean it is not having an impact.  A few weeks ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  released its first report on subsea oil.  Our top ocean science agency has been  working to understand the impacts of  subsurface hydrocarbons. While there  is now some publicly available information on subsurface oil, many unanswered questions remain. Is the subsurface oil down there, and especially  that which you can’t see? Is it there  because of the use of dispersants? Does  the large amount of pressure caused by  the weight of the water column at such  depths—as  far as 5,000  feet—lead to  these plumes of oil being subsurface?  What is the effect of having oil and gas  throughout the water column as opposed to the oil floating on the surface?  I believe it took so long to get any  information because this is something  we simply have not seen before. The  last time this country dealt with a  spill even near this magnitude was the  Exxon Valdez spill. But that was a  tanker that leaked in a bay where all  the oil was in the upper layers of the  water column. The oil basically stayed  afloat. Here, we have a situation where  the oil is being released 5,000 feet below  the surface of the gulf.  It  is being  sprayed with  dispersants,  and  that  keeps much of it down in that fragile  environment and away from view. But,  of course, the many organisms that  live down at those depths are the base  of the food web, and the impact of the  dissolved and dispersed hydrocarbons  on these critters is simply unknown.  We haven’t even begun to deal with  the question of the natural gas that is  also spewing out of the well. Some  have estimated that as much as half of  the volume coming out of the well is  actually natural gas. Some of that is  very probably dissolving, and it is possible that most of it is dissolving. But  who knows how these chemicals are  interacting with it? If any of the natural gas is bubbling to the surface, it  could pose a threat to the health and  the safety of wildlife, and it could pose  a health hazard to humans on the surface of the gulf.  As a result of all of this and so that  we  learn  from this situation so we  don’t keep doing this same thing over  and over, I am introducing the Subsea  Hydrocarbon  Imagery  and Planning  Act. This bill will address  some of  these gaps in our knowledge and understanding of what happens when oil and  natural gas are  released under  the  ocean.  This bill will direct NOAA to review  its current protocols for detecting and  mapping subsea hydrocarbons. It would  require them to develop priorities and  to adopt a plan for the future by implementing a program within the Office of  Response and Restoration dedicated to  mapping subsea hydrocarbons and releasing what  their  trajectories  are.  State and local governments and the  American people should have access to  this information so they can plan accordingly. NOAA itself needs this information for incorporation into its protocols for closing and opening fisheries.  And the people in charge of managing  this crisis need this  information so  they  can make  informed  decisions  about how to proceed.  We are in the midst, as we know, of  hurricane season. While we have not  seen this subsea oil with our eyes yet,  a hurricane could make that worst-  case scenario a reality.  Last week, during the recess, I spent  some time with some of Florida’s best  and brightest scientists who are studying this spill.  I spoke with researchers from Florida  Gulf Coast University, Mote Marine  Laboratory, and the University of Miami’s Center for Southeastern Tropical  Advanced Remote Sensing. These institutions might have the technology and  expertise that could be used to detect  and monitor subsea oil and gas and  measure its impact on fragile marine  environments.  As we look to the future and as we  are getting NOAA to adopt a plan, that  is a plan we need. This legislation—the  Subsea Hydrocarbon Imagery and Planning Act—will ensure that days in the  future we will not wonder how much  oil and gas is out there, where it is,  where it is going, and what its impacts  will be because we will know.  I hope my colleagues in the Senate  are going to support this effort. Clearly, with what is going on, this well  needs to be killed. There are 60,000 barrels of oil a day gushing into the gulf,  and this has been going on now closing  in on 3 months.  Until the time the well is killed, they  will continue to try to siphon off as  much as possible, and that is the process they are doing now. They took off  that one cap. All of that oil is gushing.  They are going to try to put on another  cap that will have a tighter seal that  they can get more to the surface.  In the meantime, all that oil on the  surface—we  have  the  skimmers—we  need to skim off and keep  it  from  reaching the shore. If it gets on the  beach, that is one thing. We can get it  off the beach. It harms all of the industries. It harms tourism. Clearly, the  perception that there is oil harms fishing. But the real ecological damage is  when it gets past the beach and it gets  into the bays, the estuaries, and the  marsh grasses. Then it is so difficult to  get out and it all the more compounds  the impact on the critters.  No. 1, kill the well. No. 2, scoop as  much as we can get off the surface to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:17 Jul 13, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A12JY6.023 S12JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2010
349,House,111,0.409,4,2010-07-19,Mr. GUTHRIE.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of  H. Con. Res. 126, recognizing the 50th  anniversary of title VI  international  education programs within the Department of Education.  Title VI was originally authorized as  title VI of the National Defense Act in  1958 in response to the launch of Sputnik and the U.S. Government’s recognition that a stronger and broader capacity in foreign language and area studies was needed to create a body of experts competent in foreign languages  and cultures who could serve the government, especially our defense and intelligence agencies and  the Foreign  Service.  Three programs that were included in  the original 1958 legislation continue  today as the National Resource Centers  program, the Foreign Language and  Area Studies Fellowship program, and  the International Research and Studies  program. These programs support language area centers  for expansion of  postsecondary instruction in languages  that are less commonly taught, as well  as  foreign  language  fellowships,  research  supporting  language  learning  methodology, and language institutes  to  provide  advanced  language  and  training.  Over time, additional programs have  been added to title VI in order to address the Nation’s growing interest in  international education. Title VI programs also help to address business  needs  for  international  expertise,  strengthening  undergraduate  education, international as well as area  studies,  advancement  of  technology  use, and overall improvement of foreign language training and assessment.  Today, as intended by the program’s  creators, title VI programs help to provide for our national defense by ensuring a Federal investment in ensuring a  supply of citizens with  international  expertise. Title VI programs help to  support American experts in, and citizens’ knowledge about, world regions,  foreign  languages, and  international  affairs, as well as those with a strong  research base in these areas.  Madam Speaker,  I  urge my  leagues to support this resolution.  ",2010
350,House,111,0.402,18,2010-07-19,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Madam Speaker, for  nearly 36 years, the people of Cyprus  have endured an illegal occupation and  massive violations of human rights and  fundamental freedoms by Turkey after  it invaded a sovereign nation 36 years  ago tomorrow. It breaks my heart to  hear the stories of how the occupied  north has been devastated, how the  Turkish  occupiers  have  converted  chapels in Kyrenia into bars and tourist information centers; how once beautiful churches have been converted into  mosques; how the U.N. peacekeepers on  the island have watched for 36 years as  the Turkish Army has laid land mines  and can only sit and note what’s being  done—a peacekeeping force operating  with no mandate to stop the lawlessness.  It breaks my heart that families forcibly removed from their homes had all  of their personal and real property stolen  from  them. More heartbreaking  than anything else are  the persons  missing  since  1974, Madam Speaker,  whose  families  still grieve knowing  they will never be at peace until their  sons, brothers, husbands, and fathers  are accounted  for and whose bones  must be laid to rest.  Yet the Turkish Government still refuses to cooperate. To us, their actions  aren’t acceptable. That is why we will  continue to fight and persist in our efforts to reunify Cyprus and make the  island  whole  again  and  heal  the  wounds. A solution to the Cyprus problem has come from the Cypriots themselves and must serve first and foremost the interests of the Cypriots.  The key to a successful outcome of  the negotiating process and reunification of the island remains in Ankara,  since a solution to the Cyprus problem  cannot be reached without Turkey’s  full and constructive cooperation. Turkey must give the new Turkish Cypriot  leader the freedom to negotiate a solution. Turkey must start with the removal of its occupation troops and illegal settlers from Cyprus.  The role of the U.N. and the international community is to provide assistance and support the process. The  process should not be subjected to false  time  frames.

351,,111,-0.187,67,2010-07-19,Mr. COSTA.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to Armando an Betty Rodriguez of  Fresno, California, as they celebrate their 60th  Wedding Anniversary.  Over the course of their journey of the past  60  years, Armando and Betty have demonstrated a loving devotion and enduring partnership that continues to make their marriage  a true inspiration for others.  Armando and Betty Rodriguez were both  born and  raised  in Fresno, California, and  were traditional high school sweethearts, having eyes only for each other. They attended  Edison High School and graduated  in 1947.  Three short years later, they were married and  in 1952, Armando joined the United States Air  Force, serving our Great Country  for  four  years, including a tour of duty in Korea, where  he served as a Morse Code operator.  After being discharged, Armando and Betty  resided  in Fresno, while he completed his  studies at Fresno State. Always true partners,  when Armando decided  to pursue his Juris  Doctorate degree, Betty supported both of  them by working in a number of part-time jobs.  Armando became an attorney and,  in 1972,  went on to become the first Hispanic elected  to  the Fresno County Board of Supervisors.  With Betty’s unwavering  support, Armando  helped open the judicial doors for many other  Latinos when he was appointed by then Governor Jerry Brown as a Fresno County Superior Court Judge in 1975. Armando would go  on to serve in his judicial capacity for twenty  years.  Armando Rodriguez is known to be proud of  the many ‘‘firsts’’ in his life—his first marriage  in  its 60th year;  first  lawyer  to work  for  the  California Rural Legal Assistance; first in his  family  to graduate  from college; and one of  the first to be elected as an adviser with el  Instituto de los Mexicanos en el Exterior during Mexico President Vicente Fox’s administration.  Betty Rodriguez has been equally active in  their beloved Fresno community by helping to  found  the  League  of Mexican  American  Women, and participating in the Ladies Aid to  Retarded Citizens, the League of Women Voters,  the Mexican-American Political Association, Friends of  the Library, and countless  other organizations. Despite her  seemingly  endless commitments to the community, Betty  has also been and remains, a devoted caretaker of the Rodriguez home throughout their  60 years of marriage.  Armando and Betty have become known as  local Latino icons and continue to have a tremendous impact on their families, friends and  fellow  community  members.  Furthermore,  each has been a recipient of La Medalla Ohtli,  the highest recognition that the Mexican government bestows on non-Mexican citizens and  both were honored  for  their work with  the  Mexican Consulate, with Fresno’s Sister City  Torreon and with youth from Mexico.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me today in congratulating Armando and Betty  Rodriguez on celebrating  their 60th year of  marriage, and expressing our hope that they  are blessed with many more joyous years together.  RECOGNITION OF AUGUSTA L.  BEVERLY  HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 19, 2010  ",2010
352,,111,-0.402,67,2010-07-19,Mr. PALLONE.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in recognition of Augusta L. Beverly, a citizen  of Neptune Township, New Jersey, who on  July 25, 2010 will celebrate her 100th birthday.  As her Representative, I would like to honor  her remarkable life and her upcoming birthday.  ‘‘Gussie Louise,’’ as Mrs. Beverly is affectionately known, has been an influential member of Neptune Township since 1982. She is  an active member of the Neptune Senior Center where  she participates  in  the Forever  Young Club,  the Neptune Seniors Club, ceramics classes, and many special events. Mrs.  Beverly is one of the original members of the  center and helped create many of the center’s  activities and groups.  Mrs. Beverly was born  in 1910  in Jersey  City, New Jersey  to Otto and Katy Ludwig.  She was taken from her parents in 1915 and  separated from her two sisters, Ann and Barbara. An orphan by the age of six, Augusta  had a difficult early life. She worked on a farm  in Locktown and  then served as a maid  in  Matawan and had  little opportunity  for education. After six challenging years, young Augusta was  taken  in by  the Bennett  family  where she served as a companion for the elderly Mrs. Bennett. The family allowed young  Augusta to go to school and travel with them.  Augusta stayed with the Bennett family for 10  years.  In 1932, Mrs. Beverly met her future husband, Joseph Beverly, on the bridge next to  the Old Grist Mill in Tinton Falls. After their  marriage,  the  couple  eventually  settled  in  Eatontown where they had three children—Joseph, Norman, and Virginia. Mr. and Mrs. Beverly were happily married  for 12 years until  1945 when Mr. Beverly lost his life fighting at  the Battle of the Bulge. During the war, Mrs.  Beverly epitomized  ‘‘Rosie  the Riveter’’ and  worked  at  the Steiner’s Factory  in  Long  Branch and then worked the night shift for the  Bendix Corporation. She remains very proud  of this part of her life. After residing in Florida  and  then Pennsylvania, Mrs. Beverly moved  back to New Jersey in 1981 where she could  be near her children and grandchildren. She  has made a lasting impression on all of their  lives and now has nine great-grandchildren  who  love her very much. She  is an adored  family member and  is an  inspiration  to her  community. It is wonderful that Mrs. Beverly  will be celebrating her 100th birthday at the  place that means the most to her, the Neptune  Senior Center.  Madam Speaker, please join me in leading  this body in acknowledging the extraordinary  longevity of Augusta Beverly. She is a highly  valued citizen of the state of New Jersey, and  I am honored to commemorate her life today.

Mr. Chairman,  in  this manager’s  amendment, there’s a provision that is  very important to the folks in the district I represent in northwest Florida.  Ladies and gentlemen, our local economy has been significantly impacted  by the BP oil spill. Many of our people  are out of work as a result of this man-  made disaster that they had no hand in  creating. Fortunately, we have been  successful  in setting up the BP Oil  Spill  Victims  Compensation  Fund  which will help speed relief to the victims of this tragedy and help respond  to one of  the gulf coast’s greatest  needs.  This amendment that is being offered  by Chairman RAHALLwill ensure that  gulf residents will have the right of  first refusal for the job opportunities  processing the claims filed for the oil  spill.  b1500  It emphasizes the importance of gulf  residents serving their neighbors by  processing these claims and ensuring  that they receive the consideration for  the ramifications of this spill.  I have already spoken with Mr. Ken  Feinberg, the administrator of the BP  Deepwater  Horizon  Victims  Fund,  about  employing  local  residents  to  process claims, and he agrees with me  that there is no one better suited to  perform this essential task. In fact, I  told him that in north Florida we have  a ready and willing workforce ready to  go. These workers, who unfortunately  are  looking  for work as a result of  their corporations’ closing their facility, have the skill and the talent that  directly align with the skills needed to  process oil spill claims. They should be  considered first in line to beef up the  newly established claims fund and ensure a high quality response for fellow  gulf coast residents.  I recommend a  ‘‘yes’’ vote on the  chairman’s manager’s amendment.  ",2010

This bill takes lessons learned and  will turn them into laws. That’s what  we need to do. Included in this bill is a  provision which is going to collect $53  billion  from the oil  industry, where  they are drilling in American waters  without paying any royalties to the  American people. And in this bill we  reclaim those $53 billion from the oil  companies, and we will reduce the Federal deficit by $53 billion. That’s in this  bill. And it is going to be the dues  which the oil companies should be paying to the American people for using  American waters.  At $80 a barrel, for the American people to be subsidizing Big Oil to drill, it  would be like subsidizing a fish to swim  or a bird to fly, to subsidize the oil industry to drill for oil at $80 a barrel.  You just don’t have to do it.  So with this bill we cut the deficit  and we stop Big Oil from cutting corners on safety. This is BP’s spill, but it  is America’s ocean. That’s what this  bill is all about. That’s what this vote  is on today. Are we going to reclaim  the oceans of America so that they are  not polluted, so that BP and the oil  companies pay the royalties that they  owe to our people and not avoid them,  that we reduce the Federal deficit and  we make sure that we never again see  a day where the American people for  100 days have to watch oil flow into our  oceans?

Nashville’s music  industry has a dazzled  history of women pioneers. Mother Maybelle  Carter created the Carter scratch. Kitty Wells  was the first female artist to have her own LP.  Patsy Cline paved the way for women to sell  records as well as men. And Loretta Lynn was  the first woman in country music to have 50  Top 10 hits. Paving the way for Dolly Parton’s  songwriting strengths, Tammy Wynette’s sultry  vocals, and Reba McEntire’s awarded success, the women on whose shoulders today’s  stars stand are a present part of Nashville’s  legacy.  The call of women to the varying notes of  the music industry is just as strong today as  when Sarah  ‘‘Minnie Pearl’’ Cannon  first  graced the Grand Old Opry in 1942. Women  have come a long way in the music business,  and Nashville continues to celebrate their success  in paving  the way  for  tomorrow’s high  notes. Founded  in 1991, Source began  the  work to unify women executives and professionals that work and succeed in all facets of  Nashville’s music industry.

Though these beachside communities were  founded in the late 19th century, it wasn’t until  1960 that residents banded together to save  the peninsula  from being sold out  to developers. On November 17 of  that year,  the  Breezy Point Cooperative was organized and  a  few months  later purchased  the  land  that  currently comprises Breezy Point. Members of  the community sometimes refer to it as ‘‘Cois  Farraige’’, Gaelic for ‘‘By the Sea.’’  The Cooperative fought tirelessly with and  alongside the federal government and the National Park Service  to preserve  the breathtaking and resplendent scenes of nature that  surrounded  the area, and  the Gateway National Recreation area was developed around  Breezy Point, where Gateway continues to be  one of the greatest treasures Queens County  has to offer.  There are several civic groups  in Breezy  that also deserve recognition at  the  time of  this anniversary. The Roxbury People’s Association, headed by Katherine Sebale, the Point  Breeze Association, headed by Christopher  Stokes, and the Rockaway Point Association,  headed by Tom MacLellan, are all organizations that work tirelessly to better their community and strengthen the heart and soul of  Breezy Point.  The story of the Breezy Point Cooperative is  a story of a community  that  relies on  the  strength of  its  leaders and citizens, and  I  would like to memorialize this great milestone  of 50  years of  service and dedication  to  bettering the community and its neighbors.

JIM COOPER  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 30, 2010  ",2010
364,,111,-0.161,143,2010-07-30,Mr. COOPER.," Madam Speaker,  to a boy  from Louisiana, the building blocks of life are  food,  faith, and a healthy dose of Southern  hospitality. Joseph Hamilton, grew up to learn  that our world is not so simple.  By January 2010 Hamilton had played a  crucial  role  in an astounding discovery. He  helped find something that no one knew existed. His work was critical in forming a multinational research team, and carrying out the  discovery of Element 117—Ununseptium—the  newest addition to the Periodic Table of Elements.  Hamilton’s life started like that of any southern boy. Born in the humble town of Ferriday,  Louisiana, he stayed  true  to his Baptist upbringing. He attended Christian Mississippi  College, where God’s calling led him to be a  physicist. Hamilton then took his studies to Indiana University, where he studied nuclear  physics and  the elements. Their  tiny atoms  and their nuclei are invisible except to a select  group of scientists with very advanced equipment. For everyone outside  this elite group,  the existence of atoms and  their nuclei  is  purely a matter of faith. The only way to observe individual atoms of elements is through  their impact on the world.  A skeptic may say  that Christianity and  physics, the two most important parts of Hamilton’s  life, cannot coexist, but Hamilton disagrees. He has pursued his passion without  abandoning his beliefs, and has found that the  two go gracefully hand in hand. As a professor  at Vanderbilt University  in Nashville, Tennessee, he and his wife have coauthored  more than twenty papers on the harmony of  physics and religion.  Professor Hamilton has dedicated himself to  the growth of his students. Recognizing that  they will soon  take his place  in  research,  Hamilton has supervised over 60 PhD dissertations and over 100 post-doctoral fellows  at Vanderbilt. He includes his students in almost everything he does. One of his few regrets in his storied career is that he did not intimately involve his students in the discovery  of Element 117.  Hamilton’s  research  career at Vanderbilt  over  the  last  fifty-two years has  taken him  around the world. Russia, China, Sweden, and  Germany have been but a few stops on his  journeys. The  creation of Element 117  in  Dubna, Russia, just north of Moscow, was the  result of a multinational project that Hamilton  helped create. He believes that scientific discovery is a global effort, not a local one. Collaboration  is key because science  is one of  the  few  things  that unite us all  in peaceful  ways. Scientific principles apply around  the  world, regardless of race, creed, and nationality.  The first collaborative project that Hamilton  initiated, the University Isotope Separator, has  been a key operation at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory  for more  than  forty years.  This began as a collaboration of 11 Southeastern universities, ORNL and  the State of  Tennessee. Hamilton is also a founder of the  Joint Institute for Heavy Ion Research, a cooperation of Vanderbilt, the University of Tennessee, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  This Institute has become a world-class scientific  resource.  Moreover,  this  Institute  opened doors  that helped  transform ORNL  through the development of three major new  joint institutes.  By January 2010, Hamilton’s critical role in  a joint Russian-American project came to fruition in the creation of six atoms of Element  117. While this new radioactive element has a  half-life of only 78 milliseconds faster than the  blink of an eye—its discovery points towards a  fascinating possibility.  Its half-life  is  longer  than  that of other recently discovered super  heavy elements, and suggests that we may be  on the path towards finding new, more stable,  super heavy elements.  Hamilton and his coworkers’ discovery will  be forever emblazoned on the walls of chemistry and physics labs worldwide as the newest member of the Periodic Table of Elements.  Generations of scientists will discover Element  117’s properties, but no matter what is learned  about Element 117, this Southern gentleman  will always know that his work added to the  building blocks of our world.  f  CONGRATULATING  MAJOR  GENERAL ROBERT WILLIAMS ON HIS  RETIREMENT  HON.

366,,111,-0.579,150,2010-07-30,Mr. CAPUANO.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize the ‘‘100,000 Homes Campaign’’, an effort to address homelessness in  America by providing permanent shelter  for  100,000 homeless persons over the next three  years. In Boston, the Pine Street Inn, a nonprofit organization in my district that has been  fighting homelessness  for over 40 years,  is  acting as  the  lead  local agency  for  this national initiative. Rosanne Haggerty, President  and Founder of the New York based nonprofit  Common Ground, launched the campaign in  Washington, D.C. on July 12th at the Annual  Conference of  the National Alliance  to End  Homelessness. So  far 34 communities have  signed on to participate. In just the short time  since the campaign’s start, over 5,000 people  nationwide have received housing assistance.  The Pine Street Inn was founded in 1969  and provides low-cost permanent housing for  homeless  individuals. The organization also  assists over 10,000 homeless individuals annually by offering emergency shelter, food and  health care  related services. Mental health  and  substance abuse  counseling are also  available through the Pine Street Inn.  Too many Americans are struggling with  homelessness and this initiative will help reduce the ranks of the homeless throughout the  country. I commend the Pine Street Inn and  Common Ground for their tireless efforts and  their compassion. Their combined work and  the efforts of so many dedicated organizations  throughout  the country will help make  the  ‘‘100,000 Homes Campaign’’ a success.  f  WHERE ARE THE JOBS?  HON.

367,,111,0.703,150,2010-07-30,Mr. HENSARLING.," Madam Speaker,  the  American people want to know: where are the  jobs?  I do not understand why the Obama Administration and Congressional Democrats have  pursued jobs-killing policies such as a government take-over of health care, a national energy  tax, a  financial  regulatory bill  that enshrines us as a bailout nation; and are doing  nothing  to stop  the  largest  tax  increase  in  American history scheduled for the end of this  year. These policies have injected uncertainty  into the economy, causing nearly $2 trillion in  private capital to stay on the sidelines.  We just learned this morning that in the 2nd  quarter this year, GDP grew at 2.4%. While  this is better than no growth, it is down from  the 3.7% in the first quarter. This recovery defies conventional wisdom, which is the deeper  the recession, the stronger the recovery.  The Obama Administration and Washington  Democrats have declared  their stimulus bill  and other economic policies a success. However,  the American people have declared  them a failure.  f  RECOGNIZING  CLENET  INTERNATIONAL, LLC FOR RECEIVING  THE MINORITY GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY  FIRM  OF  THE  YEAR  AWARD  HON. PETER J.

368,,111,-0.182,150,2010-07-30,Mr. TANNER.," Madam Speaker,  from May  28–June 3, I led a House delegation to NATO  Parliamentary Assembly (NATO PA) meetings  in Riga, Latvia, and  to additional bilateral  meetings in Podgorica, Montenegro. The U.S.  delegation to the NATO PA had a highly successful trip during which we examined a range  of political, economic, and security issues currently confronting  the Alliance, as well as  NATO and U.S. policy in Montenegro and the  Western Balkans.  The NATO Parliamentary Assembly consists  of members of parliament from the 28 NATO  states, as well as members of parliament from  candidate state Macedonia (or Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM), and  other associated states such as Russia, Georgia, and Ukraine. I currently have the honor of  serving as President of the Assembly. In this  capacity, I preside over meetings during which  delegates discuss and debate a  range of  issues of  importance  to  the Alliance. During  the NATO PA’s two annual plenary sessions,  delegates also have the opportunity to listen to  presentations by specialists on NATO affairs  and to offer guidance to NATO leadership in  Brussels. An additional element of the meetings is the opportunity to meet and develop relationships with members of parliament who  play important foreign policy roles in their own  countries. These  responsibilities can  include  setting defense budgets and determining the  operational  restrictions placed on deployed  forces. Some  of  the  acquaintances made  through the NATO PA can last the duration of  a career, and are invaluable for gaining insight  into developments in allied states.  Discussions during the NATO PA’s annual  spring meeting focused on the key issues currently facing the Alliance. These include: the  drafting of a new Strategic Concept for NATO;  NATO’s ongoing stabilization mission  in Afghanistan; NATO’s  evolving  relations with  Russia; and the effects of the global economic  downturn on national security and allied commitments to NATO. More specific issues such  as  the Alliance’s nuclear weapons posture,  missile defense, and emerging security challenges such as piracy and cyber and energy  security were also discussed by the delegates.  At NATO’s 60th anniversary summit in April  2009,  the  leaders of NATO’s 28 member  states  tasked  the NATO Secretary General  with producing a new Strategic Concept  for  the Alliance. The  re-writing of  the Strategic  Concept, which was last updated in 1999, offers NATO a chance to lay out a clarified vision of its role in the 21st century security environment. Heads of state  from  the NATO  member states are expected to approve a new  Strategic Concept at  their November 2010  summit  in Lisbon.  In April 2010, NATO PA  representatives  presented NATO Secretary  General Anders Fogh Rasmussen with the Assembly’s recommendations for a new Strategic  Concept. There is broad agreement within the  NATO PA  that  the new Strategic Concept  should re-affirm NATO’s primary role as a military alliance devoted to ensuring the collective  defense and security of its members. In this  regard, Article 5 of NATO’s founding North Atlantic Treaty—which states that an attack on  one is an attack on all—remains NATO’s core  principle. Our delegation emphasized  that  in  the face of new and emerging security challenges,  the Alliance must also continue  to  broaden  the  traditional Cold War concept of  collective defense  to  include security  threats  such as terrorism, proliferation of weapons of  mass destruction, cyber-security, and energy  security. In this regard, territorial defense can  no longer be separated from ‘‘out-of-area’’ security concerns. Members of our delegation  also highlighted the importance of developing  and maintaining the capabilities necessary to  achieve NATO’s stated objectives.  The key issue facing the Alliance continues  to be NATO’s effort to bring security and stability  to Afghanistan.

370,,111,-0.469,164,2010-07-30,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  today  to express my support  for H.R.  5143, the National Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2010.  I want  to commend Representative DELAHUNT for his  leadership on  this legislation and dedication to our nation’s  criminal justice system.  H.R. 5143 establishes the National Criminal  Justice Commission and directs that commission to review all areas of the criminal justice  system,  including costs, practices, and policies. It also directs the commission to make  findings upon their review and recommendations  for changes  to prevent, deter, and reduce crime and violence, reduce recidivism,  improve cost-effectiveness, and ensure interests of justice at every step of the criminal justice system.  As an attorney and former judge, I can say  with confidence that I believe our criminal justice system is flawed. It is an expensive system that is in many ways ineffective. It is important  that  this commission be established  and put  to work  immediately. We can no  longer be satisfied with allowing crime to fester and spread  throughout  the nation, especially among our youth. Real solutions to deter  crime are possible if we only take the time to  invest in them. It’s time we identify the problems in our criminal justice system and make  tangible efforts to ameliorate the system.  In our efforts  to create  ‘‘a more perfect  union’’, we have to take a closer look at our  nation and work to make our nation better for  our children and  the generations  to  follow.  H.R. 5143 gives us an opportunity to do that.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support and pass H.R. 5143, the National Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2010.  f  HONORING THE CHILDREN’S  MUSEUM IN OAK LAWN  HON.

371,,111,-0.233,164,2010-07-30,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor the Children’s Museum in Oak Lawn,  as its staff and volunteers celebrate the first-  year anniversary of the Museum’s expansion  to a new building.  Since it was first established in 2003, the  Museum has become a well-known and much-  loved institution in my District. Drawing 10,000  visitors when it first opened its doors, the Museum attracted over 85,000 visitors from over  36 states in the first year at its new location.  The Museum gives children and their families  an  important place  for  fun and  relaxation,  while also actively immersing children in the  joyful world of  learning. The Museum’s staff  has taken care to align the exhibits with the Illinois Learning Standards required of schools.  As a result, over 150 schools have reached  out  to  the Museum  to enrich  their curricula  and take their students on field trips. At a time  when evidence increasingly demonstrates that  learning environments and enrichment activities in early childhood profoundly affect later  life outcomes, the importance of the Museum’s  work becomes increasingly clear.  From the Museum’s beginnings in a small  space of 900 square feet, it has grown into an  institution that stands as a pillar of Oak Lawn,  Illinois’ 3rd District, and beyond. I look forward  to continuing to work with the Museum’s staff,  volunteers, and supporters to strengthen the  Museum for many years to come. I ask you to  join me  in congratulating  the Children’s Museum in Oak Lawn on its work and the first-  year anniversary of its new facilities, as well  as to wish it many more years of success.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE MAKING  HOME AFFORDABLE ACTS OF 2010  HON. JOHN P. SARBANES  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 30, 2010  ",2010
372,,111,-0.468,164,2010-07-30,Mr. SARBANES.," Madam Speaker, I rise to  introduce  the Making Home Affordable  Improvements Act of 2010. For the last eighteen  months,  the Obama Administration has  tried  very hard  to make mortgage modifications  available  to struggling homeowners but  the  program has largely failed to have the impact  we had hoped.  Average homeowners around  the country  are paying  the price  for an  inflated housing  market and a bursting real estate bubble—this  is being felt acutely throughout Central Maryland. For every borrower who defaults, there  are many others on the brink of default who  are looking for a way forward.  And this isn’t a problem that will go away  quickly—an estimated 10 to 15 million Americans own homes that are worth less than they  owe on  their mortgages. These are homeowners with a strong financial incentive to default on their mortgages, irrespective of their  ability to pay.  In a market in which the values of homes  have fallen out of step with mortgage debt, I  strongly believe  that  the best  solution  for  homeowners is a structured bankruptcy process, including a judicial mortgage modification  or ‘‘cramdown.’’ This is the process by which  a bankruptcy  judge  reduces  the value of a  mortgage attached to a home, thereby reducing the monthly payment owed by the homeowner and allowing  families  to stay  in  their  homes.  This would be only available to homeowners  who elect  to  file bankruptcy, a  lengthy and  costly process with  long-term consequences  for individuals and their families—an avenue  of last resort for struggling homeowners, not a  new means for speculators to ‘‘game the system.’’ The House of Representatives passed  legislation  to provide bankruptcy  judges with  this authority, only to watch it die in the Senate. The political reality today is such that judicial mortgage modification may never become  an available option for struggling homeowners,  leading policy makers to search for an alternative.  Absent  judicial modification,  I believe  that  voluntary mortgage modification  holds  the  promise of a better way  forward  for homeowners, but, as it stands today, it has failed to  offer real relief to the millions of homeowners  who are in desperate need of assistance. This  can be attributed  to a widespread unwillingness by banks to do right by their borrowers—  the same borrowers who are acting against  their financial self-interest by continuing to pay  their mortgages each month.  The effort is also hampered, in part, by a  bureaucratic and unwieldy modification process—one that is often overwhelming and unmanageable for the average homeowner. But  working within  the voluntary mortgage modification structure created by the White House  as part of the Making Home Affordable Initiative, there are thousands of experts across the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:02 Aug 01, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A30JY8.078 E30JYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2010
373,,111,-0.319,171,2010-07-30,Mr. HALL of New York.," Madam Speaker, I  rise in support of H.R. 4899, although I have  strong reservations about the situation in Afghanistan.  I am glad  that President Obama has  remained committed to the draw-down of U.S.  forces  from  Iraq.  In August, another 20,000  American  troops will return home  from  Iraq,  leaving only 50,000 deployed  there. We are  on schedule to have all combat troops home  by the end of 2011. H.R. 4899 funds this process, providing supplies, ammunition, and fuel  for the ships and planes bringing our troops  home.  I am also supportive of the disaster aid included in this bill, which allows FEMA to help  communities  rebuild after  recent disastrous  weather events and gives aid to Haiti. Further,  the bill contains important funding for health  care for veterans suffering from diseases related  to Agent Orange,  including b-cell  leukemia, Parkinson’s, and  ischemic heart disease.  Regarding Afghanistan, I am still convinced  that the presence of the Taliban and al Qaeda  there and in Pakistan poses a serious threat  to U.S. and Global security. Our  troops are  needed to continue the fight against enemies  who have shown  themselves committed  to,  and capable of, killing American citizens here  and abroad.  However, after more than 10 years of war,  the situation in Afghanistan is still deeply concerning. A spate of bad news in recent months  has served to deepen public mistrust over the  previous administration’s conduct of the war,  and raises questions about how to move forward. We have reliable and repeated reports  that the Pakistani Intelligence Service, the ISI,  is collaborating with the Taliban, and that the  rampant corruption in the Afghani Government  of Hamid Karzai jeopardizes our mission and  the lives of our troops. It is time for the United  States to engage in a thoughtful, national conversation about the direction of this war.  Just last December, President Obama laid  out his plan to refocus the conflict in Afghanistan and clearly articulate what we are trying  to achieve and when we plan  to bring our  troops home to their families. Our commitment  to Afghanistan is not open-ended, a point that  must be reinforced to both the American and  Afghan people.  Although we must continually  re-examine  our involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan,  it is important to remember our goals in Afghanistan are still worthy. Our troops are denying the Taliban the profits of the drug trade,  promoting education for girls and women, providing power and clean water to villages lacking it, and working to build a functioning and  stable government.  Ultimately,  unless  we make  significant  progress fighting the insurgency it is hard to  envision the U.S. achieving these goals in any  lasting way. Our allies need to show similar  progress: The Karzai government must rein in  corruption and Pakistan must purge its intelligence service of Taliban supporters. Without  these developments,  I do not believe  it  is  worth additional sacrifice of American lives or  resources.  In summary, despite these strong reservations, I plan to support this bill. The President  announced his new strategy  for Afghanistan  only eight months ago, and General Petraeus  has been in command for only a month. It is  too early to pass judgment on their leadership,  especially given  the clear  failure of  the previous administration to pursue those who attacked us from Afghanistan while they diverted  military and other resources to Iraq. I would  strongly urge, however, that this be the last  supplemental used to fund these conflicts. It is  hard  to envision how a war  that has  lasted  more than 10 years can not be funded as part  of the normal defense appropriation process.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF MR.  ARDILL WRIGHT, JR.  HON. ADAM SMITH  OFWASHINGTON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 30, 2010  ",2010
374,House,111,0.513,6,2010-09-14,Mr. BOEHNER.," Madam Speaker, the events  of recent weeks have reminded us how central  the September 11th attacks remain to our national consciousness. The shock and grief we  felt that Tuesday still echo in our hearts, still  reverberate in our minds.  America stands tall as a beacon of freedom  and tolerance because her people have risen  to the occasion each time these values have  been tested. It is with that in mind that we turn  our thoughts today to the police, firefighters,  and  first  responders who  ran  into burning  buildings so others could get out. We renew  our awe for the passengers who dug in rather  than give up and charged the cockpit of Flight  93. We  remember how Americans  from all  walks donated blood, gathered at candlelight  vigils, and organized care packages for relief  workers. The  resilience  that propels us  forward as a people is drawn from the courage  of our heroes and the compassion of our citizens.  Each year on this day, we have the opportunity and the solemn responsibility to honor  the heroes and victims, and to keep faith with  their loved ones. Though these thoughts and  prayers, we can heal, and we can steel ourselves to repeat the words ‘never again’.  Over  the  last year, we have seen  in  the  most immediate way how terrorists still have  innocent Americans  in  their sights, starting  with a plot to blow up the New York City subway system, and continuing with the attacks at  Fort Hood, Times Square, and on board  Northwest Flight 253. Each of  these attacks  represented new strands of  terrorism, new  signs of an enemy ready and willing to adapt.  Now more than ever, as citizens and patriots,  we must remain vigilant in our efforts to confront and defeat  the  terrorist  threat. That  is  why we should also take a moment today to  salute the endurance, discipline, and valor of  our troops, who have volunteered to take the  fight to the enemy and keep the light of freedom burning bright.

For the television  networks, this marks a 10-point drop  from a decade ago.  Americans have good reason to be  skeptical of the media. A total of 17  journalists have left a national media  outlet to join either the Obama administration or another liberal organization, according to the Media Research  Center. It is no wonder that, by a margin of 3 to 1, Americans describe the  average reporter as more liberal than  they are rather than more conservative, according to a public opinion  poll.

They were  two of the more than 30 National Collegiate Athletic Association  national  championship  teams  invited  to  the  White House celebration by the President.

The Nittany  Lions were a perfect 38–0 for the second  consecutive season, and this was their  seventh Big Ten title in a row. The  Penn State fencers won their fifth national title in the last decade on March  28 and their second consecutive NCAA  championship.  These teams carried the mantle of  Penn State  from the court and the  strip to the White House, and I could  not be prouder of my alma mater and  its sensational teams.

Major Baldwin is a true testament to the remarkable and courageous service that our soldiers provide our nation.  Major Darren R. Baldwin grew up in Worthington, Ohio. After graduating  from high  school, Major Baldwin attended West Point  and dedicated his  life  to  the service of his  country. His first assignment was as a Field  Artillery Officer  to Giessen, Germany during  which he was sent into combat in Kosovo as  part of Task Force Falcon. Returning from his  deployment, Major Baldwin continued his military  training  in  the Special Forces Officer  Qualification School in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. His next tour of duty took him to Iraq in  support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Over the  next two years, he served three tours of duty.  Major Baldwin continues the tradition of excellence and service exhibited by the Green  Berets and other special service members.  Major Baldwin is not only a great soldier, but  also a great son, husband, brother, friend, and  community member. His heroic efforts to help  fight the war on terror have helped to keep his  country and community safe.  During his tour in Iraq on March 9 and 18,  2005, Major Baldwin was wounded by two improvised explosive devices, and suffered a  traumatic brain injury. Currently, Major Baldwin  is on medical convalescent  leave  receiving  physical and neurological  therapeutic  treatment. The service he performed for his country, at great personal cost, has been recognized with a Purple Heart, three Bronze Stars,  a Meritorious Service Medal, as well as being  commended by the Ohio Secretary of State.  Major Baldwin and other wounded soldiers  are our country’s greatest heroes. On September 11, 2010, the Green Beret Foundation  honored Major Darren R. Baldwin at Purple  Heart Commemorative Event  for his courageous service  in  Iraq.  In addition  to  recognizing Major Baldwin,  this  event  in Worthington, Ohio honored all of our dedicated  American soldiers and wounded warriors by  raising money for the Green Beret foundation.  I commend Major Baldwin on his courage,  bravery, and unwavering commitment  to his  country and I am proud to recognize him for  his service and patriotism.  f  HONORING RICHARD CORDELL  HON.

406,,111,-0.225,125,2010-09-14,Mr. CUELLAR.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor  the Sames Motor Company’s one  hundredth year  in operation. Sames Motor  Company  is Texas’ oldest dealership. This  automotive company has accomplished a century of service  to our community  throughout  the years.  Founded in 1910 by William J. Sames, this  successful and prospering company has been  sustained through five generations of Sames,  traditional values and great work ethic. It continues to be locally owned in Laredo, Texas  and operated by the Sames family. The dealership started with humble beginnings with an  inventory starting with  three Ford Model–Ts.  Today, it sells over 3,000 new vehicles and an  excess of 4,000 used vehicles a year and employs over 400 workers  through  the Sames  Auto Group.  Within 4 years of its founding, a new location was needed for the booming business. By  1919, a new, grander location was established  in downtown Laredo, which sold Ford, Cadillac, and other automobiles. Years later after  World War II, Sames agreed with Ford Motor  Company to be a dealership selling the Ford  brand exclusively. The company continued to  prosper under a succession of  the Sames  family, Harry E. Sames, Sr., son of W.J.  Sames; Harry E. Sames, Jr., son of Harry, Sr.;  and Harry ‘‘Hank’’ E. Sames III. In 1926 the  dealership sold over a thousand Fords. By the  1960s and ’70s, Sames Motor Company expanded to add three more locations in Laredo.  The company, owned by the fourth generation  of Sames,  continued  forward by acquiring  Sames Red Barn, a dealership in Austin and  expanding  to Corpus Christi  locations. Hank  Sames developed the in-house financing division known as Thunderbird Auto Finance and  launched the state of the art Sames Collision  Center. Today, Sames Motor Company  is  owned by the fifth generation of Sames and  thrives on traditional business values and excellent customer service.  Sustaining a business for a century is not  the only accomplishment of  this establishment—community outreach and philanthropic  contributions have come along with the success of Sames Motor Company. The founding  of the Sames Scholars and the Driven to Success Programs is the only program of its kind  for south Texas as an education based initiative. Evelyn Sames, fifth generation owner, implemented a new program called  ‘‘Mission:  Give Laredo,’’ which benefits Bethany House,  a local charity. In 2009, Mission: Give Laredo  raised over $100,000 and contributed  food,  clothing, and goods. Recently, working with  city officials, Evelyn is developing the Tires for  Life recycling and wellness program, which will  commit to the youth to healthy living and recycling. Sames Motor Company has also been  the recipient of numerous awards and recognition.  Madam Speaker, I am honored to have had  this time to recognize Texas’ oldest dealership  and  its  100th  anniversary.  Through  outstanding service and a family owned business,  Sames Motor Company has accomplished a  century of dedication.

The X Prize Competition challenged our  best scientists and engineers  to develop a  new car that could achieve fuel efficiency of  over 100 miles per gallon in real world driving.  To win, the car had to be safe, affordable and  potentially desirable to consumers.  Western Washington’s team, comprised entirely of undergraduate students, developed  and entered a 2-seat car, the Viking 45, in the  ‘‘alternative’’ class. Their car successfully navigated several rounds of testing, becoming the  only American university  team  to  reach  the  finals of the competition.  The success of the Viking 45 continues the  long tradition of excellence at the Vehicle Research Institute. I commend them for their success in the X Prize competition and their continuing outstanding work to develop the next  generation of passenger vehicles.  f  RECOGNIZING THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  FOUNDING  OF  NUESTRA SEN˜ORA DE LOS DOLORES DE LAS VEGAS GRANDES,  NEW MEXICO 1835–2010  HON. BEN RAY LUJA´N  OFNEWMEXICO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 24, 2010  Mr. LUJA´N. Madam Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate  the 175th anniversary of Las  Vegas, New Mexico.  Established by a land grant from the Government of Mexico, the City of Las Vegas was  founded on  the Gallinas River on April 6th,  1835. Las Vegas soon found prosperity as a  trading hub on the Sante Fe Trail, and later as  a stop on the railroad between Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe.  Throughout  its 175 years, Las Vegas has  flourished; becoming a regional center for cultural and social diversity; seeing the establishment of theaters, schools, newspapers, and libraries. As many historic  towns  in America  have experienced,  the people of Las Vegas  have seen challenges throughout their storied  history including epidemics, economic depressions, and political turmoil.  However, with over 900 buildings  recognized by  the National Register of Historic  Places, and  the claim  to  forming  the New  Mexico Militia and the 1st United States Volunteer Calvary, Las Vegas can point  to a  strong and proud history of perseverance and  dedication that is worthy of admiration.  I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing  the celebration of  the people of Las  Vegas as they celebrate their city’s anniversary. The longevity of Las Vegas is a testament  to  the  communal bonds established  there, and it is an inspirational achievement.  f  RECOGNIZING TAIWAN ON THE  OCCASION OF NATIONAL DAY  HON. G.K.

408,,111,-0.404,22,2010-09-24,Mr. BUTTERFIELD.," Madam Speaker, I rise  to salute Taiwan on its forthcoming National  Day on October 10, 2010.  Taiwan  is a model of success  in Asia.  Through hard work and ingenuity, Taiwan has  become one of the strongest economies in the  Asia Pacific.  Two years ago, Taiwan was in the midst of  a global economic crisis. After  taking some  notable economic measures, Taiwan  is expected to bring its unemployment rate below 5  percent, and GDP is expected to grow by 4.72  percent this year.  Taiwan is also a showcase democracy and  continues to strengthen its democratic institution. The accomplishments of Taiwan, whether  economic or political, are truly remarkable.  On the occasion of Republic of China’s National Day, I ask my colleagues to join me in  wishing new era of peace and prosperity between Taiwan and mainland China. There  have been many agreements between the two  sides,  including direct air and sea  links,  increased mutual  investments, and exchanges  of peoples.  Also, my congratulations  to Taiwan  for  its  continued participation in the World Health Assembly meetings  last May  in Geneva. We  should also acknowledge Taiwan’s humanitarian assistance to Haiti and Taiwan’s medical and public health missions to Pacific island countries in recent years.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me in congratulating Taiwan.  f  A TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN B. FALEK  HON.

410,House,111,0.398,16,2010-11-29,Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky.," With that  visual, keep in mind I’ve spent the last  26 years of my life traveling in and out  of the Middle East in various capacities—serving there in the military and  being in and out of the region, traveling on business, and now as a Member  of Congress. I’ve had a chance to watch  a system that is virtually flawless, and  it’s based on a series of questions that  is not  intrusive. It’s a  free society.  They’ve maintained their civil liberties  with a dramatically higher threat to  terrorism.  Yet what we have done, if we look at  this, is create the bureaucratization of  security. We’re not going to deal with  the root cause issues; we’re going to  treat the symptoms. Nobody will ever  take down an airplane with a box cutter or a pocketknife the way the hijackers did on 9/11. Now that citizens  who are flying know, there have been  multiple instances in flight where people have had erratic behavior, mainly  trying to get to the lavatory, and they  were tackled by passengers out of concern  for  this. Americans will  fight  back.  The situation has changed, and in effect, we’re  fighting  the  last battle;  we’re fighting the last terrorist attack  as  opposed  to  something  like  the  Israeli system, which really incurs virtually no cost and manages to keep a  very robust flying public that’s very  safe, and it all begins with asking questions.  People bring up the argument, Oh,  well, you can’t do that because that’s  profiling.  I would disagree with the misuse and  misunderstanding of that term related  to the cost. We are driving people away  from traveling right now because of  these intrusions. It’s creating a huge  burden on the flying public, and it’s entirely unnecessary because it’s checking innocent people, and 99 percent of  our capacity  is devoted to checking  people for a threat that any trained security  inspector would know  is not  even there. That’s a poor use of assets.  I’ll go back to the Israeli system. I  was traveling out of Israel, alone, with  a backpack, 17 years ago, on a short  trip that I had had to make into Jerusalem. At the time, because of what I  did and because of where I had been in  the military, I had had lots of stamps  from countries all over  that area—  some areas which weren’t particularly  friendly to Israel. I was asked questions—a  blue-eyed, Caucasian male,  from  the United States, who  spoke  with  an Ohio Valley  accent. They  began asking me a series of questions.  They looked at the passport stamps  and moved me over and said, We’d like  you to talk to this person over here.  The other 200-plus people who were  going on that L–1011 Delta flight, in  fact, were moved right on through. I  was asked questions for over an hour  and a half. There was no cost to those  other people. The airline was able to do  what they did, and they were able to  very quickly verify that I was, A, no  threat and a legitimate customer. That  system works, and it works today, and  it’s almost impossible for somebody to  fool that system.  The other thing that’s important is  we don’t need these billions of dollars  spent on these scanners that are being  overused. Again, it comes down to situation awareness. We can address this  issue with a  lower cost by stepping  back and applying what you and Conhave  been  talking about tonight, which  is  just  bringing some common sense to this.  What is the problem we really want  to solve? Give us the most flexibility  and the most options to deal with this  after the fact.  Again, before regulations  like this  should be implemented, I believe we  need to have a vote of Congress. Let  the will of the people be made known  in this rather than just simply giving  away another set of our liberties without asking that question when, in fact,  it comes at a significant cost. I think if  our taxpayers who don’t travel regularly understood the amount of money  that we spend on hardware, which can  still be penetrated by some type of a  serious threat that was  just outside  that set of assumptions in TSA, we’d  be in a different world.  This doesn’t impugn the motivation  of the folks in the Transportation Security Agency. I know there is an ongoing argument below the senior management levels of what works and what  doesn’t work, and it is by those who  have lived in that world. They’ve lived  in a high-threat environment and have  been able to thrive.  I believe we can do that; but again,  let’s come back to these constitutional  gressman WESTMORELAND VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:00 Nov 30, 2010 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K29NO7.046 H29NOPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2010

Mr. Blacksheare has always welcomed the challenge to serve the underserved, and  it  is  this devotion  that has  earned  him  recognition  from  the Crooms  Academy Alumni Association.  Mr. Blacksheare carries himself with integrity, respect, and dedication in everything he  does for his profession and community. A look  into his background shows just how successful  he has been on both of  these  fronts. As a  Sanford, Florida native, Mr. Blacksheare attended Crooms Academy, graduating in 1943.  After college, Mr. Blacksheare came back to  Sanford and began his career as an educator  at Oviedo High School. In 1948, he returned  home  to Crooms Academy as a  teacher,  which marked the beginning of a long and illustrious  career. Mr. Blacksheare was appointed assistant principal  in 1960 and was  elevated to principal in 1964. After serving as  principal for 21 years, Mr. Blacksheare took a  position with  the Seminole County School  Board before retiring in 1992 with 43 years of  service in education.  In addition, Mr. Blacksheare is also a proud  Kappa man. He was a great role model for me  and others in our community, serving Kappa  Alpha Psi Fraternity in many leadership roles.  In fact, I became a Kappa at Fisk University  because of Mr. Blacksheare. When he found  out that I had pledged Kappa at Fisk University, he was so excited. Years later, when I  was nominated  for Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity’s highest award,  the Laurel Wreath, he  wrote one of  the  first  letters  to  the Laurel  Wreath Committee  on my  behalf. Brother  Blacksheare truly knows the meaning of PHI  NU PI.  Mr. Blacksheare is a man of great faith and  excellent character. He is a man known for his  many good works and his  love  for his students, family, and friends. As a Crooms Academy alumnus,  I am grateful  for  the many  years  of  guidance  and  leadership  Mr.  Blacksheare devoted  to my alma mater. He  has always displayed selfless compassion and  a desire to help those around him. A student  in  the  Class  of  1976  described  Mr.  Blacksheare as, ‘‘a man of great strength and  patience . . . a principal who is interested in  today’s youth, concerned with our welfare and  our school.’’ I can think of no one else more  deserving of this tremendous honor, which will  be bestowed upon him at the ‘‘Legacy of Hope  and Love Banquet.’’  Madam Speaker, it is truly a privilege and  an honor  for me  to  recognize Mr. Edward  Blacksheare, Sr.,  for his dedication  to education, Crooms Academy, its students, and the  Sanford community as a whole.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

417,Senate,111,-0.419,89,2010-12-10,Mr. AKAKA.," The Senator from Iowa  is correct. Remedies in S. 372 provide  relief for the consequences of preliminary retaliatory  investigations when  an  employee  prevails  in  litigation  against a prohibited personnel practice. This provision does not in any  way reduce or eliminate jurisdiction to  challenge a retaliatory  investigation  before a formal personnel action occurs.  In legislative history for 1994 amendments to the Whistleblower Protection  Act, Representative McCloskey stated  that  alleged  harassment  can  be  a  threatened personnel action if it  ‘‘is  discriminatory,  or  could  have  a  chilling effect on merit system duties  and responsibilities.’’ Congress specifically  included  retaliatory  investigations initiated because of protected activity  among  the  illustrations  for  ‘‘threatened  personnel  actions,’’  because they can be  ‘‘preludes or preconditions to’’ the entire list of formal  personnel actions in section 2302(a)(2)  of title 5. Jurisdiction to challenge retaliatory investigations as threatened  personnel actions has been upheld repeatedly. The Office of Special Counsel  also has used this authority to avoid  the need for prolonged, costly litigation while employees are off the job  from subsequent termination.  ",2010
