4,,107,-0.266,230,2001-01-22,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I am pleased to introduce this bill today to address problems with the California energy market and the unwillingness of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take the necessary action. Last week, the  lights went off  in California and the governor declared a state of emergency. More than 1 million  businesses  and  homeowners throughout the state lost power. Computers  shut off, ATMs  stopped dispensing cash, traffic lights went dark and heaters went  cold,  jeopardizing public safety, the economy, and people’s lives. The situation continues to worsen, and the prognosis for the future is dire. Unfortunately, the problem is not just limited to California. PG&E and Southern California Edison, our two largest blue chip utilities are on the brink of bankruptcy and have lost billions. The state’s economy has also lost billions from work  stoppages  that  seem  to occur every single workday. As goes California so goes the rest of the country, I believe. California is the 6th largest economy in the world. Already financial institutions and banks that have underwritten the debts of our utilities are being saddled with their own problems due to the uncertainty over whether they will be paid. Those who believe that California deserves its present plight because of the state’s deregulation bill are near-sighted. California passed a very flawed deregulation bill in 1996. It was flawed because it relied almost entirely on a free market and assumed that there will always be adequate energy supply. What has resulted is an uncompetitive market and an absence of adequate supply. I believe California shares a major responsibility here and I am encouraged that the state legislature is beginning to take action. However, the federal government also has a major responsibility because the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Federal Power Act holds the only authority over  energy generators and marketers. The state cannot address this. Unfortunately, the FERC, even after concluding that rates in California are ‘‘unjust and unreasonable,’’ has failed to take the necessary action to solve the crisis. I am thus proposing legislation today to empower the Secretary of Energy to take the same action available to the FERC in instances when FERC has failed to take decisive action. Individual states would be able to opt out of any order  from the Secretary as this bill is aimed at helping those states that need and want help. I urge the Senate to take up and pass this bill as soon as possible.

5,,107,0.381,230,2001-01-22,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, today we confront yet again a very serious challenge to our political system, as dangerous in its debasing effect on our democracy as war and depression have been in the past. And it will take the best  efforts of  every public-spirited American to defeat it. We must overcome  the cynicism  that  is growing rampant in our society. We must pass campaign reform legislation. That is why first I want to thank our cosponsors for being here today. They are proof that momentum is on our side and that we will pass campaign reform legislation and finally follow the American people’s will. Action on this issue is long overdue and I am hopeful that this year will present us with our best opportunity yet to achieve passage of meaningful campaign reform. Our legislation is simple, bi-partisan, and achieves three primary objectives that will go far to reform our electoral system. The bill: Bans soft money for usage in federal elections; Requires increased disclosure  of  electioneering  communications by so-called independent organizations  in a  constitutional and clear manner (the Snowe-Jeffords language);  and  Codifies  the  Supreme Court’s Beck decision, a court decision effectively  ignored  by  the  previous Clinton Administration and now, under this Act, a decision which would be strictly enforced. After one of the closest elections in our nation’s history, there’s one thing the American people are unanimous about—they want  their  government back.

6,Senate,107,0.146,244,2001-01-22,Mr. MILLER.," Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with Senator GRAMMas a sponsor of this important piece of legislation, first because it is an opportunity to reach across party lines and really practice bipartisanship, not just talk  about  it. But  I’m  even more pleased to be a cosponsor because of the far-reaching consequences of this bill. Right now, our taxes have never been higher. Right now, our  surplus has never been greater. To me,  it’s  just common sense you deal with the first by using the second. Remember  that old Elvis Presley song, ‘‘Return to Sender.’’ Well, that’s what we want to do with this overpayment of taxes. As some of you know, I’ve been in politics for a long time, and I thought I had seen it all. But when I came to Washington last year I was not prepared for the shock of just how matter of factly Congress ate into the surplus, gobbled  it  up  indiscriminately  and without hesitation on both sides of the aisle. I couldn’t believe it and it became clear to me that if we don’t send this overpayment of taxes back to those who paid it, much of it will be frittered away, and  I  think most Americans have enjoyed as much of that as they can stand. Some of my colleagues talk of ‘‘targeted’’ tax cuts, and I respect their opinion, I respect them. But here’s how I think about that: who are we to pick and choose and cull and select and single out among our taxpayers. Who are we to play ‘‘eeny, meany, miney, mo,’’ with them. All of them combined have paid more than it takes to run this government. And all of them combined  should get a break from this oppressive tax structure of ours. This plan would make our tax code more progressive by cutting federal income taxes for people all across the income spectrum, and the largest percentage cuts would go to those Americans who earn the least. Under this proposal, six million families will no longer pay any federal income taxes at all. That’s one out of five families with children. Any time I look at a tax cut, I always apply it to the family I grew up in: a single parent with two children.

7,Senate,107,-0.319,251,2001-01-22,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, all too often we find that our nation’s civilian employees of our federal government who have been forcibly detained or interred by a hostile government do not receive the recognition they deserve. My bill would correct this inequity and provide a prisoner of war medal  for such citizens. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: S. 45 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

8,Senate,107,0.342,279,2001-01-22,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President. I rise today  to  introduce  the  ‘‘Drug-Free America Act of 2001.’’ As many of my colleagues know, drug use by the children in our country continues to be a serious concern of mine. The  ‘‘DrugFree America Act’’ offers a series of initiatives that I believe will support efforts across the board to discourage drug use at all levels in America. Mr. President, I’ve said it before, but it bears repeating. Somewhere along the way, we lost the clear, consistent message that the only proper response to drugs is to say an emphatic ‘‘no.’’ We’re supposed to be more sophisticated. More tolerant. More willing to listen to notions of making dangerous drugs more available. What all of this ‘‘more’’ has meant  is that we have more young people using more drugs at younger ages. Today we are competing with a drug culture that tells our children ‘‘drugs are cool,’’ that ‘‘drug are safe.’’ Drugs are being more aggressively marketed, and are presented as being ‘‘user friendly’’. We cannot remain silent. I look forward with working with President Bush  in providing the resources and message  necessary  to  let  everyone know that drugs are bad, that drugs will damage your brain and your body, and that drug use will hurt you, your friends, your family, your community, and your future. The drug problem confronting our country  is not  static. Methamphetamine, Ecstasy, and other new drugs pose different challenges and require different solutions than the heroin and cocaine  epidemics. Treatment,  education, prevention, and  law enforcement efforts must all be strengthened and updated. The National Institutes of Health have some exciting research efforts underway that could really make a difference as we try to reclaim the lives of our fellow citizens who have been seduced by the false pleasures of drug use. There are several education and prevention initiatives that we can strengthen to support the educators, counselors, community activists, and parents who work hard every day to keep our children and our communities drug free. We should support ongoing efforts  by  the  National  Guard Counterdrug Directorate,  and  re-authorize the U.S. Customs Service, our Nation’s oldest law enforcement agency. We need to believe in our future. I believe that by working together, we can, we will make a difference. I hope my colleagues will join me in working to address this important problem before it becomes any worse. Left unanswered, we will see another generation of young lives blighted. We will see families torn up by a widening circle of hurt from drug use. We saw what a similar wave of drug use did to us and to a generation of young people in the 1960s and 1970s. We are smarter now, we have better tools and better knowledge. We cannot afford  to go through this again. I hope we can begin today to renew our commitment to a drug free future for our young people. I have said this in numerous town meetings, and I now say it here, ‘‘working together, we can make a difference.’’ I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Drug-Free America Act, and look forward to working with my colleagues on these important initiatives. Mr. President, I send this bill to the desk, and request that it be printed in the appropriate place in the RECORD.

Congress makes the following findings: (1) Illegal drugs cost America more than $70,000,000,000 annually. These costs include lost productivity, as well as money spent for drug treatment, illnesses related to drug use, crime prevention and enforcement, and welfare. (2) Federal, State, and local governments spend more than $30,000,000,000 annually to combat illegal drugs and the consequences of illegal drugs. (3) The estimated  total expenditure by Americans  on  illicit  drugs  in  1993 was $48,700,000,000. The vast majority of these illegal drugs are produced overseas and then smuggled into the United States by major criminal organizations. (4) The estimated worldwide potential of coca net production in 1996 was 303,600 metric tons, and in the same year, the worldwide coca cultivation was 209,700 hectares. (5) The production of opium has also been increasing for at least the past 10 years, and reached a new high in 1996 of 4,212 metric tons. Production throughout the world has led to an increase in the heroin addict population of the United States, bringing it to a new high of more than 600,000 people. (6) Money laundering constitutes a serious challenge to the maintenance of  law and order throughout the hemisphere and poses a threat to stability, reliability, and the integrity of governments, financial systems, and commerce. (7) Money laundering of illegal drug profits is an integral part of the drug trafficking process, creating an obstacle  in  fighting drugs. It is estimated that $100,000,000,000 to $300,000,000,000 in United States currency is laundered each year. (8) Certification pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is an essential tool in United States foreign policy. Through the certification process there has been improvement  in  cooperation  levels  that  demonstrates the importance of holding countries responsible for being major producing, transit, and money laundering countries. (9) The major criminal organizations that traffic in illegal narcotics are international in scope and extremely flexible in their activities, and are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their methods of operation. Their influence reaches to the highest levels of some foreign governments.

9,Senate,107,-0.256,293,2001-01-22,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President almost two years have gone by since the tragic accident in Janesville, WI, that brought to light the abuse of workers in the magazine  sales  industry. Since  1992, forty-two sales people have been killed or injured in similar crashes. Unfortunately deaths and injuries still occur. Parents are still separated from their children without knowing where they are or whether they are safe. Young people are not being paid  for their work, and are being falsely listed as independent  contractors.  Roving sweatshops  continue  to  travel  our highways and solicit unlicenced in our neighborhoods. My legislation would go a long way toward ending this sad state of affairs. Today I have introduced legislation to crack down on abuses in the traveling sales crew industry. These companies employ crews who travel from city to city selling products door to door. Often times, however, these companies mistreat their workers and violate local, state, and federal labor law. Because they rapidly move from state to state, enforcement efforts are difficult if not impossible for local authorities. In 1987 former Senator Roth, as part of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations looked into this industry, and was appalled at what he found. Incidents of verbal and physical abuse of workers were widespread. Young people were coerced  into continuing to sell long  after  they  wanted  to  leave through threats and taunts from their employers. When sellers were able to get free they were often unpaid or denied the bus ticket home they were promised when they signed up. The  compensation  system  for  the workers was also rigged to ensure that workers could not leave. Prospective sellers were promised big bucks when they were recruited, but soon  found that decent pay was difficult to come by. Sellers were paid on a commission basis according to their sales, but they were also charged by the company for their accommodations and  fined  for small infractions like showing up late to meetings or sleeping on the van. Salespeople were not paid in a timely manner, but their earnings were kept on  ‘‘paper’’ and the employees only drew a daily allowance to pay for food. Employees were seldom allowed to see the paper work  that  tracked  their earnings so they had little idea about how much  they are entitled. Many found that they were not able to keep up with the sales and fell in debt to the company. After working 12 hour days, six days a week for months, employees actually owed  the  company money! These young people became indentured servants, working long hours for only room and board. In the thirteen years since Senator Roth’s  investigation,  nothing  has changed. These abuses continue, and Congress should act. I am not one to frivolously engage in regulating business, but in this case the need  for  federal  involvement  is clear. Because of the mobility of these companies, states cannot crack down on these groups alone. They need federal help to eliminate the unscrupulous actors in the industry. The Traveling Sales Crew Protection Act would  take  important  steps  to eliminate employers who abuse their workers. First,  it would no  longer allow minors to be employed in this line of work. Door to door sales can be dangerous work and combined with the long hours and hazardous travel, creates a job too dangerous for children. Second, the bill would narrowly eliminate  the exemption under  the Fair Labor Standards Act for these specific kinds of operations. Covering these employees with minimum wages laws and overtime requirements protects them from becoming indentured servants to their employers through complex compensation systems. This provision  is carefully crafted to cover only traveling sales crews, individuals who sell over the road, or at trade shows would be unaffected. Lastly the bill creates a licensing procedure through the Department of Labor to monitor those engaged in supervising and running these operations.

10,Senate,107,0.572,300,2001-01-22,Mr. ALLARD.," Mr. President, today I am  introducing  legislation to  immediately eliminate the estate tax. I fundamentally oppose the estate tax. I call it the ‘‘death tax.’’ This unfair tax has been a concern of mine for some time now. Congress has clearly demonstrated its support for easing this burden. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 gradually increases  the exemption. Last year, Congress decided that  further action was needed and passed a bill that would have eliminated the federal estate tax. Unfortunately, President Clinton chose to veto that bill. I look forward to the opportunity to work with the new Administration to repeal this unfair tax by passing my bill. The United States has one of the highest  estate  taxes  in  the world. While income tax rates have declined in recent decades, estate taxes have remained high. Today, the death tax is imposed on estates with assets of more than $675,000. The rates begin at 37% and very rapidly rise to 55%. Some estates even pay a marginal rate of 60%. This issue really hits home for me. Family farms and small businesses are two of the groups most affected by the estate tax. I grew up on my family’s farm in Colorado, and I owned a small business before I came to Washington. So, I truly understand the concerns of those who live in fear of the impact that this tax will have on their legacy to their children. The estate tax has resulted in the loss of family farms and family businesses across the nation. Many people work their entire lives to build a business that they can pass on to their children. When  these  hard-working businessmen and  farmers pass away, their families are often forced to sell off the business to pay the estate tax. I see this as an affront to those who try to pass on the  fruits of their  lives’ work to their children. The people affected by this tax are not necessarily wealthy. Many small business people are cash poor, but asset rich. For example, the owner of a small restaurant might have $800,000 of assets, but not much cash on hand. Her children will still have to pay an excessive tax on the assets. The beer wholesaler, who has invested all of his revenue in trucks and storage, might have more than $675,000 in assets. That does not make him a cash-wealthy man. Yet, he is still subject to this so-called ‘‘tax on the wealthy.’’ The death tax also impacts employment and the economy. When a familyowned farm or a small business closes, the workers lose their jobs. Conversely, leaving resources in the economy can create  jobs. A recent George Mason study found that if the estate tax were phased out over five years, the economy would create 198,895 more  jobs, and grow by an additional $509 billion over a ten-year period. Additionally, the estate tax is a disincentive for Americans to save their earnings. The government has created a number of tax breaks and other incentives  for  those who  save  their money: 401(k)s and IRAs—to name a few. Yet, the estate tax sends a contradictory message. Basically, it says, ‘‘If you don’t spend all your savings by the time you die, the government will penalize you.’’ This tax is no small penalty, either. We are talking about some very high tax rates. The death tax also represents an unjust double taxation. The savings were taxed initially when they were earned. Then, when the saver passes away, the government comes along and takes a second cut. There is no good reason for the current  system—other  than  the government’s desire to make a profit at the already trying time of the death of a dear one. The current death  tax  law has a greater effect on the lower end of the scale than the higher. Wealthy people can afford lawyers and planners to help them plan their estate. Those at the lower end of the estate tax scale are often unable to afford sophisticated estate planning. So the current law also makes the tax somewhat regressive, which is not fair. Planning and compliance with the estate tax can consume substantial resources. In 1995, the Gallup organization surveyed  family  firms. Twentythree percent of owners of companies valued over $10 million said that they pay more than $50,000 per year in insurance premiums on policies  to help them pay the eventual bill. To plan for the estate tax, the firms also spent an average of $33,000 on lawyers, accountants and financial planners, over a period of several years. This is money that could have been better spent to expand the business and create new jobs—rather  than  dealing with  the death tax. The estate tax only raises one percent of federal revenue, yet it costs farms, businesses and jobs. No American family should lose their farm or business because of the federal government. I support full repeal of the federal estate tax. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill, as well as an article that I recently wrote, be entered into the RECORD. There being no objection, the additional material was  ordered  to  be printed in the RECORD, as follows: S. 100 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of American in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Death Tax Termination Act of 2001.’’ SEC. 2. REPEAL OF ESTATE AND GIFT TAXES. Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to estate, gift, and generationskipping taxes) is repealed effective with respect to estates of decedents dying, and gifts made, after December 31, 2000. [From the Roll Call, Apr. 27, 1998] ESTATETAXREFORMMUSTBEFIRSTSTEPTO FIXINGSYSTEM (By Sen. Wayne Allard) As we approach the new millennium, a consensus has emerged in favor of significant tax reform. Some prefer the flat tax; others advocate the sales tax. A third camp argues that Congress should avoid a complete overhaul and instead work to improve the existing system. Whatever path is chosen, it should include elimination of the federal estate tax. Repeal of the estate tax is the first step toward a fairer and flatter tax system. Congress has levied estate taxes at various times throughout US history, particularly during war. The current estate tax dates back to 1916, a time when many in Congress were looking for ways to redistribute some of the wealth held by a small number of super-rich families. This first permanent estate tax had a top rate of only 10 percent, and the threshold was high enough to ensure that the tax affected only a tiny fraction of the population. Like the rest of our tax code, it did not take long for this limited tax to evolve into a more substantial burden. In only the second year of the tax, the top rate was increased to 25 percent. By 1935, the top rate was 70 percent, and in 1941, it reached an alltime high of 77 percent. While income tax rates have declined in recent decades, estate taxes have remained high. Today, the top estate tax rate is 55 percent (a top marginal rate of 60 percent is paid by some estates), and the tax is imposed on amounts above the 1998 exemption level of $625,000 (value above $625,000 is taxed at an initial rate of 37 percent). Generally, the value of all assets held at death is included in the estate for purposes of  assessing  the  tax—this  includes  residences, business assets, stocks, bonds, savings, personal property, etc. Estate tax returns are due within nine months of the decedent’s death  (a  six-month extension  is available), and with the exception of certain closely held businesses, the tax is due when the return is filed. The tax is paid by the estate rather than by the beneficiary (in contrast to an inheritance tax). Last year’s tax bill increased the unified estate and gift tax exemption from $600,000 to $1 million. However, this is done very gradually and does not reach the $1 million level until 2006. The bill also increased the exemption amount  for a qualified  familyowned business to $1.3 million. While both actions are a good first step, they barely compensate for the effects of inflation. The $600,000 exemption level was last set in 1987; just to keep pace with inflation the exemption should have risen to $850,000 by 1997. Incremental improvements help, but we need more substantial reform. The United States retains among the highest estate taxes in the world. Among industrial nations, only Japan has a higher top rate than we do. But Japan’s 70 percent rate applies to an inheritance of $16 million or more. The US top rate of 55 percent kicks in on estates of $3 million or more. France, the United Kingdom and Ireland all have top rates of 40 percent, and the average top rate of Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development countries is only 29 percent. Australia, Canada and Mexico presently have no estate taxes. The strongest argument that supporters of the estate tax make is that most American families will never have to pay an estate tax. While this is true, it does not justify retention of a tax that causes great harm to family businesses and farms, often constitutes double  taxation,  limits  economic growth VerDate 19-JAN-2001 07:04 Jan 23, 2001 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00300 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A22JA6.228 pfrm02 PsN: S22PT1 ",2001
11,Senate,107,-0.276,307,2001-01-22,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I am proud to  introduce  today,  with  Senator SNOWE, the Equity in Prescription and Contraception Coverage Act of  2001 (EPICC). Our legislation would require insurers, HMOs and employee health benefit plans that offer prescription drug benefits to cover contraceptive drugs and devices approved by the FDA. Further, it would require these insurers to cover outpatient contraceptive services if a plan covers other outpatient services. Lastly, it would prohibit the imposition of copays and deductibles for prescription contraceptives or outpatient services that are greater than those for other prescription drugs. Our bill gives Americans on both sides of the abortion debate the opportunity to join together in the common goal of preventing unintended pregnancies. I am pleased that we have support from both pro-life and pro-choice Senators for this bill. We are introducing EPICC today—the first legislative day of the 107th Congress—because equity  in prescription contraception coverage  is  long overdue. Senator SNOWEand I first introduced this bill in 1997. Since this time, the Viagra pill went on the market, and one month later was covered by most indemnity policies. Birth control pills, which have been on the market since 1960, are covered by only thirtythree percent of insurance plans. Most recently, the U.S. Equal Employment  Opportunity  Commission (EEOC) issued a decision finding that an employer’s failure to include insurance coverage for prescription contraceptives in an employee health benefits plan, when it covers other prescription drugs and devices, constitutes unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC ruling  is an  important step toward ensuring that women have access to affordable contraceptives. At the same time, it highlights the importance of our legislation because title VII applies only to employers; it does not cover insurance providers. An estimated  16 million Americans obtain health  insurance  from private  insurance  other  than  employer-provided plans. Only the enactment of EPICC will  ensure  that  contraceptive  coverage is offered by insurance providers. Our efforts have not been entirely without  results. For  the past  three consecutive years, we have passed a provision in the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill that requires Federal VerDate 19-JAN-2001 08:29 Jan 23, 2001 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00307 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A22JA6.219 pfrm02 PsN: S22PT1 ",2001
12,Senate,107,-0.308,314,2001-01-22,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce legislation that would put an end to automatic cost-ofliving adjustments  for Congressional pay. As my Colleagues are aware, it is an unusual thing to have the power to raise our own pay. Few people have that ability. Most of our constituents do not have that power. And that this power is so unusual is good reason for the Congress to exercise that power openly, and to exercise it subject to regular procedures that include debate, amendment, and a vote on the RECORD. Last year, the Senate initially voted down the conference report on the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. As I noted during the debate on that bill, by considering the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill as part of that conference report, shielded as it was from amendment, the Senate blocked any opportunity to force an open debate of a $3,800 pay raise for every Member of the Senate and the House of Representatives. This process of pay raises without accountability must end. The  stealth  pay  raise  technique began with a change Congress enacted in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. In section 704 of that Act, Members of Congress voted to make themselves entitled to an annual raise equal to half a percentage point less than the employment cost index, one measure of inflation. Many times, Congress has voted to deny itself the raise, and Congress traditionally does that on the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill. And by bringing the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill to the Senate floor for the first time last year in a conference report, without Senate  floor consideration, the majority leadership prevented  anyone  from  offering  an amendment on that bill to block the pay  raise. The majority  leadership tried to make it impossible even to put Senators on record in an up-or-down vote directly for or against the pay raise, nearly perfecting the technique of the stealth pay raise. The question of how and whether Members of Congress can raise their own pay was one that our Founders considered from the beginning of our Nation. In August of 1789, as part of the package of 12 amendments advocated by James Madison that included what has become our Bill of Rights, the House of Representatives passed an amendment to the Constitution providing that Congress could not raise its pay without an intervening election. Almost exactly 211 years ago, on September 9, 1789, the Senate passed that amendment. In late September of 1789, Congress submitted the amendments to the states. Although  the  amendment  on  pay raises languished for two centuries, in the 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the Wisconsin state Senate, I was proud to help  ratify  the amendment.  Its approval by the Michigan legislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed approval by three-fourths of the states. The 27th Amendment to the Constitution now states: ‘‘No law, varying the compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, shall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened.’’ I try to honor that limitation in my own  practices.  In my  own  case, throughout my 6-year term, I accept only the rate of pay that Senators receive on the date on which I was sworn in as a Senator. And I return to the Treasury any additional income Senators get, whether from a cost-of-living adjustment or a pay raise we vote for ourselves. I don’t take a raise until my bosses, the people of Wisconsin, give me one at the ballot box. That is the spirit of  the  27th Amendment. The stealth pay raises like the one that Congress allowed last year, at a minimum, certainly violate the spirit of that amendment.

13,Senate,107,-0.266,328,2001-01-22,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President.  I rise today to introduce legislation to change the way unaccompanied immigrant children are treated while in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). If enacted, the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2001 would ensure that the federal government addresses the special needs of thousands of unaccompanied alien children who enter the U.S. It will ensure that these children have a fair  opportunity  to  obtain humanitarian relief. Central throughout this  legislation are two concepts: The United States government has a fundamental responsibility to protect unaccompanied children  in  its custody; and  in all proceedings and actions, the government’s ultimate priority should be to protect the best interests of children. The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2001 would ensure that children who are apprehended by the INS are treated humanely and appropriately  by  transferring  jurisdiction over their welfare from the INS Detention and Deportation division  to a newly created Office of Children’s Services within the Department of Justice. This legislation would also centralize responsibility for the care and custody of unaccompanied children in this new Office of Children’s Services. By doing so, it would resolve the conflict of interest inherent in the current system— that is, the INS retains custody of children and  is charged with their care while, at the same time, it seeks their deportation. Under this bill, the Office of Children’s Services would be required to establish standards for the custody, release, and detention of children, ensuring that children are housed in appropriate shelters or  foster care rather than  juvenile  jails. In 1999, the INS held some 2,000 children  in  juvenile jails even though they had never committed a crime. Equally as important, the bill would require the Office to establish clear guidelines and uniformity for detention alternatives such as shelter care, foster care, and other child custody arrangements. The bill would  improve unaccompanied aliens’ access to existing options for permanent protection when U.S. immigration and child welfare authorities  believe  such  protection  is warranted. Finally,  the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act would provide unaccompanied minors with access  to legal counsel, who would ensure that the children appear at all immigration proceedings and assist them as the INS and immigration court consider their cases. The bill would also provide the children with access to a guardian ad litem to ensure that they are properly placed in a safe and caring environment. The guardian ad  litem would also work to ensure that each child’s best interests are protected throughout the process. Let me turn for a moment to the issue of access to counsel. Children, even more than adults, have incredible difficulty understanding the complexities of the asylum system without the assistance of counsel. Despite this reality, most children in INS detention are  overlooked  and  unrepresented. Without legal representation, children are at risk of being returned to their home countries where they may face further human rights abuses. I am aware of two cases that demonstrate the compelling need for counsel on behalf of these children. The first case involves two 17-year old boys from China. Li and Wang, who were apprehended on an island near Guam and had been in INS custody for almost two years. During their detention in Guam, the two boys testified in federal court against  the  smugglers who brought them  to Guam.  In  their  testimony, they described being beaten by  the smugglers even before leaving China, and stated that others were beaten during the trip to Guam. In the spring of 2000, the two boys were brought to a corrections facility in Los Angeles and VerDate 19-JAN-2001 08:14 Jan 23, 2001 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00328 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A22JA6.258 pfrm02 PsN: S22PT1 ",2001

19,Senate,107,-0.309,41,2001-01-29,Mr. BYRD.," Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today in supporting the president’s nomination of Mrs. Gale Norton to be the next Secretary of the Department of the Interior. As the ranking minority member on the  appropriations  subcommittee which provides funding for the Interior department, I have a particular interest in this Cabinet position. I know that effectively managing this department—an organization of  69,000 employees and an $8.4 billion budget—is not an easy task. The Interior Secretary is charged with overseeing the 379 parks of the National Park System, the 521 refuges and the 66 national fish hatcheries of  the Fish and Wildlife Service, the 264 million acres of land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, and serving the needs of 1.4 million  American  Indians.  Clearly, with a portfolio that broad, it is easy to see that the programs under the jurisdiction of the Secretary have a direct impact on every state in the union and nearly every American citizen. I am aware of the controversy that has  surrounded  this  nomination.  I know that there are those who do not see Mrs. Norton as an ally. There have been many  accusations made  concerning the nominee’s public policy positions, and she has been, in my opinion, unfairly derided as a result of certain past working relationships. Despite this, I remain confident that, as Secretary, Gale Norton will be responsive to the concerns of the American people, particularly those concerns expressed by the Congress. I have personally talked with Mrs. Norton, and while I will not say that we had an in-depth discussion of all the issues which come before the Interior Department, I can say that, with respect to those subject matters we did discuss, I found Gale Norton to be well informed. More  importantly, I  found her willing to consider various points of view. Obviously, Senators cannot expect a Cabinet Secretary to agree with us on all things at all times. But what we should expect is to have an opportunity to present our views, or present the case of those we represent, and to have those views heard in a fair and unbiased manner. I believe Mrs. Norton will deliver quite well on that expectation. Madam President, I wish Gale Norton well as she embarks on a difficult assignment, and she will work with the Congress to ensure that we fulfill our land management and  trust  responsibilities to the American people in a fair, economical, and efficient manner. f MORNING BUSINESS ",2001

21,Senate,107,-0.314,48,2001-01-29,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the ‘‘Offender Reentry and Community Safety Act of 2001,’’ a bill I first introduced last July. The bill is also a part of S. 16, the Democrat’s omnibus crime legislation. Too often we have short-term solutions for long-term problems. All too often we think about today, but not tomorrow. It’s time that we start looking forward. It’s time that we face the dire situation of prisoners re-entering our communities with  insufficient monitoring,  little or no  job skills,  inadequate  drug  treatment,  insufficient housing and deficient basic life skills. According to the Department of Justice, 1.25 million offenders are now living in prisons and another 600,000 offenders are incarcerated in local jails. A record number of those inmates—approximately 585,400 will return to communities this year. Historically, twothirds of returning prisoners have been rearrested for new crimes within three years. The safety threat posed by this volume of prisoner returns has been exacerbated by the  fact that states and communities can’t possibly properly supervise all their returning offenders, parole systems have been abolished in thirteen states and policy shifts toward more determinate sentencing have reduced the courts’ authority to impose supervisory conditions on offenders returning to their communities. State systems have also reduced the numbers of transitional support programs aimed at facilitating the return to productive community  life styles. Recent studies indicate that many returning prisoners receive no help  in finding employment upon release and most offenders have low literacy and other basic educational skills that can impede successful reentry. At least 55 percent of offenders are fathers of minor children, and therefore face a number of issues related to child support and other family responsibilities  during  incarceration  and after  release. Substance  abuse  and mental health problems also add to concerns over community safety. Approximately 70 percent of state prisoners and 57 percent of federal prisoners have a history of drug use or abuse. Research by the Department of Justice indicates that between 60 and 75 percent of inmates with heroin or cocaine problems return to drugs within three months when untreated. An estimated 187,000 state and federal prison inmates have self-reported mental health problems. Mentally ill inmates are more likely than other offenders to have committed a violent offense and be violent recidivists. Few states connect mental health treatment in prisons with treatment in the return community. Finally, offenders with contagious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis are released with no viable plan to continue their medical treatment so they present a significant danger to public health. And while the federal prison population and reentry system differs from the state prison population and reentry systems, there are nonetheless significant reentry challenges at the federal level. We need to start thinking about what to do with these people. We need to start  thinking  in  terms of helping these people make a transition to the community so that they don’t go back to a life of crime and can be productive members of our society. We need to start thinking about the long-term impact of what we do after we send people to jail. My legislation creates demonstration reentry programs for federal, state and local prisoners. The programs are designed to assist high-risk, high-need offenders who have served their prison sentences, but who pose the greatest risk of reoffending upon release because  they  lack  the  education,  job skills, stable family or living arrangements, and the substance abuse treatment and other mental and medical health services they need to successfully reintegrate into society. Innovative strategies and emerging technologies present new opportunities to improve reentry systems. This legislation creates federal and state demonstration projects that utilize these strategies  and  technologies.  The projects share many core components, including a more seamless reentry system, reentry officials who are more directly involved with the offender and who can swiftly impose intermediate sanctions if the offender does not follow the designated reentry plan, and the combination of enhanced service delivery and enhanced monitoring. The different projects are targeted at different prisoner populations and each has some unique features. The promise of the legislation is to establish the demonstration projects and then to rigorously evaluate them to determine VerDate 29-JAN-2001 02:36 Jan 30, 2001 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A29JA6.023 pfrm01 PsN: S29PT1 ",2001

Wolf Trap is the only unit of the National Park System dedicated to the performing  arts.  It  provides  an unrivaled setting for live performances in the rolling countryside of Virginia outside of Washington, D.C. To provide this unique experience, the National Park Service collaborates with the Wolf Trap Foundation in a public/private partnership to offer cultural, natural, and educational experiences to the community and to the nation. The National Park Service maintains the grounds and buildings of Wolf Trap Farm Park. The Wolf Trap Foundation, a ‘‘501(c)(3)’’ not-for-profit organization, creates and selects the programming, develops all education programs, handles ticket sales, marketing, publicity  and  public  relations,  and raises funds to support these programs. The Park Service has an annual budget of just over $3 million to maintain the facility while the Wolf Trap Foundation has an annual budget of $22 million, 60% of which is generated through ticket  sales with  the  rest  raised through private donations. Wolf Trap offers a wide variety of educational programs including the nationally acclaimed Wolf Trap Institute for Early Learning Through the Arts for preschoolers, scholarships and performance  opportunities  for  talented high  school musicians,  pre-performance preview lectures, the America’s Promise mentoring program, the Mars Millennium project partnership with Buzz Aldrin Elementary School, the Folk Masters Study Units for teachers who want to incorporate the folk arts into their curriculum, a highly competitive internship program for college students, and master classes for people with all skill levels and interest. Wolf Trap has also gained world-wide recognition for its summer residency program for young opera singers, the Wolf Trap Opera Company.

25,House,107,-0.454,5,2001-02-07,Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an important anniversary of the United States: 153 years ago, the United States and Mexico signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. This treaty sought to protect the property rights of those who remained in the United States and became United States citizens. There  is now  substantial evidence there were many violations of  this treaty’s provisions. The GAO has undertaken an investigation to get to the heart of this important matter. This situation cries out for justice. I urge all my colleagues to follow this study closely so we can bring justice to this issue. Mr. Speaker, February 2nd marks the 153d anniversary of  the signing of  the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican War, and ceded to the United States what is now California, Arizona and New Mexico. The Treaty also recognized U.S. claims over Texas, with  the Rio Grande as its southern boundary. In  turn,  the United States paid Mexico $15,000,000, and among other things, agreed to recognize prior land grants issued by Spain and Mexico  to  individuals, communities, and indigenous pueblo people. Thus, during the 50 years that followed the signing, numerous procedures were developed to evaluate and validate the land grants. However, the change in sovereignty in 1848 brought together two different legal systems— the Spanish/Mexican and the Anglo-American. These competing legal systems resulted in the inability of the United States to properly recognize and honor the role that custom played in preserving the lands and waters in accordance with Spanish and Mexican law. Mr. Speaker,  this along with other  facts, suggests that the manner in which these private and communal land grants were evaluated by the U.S. Courts and by Congress, did not satisfy  the obligations assumed by  the United States when we signed the treaty. To address this issue, the GAO has embarked on a study of whether the United States fulfilled its obligations under the Treaty of GuadalupeHidalgo with regard to land grants made by Spain and Mexico. I am pleased that the initial exposure draft was recently completed, and I believe  that  this ongoing study  is a proper step  in addressing  the numerous  issues regarding the Treaty and its implementation. Mr. Speaker, the issues that have evolved from the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo center on the concept of fairness and justice. Thus,  I ask  that all Americans acknowledge the 153d anniversary of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, by  recognizing  the many  issues  that remain  to be properly addressed in order to assure a fair evaluation of the land grant claims. f LER SPECIAL ORDERS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MILof Florida).

As a matter of fact, I was looking at a report that suggests that, in the first detailed study to target some of the AIDS epidemic’s overlooked victims, researchers in Chicago reported Monday that fully 30 percent of young gay African-American men  are  infected with HIV. The infection rate for gay blacks was twice that of any other ethnic group, a finding that shocked some experts despite the already well-documented racial gap in AIDS cases. ‘‘This is a disturbing and frightening number, and something should be done about it,’’ said Linda Valleroy, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who led the six-city survey of gay men  in their twenties. The  results were outlined Monday at the 8th Annual Retrovirus Conference being held in Chicago this week. The new figures reflect a troubling reality for gay black men who may not have enough  income  to  live  in  the largely white gay enclaves where AIDS health centers are located. Such problems are amplified, gay advocates say, by lingering rifts over homosexuality within the African-American community itself. For example, and I quote, ‘‘I am an African-American gay man living with HIV. In some people’s eyes, I’m damned several  times  over,’’  said  Frank Oldham, Jr., who is the assistant commissioner of AIDS public policy at the Chicago Department of Health. Previous AIDS  surveys  tended  to focus on members of the white population, Valleroy said, in part because the researchers sampled gay neighborhoods where relatively few blacks live, men who frequented gay bars, clubs, restaurants and coffee houses. Valleroy’s team succeed in recruiting 408 gay black men for the survey, about 17 percent of the total. Moreover, no ’ ’ ",2001
27,Senate,107,0.552,26,2001-02-07,Mr. INHOFE.," I don’t think there is any question,  if we are honest, we would  deny  that  if we  leave  this money, it will be spent. Parkinson’s law  is: Government expands to consume the resources allocated to it, plus 10 percent. This has proven to be true over and over again. I can argue as to the  fairness of where this cut takes place. I could talk about the fact that the top 5 percent of the income makers in this country actually pay 54 percent of the taxes; the bottom 50 percent only pay 4.2 percent of the taxes. That begs the question. There is no reason to talk about the fairness of this because it is too logical. Obviously, what we are going through now is an overpayment. We have taxed the American people, and anyone out there right now—and there are millions of people who have paid any type of taxes—is entitled to a refund.  To  redistribute  that  wealth would be as unfair as it would be if you went  down  to  an  auto  dealership, bought a new car, paid the sticker price, got home and said: Wait, I paid $2,000 too much. And you get in the car and drive to the auto dealer and say: You overcharged me  $2,000, and he says: I just gave it to my mother-inlaw. This is an overpayment of taxes we have made and I think people are entitled to have the overpayment back. If you do that, it will have the effect of increasing  revenue,  and  stimulating the  economy, which we desperately need. We are on the brink right now of a recession. I yield the floor. EXHIBIT1 [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 29, 2001] WHEREDOWEPUTTHESURPLUS? (By Kevin A. Hassett and R. Glenn Hubbard) When historians look back on Alan Greenspan’s tenure as chairman of the Federal Reserve and attempt to identify the source of his enormous success, last Thursday’s Congressional testimony—in which he advanced the course of tax reform—will likely provide one answer. Mr. Greenspan raised a pressing public-policy question that has been overlooked by most, a question that will likely become the focal point of political and economic debate during President Bush’s first four-year term. If  the U.S. government  starts accumulating big surpluses, where should it put the money? That might not seem so tricky. After all, the government already occasionally places deposits in private banks. But this time we aren’t talking nickels and dimes. Current surplus estimates are so large that the government’s passbook savings account, if nothing changes, will soon become the Mount Everest of cash hoards. Let’s look at the numbers. The latest Office of Management and Budget forecast is for the surplus to reach about $5.5 trillion over the next 10 years. Rumor has it that the soon-to-be-released Congressional Budget Office forecast will peg it at $6 trillion, with almost $1 trillion arriving in 2011 alone. (Note: actual CBO numbers are $5.61 trillion, of which $3.12 trillion will be the non-Social Security surplus) Why not just pay down the debt? Put simply, there’s not that much debt to pay. According to the Treasury Department, total government debt held by the public is only about $3 trillion. With no change in tax policy, projected surpluses would pay down the debt by around 2008. Government will subsequently have to decide in what it will invest the massive surpluses. But that is far in the future. Many opponents of tax reduction have suggested that we wait until the uncertain surpluses arrive, and the $3 trillion of existing government debt is retired, before considering tax cuts. Mr. Greenspan had an answer for that as well:  ‘‘Private asset accumulation may be forced upon us well short of reaching zero debt.’’ Indeed, by some estimates, as much as half of existing government debt will be almost impossible to retire, since savings bonds and state and  local government  series bonds often aren’t redeemed until maturity, and because many holders of long-term treasury bills will be unwilling to sell them back to the government. Factor in that surplus estimates keep getting revised upward, and government may well be forced to invest in private assets in just three or four years. How big could the hoard get? Investing that much public money would likely mean the government purchase of stocks, because only equity markets are large enough to absorb such inflows and still remain liquid. Assuming the Treasury begins to invest surpluses in the stock market as soon as it has retired all the debt that it can, and that these investments earn a 10 percent annual return, our government will be sitting on a stock-market portfolio worth $20 trillion by 2020. To put that in perspective, the current market value of all equities in the U.S. is about $17 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve. Projecting forward, the U.S. government could own about one-fifth of all domestic equities by 2020. Allowing  the government  to own  that much of the private economy is an invitation to unbounded mischief. Firms will lobby to be put on the list of acceptable investments; those firms or assets left off will suffer hardship. Calls to sell firms that aren’t ‘‘green’’ or that fail to pass litmus tests will become the latest in political lobbying. Which is why Mr. Greenspan stated  flatly:  ‘‘The  federal government should eschew private asset accumulation because it would be exceptionally difficult to insulate the government’s investment decisions  from political pressures.’’ The risks are just too great. His argument on Thursday caught Democrats flat-footed. Sen. ERNESTHOLLINGS of South Carolina told Mr. Greenspan that ‘‘in all candor, you shock me with your statement.’’ An apoplectic Sen.

33,Senate,107,-0.352,89,2001-02-07,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, the powerful earthquake which recently devastated India’s densely populated western state of Gujarat has focused our attention, once again, on India. Gujarat officials estimate that 28,000 to 30,000 people have died. Thousands more have been  injured, and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. In response to India’s dire need for help, USAID has sent blankets, generators, water containers, plastic sheeting, food, and other relief supplies—all part of our official commitment to provide some $10 million in emergency humanitarian aid. But in my view this is not enough. We can and  should do more. In the initial phase of this disaster when India particularly needed search and rescue teams and medical assistance, the United States was conspicuous in its absence. The Russians, the Brits, the Swiss and others were engaged in pulling people out of the rubble. We were not. At least half a dozen countries,  including Denmark, Israel, and Sweden, sent field hospitals, doctors and medical personnel. We did not. Given our slow start, it is especially important for the United States to be particularly generous when  it comes to reconstruction. Indian-Americans, on the other hand, have moved quickly to mobilize their own  relief effort—collecting  sizeable donations and medical supplies as well as assembling teams of doctors. Reflecting the depth of concern among Americans  for the tragedy that has struck  India, President Bush,  last week, made a condolence call to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. I commend  the President  for making this call, not only because it was the right  thing  to  do  under  the  circumstances, but also because it was an important gesture by the new Administration toward a country in a region that the United States tends to ignore, except in times of crisis. Regrettably the Clinton Administration paid little attention to developments in South Asia until May 1998, when India broke its 25 year moratorium on nuclear testing with five underground tests. Taken by surprise, the Administration tried—to no avail—to persuade Pakistan not to test in response. Confronted with escalating tensions not only in the nuclear realm but on the ground over Kashmir, the Administration was  forced to  focus on growing  instability  in  the  subcontinent.

34,,107,-0.513,96,2001-02-07,Mrs. MINK of Hawaii.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a bill that would provide Social Security disability beneficiaries with severe spinal cord injuries the same protections as are afforded the blind. Many people who suffer from spinal cord injuries are unable to earn a living, and receive Social Security disability. My legislation seeks to help those who have overcome their debilitating injury, and are able to work. Under current law, recipients of Social Security disability are eligible for benefits if they are unable to earn no more than the Substantial Gainful Activity  (SGA) amount, which  is $740/month. The Senior Citizens’ Right to Work Act of 1995 increased the SGA amount for blind individuals to $1000/month. The provision allows blind individuals to qualify for Social Security disability even if their income is $1000/month. In 2001, the monthly SGA amount was raised to $1,240/month. My bill would raise the SGA amount for persons with spinal cord injuries to $1,240/month. These individuals should not be discouraged from earning  income  that could supplement their disability payments. Social Security disability benefits should not be withdrawn from persons with spinal cord injuries because they have the courage to return to work. I urge my colleagues to join as cosponsors of this legislation. f ON THE  INTRODUCTION OF THE COMMUNITY ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2001 HON. GENE GREEN OFTEXAS INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, February 7, 2001 ",2001
35,,107,-0.324,96,2001-02-07,Mr. GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Community Access to Health Care Act of 2001, legislation I am introducing  to help our states and communities deal with the crisis of the uninsured. More than 42 million Americans do not have health insurance and this number is increasing by over a million persons a year. Most of the uninsured are working people and their children— nearly 74 percent are families with fulltime workers. Low  income Americans,  those who earn less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level or $27,300 for a family of three, are the most likely to be uninsured. Texas is a leader nationally in the number of  insured,  ranking second only  to Arizona. About 4 million persons, or 26.8 percent of our non-elderly population, are without health insurance. The uninsured and under-insured tend to be more expensive  to  treat because  they  fall through the cracks of our health care system. The uninsured and under-insured often can’t afford to see the doctor for routine physicals and preventive medicine. Consequently, they arrive  in  the emergency  room with costlier, often preventable, health problems. Research by the Kaiser Family Foundation underscores this problem. Nearly 40 percent of uninsured adults skip a recommended medical test or treatment, and 20 percent say they have needed but not received care for a serious problem in the past year. Kaiser also reports that uninsured children are at least 70 percent less likely to receive preventive care. Uninsured adults are more  than 30 percent less likely to have had a check-up in the past year, uninsured men 40 percent less likely to have had a prostate exam and uninsured women 60 percent less likely to have had a mammogram than compared to the insured. This broken health care system yields dangerous, sometimes deadly results. The uninsured are at least 50 percent more likely than the  insured  to be hospitalized  for conditions such as pneumonia and diabetes. Death rates from breast cancer are higher  for  the uninsured than for those with insurance. Our Nation’s health care safety net is in dire need of repair. Communities across the country are identifying ways to better tend to the uninsured, to provide preventive, primary and emergency clinical health services in an integrated and coordinated manner. This kind of service can only be accomplished, however, if our safety net providers have the resources to improve communication  to better  reach  this target population. The Community Access Program (CAP) promotes  this kind of  interagency coordination and communication. It stems from a very successful Robert Wood  Johnson Foundationfunded project that demonstrated how community collaboration can increase access to quality, cost-effective health care. The Community Access to Health Care Act of 2001 provides competitive grants  to assist communities  in developing programs to better serve their uninsured population. Funding under CAP can be used to support a variety of projects to improve access for all levels of care for the uninsured and under-insured. Each community designs a program that best addresses the needs of its uninsured and under insured and its providers. Funding is intended to encourage safety net providers to develop coordinated care systems for the target population. The Clinton Administration created a $25 million CAP demonstration project in FY 2000. More than two hundred applications were submitted by groups from 46 states and the District of Columbia. Applications were evenly distributed between urban and rural areas; and six were submitted by tribal organizations. Funding in FY 2000 provided grants to 23 communities. An  increase  to $125 million  in FY 2001 will make grants available to an additional 55 projects. While  this  increase has helped communities get their program off the ground, more can be done to ensure that future funding is available. I would  like  to highlight one program,  the Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services Department, in my hometown of Houston, TX. This program is a good example of how CAP funds can improve a community’s health  care network. Harris County, Texas  is  the  third most populated county  in the nation and the most populated county in the state with approximately 3.2 million residents. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission estimated that in 1999, 25.5 percent of the total population in Harris County— 834,867— was uninsured. Harris County’s CAP project aims to assist three populations: Those with incomes under 200 percent of the Federal poverty  level;  those with  incomes over 200 percent of the Federal poverty level; and those who are under insured. The primary focus of this project is to improve the interagency communication and referral infrastructure of major health care systems in the city. This will improve their ability to provide preventive, primary and emergency clinical health services  in an  integrated and coordinated manner  for  the uninsured and under  insured population.

36,House,107,0.433,4,2001-02-13,Mr. GRAVES.," Mr. Speaker, for over 30 years, the Social Security and Medicare Part A trust funds have been used to distort the budget surplus numbers and mask deficits. This must not continue. Today we have the opportunity to cast a vote that will end this shortsighted and fiscally irresponsible practice. Today we have the opportunity to lock away all surpluses in the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and ensure that these funds can only be spent to provide retirement and health care security for our seniors. Mr. Speaker, the first step to saving Social Security and Medicare is to stop spending it on unrelated government programs. This is an essential first step to preserve and strengthen these programs for current and future retirees. I urge my colleagues to send a clear message to all Americans and end the raid on Social Security and Medicare. f PROTECTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE (Mr. OTTER asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2001
37,House,107,0.692,4,2001-02-13,Mr. OTTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today in support of H.R. 2, the Social Security and Medicare Lockbox Act of 2001. This measure  guarantees  that every penny paid into the Social Security and Medicare trust funds will be secure for the millions of seniors, including my  85-year-old mother  in Nampa, Idaho, who rely on them today. It is also an important first step in shoring up the funds for young workers who will rely on them in the years to come. But, Mr. Speaker,  there  is much more to do. And  I  look  forward to working with the new administration and reforming Social Security to ensure that we keep our promise to those current beneficiaries and to those who are soon to retire, and just as importantly, to guarantee to those younger workers that they will get them when they reach their retirement age. Mr. Speaker, we should also work to repeal the tax on senior citizens that was placed there by the last administration. H.R. 2 is a much-needed sign that the Federal government is keeping its commitment to senior citizens by  creating  a Social Security  and Medicare Trust Lockbox to buttress these dollars against spending raids. Our action today sends a strong message that saving Social Security and Medicare is a top priority of this Congress. The senior citizens that have contributed so much of their lives to our country deserve the comfort and the peace of mind that their country is there and will be there for them because they were there for us. It is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that we will move quickly to accept this legislation. ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. LAHOOD).

42,House,107,-0.631,18,2001-02-13,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong support for the purported purpose of this legislation before us  today. We can and should lockbox’  our Social Security and Medicare surpluses so that monies put into them by the working people of America are used as they were intended— to provide financial and health security for them in their senior years or if they become disabled— not to provide a tax break aimed mostly at those with upper incomes. Unfortuantely, the bill before us today talks the talk, but fails to walk the walk. This bill will not guarantee  that either  the Social Security or Medicare surpluses are protected from being used to finance tax breaks or any other government spending. While the bill states that it protects Medicare and Social Security  trust  funds,  it creates a giant exception that if a bill is brought up on the House floor that contains the words ‘ ‘Social Security reform legislation’  or ‘ ‘Medicare reform legislation,’  then the protections for either trust fund no longer exist. It doesn’t define what would constitute ‘ reform’  of either program. It would be very simple for anyone to circumvent the stated intent of this bill by simply referring to legislation as either Medicare or Social Security reform and then the protections against using the trust funds would be overridden. I could see the argument that a ‘Star Wars’  missile defense system will protect seniors— therefore it is a Medicare reform. The  legislation contains a  further  loophole that allows the President to dip into the Social Security and/or Medicare surpluses  in any budget he presents to Congress as long as the budget claims to reform each of the programs. The public should not be  fooled one moment. President Bush is pushing a tax cut proposal in Congress that he admits costs $1.6 trillion. The unstated  reality  is  that  the proposal costs $2.5 trillion by the time you count all of the pieces that he’s left out of his early version, but that will be included in the end. The entire surplus over the next ten years— if you really protect Medicare and Social Security surpluses— is $2.7 trillion (and even that figure is highly speculative). What am I leading up to? There is no way that this tax cut package can pass Congress and get signed into law in a way that leaves money for other government priorities like education, Medicare prescription drug coverage, improved Medicare solvency, or Social Security reform without putting  the Medicare and Social Security  trust  funds on  the chopping block. Anyone who believes otherwise  is  fooling themselves and passage of  this  legislation today does nothing to change that fact. Larry Lindsey, President Bush’s chief economic advisor has already been asked whether government should dip into the Social Security surplus to make room for tax cuts and he responded: ‘ It’s a question that needs to be asked.’ President Bush’s Director of  the Office of Management and Budget Mitch Daniels has already stated with  regard  to protecting  the Medicare trust fund from any other use that he would be: ‘ ‘very hesitant to treat those funds in the same way as we do in Social Security where I think it is in order.’ A February 5 Wall Street Journal article states  that,  ‘The Bush Administration also won’t wall off Medicare’s current surpluses in a ‘ lockbox’ . . . In fact, Mr. Daniels has said he’s told his staff not to talk about a Medicare surplus. Finally, Senate Majority Leader TRENTLOTT has yet to make a commitment on a Medicare lockbox. A recent BNA Daily Report for Executives, asked him about whether he’d decided to  lockbox Medicare  and  he  responded, ‘We’re going to think that through.’ I will vote for this legislation today. But, I do so with the firm knowledge that my vote— and that of every other member of the House of Representatives— really means nothing about whether we stand for protecting the Medicare and Social Security surpluses  for  their  intended purposes. I hope that the weaknesses of the legislation are not intended and that this vote is a good faith commitment by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to protect both  the Social Security and Medicare surpluses from use for tax cuts or any other new spending.  If  that commitment  is  real, we’ve got a tough job in front of us to ensure that the upcoming tax cut debate doesn’t absorb all available government monies— in addition to the Medicare and Social Security trust funds. Mr. THOMAS M. DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2, the Social Security and Medicare Lock Box Act of 2001. I would also like to thank my colleague, Congressman WALLYHERGER, for taking the lead yet again in ensuring that common-sense measures are  taken  to preserve the Social Security and Medicare Part A programs for our senior citizens. Currently,  both  the Social Security  and Medicare Part A programs take in more revenue through taxes and premiums than they pay out in benefits. This has resulted in large surpluses in both Trust Funds, estimated to be $157 billion for Social Security and $29 billion for Medicare. However, as  the Baby Boom generation reaches retirement age, the situation changes significantly. Over  the coming years we will see a decrease in the ratio of workers to beneficiaries from 5-to-1 to 2-to-1, causing a precipitous decline in the amounts held in both Trust Funds. By the year 2037, it is estimated that the combined Social Security Trust Funds will be depleted, with revenues only sufficient to pay about 72 percent of benefits. The situation for Medicare is even more dire, with the Part A Trust Fund projected to be depleted by 2025. We cannot simply put off the difficult decisions for a later day. It is clear that we can enact significant  reforms now  that are necessary to keep Social Security and Medicare solvent for the future. It is also evident that while this is a challenging task in and of itself, it will be even more difficult, if not impossible, if we allow  the surpluses  that we currently have to be raided for other government spending. To this end, H.R. 2 creates a lockbox by creating a point of order against any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that would raid either the Social Security or Medicare Trust Fund. This lockbox ensures that the Trust Fund surpluses will only be used to further pay down our national debt or to strengthen these vital programs for our children and grandchildren. This is a modest, common-sense step  to help preserve social security benefits for future retirees. We have an obligation to keep our promises to our senior citizens. They have paid into Social Security and Medicare over the course of their working  lives  in  the expectation  that these benefits would be there to help support them in their later years. We do them a severe injustice  if  financial mismanagement on our part robs them of the security they deserve. By approving H.R. 2, we will show the American people that we remain committed to saving  these  invaluable programs.  It  is  for  this reason  that  I urge my colleagues  to  lend  it their full support. ",2001
43,House,107,-0.348,18,2001-02-13,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  the Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Lockbox Act. Passage of this legislation will make certain that the Social Security and Medicare surpluses are protected in a ‘‘lock-box’’ and are not affected by spending increases and tax cuts. However, the Medicare surplus is not taken off-budget by this bill and therefore is not ensured the same protection as the Social Security surplus under current budget rules. This is a critical flaw in this bill and I do not believe that H.R. 2 alone will solve the long-term challenges facing Medicare. Nevertheless, I support passage of the Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Lockbox Act of 2001 and will remain committed to protecting these surpluses. I believe  it  is absolutely essential that we maintain our fiscal discipline and continue paying down our debt. We must provide resources to deal with long term problems facing Social Security and Medicare, while making room for targeted tax cuts and investments in priority programs. I am also proud to have joined my colleagues, MIKE and DENNIS MOORE, in introducing H.R. 560, a bill that would take Medicare off-budget, giving it the same protected status as Social Security, and would lock away Medicare surpluses unless they are to be used for current Medicare programs. While I support the bill before us, our bill has a much stronger enforcement mechanism and would be even more difficult, if not impossible, to violate. ",2001

45,House,107,-0.092,39,2001-02-13,Mr. SHOWS.," Mr. Speaker, in a major legal development this past Thursday, a U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of a lawsuit filed by the class act group of the military retirees. In the case of Schism versus the United States, the court  found that there is, in fact, a broken promise between the United States Government and thousands of military retirees and their families. This suit was filed on behalf of military retirees who were recruited into the service with a promise that lifetime health care would be provided to them if they served a career of at least 20 years. The class act represents retirees who entered the service prior to June 7, 1956. That was the day Congress enacted the first military retiree health care plan, which today we know it as Champus or TRICARE. Enactment of those health care plans actually  stripped  away health  care that had been promised to these recruits and which had been routinely delivered. After June 7, 1956, statutes no longer obligated the government to provide health care to military retirees, but health care that  is now provided at military bases on a  space-available basis is out of reach for many retirees, due to base closures and downsizing, and that  is assuming that space  is available which is not always the case. Here are a few choice quotes from the appeals court decision. The retirees entered active duty in the Armed Forces and completed at least 20 years of service on the good faith that the government would fulfill its promises. The terms of the contract were set when the retirees entered the service and fulfilled their obligation. The government cannot unilaterally amend the contract terms now. The government breached  its  implied-in-fact contract with the retirees when it failed to provide them with health care benefits at no cost. Congress was without power to reduce expenditures by abrogating contractual  obligations  of  the United States. To abrogate contracts, in the attempt to lessen government expenditure, would not be the practice of economy, but an act of repudiation. The case has been remanded to a lower  court  to  determine  damages. Such damages could result in billions and billions of Federal dollars being awarded to millions of military retirees and their families, particularly if damages are rewarded to retirees who fall beyond the scope of the class act group. What does this mean to us in Congress? The  court  decision  validates what I had been saying since 1999 when I introduced the Keep Our Promise to America’s Military Retirees Act. The appeals court decision gives us the opportunity to act now and restore health equity to military retirees who now have the courts on their side, and we can do it without busting our budget. We must pass H.R. 179, the Keep Our Promise Act. It acknowledges the broken promise of  lifetime health care by providing military retirees within the class act group with fully-paid Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan eligibility, and allows all other military retirees to participate  in the FEHBP,  just  like any other Federal employee. Mr. Speaker, but if they are happy with TRICARE,  the military health plan, they can stay with it, Congress passed that part of the Keep Our Promise Act last year. If we pass this bill, the U.S. government will have responded to the court, and we will have acknowledged and made good on the broken promise to our America’s military retirees. We must do  the  right  thing and quickly enact H.R. 179 into law. f IN SUPPORT OF BIPARTISAN PATIENT PROTECTION ACT OF 2001 The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. SIMPSON). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 5 minutes. ",2001
46,House,107,-0.324,39,2001-02-13,Mr. GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act, which was introduced last week by the gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr. DINGELL), the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. GANSKE), Senator JOHNMCCAIN, and Senator TEDKENNEDY. I am proud to be part of the bipartisan coalition that hopefully will finally enact a strong Patients’ Bill of Rights. Mr. Speaker, Americans have been clamoring for a Managed Care Reform for a number of years. They want Congress to enact  legislation that puts medical decision-making back in the hands of doctors and patients. They want legislation that provides meaningful accountability.  In short, they want  the Dingell-Ganske Bipartisan Patient Protection Act of 2001. This legislation provides patient protections that are very similar to those that have been the law in my home State of Texas since 1997. A recent article in Texas in the magazine  ‘‘Texas Medicine’’ outlines the success  of  the  independent  appeals process as part of the HMO reform. As the article references, a provision of the law has been particularly effective in providing patients with real protections.

47,House,107,-0.402,53,2001-02-13,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for coming down here and joining me, as he has on so many other occasions. Quickly, the gentleman is absolutely right, we have been talking about this for 4 years. I think we were very hopeful during the campaign when we heard President Bush then talk about these issues, the HMO reform, prescription drug benefit, that we were going to see quick action on it. Even in the beginning of the Congress, at the time of his inauguration a month ago, it seemed like this was going to be a priority. We have heard very little about it. We have heard about the tax cuts, about defense spending, we have heard about a lot of other issues. When he unveiled his prescription drug benefit, it was almost like it was not even important.  I  just  hope  that  that  turns around, but we are certainly going to make sure that turns around. I thank the gentleman. f BLACK HISTORY MONTH The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. CULBERSON). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2001, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. JONES) is recognized for 40 minutes, the remainder of the time, as the designee of the minority leader. ",2001
48,House,107,-0.521,53,2001-02-13,Mrs. JONES of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman  from  New  Jersey  (Mr. PALLONE). He has  stood up on  this issue. Last year was my first term in the U.S. Congress, and there was not a greater voice on the issue of health care than that of the gentleman from New Jersey. I appreciate the gentleman yielding the balance of this hour as we celebrate Black History Month this year, and I thank the gentleman, who should let me know when he needs a speaker and I will be there for him. Mr. Speaker, Black History Month is an excellent time for reflection, assessment,  and  planning. A  full understanding of our history is a necessary and crucial part of comprehending our present circumstances and crafting our futures. An understanding of our history helps illuminate and inform the present discussions concerning voter rights, particularly the travesty we recently witnessed in Florida, a social, political, and legal travesty ultimately sanctioned by the United States Supreme Court. At this time, the subject matter of our special order is black history. We are going to be talking about voting rights, and historically, the disenfranchisement that occurred through the years. It gives me great pleasure to yield to the  gentlewoman  from Texas  (Ms. the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. ",2001

93,Senate,107,0.548,81,2001-02-13,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I would like  to turn my attention this afternoon to  something a little bit more immediate  in terms of the Senate’s actions. We all  saw the news yesterday of the President’s visit to Fort Stewart in Georgia.  In fact, I spoke with a colleague of ours  who had been with the President on  that trip. She talked about the rather  sorry state of the military barracks  she visited, and the need for improvements to the military quality of life all  around the country, exemplified by the  President’s visit to Fort Stewart.  As a result of his visit, the President  has made some very  forward-leaning  announcements about improvement of  the quality of life, including $5.7 billion  in new spending—$1.4 billion for military pay increases, $400 million to improve military housing, $3.9 billion to  improve military health benefits, $5.7  billion on new spending for the people  in our military. I am certain that part  of that will have to come through a so-  called  supplemental  appropriations  bill.  For those who are not totally familiar with the work of the Senate, ordinarily at about this time of the year,  the Senate has to provide some infusion of cash to the military because of  unforeseen expenditures and some that  really were  not  so  unforeseen  but  which were not budgeted for. For example, we know we will have to be in  Bosnia and Kosovo and  some other  places in the world. Unfortunately, the  previous administration never budgeted for those operations in advance, so  the military had to pay for those operations out of hide.  They had to not buy certain spare  parts, not  sail  ships during certain  hours, not provide for maintenance of  facilities and  installations, deferring  that for a later day, and use the money  instead  to  support  these operations  abroad. Each year, we have had, therefore,  a  supplemental  appropriations  bill. Basically, the bill comes due. It  has to be paid one way or another,  sooner or later. We will have to do that  same thing this year.  The President has decided to wait a  little bit to make sure he knows exactly how much is needed. By the way,  I hope President Bush will say to the  Congress: I found out that we need exactly—and then give us the number.  Let’s assume it is $5 billion, for the  sake of argument—I would  like the  Congress to provide $5 billion in supplemental appropriations to get our military through the end of the fiscal year.  That is how much we need, and I will  veto a bill that is a dollar less or a dollar more.  In other words, this should not become a Christmas tree for everyone’s  favorite project. I urge the President to  give us an exact figure and tell us it is  on our shoulders to pass that supplemental appropriations bill for him, for  the military, and to reject any change  we may make, therefore, removing the  temptation  some  of  our  colleagues  have to load those bills up with things  that don’t really pertain to necessities  for the military.  I also want to suggest that we are  going to need that supplemental appropriations bill not just for the quality of  life of our military but for readiness.  Certainly, the Presiding Officer knows  this better than almost anybody in this  body. Readiness has suffered during the  last several years through a combination of  two primary  circumstances.  One, we are deploying troops far more  frequently and  far-flung around  the  world than in the past. Two, we have  cut the spending year after year, so we  don’t have the equipment in top shape  to send where we need to send it, when  we need to send it. Our troops are overstressed. The net result  is readiness  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:26 Dec 20, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\ODA425(cid:1)997-2008-FILES-4-SS-PROJECT€1-S ",2001
94,Senate,107,-0.45,88,2001-02-13,Mrs. BOXER.," I thank the Chair.  I hope everyone will  look at that  Kevin Phillips commentary I just read  into the RECORD. It is very instructive.  I have told my colleagues why this is  not a compassionate tax cut. It ignores  99 percent of the taxpayers, essentially,  and gives almost everything, or way  too much,  to  the very  few of  the  wealthiest people in this country, the  biggest break going to those who earn  close to $1 million a year.  Let me tell my colleagues why it also  is not compassionate. It is so large, it  is so big, it is so huge, there will not be  enough left over for the things we need  to do to protect Social Security so that  these kids who are Senate pages now  will have a Social Security system, to  add  a  prescription  drug  benefit  to  Medicare that everyone seems to want.  We don’t have the money for that. To  really invest in education, in early education, in after school, in school construction, and in smaller class sizes, we  are not going to have money for that,  nor to clean up our environment, to fix  up our parklands—we could go on—to  have a decent air traffic control system  that is safe. It is not compassionate because it takes from that.  What about  it not being conservative? That is something we have to  talk about. The fact is, not only will  we not have money for the priorities  the American people want, but the plan  leaves nothing to pay down the debt  over the long run. That is not conservative. Show me one family who does  not  think about a  rainy day: Gee,  honey, what if something goes wrong  next year? Maybe we should save a few  dollars. Gee,  I am a  little worried,  Tommy doesn’t look so great. Maybe  we need to spend a little of our savings  on a second opinion and take him to a  doctor outside the HMO. Thank goodness we saved a little bit.  What about the families now across  this country who are looking at their  natural gas bills—the natural gas that  heats their home? They are in shock at  seeing a twofold increase, a threefold  increase. Those families are going to  have to save from somewhere to pay  those bills. We have a 10-year boondoggle tax cut that leaves nothing for  emergencies, that counts on forecasts  that are going to be as crazy as the  weather forecasts.  I am hopeful that we can get some bipartisanship here.  I  find  it amazing  that only a couple of my Republican  friends have said this tax cut is too big.  I am happy they have. But where is the  chorus from people on that side who  say they are conservative? How can a  true conservative go back to deficits as  far as the eye can see? How can a true  conservative go back to debt as far as  the eye can see, to force our children to  inherit a debt and have to pay a billion  dollars a day or more to finance that  debt? That is not conservative.  Let’s go back to the drawing boards,  I say to the President. Let’s come up  with a compassionate and a conservative budget, one that rests on a few  foundations that I will talk about.  I ask unanimous consent to proceed  for 10 more minutes.  ",2001

96,Senate,107,-0.374,144,2001-02-13,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, today I  join with Senator HATCHand Senators  BIDEN, DEWINE, and THURMOND to introduce  the Drug Abuse Education,  Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2001.  This bill provides a comprehensive approach to drug treatment, prevention,  and enforcement. It is my hope that  the innovative programs established by  this legislation will assist all of our  States in their efforts to address the  drug problems that most affect our  communities.  No community is immune from the  ravages of drug abuse. My own State of  Vermont has one of the lowest crime  rates in the nation, yet we are experiencing serious troubles because of the  abuse of heroin and other drugs. Recent estimates indicate that heroin use  in Vermont has doubled  in  just the  past three years, and the number of  people  seeking  drug  treatment  has  risen even more rapidly. The average  age of a first-time heroin user dropped  from 27 to 17 during the 1990s, signaling  a sharp rise in teenage drug abuse. The  consequences of this rise have made  themselves all too clear over the past  months.  On January 3, Christal Jones, a 16-  year-old  girl  from Burlington, was  murdered in New York City. According  to news reports, she was recruited in  Burlington to move to New York and  become part of a prostitution ring, and  she was motivated by a desire to get  money to buy heroin. When she died,  drugs were found in her body, although  they were not the cause of her death.  And Christal Jones’ tragedy apparently  is not unique as many as a dozen  Vermont girls may have been involved  in this New York ring. And since her  death, others have come forward to say  that teenage girls  in Burlington are  prostituting themselves to get money  to buy heroin.  These disturbing reports followed by  only a few months a heinous drug-related  triple  murder  in  Rutland,  Vermont.  In  that  case,  20-year-olds  Robert Lee and Donald Fell reportedly  spent the night drinking and taking  crack  cocaine,  and  then  allegedly  killed Fell’s mother and her  friend.  Looking to get out of Vermont, they  then allegedly carjacked a woman arriving for work at a local supermarket  and drove to New York, where they are  accused of beating her to death. Such a  case surely deserves a strong law enforcement response, and last Thursday  the accused were indicted by a federal  grand jury for carjacking resulting in  death and kidnapping, among other  charges.  Such violence is rarely visited upon  my State. When it is, a swift law enforcement response is necessary, and  we must do what we can to support the  efforts of law enforcement to safeguard  our communities. But we kid ourselves  if we  think  that  law  enforcement  alone, with ever-increasing penalties,  is the answer to the drug problem.  Though effective enforcement of our  drug  laws, particularly  to deter  involvement of our young people, is a  critical component, this is simply insufficient to meet the severe social effects of drug abuse. We need to provide  a comprehensive approach to the drug  problems of my State and our nation.  In Vermont, as the Rutland Daily Herald recently editorialized, on January  26, 2001,  ‘‘agencies that treat addictions’’ need ‘‘a boost in resources and  manpower.’’ Those who work to prevent drug abuse from occurring in the  first place need our strong support.  I have tried to boost Vermont’s anti-  drug efforts by working  to provide  funding for drug prevention, law enforcement,  and  drug  treatment  projects. For example, I secured funding for the Vermont Coalition of Teen  Centers in last year’s Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. These  teen  centers  give  adolescent  Vermonters  recreational alternatives  to drug use. I was also able to help provide  significant  funding  for  the  Vermont  Multi-Jurisdictional  Drug  Task Force, facilitating the ability of  law enforcement officials to work together to tackle Vermont’s drug problems. In addition, at my request Congress approved substantial funding for  Vermont to plan and establish a long-  term residential treatment facility for  adolescents.  I believe that the bill I  introduce  today with Senator HATCHwill build  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:26 Dec 20, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\ODA425(cid:1)997-2008-FILES-4-SS-PROJECT€1-S ",2001
97,Senate,107,0.404,165,2001-02-13,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr.  President,  today I rise to introduce, with my colleagues Senators GREGG, FRIST, MILLER, LOTT, DEWINE, ENZI, HUTCHINSON,  SESSIONS, and CARPER, The Paul D.  Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection  Act. This important legislation extends  protections from frivolous lawsuits to  teachers,  principals,  administrators,  and other education professionals who  are acting within the scope of their  professional responsibilities.  The Teacher Liability Protection Act  builds upon the good work Congress  began in 1997 when it enacted the Volunteer Protection Act. As you may recall, the Volunteer Protection Act provides liability protections to individuals serving their communities as volunteers. After bringing several volunteer protection amendments  to  the  floor throughout the 1990’s and introducing the Volunteer Protection Act  during the 104th Congress, I was honored to work with our colleague, Senator Paul Coverdell, to steer this measure through the 105th Congress and  have it enacted in 1997.  Now, we need to extend similar liability  protections  to  our  nation’s  teachers, principals, and education professionals who are responsible for the  safety of our children when they are at  school.  Everyone agrees  that providing a  safe, orderly environment is a critical  component of ensuring that every child  is able to reach their full academic potential. Teachers who are unable to  maintain order in the classroom cannot reasonably be expected to share  their knowledge with  their  pupils,  whether it be in math, science, or literature. Disruptive, rowdy, and sometimes violent students not only threaten the immediate safety of their classmates, they threaten the very future of  our children by denying them the opportunity to learn.  Unfortunately,  teachers, principals,  and other education officials share an  impediment in their efforts to ensure  that students can learn in a safe, orderly learning environment: the fear of  lawsuits. All  too often,  these hard-  working professionals  find their reasonable actions to instill discipline and  maintain order are questioned and second guessed by opportunistic trial lawyers.  Today’s teachers will tell you that  the threat of litigation is in the back  of their minds and forces them at times  to act in a manner which might not be  in the best interests of their students.  A 1999 survey of secondary school principals found that 25 percent of the respondents were involved in lawsuits or  out-of-court  settlements  in  the previous two years—an amazing 270 percent increase from only ten years earlier. The same survey found that 20  percent of principals spent 5–10 hours a  week  in meetings  or  documenting  events in an effort to avoid litigation.  This is time that our educators should  spend counseling students, developing  curriculum, and maintaining order—  not fending off frivolous lawsuits.  The  legislation  is structured similarly to the Volunteer Protection Act  of 1997 and is nearly identical to teacher protection legislation introduced by  Paul Coverdell (S. 1721) in the 106th  Congress. Simply put, the bill extends  a national standard to protect from liability those teachers, principals, and  education professionals who act in a  reasonable manner to maintain order  in the classroom. It does not preempt  those States that have already taken  action to address this problem and it  allows any state legislature that disagrees with these strong protections to  opt out at any time. Since this bill  builds on Sen. Coverdell’s fine work,  my colleagues and I thought it would  be highly appropriate that it bear his  name.  At the same time, it is important to  note  that  this  legislation  is not a  ‘‘carte blanche’’ for that minuscule minority of school officials who abuse  their authority. The bill does not protect  those  teachers who  engage  in  ‘‘willful misconduct, gross negligence,  reckless misconduct, or a conscious  flagrant indifference to the rights or  safety’’ of a student. Nor does the bill  preclude schools or local law enforcement entities  from taking criminal,  civil, or administrative actions against  a teacher who acts improperly. Rather,  the bill is simply designed to protect  those  teachers, principals, and  educational professionals who act responsibly from frivolous lawsuits.  From a historical context, this is not  new ground for our colleagues in the  Senate. During  the  106th Congress,  Senator Coverdell sucessfully included  his legislation in the Senate’s verison  of the ESEA Reauthorization bill. Unfortunately, as we all know, efforts to  reauthorize the ESEA stalled on the  Senate floor. It is now appropriate for  the Senate to revisit this issue, and I  hope give its full endorsement.  I look forward to working with my  fellow original co- sponsors and the  rest of the Senate to see that these important protections are enacted  into  law on behalf of America’s hard working and dedicated teachers.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 316  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

98,Senate,107,-0.293,172,2001-02-13,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, I join  with Senator MCCAIN in co-sponsoring  the Airline Customer Service Improvement Act. The Commerce Committee  has spent a great deal of time seeking  ways to hold the air carriers accountable for their service and to force them  to do a better job. Deregulation was  supposed to make the carriers compete  for our business, but it has failed. We  now have hundreds of markets with no  competition, and without competition,  you get no service. Carriers have treated consumers like cattle in a stockyard, and that must end.  It is time to stand up for all travelers  and demand basic information, and to  expect service if we are paying the high  fares.  The Commerce Committee has held  three hearings, enlisted  the Department  of  Transportation’s  Inspector  General, and experienced the lack of  service,  first hand.  It  is not  complicated, but it does take a commitment from the industry to hire more  people and give them the tools to tell  consumers what is going on or why a  flight is canceled or delayed. Flights  delayed 30, 40 percent of the time, according to DOT statistics, or canceled  that often,  should be eliminated or  schedules changed.  Telling people truthfully what is happening,  providing  basic  necessities  when flights are delayed for hours on  end like they were in Detroit in January 1999, is not hard.  The chairman and I have waited patiently to proceed with legislation in  anticipation of a final report by the  Department  of Transportation’s  Inspector General, Ken Mead. The report,  released Monday,  is a blueprint  for  change. Mr. Mead and his staff, David  Dobbs, Lexi Stefani, Brian Dettleback,  and Scott Morris, worked  long and  hard to find the best way to make improvements in service.  The  report  notes  that  reducing  delays is a tough problem, requiring  funding and industry action. We have  an air transportation system in crisis,  from every angle, nonetheless that is  no excuse for poor service. There are  more people flying, more planes landing, an increase in delays (up 33% since  1995), a critical shortage of runways,  and airlines able to dictate the price  and quality of service offered in many  markets without regard to competition. Delays will continue to plague  the system, but the carriers know this,  and their Customer Service Commitments were done  in  light of known  problems. We will work with the industry on many facets of expanding capacity, but it is their job to improve service.  The carriers all to often want to cite  the government as the reason for their  problems. I do not buy that. These carriers have more data than virtually  any  industry,  and make  educated  guesses  on  pricing  and  scheduling  every day. They know the likelihood of  delays. Even weather, which is unpredictable on a daily basis, is something  they can anticipate. I know right now  we will have thunderstorms this summer, and snow storms next winter. How  will the carriers treat people during  those times? I know my flight is likely  to be delayed—the reasons may vary,  but the process by which you tell people basic  information should not be  hard. Some of the carriers have attempted improvements. At a hearing  last June, one carrier demonstrated a  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:26 Dec 20, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\ODA425(cid:1)997-2008-FILES-4-SS-PROJECT€1-S ",2001
99,Senate,107,0.068,179,2001-02-13,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I have  sought recognition today to introduce,  with my distinguished colleague, Senator HARKIN, an important resolution  calling for increased funding for the  National Institutes of Health, to keep  us on track to double NIH funding by  fiscal year 2003. Specifically, the resolution calls  for the  fiscal year 2002  budget resolution to include an additional $3.4 billion in the health function, to be allocated for biomedical research at the National Institutes of  Health.  As chairman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee for Labor, Health and  Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, I have said many times  that the National Institutes of Health  is the crown jewel of the Federal Government—perhaps the only jewel of the  Federal Government. When I came to  the Senate in 1981, NIH spending totaled $3.6 billion. Today,  funding  is  $20.3 billion. This money has been very  well spent, given that the advances realized by the National  Institutes of  Health has spawned tremendous breakthroughs in our knowledge and treatment for diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,  severe  mental  illnesses,  diabetes,  osteoporosis, heart disease, and many  others. It is clear that a substantial investment in the NIH is paying off and  that it is crucial that increased funding be continued in order to convert  these  advances  into  treatment  and  cures.  The effort to double NIH began on  May 21, 1997, when the Senate passed a  sense-of-the-Senate resolution stating  that  funding  for the National  Institutes of Health be doubled over five  years. Regrettably, even though the  resolution was  passed  by  an  overwhelming vote of 98 to nothing, the  Budget Resolution  contained a  $100  million reduction for health programs.  That  led  to  the  introduction of an  amendment to the resolution by myself  and Senator HARKINto add $1.1 billion  to carry out the expressed sense of the  Senate to increase NIH funding. Our  amendment, however, was defeated 63–  37. We were extremely disappointed  that, while the Senate had expressed  its druthers on a resolution, they were  simply unwilling to put up the actual  dollars to accomplish this vital goal.  The following year, during debate on  the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution,  Senator HARKINand I again introduced  an amendment to the budget resolution  which called for a $2 billion increase  for the National Institutes of Health.  While we gained more support on this  vote than  in the previous year, our  amendment was again defeated by a  vote of 57–41. Not to be deterred, Senator HARKINand I again went to work  with our Subcommittee and we were  able to add an additional $2 billion to  the NIH account for fiscal year 1999.  In fiscal year 2000, Senator HARKIN  and I again offered an amendment to  the budget resolution to add $1.4 billion  to the health accounts, over and above  the $600 million increase which had already been provided by  the Budget  Committee. Despite this amendment’s  defeat by a vote of 47–52, we were able  to provide in the appropriations bill a  $2.3 billion increase for fiscal year 2000.  Last year, Senator HARKINand I yet  again offered an amendment to the  budget resolution to increase funding  for health programs by  $1.6 billion.  This amendment passed by a vote of 55–  45. This victory brought the NIH increase to $2.7 billion for FY’01. However, after late night negotiations with  the House, the funding for NIH was cut  by $200 million below that amount.  This brief history of defeats and victories brings us to where we are today.  The amount necessary to keep us on  our track to double NIH funding will  require $3.4 billion for fiscal year 2002.  I believe that this goal can be achieved  if we make the proper allocation of our  resources.  Our investment has resulted in tremendous advances in medical research.  A new generation of AIDS drugs are reducing the presence of the AIDS virus  in HIV  infected  persons  to  nearly  undetectable levels. Death rates from  cancer have begun a steady decline.  With the sequencing of the human genome, we will begin, over the next few  years, to reap the benefits  in many  fields of research as analysis continues.  And if scientists are correct, stem cell  research could result  in a veritable  fountain of youth in replacing diseased  cells. I anxiously await the results of  all of these avenues of remarkable research.  I, like millions of Americans, have  benefited tremendously  from the  investment we have made in the National  Institutes of Health. That is why we  offer  this  resolution  today—to  call  upon the Budget Committee to include  the additional $3.4 billion to the health  accounts so we can carry forward the  important work of the National Institutes of Health.  f  AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO  MEET  COMMITTEEONARMEDSERVICES  ",2001

Ginny joined my staff on January 16, 1985, providing constituent service in my Burlington, Iowa, office. She and her late husband David owned  their own business  in Burlington and she had long been active in promoting tourism, the arts as well as the economy of southeastern Iowa. After  redistricting, Ginny helped open my Iowa City office in 1992, continuing to provide outstanding service to the residents of Iowa’s First Congressional District. All of my colleagues know how essential to the functioning of government is the ombudsman role in Congressional offices, and particularly caseworkers within them, play. For constituents with problems, be  it with veterans benefits, Social Security, Medicare or student loans, the federal bureaucracy can be a bewildering maze, the applicable laws and regulations often seemingly  irrational. An experienced, knowledgeable and sympathetic caseworker can be indispensable in getting the answers needed and problems resolved. In the 16 years she worked with me, Ginny epitomized the consummate professional and her file is fat with letters from Iowans thanking her for the help she provided. In recent years, as  immigration  casework  increased,  her knowledge of  immigration  law,  regulations, processes and paperwork has become  legendary. Equally well known has been her patience, both with harried staffers at INS and with newcomers to this country, unfamiliar with both its language and its ways.

101,,107,-0.465,200,2001-02-13,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise to announce the reintroduction of the Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act. Yesterday, scientific and scholarly articles were published that explored the implications of the mapping of the human genome. Their conclusions were nothing short of awe-inspiring. The human genome map is going to allow us to explore and better understand not only human health and disease, but the very development of our species.  It has  tremendous promise to allow us to conquer some of the most feared diseases known to humanity and perhaps to manipulate our very destiny. It is a story of our present, past, and future. The Romans had a famous saying: Scientia est  potentia.  Knowledge  is  power.  From scientia we derive the English word science. Like any kind of power, however, the scientific knowledge we are gaining about our genetic composition can be used for both positive and negative ends.  If used wisely,  it could be a tool  for health and healing  that shapes  the very future of our race. If used foolishly, however, it could become a weapon to undermine individuals’  futures,  create  further divisions among groups of people, and tear at the very fabric of our nation. Over  five years ago,  I  introduced  the  first legislation in Congress to ban genetic discrimination  in health  insurance. Since  that  time, science has rocketed ahead at a speed no one predicted, even within the genetics community. Social policy, however, has not kept pace. Congress addressed the use of genetic information in passing through the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, but this law covered only some cases of health insurance discrimination. A comprehensive  law  is  needed  to  protect Americans against the misuse of their genetic information. For that reason, I am introducing the Genetic Nondiscrimination  in Health  Insurance and Employment Act of 2001. l am pleased to be joined by my distinguished colleague, Representative CONSTANCEMORELLA, who  represents the National Institutes of Health and has a long record of achievement and advocacy in the health care arena, and 150 bipartisan cosponsors. In the Senate, identical legislation is being introduced by Minority Leader and Senators EDWARD KENTOM DASCHLE NEDY, CHRISTOPHERDODD, and TOMHARKIN, as well as a  Senators. long  list of other distinguished The events of the past few days have illustrated the urgent need for this legislation all too well. In addition to the events concerning the mapping of the human genome, we have learned  that Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway performed genetic tests on employees without their knowledge or consent. The tests were conducted with the goal of identifying a predisposition for carpal tunnel syndrome and thereby undermining those employees’ claims of job-related injuries. Unfortunately, this was not the first case of such genetic testing and potential discrimination. From the 1960s until 1993, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory secretly tested black employees for sickle cell anemia, until workers filed a lawsuit that resulted in a 1998 decision by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that this practice was unconstitutional. During  the  late  1990s,  a study conducted by Northwestern National Life Insurance  found  that, by  the year 2000, 15 percent of employers planned to check the genetic status of prospective employees and dependents before making employment offers. Last year,  the American Management Association’s survey of medical testing in the workplace found that 3% of responding employers admitted  they  tested employees  for breast and/or colon cancer, 1% tested for sickle cell anemia, and a handful tested for Huntington’s Disease. Moreover, 18% collected family medical histories, and about 5% stated that they use this information in making decisions about hiring, firing, and reassignment. This  legislation would prevent employers from using predictive genetic  information  to make employment decisions. It would further prevent employers from requesting or requiring that workers disclose genetic information or take a genetic test. Finally, employers are barred  from  disclosing  genetic  information without prior written informed consent. The Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act would also address discrimination in health coverage based on genetic information. Too many Americans are deciding not  to  take a genetic  test because they are afraid the information could be used by their insurer to deny them coverage or raise their rates to unaffordable levels. Vital medical decisions like these should be made based on solid science and personal reflection, not the fear of insurance discrimination. This legislation would prohibit insurers from requesting or  requiring  that an  individual disclose genetic  information.  It would prevent health insurance companies from using this information to deny, cancel, refuse to renew, or change the terms or conditions of coverage. Finally, it would protect the privacy of genetic information by  forbidding  insurers  from disclosing it to outside parties without prior written informed consent. Simply having a given gene almost never means that a person will definitely develop a condition. Furthermore, every human being has between 5 and 50 genetic mutations that predispose him or her  to disease. No one should lose their insurance coverage or their job based on the fact that she might develop cancer or some other disorder in 10, 20, or 30 years. Genetic science has the potential to transform human health and open entirely new frontiers. We must safeguard the future of this research by ensuring that genetic information cannot be abused. Americans will not continue to support genetic science if they believe the knowledge gained will be used against them. We can protect  the  future of genetic  research and secure the rights of all Americans by passing  the Genetic Nondiscrimination  in Health Insurance and Employment Act. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure  that Congress passes  this responsible, comprehensive genetic nondiscrimination and privacy law. f ON PRIME MINISTER CHRE´TIEN’S SPEECH TO THE OAS HON.

The speech outlined his vision for the upcoming Third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City, specifically how  the nations of the hemisphere can ‘ ‘move ahead on an agenda of human progress and shared prosperity’ to create ‘ ‘La Gran Familia of the Americas.’ These ideas are likely to serve as the guideposts for the bilateral and multilateral relationships evolving throughout the Americas, and I urge all of my colleagues to take the time to read the following speech. ADDRESSTOASPECIALSESSIONOFTHEPERMANENTCOUNCILOFTHEORGANIZATIONOF AMERICANSTATES—FEBRUARY5, 2001 The  first address by a Canadian Prime Minister to the Organization of American States is an important milepost in the embrace by Canada of our hemispheric identity. A path marked by our decision to join the OAS in 1990. By our presence at the first two Summits of  the Americas  in Miami and Santiago. By my leading two trade missions to Latin America in 1995 and 1998. By our hosting the OAS General Assembly in Windsor  last June. By the meetings of hemispheric ministers of  finance, environment and labour that will take place in Canada in the coming months. And by the inaugural meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Forum of the Americas  in Ottawa  in  just a  few weeks. In a couple of months, we will take the most important step on our journey, as we welcome the democratically elected leaders of the Americas to Quebec City for the Third Summit of the Americas. The steps we have taken on our journey have run in parallel with the growing sense that there is more to the Americas than geography. A sense that we are more than just neighbours and friends. We are ‘‘Una Gran Familia.’’ Each a proud individual nation to be sure. Secure in our unique identity and sovereignty. But at a higher level, a family. Who share aspirations and values. Who have embraced democracy, free markets and social justice. Who have taken enhancing the quality of life of all of our people as our common cause. Recently I have spoken to many of your leaders about how we can move ahead on an agenda of human progress and shared prosperity. I will talk to President Bush about it later today. For those  listening  in Washington and beyond, I would like to outline how Canada sees our agenda unfolding for the Quebec City summit.

On Tuesday, February 13, business and community leaders in my hometown of Flint, MI, will gather to honor the 3,051 auto workers of the Flint Truck Assembly Plant. On that day they will celebrate  the Chevy Silverado HD, selected by Motor Trend Magazine as 2001’s ‘Truck of the Year.’ The Flint Truck Assembly Plant which is located on Van Slyke Road has been assembling automobiles since 1947.  In addition  to producing the Silverado 1500, 2500, 3500 HD, the plant also produces GMC Sierra 1500, 2500, and 3500. General Motors continues  to support  the plant by investing $500 million in new equipment, and there are plans to add a new line. With continued support not only from General Motors but also from the community, the plant will no doubt see many more successes and accolades in the future. Mr. Speaker, the Chevy Silverado HD was built with quality labor and parts. The employees of  the Flint Truck Assembly Plant have worked diligently to improve their facility’s productivity and quality. This group is one example of what hard work, determination and a passionate desire to be No. 1 can accomplish. I am grateful  for  the men and women who day-in and day-out work to provide safe quality vehicles for our Nation and the world. I ask my colleagues in the 107th Congress to join me in recognizing their achievement. f TRIBUTE TO JUDY ROCCIANO HON. DIANA DeGETTE OFCOLORADO INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 13, 2001 Ms. DEGETTE Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize  the notable accomplishments and the extraordinary life of a woman in the 1st Congressional District of Colorado. It is both fitting and proper that we recognize this community  leader  for her exceptional  record of civic leadership and invaluable service. It is to commend this outstanding citizen that I rise to honor Ms. Judy Rocciano. Judy Rocciano is a remarkable woman who has  touched  the  lives of many people and made a tremendous impact on our community. Her  indomitable  spirit  has  sustained  her through many challenges and molded a life of notable accomplishment. Those who  know Judy understand her passion  for  fairness, community service and political activism. She is well known  in  the Denver area  for being outspoken and for her immeasurable contribution to the life our community. Judy Rocciano began her  life  in Findlay, Ohio and in 1971, she came to Colorado on vacation and subsequently moved to Denver three months  later. Judy  is a paralegal and has been a successful businesswoman. She has distinguished herself in the non-profit sector as the Southwest Director of the Concord Coalition where she worked on revisions  to Social Security and Medicare  in six states. She also served as a powerful advocate for Choice as Executive Director of Colorado NARAL. It comes as no surprise that she was honored by Colorado NARAL as a  ‘Local Hero. ’ Judy also found the time to serve in numerous community service capacities as a board member of the Washington Park Community Center, as a founding board member of the Neighborhood Resource Center, and as President of Colorado NARAL, the Aurora League of Women Voters, the West Washington Park Neighborhood Association and  the Theatre Associates Group. She has also been very active  in  the Colorado Chapter of  the Multiple Sclerosis Society. I have had  the great privilege of working with Judy Rocciano  in a political organizing capacity. She is well known in Democratic political circles for her leadership and years of service to the Democratic Party and its candidates. When people need some advice or need to get something done, they go to Judy Rocciano. She has managed numerous campaigns  including  those  of  State  Senator Deanna Hanna, State Senator Doug Linkhart, State Representative Wayne  Knox,  State Board of Education Member Gully Stanford, and Councilman Dave Doering. She was instrumental in passing the bonding authority to build Denver International Airport and she also managed campaigns for the Science and Cultural Facilities District  to bring needed  resources to sustain the arts and cultural amenities in Denver. She headed up the Get-OutThe-Vote effort for my first campaign, for the campaign of Councilwoman Cathleen MacKenzie and  for  the Democratic Coordinated Campaign. Judy Rocciano’s contribution to the life and character of our community is one that is rich in consequence. It is the character and deeds of Judy Rocciano, and all Americans like her, which distinguishes us as a nation and ennobles us as a people. Please  join me  in paying  tribute  to Judy Rocciano.  It  is  the values,  leadership and commitment she exhibits on a daily basis that serves to build a better future for all Americans. Her life serves as an example to which we should all aspire. f NATIONAL SALUTE TO HOSPITALIZED VETERANS HON. KAREN McCARTHY OFMISSOURI INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, February 13, 2001 Ms. McCARTHY of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, in 1978  the Department of Veterans Affairs designated the week of February 14 as ‘ ‘National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans,’  calling upon the nation to focus on hospitalized veterans by making personal visits, hosting programs, and sending valentine cards  to veterans  from an appreciative country. Twelve years ago columnist Ann Landers called up Americans to participate by sending a valentine to hospitalized veterans on February 14. The response has been tremendous as school children, clubs, churches, and individuals sent notes of affection to those who gave the greatest gift of love through their patriotic service. ‘National Salute  to Hospitalized Veterans’ was originally known as  ‘No Greater Love Day’  in tribute to those who sacrificed to protect the future of the United States and the freedom each of us enjoys today. Those who choose to serve know that ‘ ‘Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.’  (John 15:13.) In recognition of an injury sustained during times of conflict a soldier receives a heart, the Purple Heart, the greatest honor and a symbol of admiration. In tribute we are reminded to send a valentine message from the heart to veterans wounded in action and to all who served. As we salute our veterans, we must also recognize  the medical care provided by VA medical centers, clinics, and nursing home facilities. I applaud the efforts of the hundreds of compassionate men and women who have dedicated  themselves professionally  to our veterans. Our veterans are receiving the best of care from people who care. This includes volunteers, many of them veterans, who provide countless hours of medical and customer service. Collectively they help provide that personal contact which means so much.

122,Senate,107,0.419,40,2001-03-06,Mr. HUTCHINSON.," Mr. President, I  commend the passion of my colleague  from Connecticut. I have the utmost  respect and admiration for him. I know  how strongly he  feels about this.  I  know in his comments he was not in  any way insinuating those of us who  take a different position than he on  this would not be  concerned about  workers, that we would not be concerned about health and safety in the  addressed  the  workplace because  I want to assure  him that this Senator from Arkansas,  who  supports  the  resolution of disapproval, feels very strongly, as I know  the Presiding Officer, who has worked  long and hard on this issue, does, that  the ergonomics issue needs to be dealt  with but needs to be dealt with properly.  Frankly, you may have 7,000 comments, but if they are ignored, and the  rule is changed, then that process is  flawed. Frankly, to question the process we are now going through is to  question the lawmaking authority and  the right of the Congress.  What has brought us to this point? It  is the fact that there are agencies out  there that have sought to do what we  are constitutionally authorized to do;  that is, to make the laws and the policies for this country.  I want to take just a moment to commend the Presiding Officer, Senator  ENZI, who made an eloquent and very  accurate and detailed speech earlier  today. But, more than that, I thank  him for the hearings he has conducted  and the  information he has brought  forward and elicited about how this  process went forward, about witnesses  who were paid,  instructed, coached,  practiced, to arrive at a preordained  outcome. I thank Senator ENZI for the  role he played as part of this process to  which Senator DODDwas referring. Unfortunately, after hearing after hearing  that was conducted, the outcome and  the evidence that was elicited was ignored by OSHA.  I commend Senator NICKLES for his  foresight years ago in sponsoring the  Congressional Review Act. With the  CRA, we have a means by which we can  address an agency that goes amok and  passes a rule that is not in the interest  of the American people.  I see Senator BOND, who has walked  on the floor. He has worked long and  hard and felt strongly about this issue  and has played an important role in  bringing us to this day and allowing  Congress the opportunity to assert its  rightful  role  once  again.  Senator  THOMPSON, who  spoke  earlier,  has  played an important role as well.  For the first time ever, the Senate  will today utilize the CRA to vitiate  and overturn an agency rule—that is, a  several-hundred-page OSHA rule—that  imposes the largest and most costly  regulatory mandate in American history on the workplace.  It  is appropriate that this would be the first use  for the CRA.  My colleague from Connecticut said  that  under  the  rule  the  employer  makes the determination. Therefore,  that is a good thing. That is one of the  problems. Under the OSHA rule, the  employer is going to be asked to determine health conditions, to determine  whether or not the health condition of  his employee was caused by a workplace condition or something that happened outside the workplace. The employer is going to be asked to have the  wisdom of Solomon in making those  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:14 Dec 20, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\ODA425(cid:1)997-2008-FILES-4-SS-PROJECT€1-S ",2001
123,Senate,107,-0.367,47,2001-03-06,Mrs. CLINTON.," Mr. President, I rise  to add my voice to those of my colleagues who are concerned about efforts to demolish this important worker health and safety standard.  I listened carefully to the remarks of  my distinguished colleague from Missouri, and I understand there are many  serious concerns being discussed about  this regulation and its impact both on  our workforce and our employers. But I  ask  that we  remember where  this  started 10 years ago—in the previous  Bush administration, under the leadership of Secretary of Labor Elizabeth  Dole. We have held numerous hearings  and studies to determine the impact of  our 21st-century worksites on people’s  physical well-being.  OSHA is charged with the responsibility  of  setting  standards  for  the  workplace to help protect citizens from  harm.  In  its  30 years of existence,  OSHA has helped to save many lives  and prevent countless injuries. Despite  such a track record, we know that  OSHA faces almost continual opposition from those who do not agree with  its mission and who seek to undermine  its work. This year,  the opposition  feels emboldened to strike at the heart  of OSHA’s  latest efforts  to protect  American workers.  We are, of course, talking about the  ergonomics standard, which is designed  to help more than 600,000 workers who  experience serious workplace injuries  every year from repetitive motion and  exertion.  In enacting  this  standard,  OSHA heard  from thousands of witnesses and received the backing of the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:14 Dec 20, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\ODA425(cid:1)997-2008-FILES-4-SS-PROJECT€1-S ",2001

125,Senate,107,0.538,54,2001-03-06,Mr. ENZI.," Mr. President, the Senator  is correct. The reason we can’t wait 60  or 90 days is that the CRA is time limited. Sixty working days from the time  the thing was published is how long we  have to reverse this rule. So we are put  under the rule that was passed by everybody  in this Chamber—not me, I  wasn’t here at the time, but everybody  voted to do it that way, so that we  would have the right to jerk agencies  back that didn’t listen.  They did not listen to anything said  in the committee hearing that I held,  that the Senator attended. Without cooperation, with that club of the President over his head, it was easy to see  they didn’t need to concede any points.  That is not cooperation. That is not civility. We can get together and work  on these things but not when one side  thinks they hold all of the ammunition.  ",2001
126,Senate,107,-0.37,68,2001-03-06,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, I rise  to oppose this resolution which seeks  to overturn OSHA’s new standard that  protects workers from workplace injuries. It is bad for American workers  and bad for our economy.  This resolution would prevent OSHA  from  implementing  an  ergonomics  standard  that would establish basic  safety standards for American workers.  This standard would protect workers  from  on-the-job  injuries  caused  by  working conditions that involve heavy  lifting, repetitive motions or working  in an awkward or uncomfortable position.  American workers  deserve  a  safe  workplace, yet each year more than  600,000 people suffer ergonomics injuries. Who suffers most from ergonomic  injuries? Women. Women  represent  only 46 percent of the workforce, but  they suffer 64 percent of the repetitive  motion injuries.  Who are these women? They’re the  caregivers—like the home health care  worker who bathes a housebound senior or the licensed practical nurse who  cares for us when we are hospitalized.  They are the factory workers who build  our cars and process our food. They are  the cashiers and sales clerks who are  the backbone of our retail economy.  And they are the data entry clerks who  keep our high-tech economy moving  forward.  There are terrible human costs to  these  injuries. Women  account  for  nearly 75 percent of lost work time due  to carpal tunnel syndrome and 62 percent of  lost time due to tendinitis.  These are painful, debilitating injuries  that prevent you from doing even simple activities like combing your hair or  zipping your child’s jacket.  We can’t measure the pain and suffering of workers who are injured at  work, but we can measure the economic costs. These injuries cost our  economy over $80 billion annually in  lost productivity, health care costs and  workers compensation. In fact, nearly  $1 out of every $3 in worker’s compensation  payments  result  from  ergonomics injuries.  OSHA’s ergonomics standard wasn’t  slapped together at the last minute or  in the dark of night. The effort was initially  launched by Labor Secretary  Elizabeth Dole in 1990 and the standards have been in development over the  past 10 years. During the development  phase there were 10 weeks of public  hearings and extensive scientific study,  including  the National Academy of  Science’s study which concluded that  workplace interventions can reduce the  incidence of workplace injuries.  The result of this long and careful  study is the OSHA ergonomics standard issued last November. These standards would require all employers to  provide their workers with basic information on ergonomic injuries—including their symptoms and the  importance of early reporting. These standards would  take action whenever a  worker reports these activities and employers would be required to correct  the situation. Correction could mean  better equipment or better training.  What will OSHA’s new rule mean? It  would prevent 300,000 injuries per year  and it would save $9 billion in workers  compensation and related costs.  It’s  outrageous that the first major legislation considered by the Senate this year  would turn the clock back on worker  safety. This would be the first time in  OSHA’s 30 year history that a worker  health and safety rule has ever been repealed.  As a great nation, it is our duty to  protect our most valuable resource—  our working men and women. I urge  my colleagues to join me in opposing  this resolution.  ",2001
127,Senate,107,-0.446,68,2001-03-06,Mr. CORZINE.," Mr. President, I rise  today in strong opposition to the resolution  that would  overturn worker  safety regulations designed to prevent  ergonomic injuries. OSHA’s new ergonomic standard addresses the nation’s  most  serious  job  safety and health  problem—work  related  musculoskeletal disorders. According  to  the  Bureau of Labor Statistics,  in  1999  more than 600,000 workers suffered serious workplace injuries caused by repetitive motion and overextension. These  injuries can be painful and disabling,  and can devastate people’s lives. Workers in a wide variety of jobs and locations are affected, from textile workers  in New Jersey to white collar workers  throughout our nation. These are real  people and their  lives are being affected in very real ways. At the same  time, their injuries impose huge costs  on our economy as a whole, roughly $50  billion a year.  Mr. President, OSHA has been working to address ergonomic problems for  10 years, under both Republican and  Democratic administrations.  In  fact,  the agency first began its involvement  under Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.  At the time, Secretary Dole called repetitive strain injuries, and I quote,  ‘‘one of the nation’s most debilitating  across-the-board worker  safety  and  health illnesses of the 1990’s.’’  Unfortunately, after going through a  very lengthy rulemaking process, critics of OSHA’s efforts have continually  put roadblocks in the agency’s path.  These critics have questioned the seriousness of the ergonomics problem and  called  repeatedly  for additional  scientific studies. It’s been a strategy of  denial and delay.  Now, however, there’s no longer an  excuse for inaction. This January, the  National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine released a report  documenting the severity of the problem. The report confirmed that workplace exposures do, indeed, cause musculoskeletal disorders and that OSHA’s  approaches to the problem are effective. This should not have been a surprise to anybody, but now its undeniable.  Mr. President, I realize that many  businesses are concerned that OSHA’s  regulations will impose costs.

128,Senate,107,0.014,82,2001-03-06,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. President, today  may be  just another day  in Washington, but  it  is a  special day  in  Vermont. Today is town meeting day,  when towns throughout Vermont go  over their budgets line by line. This includes a review of school budgets in  many towns. In Vermont, where special  education referrals grow at a rate of  about 3.5 percent per year. With the  cost of special education rising at a  rate that Vermont’s 287 school districts  can not sustain, the number one education issue that will be discussed at  these town meetings will be Federal  funding  of  special  education.  Vermonters, like so many Americans  across the country, understand that  these costs must be paid. All of our  children, those with disabilities and  those without, need and deserve the  services and supports that will ensure  that they meet their educational goals.  In 1975, responding to numerous Federal Court decisions involving lawsuits  against a majority of the States, and  growing concerns about the unconstitutional  treatment of children with  disabilities,  Congress  passed Public  Law 94–142, now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  IDEA rightly guaranteed all children  with disabilities a constitutionally required  ‘‘free and appropriate public  education.’’ As a freshman Congressman, I was proud to sponsor that legislation and to be a member of the Conference Committee that negotiated the  differences  in the House and Senate  bills.  In passing Public Law 94–142, Congress recognized that education is not  free. We recognized that children with  disabilities  often  require  specialized  services  to  benefit  from  education.  Congress assumed  that  the average  cost of educating children with disabilities was twice that of educating other  children. At that time, 25 years ago,  Congress authorized the Federal Government to pay up to 40 percent of the  additional costs associated with educating children with disabilities. That  amount—often referred to as the IDEA  ‘‘full-funding’’  amount—is  calculated  by taking 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure, or APPE,  times the number of children with disabilities being served under IDEA Part  B in each state.  While some may question whether  Congress made a commitment or set a  goal, I am here to tell you, as someone  who was there at the time, we definitely made a pledge to fully fund the  Federal  share  of  special  education.  Thanks  to  teachers and administrators, advocacy organizations, parents  of children with disabilities, and the  children themselves, I believe that together  we  have made  tremendous  strides in assuring that we keep that  promise.  Since  I  became Chairman  of  the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee  in 1997, there have  been significant  increases  in special  education funding. In fact, special education funding has increased by 174 percent since 1996. For Vermont, the Federal share has increased from $4.5 million to $13.2 million. Even with this  substantial increase, the Federal Government still contributes less than 15  percent of the APPE.  Failure to live up to the commitment  of Congress means that the majority of  the funding for special education for  8,000 Vermont students, and 6.1 million  students across the country, currently  comes from the States and from local  school budgets.  Last year, I led three congressional  efforts to  increase special education  funding. In April 2000, I sponsored an  amendment to the budget resolution.  This amendment would have mandated  that the Federal Government increase  spending  for special education by $2  billion each year,  for  5 years. The  amendment, which would have raised  Federal special education funding from  $5 billion per year to close to $16 billion  per year, failed by three votes. In its  place, the Senate approved, by a vote  of 53 to 47, a substitute amendment  that made my  amendment  a  nonbinding sense of the senate resolution  to fully fund special education. This  was definitely not the outcome I was  seeking. However,  it was the second  time the Senate has gone on record in  support of  fully  funding the Federal  Government’s  share  of  special  education  costs. After  two  decades  in  which  full  funding of IDEA was regarded as more of a pipe dream than a  commitment to be honored, Congress  finally seems to be taking its obligation seriously.  Today, I am pleased to join my colleagues in introducing legislation that  will provide for mandatory increases in  special education funding at $2.5 billion  a year for each of the next 6 years. This  bipartisan effort  sets  the course  to  achieve full funding for Part B of IDEA  by fiscal year 2007. The enactment of  this bill will give relief to school districts, resources to teachers, hope to  parents, and opportunities to children  with disabilities. It will free up State  and local funds to be spent on such  things as better pay for teachers, more  professional development, richer and  more diverse curricula, reducing class  size, making needed  renovations  to  buildings, and addressing other needs  of individual schools. To me, passage of  this bill will provide the ultimate in  local educational flexibility.  Last week, Representative BURTON,  Chairman of the House Committee on  Government Reform, held a hearing on  IDEA. Every witness  that  testified  identified  insufficient  special  education funding as the number one barrier that prevents schools from fully  meeting the needs of children with disabilities.  Every  congressional  Representative who attended the hearing  spoke  to  the  issue. Representative  HOOLEYand Representative BASShave  both introduced bills in the House to  fully fund Part B of IDEA.  In 1975, we made a commitment to  fully  fund the Federal Government’s  share of special education costs. If, 25  years  later,  in this era of economic  prosperity  and  unprecedented  budgetary surpluses, we cannot meet this  commitment, when will we keep this  pledge?  School districts are demanding financial relief. Children’s needs must be  met. Parents  expect  accountability.  There  is no better way to touch a  school, help a child, or support a family than to commit more Federal dollars for special education. Personally, I  do not believe anyone can rationally  argue this is not the time to fulfill our  promise.  In America, education is viewed as a  right. Across the country, our Governors, school boards, education professionals, and families of children with  disabilities identify fully funding for  special education as their number-one  priority. The American people have a  right to ask us, ‘‘if not now, when?’’  Six million American  students with  disabilities have a right to a free and  appropriate public education. They deserve to participate in the American  dream.  This issue will not go away and neither will I. I intend to do all I can to  make sure we keep our promise to fully  fund the Federal share of special education. As we proceed with new initiatives and requirements for schools, let  us  also  dedicate  increased Federal  funds to meeting our existing obligations to children with disabilities, families, and the State and local education  agencies that serve them. I believe this  is the most important education issue  before our Nation, and I will continue  to fight for it.  ",2001
129,Senate,107,-0.351,82,2001-03-06,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I strongly support the ‘‘Helping Children Success by Fully Funding the Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA,  Act.’’ This is a bi-partisan effort to  help our states provide a free and appropriate public education to children  with disabilities. As I’ve said time and  again, disability is not a partisan issue.  We all share an interest in ensuring  that  children with  disabilities  and  their families get a fair shake in life.  Currently, the State Grant program  within IDEA receives $6.34 billion. Estimates by the Congressional Research  Service suggest that the program needs  to be funded at $17.1 billion for fiscal  year 2002 to meet the targets established in 1975. Our amendment would  obligate funding for IDEA annually in  roughly  $2.5 billion  increments over  the next six years and would put us on  track to meet our goal of 40 percent  funding.

130,Senate,107,-0.383,89,2001-03-06,Mr. REED.," Mr. President, today is  the 11th Annual National Sportsmanship Day, which is a unique program  that champions sportsmanship and enhances  student  leadership  and  academic skills. The object of the 2001 National Sportsmanship Day is to promote appreciation for the critical role  of ethics and honesty in athletics and  society  through  student-athlete outreach programs, writing and art contests, coaches’ forums and other activities aimed at furthering the principles  of sportsmanship.  National  Sportsmanship Day was  founded at the University of Rhode Island in 1991. Today, more than 12,000 elementary, middle, and high schools, as  well as colleges and universities in all  50 States and over 100 countries will  participate  in the events planned to  help instill in young people the importance of playing fair and the value of  hard work and discipline. The Institute  of Sport is also proud that National  Sportsmanship Day will be webcast  over  the  Internet. Through  online  interaction with featured guests, exclusive  interviews,  and  sportsmanship  polls, this event will harness the power  and expanse of the World Wide Web to  reach students and supporters here and  around the world.  The organizers of National Sportsmanship Day have gathered some of  the best of our nation’s sportsmen and  women to serve as 2001 Sports Ethics  Fellows. By sharing their remarkable  accomplishments athletes Grant Hill of  the Orlando Magic, soccer great Mia  Hamm, Sergei Fedorov of the Detroit  Red Wings, and 2000 Olympic Gold Medalist Lenny Krayzelburg, among others, will help encourage young athletes  to strive and succeed by the rules of  fair play. And in so doing, these gifted  athletic heroes will inspire today’s athletes to impart on future athletes the  lessons of good sportsmanship.  Also part of this event and in its  third year is a program called ‘‘The No  Swear Zone,’’ which is a pledge that  can be signed by athletes and coaches  to stop the use of profanity in sports  and everyday life. Further, in conjunction with National Sportsmanship Day,  the Institute for International Sport  will launch the Center for Sports Parenting. This online center will provide  an interactive service where parents,  coaches, educators, and team officials  involved in youth sports can seek guidance on youth  sports.  Indeed,  it  is  equally important for adults involved  in youth athletics to teach and lead in  the spirit of sportsmanship.  Sportsmanship needs to be taught to  each successive generation, and I commend the Institute of Sport and all this  year’s participants  for making  sure  that this valuable life lesson continues  to lead the way on and off the field.∑  IN HONOR OF THE PRUDENTIAL  SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY AWARDS  2001  STATE  HONOREES  FOR  PENNSYLVANIA  ∑",2001

A loving mother of  five children and a courageous businesswoman, Mrs. Stefanski’s  life serves as a beautiful example of the American dream come true. Daughter  of  Helen  and  Alexander Rutkowski, Gerome Rita Stefanski was raised in a loving and caring environment. From her parents, Mrs. Stefanski learned strong family values which helped her  in raising her own children. Married in 1937, Mrs. Stefanski was mother to five children: Ben, Hermine Cech, Abigail, Floyd and Marc. Throughout her life, Gerome Rita Stefanski always made her family her first priority. Foregoing a career as a social worker, Mrs. Stefanski chose to stay at home and raise her children  to assure  that they would grow up in the same loving environment which she had known as a child. Mrs. Stefanski attended college at Notre Dame College of Ohio and earned a master’s degree  from Catholic University of Washington, D.C. At her college graduation, Mrs. Stefanski was awarded the Bishop Schrembs Cross for recognition of her superior essay on the subject of religion as a working principle of life. She was also recently awarded an honorary doctorate from Notre Dame College of Ohio. Shortly after her marriage, Gerome Rita Stefanski was an  important partner  in  the founding of the Third Federal Savings Association. Working closely with her husband Ben, she prepared all of the original organizational documents. Mrs. Stefanski served as the sole advertising manager and wrote all of its publications for almost fifty years. A pioneer of the increased  role of women  in  the workplace, Mrs. Stefanski became the Third Federal Savings Association’s first female director in 1981. Mrs. Gerome Rita Stefanski was a brilliant businesswomen and a loving mother, My fellow Congressmen, please  join me  in celebrating the life of Gerome Rita Stefanski. f BILL FRENZEL, ORDER OF THE RISING SUN HON.

133,,107,0.225,110,2001-03-06,Mr. GREENWOOD.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I take a moment to recognize one of our former colleagues, Bill Frenzel of Minnesota. Bill recently received the Order of the Rising Sun from the Emperor of Japan. This decision is one of the highest honors that can be bestowed on someone of non-Japanese descent. Such a distinguished honor highlights his dedication and many years of service to the development of Japanese-American  relations. Many of  these efforts began right here while he was serving on the House Ways and Means Committee. Bill was known as the most active Republican on trade matters and was an instrumental player in the advancement of the trade relationship between America and Japan. During the last six years, Bill has served as the Chairman of the Japan-America Society of Washington, DC, a non-partisan educational and cultural organization. Founded in 1957, it serves as the primary forum in the Mid-Atlantic region  for promoting understanding between the two countries. While there, Bill has worked hard  to  foster  the development of an open, U.S.-Japanese dialogue. His efforts helped create an honest discussion regarding cultural differences, unfair trade practices, protectionist measures and the need for increased Japanese participation  in multinational  corporations. Bill’s work has been essential  in creating stronger ground  for  trade  relations between our great nations. His commitment to secure a productive working relationship has resulted in a sound base that will further continuing economic and political endeavors. It is an honor to recognize his work today on the floor, and I thank him for his dedication to such an important area of our foreign policy. f AL RESCINIO, MAN OF THE YEAR, AMERIGO VESPUCCI SOCIETY HON.

134,,107,-0.402,110,2001-03-06,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, March 3,  the Amerigo Vespucci Society of Long Branch, N.J., my hometown, honored Al Rescinio as Man of the Year. I am proud to say that Al is a constituent and friend who has made  innumerable contributions  to our community, our county, and our state. Al was born and educated in Long Branch and later graduated from Upsala College with a degree in business. He worked for the international organization of certified public accountants, Haskins & Sells, while he and his wife Marge raised  their  four children. These children, who  no  doubt  are Al’s  greatest source of pride and satisfaction, are now all successful professionals— individuals who are in turn making their own contributions to society. In 1968, Al started his own firm, Umberto Rescinio, C.P.A. Since  then, he has participated  in many national organizations and charities, giving back to those in need some of what he earned and achieved throughout his career. Locally, he has been affiliated with the Monmouth County Drug and Alcohol Abuse Commission and the NJ State Planning Council of Central Jersey. He has received many awards and citations for his contributions. On March 3, members of the Amerigo Vespucci Society honored him and thanked him for helping to raise the $62,000 that was donated this year to local charities by the Society. On that night, it was apparent how one man and one civic-minded organization can make a big difference in the lives of the citizens of their community. f IN HONOR OF REVEREND FATHER RAPHAEL (ALBERT) ZBIN, O.S.B.

Seely was born May 25, 1903 and  lived  in  the Champaign-Urbana area  for all of his 97 years. During that time he made his mark as a Champaign City Council member, sporting goods store owner, and  friend of all. Seely said he was always guided by the advice of his father who told him once that making a living is important, but not as important as making friends. Whether it was with the likes of Harry Houdini or one of the many University of Illinois students he had over  for breakfast every Sunday morning, Seely took this advice to heart. There are few people, in each community and generation, who not only enrich lives during their lifetime, but also leave a legacy. Seely Johnston was one of these people. Without Seely,  the Champaign-Urbana area would have been a lesser place. f INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO REDUCE THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RATE TO 25 PERCENT HON. PHILIP M. CRANE OFILLINOIS INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, March 6, 2001 ",2001
136,,107,0.739,117,2001-03-06,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing three pieces of legislation to refine the tax proposal put forward by President Bush. Let me state at the outset that I fully support President Bush’s tax proposal as he laid it out. I think it is appropriate for the times and welldesigned. Even so, there is no legislation or proposal that cannot be improved upon. And so I offer these three bills in this spirit and in the belief  that  the President  in all  likelihood would and should support them. The first bill I am introducing takes as its starting point the income tax rate reductions proposed by President Bush, phased in over ten years. I have included these rate reductions to provide the context for my proposed refinement, which is to reduce the tax rates of the individual Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) from 26 and 28 percent to 25 percent, consistent with the reduction of an individual income tax rate under the Bush proposal from 28 to 25 percent. The individual (AMT) is a complex and unfortunate aspect of our  tax code. Most  taxpayers are blissfully unaware that they are, in fact, subject to two federal income taxes— the regular  income  tax and  the AMT— and  that their annual tax liability is the greater of the two produced by  these  two systems. The modern AMT was intended to ensure that certain upper-income taxpayers paid a significant amount of tax. It was to achieve this objective by denying to these taxpayers certain deductions and exemptions available under the regular income tax. For example, in addition to denying  taxpayers any of a  set of  ‘preferences’ , such esoteric items as excess intangible drilling costs and a deduction for pollution control  facilities,  the AMT denies  taxpayers the personal exemptions allowed under the regular income tax, and denies them a deduction for State and local taxes paid. For a variety of reasons, the number of taxpayers,  especially middle-income  families, subject to the individual AMT has been soaring in recent years, and this trend is expected to continue.  Ideally,  the AMT should be repealed outright. The abuses the AMT was established  to address have  long since been eliminated from the income tax. Until full repeal becomes  timely, however, we must at least ensure that matters do not worsen. In the context of the Bush income tax rate reductions,  the AMT poses additional problems because these rate reductions do not extend to the AMT rate. This means that many taxpayers currently subject to the AMT suffer the additional wrong of being excluded from any tax relief under the Bush program. This is patently unfair as many Members on both sides of the aisle have pointed out. It also means that many more taxpayers will see far less tax relief than is intended. This would occur for those taxpayers whose current regular  income  tax  liability barely exceeds their AMT liability. Once the Bush rate reductions are put into effect, these taxpayers’ regular income tax liability will drop below their AMT liability. They will still receive some tax relief, to be sure, but far less than they expected and far less than was anticipated when the Bush proposal was developed. The new  income  tax  rate structure suggested by President Bush starts at 10 percent, and then rises to 15 percent, 25 percent, and finally 33 percent. The current individual AMT has two rates of 26 and 28 percent. My bill reduces the AMT rates to a single rate at 25 percent to be more consistent with the President ’s proposed  rates. Thus, my proposal would reduce marginal tax rates for AMT filers so they, too, have a better incentive to work, save, and invest. Just as important, however, under my bill current AMT filers and near AMT filers would join with all other taxpayers in enjoying significant tax relief. This legislation is sound tax policy. By any measure it increases fairness in the tax code. And it deserves the support of this Congress. f IN HONOR OF THOMAS G. FERN HON.

Fern, immediate past State Director of  the United States Department of Agriculture in Kentucky. For more  than 35 years, Mr. Fern has served the people of Kentucky thru his work at USDA/Rural Development, formerly the Farmers Home Administration. Mr. Fern served as Assistant County Director, County Director, and District Director before being appointed State Director by President Clinton  in 1993. His broad experience in agriculture, housing, and  community development made him a strong advocate for the people of rural Kentucky. His wealth of experience and knowledge qualified him to serve on various committees and commissions such as  the Kentucky Renaissance Committee, The Kentucky the Rural Water Resource Commission, and  Kentucky Appalachian Commission. Mr. Fern administered with great professionalism  the  programs  offered  by USDA Rural Development,  including Rural Utilities Service, Rural Housing Service, and Rural Business Service, as well as  the Empowerment Zone, Enterprise Community, and Champion Communities programs. Mr. Fern worked hard to help rural Kentucky reap the benefits of these programs. As a result, many community  improvements were  funded during Mr. Fern’s time as State Director of USDA/Rural Development, and  I and my  fellow Kentuckians owe him a big thank-you. Projects funded under his leadership will improve the quality of life  in  the great Commonwealth of Kentucky for decades to come. I rise today to commend Thomas G. Fern for his 35 years of service to the people of rural Kentucky. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking him and wishing him well. f LEGISLATION TO  SIMPLIFY THE EXCISE TAX ON HEAVY TRUCK TIRES HON. WES WATKINS OFOKLAHOMA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, March 6, 2001 ",2001
138,,107,0.368,117,2001-03-06,Mr. WATKINS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation that would simplify the excise tax on heavy truck tires. The  IRS and  the  tire manufacturers are today laboring under an unnecessary administrative burden. The tire industry pays an excise tax on heavy truck tires that goes directly to the Highway Trust Fund. But the means by which the IRS collects the tax are inefficient and costly. Under the current collection system, the IRS requires manufacturers to weigh each line of taxable tires for each tire size, to track the sales and taxes paid for each tire, and to maintain burdensome compliance systems  to verify sales and  tax payments by weight. Manufacturers must determine if a tire is for a taxable highway use or for a non-taxable off-road use, and then track whether the purchasers are tax exempt. This system of tax collection is both onerous and wasteful; I propose we change it. The legislation I am introducing today would reduce  these administrative burdens without reducing any revenue  to  the Highway Trust Fund. It does this by revising the current system based on  the weight of  the  tire  to one based on the weight-carrying capacity of the tire. This new system would simplify the payment and collection of taxes for both the tire industry and for the IRS— resulting in reduced expenses for both. We also may simplify this tax by adopting a bright line that identifies which tires are subject to the excise tax. Under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Act, as administered by the Department of Transportation, all tires sold in the U.S.  for highway service are required  to be marked with the maximum weight carrying capacity of the tire. The IRS would take the data already collected by the DOT and base its tax on the amount per pound of weight carrying capacity. And the tax rate would be set at an amount that provides revenue neutrality to the U.S. Treasury. This much-needed bright line test would be simple to apply and easy to enforce: Tires that VerDate 11<MAY>2000 04:25 Mar 07, 2001 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A06MR8.044 pfrm01 PsN: E06PT1 ‘ ’ ",2001
139,Senate,107,0.304,6,2001-03-12,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President,  I rise today to discuss a subject of major importance to the national security of the United States—the maintenance of our nuclear weapons stockpile. For most of the nuclear age, the United States has relied on nuclear testing  to  ensure  that our nuclear weapons remained safe, secure, and reliable. Our country conducted more than one thousand nuclear tests in furtherance of these goals. In July 1992, President George Bush announced that the United States would suspend underground  testing. We  initiated  the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which was designed to replace detonations at the Nevada Test Site with computer simulations. In 1999, concerns about the Stockpile Stewardship Program were a critical element of the Senate debate over ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It was unfortunate that the Senate was forced to take up the treaty in a highly politicized atmosphere. The CTBT was not a new subject, but in 1999, the Senate was not prepared to develop the consensus necessary to ratify a major treaty with far-reaching consequences for U.S. security. I opposed ratification of the CTBT, because I did not believe that the treaty’s verification and enforcement provisions would be successful. Equally important, I was concerned about our ability to maintain the integrity and safety of our nuclear arsenal under the conditions imposed by the treaty. The United States must maintain a reliable nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future. The end of the cold war provided tremendous national security benefits, but the necessity of our nuclear deterrent did not disappear. The transformation of the  former Soviet Union has permitted the United States to consider lower numbers of nuclear weapons, but the current security atmosphere does not permit us to consider their elimination. Our nuclear arsenal continues to play a critical role in ensuring the security of the American people. It also plays a role  in  the  security calculations of friends and allies around the world. Many of them have  foregone potentially destabilizing arms build-ups and weapons  procurement  programs  because of the nuclear umbrella provided by the United States. During the CTBT debate, I expressed my concern that the Senate was being asked to trust the reliability of our nuclear stockpile to a Stockpile Stewardship Program that was both unproven and unlikely to be fully operational for a decade or more. There remains strong disagreement among many nuclear experts and national security leaders about the efficacy of maintaining a nuclear stockpile without testing. As Senators, we do not have the  luxury of taking a chance on the Stockpile Stewardship Program. The restrictions imposed by the CTBT could have harmed the national security of the United States if we could not ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile without testing. We cannot allow our nuclear weapons to fall into disrepair or permit their safety to be jeopardized. Now unfortunately, little progress in advancing the Stockpile Stewardship Program  appears  to  have  occurred since the 1999 Senate debate. Our new Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham,  recently  testified  before  the Armed Services Committee that: The Department of Energy has allowed its nuclear-weapons production plants  to degrade over time, leaving a tremendous backlog of deferred maintenance and modernizations. The deterioration of existing facilities is a very serious threat. Under  the  Stockpile  Stewardship Program, the United States will depend on these facilities to inspect our nuclear arsenal and to replace degraded weapons. I am particularly concerned by the uncertainty surrounding the construction of the National Ignition Facility, the NIF, which was profiled in a recent episode of the ‘‘Jim Lehrer Newshour.’’ The NIF is intended to play a key role in the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the annual certification of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. The National Academy  of  Sciences  and  others  recommended the construction of the NIF, which will  simulate  thermonuclear conditions. This facility would be critical to evaluating our nuclear weapons arsenal in the absence of testing. The Academy stated that such a facility was necessary because nearly all of the 6,000 parts of a nuclear weapon change with age. Yet at present, the NIF is 4 years behind schedule and approximately $1 billion over budget. These are dismal omens. Even more disconcerting is that the National Science Foundation and others  have  estimated  the  NIF’s chances of success at only about 50 percent. It is alarming to learn that the possibility of  success  for a  critical component of our Stockpile Stewardship Program can only be characterized as 50/50. Some supporters of the CTBT, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, have suggested that the stockpile could be maintained without the NIF by replacing old warheads with new warheads manufactured to the same specifications as the originals. They also have posited that current warheads could be rebuilt with fresh nuclear material. Yet many nuclear  experts  regard these strategies as unreliable. This is why both the former Bush and Clinton administrations moved forward on the Stockpile Stewardship Program. According to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, it is impossible to guarantee that new warheads manufactured to old specifications will work reliably. Neither is replacing the nuclear core of existing weapons a viable option. Nuclear material  contained within weapons changes with age. As the nuclear material changes, so does its effects on the other components of the warhead. If one attempted to maintain weapons by periodically replacing their nuclear cores, the older warhead components around the pits would not be matched to the new nuclear material. Under these conditions, the warheads would not necessarily function as originally designed. Even many proponents of the CTBT do not believe that U.S. nuclear weapons can be maintained in the absence of an effective Stockpile Stewardship Program. Most notably, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, who conducted extensive review of the CTBT following the Senate’s rejection of the treaty, outlined  the  need  for  an  effective Stockpile Stewardship Program. His review emphasized that the program was  needed  to  provide  the  people, knowledge, equipment, and  facilities necessary to accomplish three tasks: First of all, to enhance surveillance of weapons in the stockpile to monitor for age-related  changes and  to  identify other defects; second, to deepen the scientific understanding of how nuclear weapons work and how they age so that we are better able to spot potential defects;  and,  third,  to  remanufacture components  and  refurbish warheads using an updated nuclear weapons complex. General Shalikashvili offered his strong support for the Stockpile Stewardship Program and reiterated its necessity in the absence of testing. But if we are going to depend on the Stockpile  Stewardship  Program,  it must be  reliable and accurate, Recently, the Panel to Assess the Reliability, Safety and Security of the U.S. Nuclear Stockpile found: . . .  growing  deficiencies  in  the nuclear weapons production complex, deep morale and personnel problems, continued slippage of program milestones, and unacceptably high risks to the completion of needed weapons refurbishments. The panel, established by Congress in the 1999 Defense authorization bill, was tasked with providing an assessment of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. The panel’s concerns led to numerous recommendations, including: one, stopping the slippage in stockpile life-extension programs; two, restoring missing production capabilities and refurbishing the production complex; three, stopping the slippage in development of tools needed to make future assessment of the stockpile’s safety and reliability; and four, responding to the low morale at the weapons  laboratories. The panel concluded that the problems within our nuclear weapons complex are ‘‘unacceptable,’’ and they warned that the situation could decline further. The report states that: Worrisome deterioration of nuclear components has already been found. Moreover, the history of the stockpile has demonstrated many surprises, and weapons are entering an VerDate 23-FEB-2001 23:35 Mar 12, 2001 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A12MR6.004 pfrm02 PsN: S12PT1 ",2001

142,Senate,107,-0.25,27,2001-03-12,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, I rise today to honor the achievements of a true  friend of American agriculture, Grant B. Buntrock, a native of my home State of South Dakota. Grant died at his home on Friday, March 9, 2001. Grant made his mark on American agriculture all throughout his 38 years of service. He was honored to be selected by President Clinton as the administrator of the Department of Agriculture’s  Agricultural  Stabilization and  Conservation  Service,  ASCS. Through reorganization, he  later became the  first administrator of the Farm Service Agency, where he served until his retirement in 1997. His training to be the agency’s administrator came through his many ASCS positions. From  1977  through 1980, he served as Assistant Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations, DASCO. In 1981, he became the director of the Cotton, Grain and Rice Price Support Division, where he administered all support programs. His other assignments  included Director, Price Support and Loan Division and DASCO staff assistant, as well as assignments to the Programs Operations Division and the Bin Storage Division. But perhaps the most important position of all was his tenure as a program specialist in the Brown County ASCS office and his position as county office manager in the Day County ASCS office. He was on the front line, dealing directly with South Dakota’s farmers and ranchers. His friends are confident that is what guided him in making his daily decisions on how our farm programs should function.

143,Senate,107,-0.328,27,2001-03-12,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to pay tribute to the late John V. Lindsay, a talented public servant and a remarkable man. John Lindsay served in public office, first as a Member of the United States House  of Representatives,  then  as Mayor of New York City, during the 1960’s and early 1970’s, a tumultuous period in our Nation’s history. In ways both large and small, he demonstrated an unswerving commitment to reason, to compassion and to progress for all Americans. As a Republican, he recalled that he belonged to the party of Lincoln. While many in the 1960’s and 1970’s walked the  streets  of America’s  cities, he walked the streets of Harlem, jacket flung over his shoulder, to promote understanding and harmony. While many counseled caution and hesitation, he urged reconciliation among the races and attention to the needs of the less fortunate. And while many fled our cities for suburbia, he stayed and worked tirelessly to make urban America safer and more culturally enriching for residents and visitors alike. John Lindsay made the fate of America’s cities an urgent national concern. He believed that the Nation’s future rested on the health and vibrancy of its urban centers. He supported the arts, affordable housing, school reforms and other  initiatives to provide a better quality of life for both residents of and visitors to America’s cities. Today, the renaissance being experienced in cities like New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Los Angeles  suggest  that John Lindsay’s hopeful vision for our cities has been realized at least in part. Upon graduating from Yale University in 1943, he joined the Naval Reserve as an ensign, serving as a gunnery officer during World War II. He participated in the invasion of Sicily and  in  the American  landings  in Hollandia, the Admiralty Islands and the Philippines. He won  five battle stars and was a lieutenant when he was discharged in 1946. Twelve years later, in 1958, John ran for Congress in New York’s 17th Congressional District, which  extended from Harlem to Greenwich Village on the East Side. Though ethnically and culturally diverse, he represented all of the people of his district with understanding, empathy, and a keen sense of their varied needs. He would represent them for eight years, re-elected three times by successively larger margins. Thereafter, he would represent all of the people of New York as Mayor from 1966 to 1974. In 1972, John ran for President. As we all know, he did not prevail in that endeavor, at least at the ballot box. But in another sense, he succeeded in showing many in America what the people of New York City already knew; that he was a man of uncommon  intelligence, charisma, and vision. On a personal note, let me say that I had the great good fortune to know John not only as an elected leader, but as a friend. I will always cherish his warmth, his wit, and the wisdom he brought to all he did and said. Our Nation has lost a public servant of rare gifts and broad vision. I extend my deepest  sympathies  to his wife, Mary Lindsay, to his children Katherine Lake, Margaret Picotte, Anne Lindsay, John Jr., their spouses and his five grandchildren.∑ f MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE At 1:32 p.m., a message  from the House of Representatives, delivered by Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced  that pursuant  to  section 5(a) of the James Madison Commemoration Commission Act  (Public Law VerDate 23-FEB-2001 01:55 Mar 13, 2001 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G12MR6.035 pfrm04 PsN: S12PT1 ",2001

145,,107,0.208,34,2001-03-12,Mr. WALSH.," Mr. Speaker, on March 6, the U.S. Senate voted 56–44 to repeal an OSHA ergonomics rule initiated by the Clinton administration  that would affect over 102 million workers at over 6 million work sites. While Congress passed  the Congressional Review Act in 1996, granting the authority to review and disapprove of many regulatory rules made by a  federal agency, Congress has never passed a joint resolution of disapproval. I have strong reservations about the rule because it puts a significant burden on already struggling small businesses not only  in my community in Central New York but across the United States. Currently, Congress is trying to maintain and strengthen the overall economy by encouraging small business entrepreneurship with a variety of economic stimulus programs. We must continue this effort in a positive manner as it is the small business person who creates jobs in each of our districts. The implementation of  this  rule would devastate employers with extra costs that would try to fix ergonomically related problems. Despite my opposition to this rule, our work on this issue cannot stop here. According to OSHA, improper ergonomic design of jobs is one of the leading causes cited for work-related illness. Congress must protect the thousands of employees  that have had work-related injuries while at the same time protect small businesses that must deal with the complexity and cost of the standard. Through federal funding, studies by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) have provided a thorough review of studies that showed significant statistical information between workplace injuries and musculoskeletal disorders. However, the scientific understanding of the problem has not been completed. With this in mind, I urge Secretary Chao to immediately  review and  revise  the standard that meets the needs of all parties. I do believe  in  a  comprehensive  approach  to ergonomics that addresses the concerns imposed against the current standard. By finding corrective actions that can redesign the workplace, we will ensure the health and stability of our nation’s workforce. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON.

Due to the death of my mother-in-law on March 6 in Mississippi, I was with my family and was unable to cast recorded votes on rollcalls 26 through 45. On rollcall 26, I would have voted ‘ ‘yea’ ’ on the Motion  to Suspend  the Rules and Pass H.R. 724, a bill to Authorize Appropriations to Carry Out Part B of Title I of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, relating to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

On rollcall 31, I would have voted ‘ ‘yea’ ’ on the Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass, as Amended, H.R. 624, the Organ Donation Improvement Act. On rollcall 32, I would have voted ‘ ‘yea’ ’ on the Motion to Suspend the Rules and Agree to H. Con.

On rollcall 34, I would have voted ‘ on Approving the Journal. On rollcall 35, I would have voted ‘ the Motion to Adjourn. On rollcall 36, I would have voted ‘ the Motion to Adjourn. On rollcall 37, I would have voted ‘ ‘no ’ ’ on Ordering  the Previous Question on H. Res. 83, a bill Providing for consideration of H.R. 3, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001. On rollcall 38, I would have voted ‘ ‘no ’ ’ to Table the Motion to Reconsider H. Res. 83. On rollcall 39, I would have voted ‘ ‘no ’ ’ on Agreeing to H. Res. 83. On rollcall 40, I would have voted ‘ ‘no ’ ’ to Table the Motion to Reconsider H. Res. 83. On rollcall 41, I would have voted ‘ ‘aye ’ ’ on the Motion to Adjourn. On rollcall 42, I would have voted ‘ the Rangel Substitute to H.R. 3. On rollcall 43, I would have voted ‘ ‘yea ’ Table the Motion to Reconsider H.R. 3. On rollcall 44, I would have voted ‘ ‘aye ’ ’ on the Motion to Recommit H.R. 3 with instructions. On rollcall 45, I would have voted ‘ ‘yea’ ’ on Passage of H.R. 3, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001. Mr. Speaker, for me a ‘ ‘yea’ ’ vote on rollcall 33, to pass S.J. Res. 6, was a difficult decision.  I supported S.J. Res. 6 because, although I firmly believe an ergonomics regulation  is necessary,  I am  troubled by overly broad scope of the regulation that was promulgated late last year, and by the potential costs incurred by businesses required to implement this unfunded mandate against  the private sector. In recent years, my district has experienced the exodus of thousands of jobs, Mr. Speaker, largely because our  trade policies have encouraged businesses  to  take advantage of lower wages and weaker worker protection and environmental laws across our borders. I fear that imposing this particular ergonomics regulation would have encouraged the loss of even more jobs at home. At the same time, the process used to bring S.J. Res. 6  to  the House  floor disappointed me. It was rushed with no House hearings and little opportunity for debate. This process gave me little time to solicit the opinions of my constituents  in Mississippi. That  is why  I would have voted against the rule governing consideration of the Joint Resolution. Nonetheless,  I  believe  we  need  an ergonomics  regulation  that provides  reasonable protections for our workforce. The Secretary of Labor has indicated her willingness to promulgate a new regulation and I urge her to initiate the process immediately. We need  the business and  labor communities to work together to craft worker safety ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

And there are several other Senators’ staffs who have also been working on this issue. I think we might be able to get something done. I will make a couple points. One, these organizations do get a Federal tax benefit even though they are only involved in State and local races. That is something we have to address. The other point  is, as the Senator  from Texas did point out, I argued strenuously that our legislation, which was put on the Defense bill, would not be blue-slipped by the House and should not have been. And I still believe that. I agree with the Senator from Texas that this should not be blue-slipped either. But after we passed the bill, and they went to conference, the House was insistent upon  their position  that  it would be blue-slipped. So it was withdrawn from the Defense bill because of that adamant position the other body assumed. I have been discussing this matter with our staffs, and I think there is a way to work it out. I agree with the Senator from Texas, we should not put additional burdens on especially a majority of these relatively small organizations that are engaging in State and local campaigns. So I rather believe we can probably get something worked out and get it modified so it is acceptable to both the Senator from Texas as well as all Senators. I thank the Senator from Texas. We are going to work on it. I thank her for her engagement on this very important issue. I yield the floor. Mrs.  HUTCHISON  Chair. ",2001

150,Senate,107,-0.205,12,2001-04-05,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," I thank the Senator from Utah. I did not comment because, for me, the distinguishing factor in this amendment is the short-term economic stimulus and the particular method to achieve it, which is spelled out here, which is the substitute for the House tax bill. Those who framed the amendment consistently linked it with the long-term tax cut that, as you know, most Democrats propose because we think it is more fiscally responsible. Mr. President, if I may return the question, is the Senator from Utah prepared to separate the short-term fiscal stimulus? Again,  I think across the aisle we agree that $60 billion is the number. We may disagree about how to distribute it—to separate that from the longer term, 10-year discussion about how to divide the surplus. ",2001
151,Senate,107,-0.173,19,2001-04-05,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. President, this is the week baseball season begins anew. I am in a little bit of a baseball mood this week, even this afternoon under bright,  sunny  skies  in our Nation’s Capital. We have been working on the budget resolution in the Senate Chamber for the better part of this week, and  under  the  unanimous  consent agreement we will wrap it up hopefully tomorrow afternoon. Using a baseball analogy, this is like the seventh inning stretch. I want to take the opportunity to reflect on what we have agreed to, not agreed to, and maybe some thoughts we can keep in mind over the next 24 hours or so. As we attempt to adopt, fashion, and agree on a blueprint for spending for our Nation, the thought that creeps into almost every aspect of our discussions is the economy, the shaky nature of the economy, the fragile nature of the economy, and to what extent tax cuts should play as we adopt this budget framework. There are a number of ways to stimulate the economy, as we all know. One of the ways that is going forward right now is the aggressive monetary policy launched by the Federal Reserve over the last couple of months which will add to the gross domestic product of our country,  I am  told,  somewhere close to half a percentage point this year by virtue of lower interest rates. The Federal Reserve  is expected  to come back and consider by May 15 whether more  interest rate relief  is called for. My hope is they will do so, and maybe even before that time. Those interest rate reductions are already being felt in our economy as people refinance their homes, lower their mortgage rates, and take the moneys they are saving and spend it for other purposes. Another obvious way to stimulate the economy is through tax policy. I remind my colleagues as we consider a stimulus policy, trying to put some kind of rebates in place now, rate reductions,  child  credits, or marriage penalty relief, the actual  impact we will have through tax policy is de minimis. Take $3 trillion out of the stock market, as we have seen over the last several months, and pump in $40 billion, $50 billion, $60 billion in tax policy and in reality it is not going to amount to too much. I hope we will continue our efforts over the next 24 hours—frankly, over the weeks to come—to adopt the best stimulus of all. The best stimulus we could send, not just to the markets but the American people, would be for us to actually agree on a tax policy, not just 51 Republicans with the Vice President casting the tie-breaking vote but for a number of Democrats and Republicans to agree on an incremental approach where we would be able to lower marginal rates, broadly but not as deeply as the President wants, or double the child credit and make it retroactive to the beginning of this year, or we might eliminate the marriage penalty effective the beginning of this year, and do it in a way to provide stimulus to our economy but also some assurance that the taxpayers are going to see longterm rate reduction, long-term relief. The President was in Delaware a couple days ago, and I talked with him about this. He said: My concern  is, Tom, if we do not take a lot of money off the table now, we will spend the money. I reminded the President he plays an activist role in the appropriations process—signing and vetoing appropriations bills, signing and vetoing enhancements  to  entitlement  programs. In the end, while we are in the seventh inning stretch, the ball game is likely to go into extra innings, and the very best victory the American people can hope for is a bipartisan agreement for an  incremental approach to tax cuts that includes restraint on spending and includes a consensus that one of the best things we can do is continue the good work we have begun on reducing our Nation’s debt.

154,Senate,107,-0.123,26,2001-04-05,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. President, I thank the  distinguished  ranking member, Senator CONRAD, for his skill in managing our presentation from this side on the budget. I rise to make some comments  in general terms but directing my comments to the amendment I introduced today on behalf of myself and Senators NELSON, LANDRIEU, CARNAHAN, CHAFEE, LINCOLN, BAYH, TORRICELLI, and JEFFORDS. The amendment provides for a $1.25 trillion tax cut over the next 10 years for the enactment of marginal rate reductions and estate, marriage penalty, and alternative minimum tax relief,  and  reserves  additional  resources  for other domestic priorities such as debt reduction, education, agriculture,  defense,  and  prescription drugs. That  is  the  essence  of  the amendment. Let me suggest to my colleagues and, indeed, to the American public, that during  the Presidential elections of last year, the most  important thing President Bush was able to enunciate for the American people who contributed to his victory was not a number but a concept. The number he talked about in the campaign was a $1.3 trillion tax cut  for all Americans. But more important than the number was the concept in which he told the American people that if he were to come to Washington, he wanted to change the culture of the way Washington worked or, rather, the way Washington did not work. He said—I think correctly—that the American people were tired of class warfare. The American people were tired of the blame game. The American people were tired of seeing Democrats blame Republicans  for  failure. The American people were tired of Republicans blaming Democrats for failure. The American people were tired of the blame game and the essence in which we argued about  failure and whose fault it was that nothing was getting done. He said: If I get the chance to come to Washington, I will change that culture. The election was not about a number. It was about changing fundamentally the way we do business in this city. On this budget, we have the opportunity to show the American people that perhaps there  is a glimmer of hope, that perhaps with a new President  in Washington,  if he truly believes, as  I think he does, that he wants to change the culture, this is the first test of whether that will be done. If you took to the American people a tax cut of over a trillion dollars for all Americans and you were able to put together a bipartisan coalition of 55, 60, 65 or more votes together in a package and say, we have worked together to accomplish this in a bipartisan fashion, we have  fundamentally changed  the way Washington works, that would be a victory for this President. It would be a victory for the Senate and, far more importantly, it would be a victory for the American public. Let me assure my colleagues of one thing: This body is not the Super Bowl. This body is not the Final Four. In both of those endeavors there has to be a winner and there has to be a loser. I suggest that  in the Congress of the United States that is not true. In the Congress of the United States it is far more important that we keep in mind that we should be trying to make the American people the real winners. It is not as important which party wins, but that both parties can work together in order to make a victory available to the people of this country. I suggest we have an opportunity to do that, and unlike with the Super Bowl and the Final Four, everyone can be a winner and there can be no losers. It is time that we stop thinking that any number under $1.6 trillion is a loss for the President and a victory for the Democrats. That is simply not true. A number  in between what Democrats have offered and what the Republicans have offered that is available to all Americans, that receives a substantial degree of support from both sides, is an incredible victory. It is an incredible victory not because it is a number but because we will have  changed  fundamentally the culture of this city. It does not behoove any of us to try to pick one Republican off to join this side and for them to try to pick one Democrat off to join them on that side. If the American people see that that is the way Washington works in the year 2001, they will say the last Presidential election meant very little because of all the talk about change in the culture, and we ultimately get back to the VerDate 05-APR-2001 02:35 Apr 06, 2001 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G05AP6.075 pfrm02 PsN: S05PT1 ",2001

I am particularly excited about the proposal because with  each passing month, I have been hearing from new interested partners in helping with the legislation or have seen similar concepts advanced by others. Because of our mutual interest in helping small communities respond to environmental problems,  I  invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. The national Project SEARCH, Special Environmental Assistance for the Regulation of Communities and Habitat, concept is based on a pilot program that operated with great success in Idaho in 1999 and 2000. In short, the bill establishes a simplified application process  for communities with populations under 2,500 to receive assistance grants for meeting a broad array of federal, state, or local environmental regulations. Grants would be available for initial  feasibility studies, to address unanticipated costs arising during the course of a project, or when a community has been turned down or underfunded by traditional sources. The program would require no match from the recipients. Some of the major highlights of the program are: A simplified application process—no special grants coordinators required; No unsolicited bureaucratic intrusions  into  the  decision-making process; Communities must first have attempted to receive funds from traditional sources; It is open to studies or projects involving any environmental regulation; Applications are reviewed and approved by citizens panel of volunteers; The panel chooses the number of recipients and size of grants; The panel  consists  of  volunteers  representing all regions of the state; and No local match is required to receive the SEARCH funds. Over the past several years, it has become increasing apparent that small communities are having problems complying with environmental rules and regulations due primarily to lack of funding, not a willingness to do so. They, like all of us, want clean water and air and a healthy natural environment. Sometimes, they simply cannot shoulder  the  financial  burden with their limited resources. In addition, small communities wishing to pursue unique collaborative efforts might be discouraged by grant administrators who prefer  conformity. Some run into unexpected costs during a project and have borrowed and bonded to the maximum. Others are in critical habitat locations and any project may have additional costs, which may not be recognized by traditional financial sources. Still others just need help for  the  initial  environmental  feasibility study so they can identify the most effective path forward. With these needs in mind, in 1998, I was able to secure $1.3 million through the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, for a grant program for Idaho’s small communities.  Idaho’s program does not replace other funding sources, but serves as a final resort when all other means have been exhausted. The  application  process was  simplified so that any small town mayor, county  commissioner,  sewer district chairman, or community leader could manage  it without hiring a professional grant writer. An  independent citizens committee with statewide representation was established to make the selections and get the funds on the ground as quickly as possible. No bureaucratic or political intrusions were permitted. Although the EPA subsequently insisted that grants be limited to water and wastewater  projects,  forty-four communities in Idaho ultimately applied, not including two that failed to meet the eligibility requirements. Ultimately, twenty-one communities were awarded grants in several categories, and  ranged  in  size  from  $9,000  to $319,000. Communities serving Native Americans and migrants, as well as several innovative collaborative efforts were included in the successful applicants. The communities that were not selected are being given assistance in exploring other  funding  sources and other advice.

158,,107,0.231,110,2001-04-05,Mrs. KELLY.," Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday was the first day of ‘ ‘Back to Health Month,’ a  national  campaign  created  to  increase awareness of back pain as well as possible causes and prevention. Sponsored by  the North American Spine Society, this month is designed  to educate Americans about  their spine and how they can prevent common back injuries. The  facts of back pain speak  for  themselves. Did you know  that at some point  in their lives, more than 80 percent of American adults will experience back pain? Or, that 1 out of 14 adults will visit a physician this year due to back or neck pain, and that back pain is  the second most common reason people visit a physician? These statistics demonstrate how important it is to raise awareness about this health problem  that affects  too many Americans. One  famous American who suffers  from back pain is 1993 Major League Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, Reggie Jackson. Jackson was a two-time World Series MVP and Major League Player of the Year in 1973. During his legendary career, Jackson was named to the Major League All-Star  team  fourteen  times. However, last July, like so many other Americans, following a spine injury, Jackson underwent emergency spine surgery and has been undergoing spine rehabilitation ever since. Another highlight of ‘ ‘Back to Health Month’ is an event  to distribute  information about back pain. ‘ ‘Back to Health Day’ ’ on Capitol Hill will be held on April 24th, in the Rayburn Gold Room. ‘ ‘Back to Health Day’ ’ will provide an array of educational materials,  including guidelines  to a healthy back, exercises  to strengthen your back, and how  to prevent back pain.  In addition,  representatives  from the North American Spine Society will be on hand  to discuss commonly asked questions about back pain, causes and prevention. I encourage my colleagues to join us for ‘ ‘Back to Health Day’ ’ as we  learn  the most effective ways to prevent and alleviate back pain. I commend the North American Spine Society for organizing ‘ ‘Back to Health Month’ ’ and for their commitment to ensuring that Americans learn to keep their backs healthy. f TAX TREATMENT OF BONDS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY THE AMERICAN SAMOA GOVERNMENT HON.

TRIBUTE TO TOM KRIEGISH HON. JAMES A. BARCIA OFMICHIGAN INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 4, 2001 ",2001
160,,107,-0.184,110,2001-04-05,Mr. BARCIA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to pay tribute to Tom Kriegish upon the occasion of his retirement as Chief of the Electrical Division of the state of Michigan ’s Bureau of Construction Codes. Tom has spent 35 years to working in the electrical industry and for the past 15 years he has used his vast array of knowledge and training to ensure public confidence  in  the safety of buildings and structures throughout the state. Such work is critical to the well-being of citizens all over Michigan and Tom has always approached his job with extraordinary dedication and energy. Tom ’s work ethic and positive attitude in dealing with management, co-workers and customers have served as a shining example for others to follow. Tom has proved in his years of service that it is possible to exhibit character and professionalism  in a  job, while simultaneously earning the friendship of those with whom and for whom you work. Tom’s successful efforts  in ensuring  the electrical safety of Michigan homes and buildings often took him on the road. His time away from home certainly was a sacrifice  for his wife, Vicki, and three daughters, Leslie, Sandy and Jill. Michigan  residents owe a debt of gratitude both to Tom and his family for an unfailing devotion to duty. As an electrical inspector, Tom became a legend for his ability to quickly react to a problem and solve it satisfactorily. His responsiveness came in handy during his frequent travels in northern Michigan. Once, Tom, who was known to miss a curve or two on slippery winter roads, found his vehicle heading straight for a dump truck hauling a backhoe. Showing his acumen for swift reaction, Tom regained enough control of his vehicle to bury it in a snowbank. Always  faithful  to  the mission at hand, Tom had plenty of  time  to reflect on electrical inspections protocol while waiting for a wrecker to arrive. On a more serious note, Tom has always displayed a willingness to give back to the industry to which he dedicated his life. His active role in the Michigan Chapter of the International Association of Electrical  Inspectors, including  terms as President and Executive Board Chairman, have contributed greatly to the industry and to the general public by developing professionalism and expertise among his peers. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our deep appreciation to Tom and his family for outstanding service and  in wishing  them well in all future endeavors. ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

161,,107,0.484,117,2001-04-05,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against the ongoing wage and labor rights violations in factories operating in some of our American territories, and I ask that my colleagues join me in creating reforms that will finally ensure that all workplaces that operate under the American flag do so  in compliance with  federal  law.  I have been involved for a number of years in an effort  to reduce  the well-documented exploitation of  temporary  foreign workers, particularly Asian women, in the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (US/ CNMI). In the past few months, I have been troubled to leam that the practice of exploiting temporary workers has now spread to American Samoa. According to a recent Department of Labor investigation,  the Daewoosa  factory  in  the American Samoa employed 251 Vietnamese ‘guest workers’ more  than 90 percent of them women— for nearly two years under conditions of indentured servitude. These workers took on a debt of up to $8,000 dollars each in order to qualify for what they believed would be good  jobs  in America, but  instead  they were constantly paid  less  than  the Samoan minimum wage of only $2.60 per hour. Sometimes  the workers of  the Daewoosa  factory were not paid at all. Many workers also faced verbal, physical and sexual abuse, including a severe beating that caused one young woman to lose an eye. As a result of these violations, Daewoosa owner Kil Soo Lee now  faces charges of forced labor in federal court. While I applaud the Federal Government for prosecuting  this particular  violator of  labor laws, I believe we must take steps to ensure that  these  injustices never happen again.  I urge my colleagues to read the following article from the Honolulu Star-Bulletin and consider whether  they would ever  tolerate such conditions and exploitation  in  their own districts. I also invite my colleagues to join me in cosponsoiing legislation to bring all of the U.S. territories  into  compliance with  the  federal laws  that  protect workers  throughout  the United States. [From the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Mar. 31, 2001] HAWAIISHOULDLEADFIGHTTOENDABUSEOF WORKERSINU.S. TERRITORIES The issue: Allegations that Asian workers were forced to work at an American Samoan garment sweatshop under  inhuman conditions have resulted in federal charges here. Human rights and labor abuses uncovered on the Northern Marianas island of Saipan three years ago embarrassed U.S. garment manufacturers, resulting in lawsuits and federal  legislation  targeted  for  the  islands north of Guam. Sweatshop conditions as bad if  not worse  in American Samoa  have prompted criminal charges in federal court. The two cases suggest that U.S. territories in the Pacific have been vulnerable to such abuses far more than had been assumed. Reform legislation that failed in the last Congress should be rejuvenated and broadened to include all U.S. possessions. About  14,000  workers,  mostly  young women, from China, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Thailand were lured by promises of good wages to pay fees of up to $10,000 to enter the labor force in the Northern Marianas. In 1998, federal lawsuits accused 32 contractors on Saipan of beatings, forced abortions and rat-infested quarters in essentially a prison environment surrounded by barbedwire and armed guards. Major  clothing  retailers  in  the United States that had bought garments sewn on Saipan settled lawsuits by agreeing to establish a $1.25 million fund to finance monitoring, compensate workers and create a public education program. Senator Akaka last year won Senate approval of a bill to extend U.S. immigration and minimum-wage  laws to the Marianas and allow ‘‘Made in the USA’’ labels only on garments on which more than half the work had been done by American citizens. The measure died in the House. More recently, a Labor Department investigation has uncovered  similar abuses  in American Samoa, with work and living conditions so horrid that some garment workers, mostly women  from Vietnam,  looked like ‘‘walking skeletons.’’ Similar to the situation on Saipan, up to 250 workers had borrowed $2,000 to $7,000 each to acquire their jobs and fly from Vietnam or China to Saipan.  Investigators  found  frequent violations of the Samoan minimum wage ($2.60 an hour) and numerous abuses, including the beating of workers and withholding of meals as a form of punishment. Daewoosa, a Korean-owned clothing manufacturer  that had made apparel  for J.C. Penney Co., closed the plant in January. A judge in Samoa placed Daewoosa under receivership after it failed to pay $600,000 in back wages and  fines resulting  from the Labor Department investigation. Penney had canceled contracts with the factory  immediately after  learning of the abuses. Daewoosa owner Kil Soo Lee now faces charges of involuntary servitude and forced labor in federal court in Honolulu. While the semiautonomous status of U.S. territories in the Pacific may vary, the conditions  that were  found  on Saipan  and Samoa should be condoned on none of them. As leaders of the U.S. community in the Pacific,  Hawaii’s  congressional  delegation should promote  legislation  to  end  these human-rights abuses. f TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER JOHN FRISTACHI HON.

163,,107,-0.376,124,2001-04-05,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me today in paying tribute to a great man who will shortly celebrate his 80th birthday— Irving M. Rosenbaum. In addition to the commendable accomplishment of attaining the age of 80, Mr. Rosenbaum, has provided extraordinary commitment and  leadership on behalf of the Open University of Israel. The Open University of Israel, modeled after the Open University  in Great Britain, welcomed its first students in 1976. With a current enrollment of approximately 29,000 students, the Open University of  Israel has a  flexible teaching style that allows many working and older students the opportunity to receive a college education. Students hail  from all over Israel and from virtually every walk of life. Utilizing  the  Internet, satellites, cable TV and other methods, the University is able to provide long distance learning to almost any student who desires it. Mr. Speaker, Irving Rosenbaum has played an  active  role  in  the University’s  history through  the American Friends of The Open University of  Israel. During  the past  thirteen years, under his astute leadership, the American Friends of The Open University of Israel has been transformed from a small group to a large organization which contributes significant funding annually to the University. Irving was born in Dresden, Germany, and with his  family, he  fled Nazi Germany and came to the United States in 1938. Here, he joined S.E. Nichols and Co., a variety store chain. His service at the store was interrupted when he served in Europe with the U.S. Army. As a member of  the Psychological Warfare Branch, Rosenbaum participated in Allied war efforts in Africa, Italy, France, and Germany. After the war, he remained in Germany where he served as a member of the Allied Control Commission for Germany. When he returned to the United States he received a bachelors degree in Economics from the New School for Social Research and later earned a Masters degree, also in economics. Mr. Speaker,  Irving Rosenbaum’s commitment to Jewish and Israeli causes is exceptional.  In addition  to his  leadership of  the American Friends of  the Open University of Israel, he is a member of the Executive Committee of  the American  Israel Public Affairs Committee, a Member of the Board of Directors of the United Jewish Appeal Federation of New York, a Member of the Executive Committee of the American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic, and a Member of the Board of the American Friends of Livnot U’Lehibanot.

164,,107,-0.465,131,2001-04-05,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  the nominees  for  the South Carolina Outstanding Neighborhood Volunteers of  the Year. Many of these volunteers nominated for the award are from my district and well deserving of the honor. The Burton Heights-Standish Acres Neighborhood Association in Columbia, South Carolina is an organization devoted to the safety and cleanliness of their neighborhood; this association has four members who were nominated for the award. Mr. and Mrs. John Watson are dedicated volunteers who have been catalysts for a united, safe, and friendly community. Sylvester Jenkins, a charter member of the Burton Heights-Standish Acres Neighborhood Association, is a model citizen who also serves as President of the Retired Mail Handlers Organization. Venis J. Livingston is noted  throughout  the neighborhood  for her rapport with the youth, a characteristic she utilizes in her role as a Parent educator. ‘The Drama Team,’  a subunit of the Eau Claire Community Council Youth Organization, uses theatrical plays and artistic endeavors to educate community youth about issues ranging  from HIV/AIDS  to violence and drugs. ‘The Drama Team’  has  three  fine women who have been nominated for the Outstanding Neighborhood Volunteers of the Year Award. Angela Cooper  is a schoolteacher who provides mentoring to the students on the team, teaching self-esteem and reading skills. Community Advocate Angeline Morris ensures support  from  the business  community  to  the ECCC so the operations of the team are properly financed. Rubye Finch is a team mentor who excels in the teaching of conflict resolution. Neighborhood promotion, preservation, and improvement are  the goals of  the Bradley Community Council; the Council has three outstanding volunteers nominated for the award. Block Captain Sue Finch devotes her time on a  regular basis  to ensure  the success of events such as the annual Hot Dog Night and Crime Out Night. Susan Hamm served as President of the Bradley Community Council from 1995  to 2000 and currently  leads a neighborhood  bible  study. Stacey Shugart leads the Council in the production of a Community Directory and assists in the printing of newsletters and meeting minutes. The Booker T. Washington High School Foundation nominated one of  their  founding members, Susan Brown Freeman, as the Outstanding Neighborhood Volunteer of the Year. Mrs. Freeman was the first African American consultant  for Special Education  teachers  in Richland County, SC School District 1. Mary C. Short of the Bethel Bishop Tenant Association  is another nominee  for  the award. Her dedication  to  the  AmeriCorp  organization along with her work as an Education Coordinator for Eau Claire Community Council have earned her a nomination. The HOPE volunteer organization nominated Samuel Gadegbeku for his work with the organization and in his community of  the Colony Apartments. Mr. Gadegbeku selflessly gives his time to inspire self-esteem and hard work in the youth of his neighborhood. The members of the Brandon Acres/Cedar Terrace Neighborhood Association are committed to preserving and improving the community in which they reside; they have nominated Dr. Ramona Lagos, professor at  the University of South Carolina. Dr. Lagos organized the Association’s first meeting with important city officials; she also serves as Secretary. The Seminar Ridge Neighborhood Organization organizes activities to provide the best  living environment  to  its  residents. Dr. Lois Fries served as President of this Organization for seven years, during which time she greatly increased its impact in the community. The Read Street/Edgewood Community  Improvement Cooperative Council  nominated Georgia Davenport for the Outstanding Neighborhood Volunteer of  the Year Award. Mrs. Davenport worked extensively  in  the Read Street clean up, which led to a reduction in drug traffic and violence in the area. The Booker Washington Heights Neighborhood Organization  is dedicated  to  the  improvement of  the  community of Columbia, South Carolina and has nominated three individuals. Johnnie Edmonds serves as Treasurer and is very active in this organization despite the fact that he moved out of the neighborhood years ago. The late Beverly Hampton left a  legacy of community  involvement and dedication  to her neighbors when she departed  this  life  on May  21,  2000. Kevin Speaks has worked to improve a poor section of the Booker Washington Heights neighborhood by giving his time and showing pride in his community. Mr. Speaker, please  join me  in honoring each and every one of these wonderful volunteers. They show all of us what can be done if we give back  to  the neighborhoods and towns we call home. Every one of the nominees for the Outstanding Neighborhood Volunteers of the Year Award deserves the honor along with our appreciation. f HONORING GARY LEE TIMMER HON. DALE E.

On Saturday, February 24, 2001 at the Reggie Lewis Center in Boston, the Hillers won their second consecutive state championship. This accomplishment is impressive in and of itself, but when one considers the obstacles that these outstanding young female athletes had to overcome in their season-long pursuit of the title, their victory is all the more remarkable. Despite construction delays at their practice venue that kept meets from starting until halfway through the season, they remained focused. Despite season-ending injuries to essential runners Vicky Henderson and Melissa Sprachman, they were able to remain positive. And despite illnesses that affected some team members at important meets, they were able to pull together and earn victories. At  the  championship,  senior  co-captain Christine Moschella  led  the Hillers’ charge. She not only won  the 300-meter, but set a new state record in the event as well. Freshman Tiana Riel also earned critical points for placing  third  in  the 55-meter high hurdles. Moschella and Riel then joined with senior cocaptain Jen McCowan and sophomore Emily Campbell to win the 4×200 meter relay.

166,,107,0.4,138,2001-04-05,Mr. BONILLA.," Mr. Speaker, I commend the leadership of the government of Bulgaria for its ongoing  interest  in and support  for modernization of the Maritza III East thermal plant. I urge  the sitting Parliament  in Sofia  to express their support for this project by granting, all necessary government approvals before their scheduled dismissal prior to the upcoming, general elections. This will ensure  that this important project can move forward expeditiously and successfully. The Maritza  III East  thermal plant project has benefits  that are well documented and widely-acknowledged at the local, regional and national levels. When the refurbishment work begins, more than $75 million in local goods and services will be purchased and more than 600 construction jobs will be created. Regionally, refurbishment of the Maritza III East power plant will reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by as much as 90 to 95 percent. The  refurbished power plant will meet  the emissions  requirements of  the World Bank, European Union,  the Bulgarian government, which  in  turn, will  fulfill  important criteria  for Bulgaria’s ultimate entry  into  the European Union. Also at the regional level, the joint venture (Entergy & NEK) company that will operate the rehabilitated power plant will provide direct and  indirect  tax  revenues  to Bulgaria and to the Galabovo municipality in the Stara Zagora region. On a broader scale, modernization of  this power plant will have several positive impacts on Bulgaria’s national economy. Long-term, modernization of  this power plant will move Bulgaria closer  to competitive energy  independence. f INTRODUCTION OF THE EXPENSING TECHNOLOGY REFORM ACT OF 2001 HON. JERRY WELLER OFILLINOIS INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 4, 2001 ",2001
167,,107,0.288,138,2001-04-05,Mr. WELLER.," Mr. Speaker,  today, Representative NEALand I have introduced legislation which will update the existing depreciation schedules for high tech assets. Currently, businesses must depreciate much of their high tech equipment over a 5 year period. This bill would allow businesses to expense these assets. The 5 year depreciation lifetime for tax purposes  is outdated  since many  companies today must update their computers as quickly as every 14 months in order to stay technologically current. We allow businesses to expense their computers, peripheral equipment, servers,  networks,  wireless  telecommunications equipment, software, high tech medical equipment and copiers in this bill. This will stimulate the economy! According to a study conducted by the Printing Industries of America, printers would purchase 20 percent more  computers  if  the  depreciation schedules reflected the actual life of the equipment. It is time to update an outdated tax code to reflect  the  realities  of  today’s  technologybased workplace.  A  5  year  depreciation schedule for high tech equipment is no longer realistic. This  legislation will allow every company, from  the neighborhood real estate office,  to the local hospital, to the local bank to fully depreciate, or expense,  their high  tech equipment during the tax year in which the equipment is purchased. As a result, these companies will no  longer be  forced  to keep  their equipment  ‘on  the books’ for  tax purposes long after its useful life has become obsolete. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with you and my colleagues to get this important pro-business legislation signed into law. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON.

FRED UPTON OFMICHIGAN INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 4, 2001 ",2001
169,,107,0.339,138,2001-04-05,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to honor the 50th Anniversary of one of the finest radio stations in my state of Michigan, and indeed  the entire Midwest, WMUK, of Kalamazoo, Michigan. Like many of our country’s greatest institutions, WMUK had modest beginnings. In 1951, based on the campus of what was then Western Michigan College, WMUK was  founded under the call letters WMCR. WMCR was only on the air for a few hours each day and early programming consisted of music and instructional programs. At  the  time, WMCR was a pioneer in radio. As such, it was the first FM station in Kalamazoo. Over the years, WMCR’s development mirrored the growth of Kalamazoo. For example, in 1961, WMCR changed their call letters to WMUK to reflect Western Michigan College’s name change to Western Michigan University. A few years later, in 1965 WMUK was the first radio station  in Kalamazoo  to begin broadcasting in stereo. Over the years, as the station ’s popularity has grown so has their signal strength. From a meager 400 watts in 1951, today, WMUK broadcasts at 50,000 watts. Today, after 50 years, WMUK is a cornerstone of  the Kalamazoo community.  I am pleased to say that WMUK is now on the air 21 hours a day offering a wide variety of programming  to suit  the diverse  tastes of our community. Mr. Speaker, I ask that these remarks be made part of  the permanent  record of  the VerDate 11<MAY>2000 01:36 Apr 06, 2001 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A04AP8.117 pfrm08 PsN: E05PT1 ‘ ’   ‘ ’ ",2001
170,,107,-0.396,145,2001-04-05,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special  tribute  to  the  late Raymond W. ‘Jake’  Engelhard, a  former  resident of my northern Michigan congressional district, who spent decades as a miner, a community servant, a local volunteer. Jake was also a union leader, who devoted many years to the labor movement, helping ensure a good quality of life for working men and women. Jake was born  in Rosco, Minnesota and moved  to  Ishpeming, Michigan,  in 1935. He worked as an iron ore miner for 43 years for the Inland Steel Corporation and was the first miner to join the CIO union in the Lake Superior District. As president of USWA Local 2099 for many years, Jake’s effort helped  to  improve  the quality of life for miners on the Marquette Iron Range. Jake was  instrumental  in waging a successful strike in 1946 that lasted 108 days. Contract demands were met as a result of that strike. Jake went  through many strikes over  the years, and he strived tirelessly to improve the wages and working conditions of his  fellow workers. He retired in 1970. In addition to Jake’s union activities, he was active  in numerous community service and civic organizations. Jake also played on  the Ishpeming city baseball team, later coaching the  Ishpeming City  and American  Legion teams. Jake Engelhard was also a local businessman,  the proprietor of  the Coffee Pot  in Ishpeming during the 1940s. You can be sure, Mr. Speaker, that a good deal of solidarity was served up to each patron along with their orders. There are many of us in Congress, who are concerned about the impact of world trade— and violations of world trade agreements— on our iron ore production back in Michigan. We fight this fight today with the assistance of administration officials and with the cooperation of varied segments of the steel industry. We fight for this industry, because we know it is vital to both the nation’s health and the jobs of the men and women who work in the industry back home. Men like Jake Engelhard fought an earlier fight on behalf of the working men and women of the iron range, a battle that was vital during its  time. But Jake’s battles were different.  It was the workers themselves with their limited resources, fighting with the weapons of belief in the rightness of their cause and the strength of their united effort. I look for encouragement and inspiration in those old struggles; I am reminded  that battles may not be won  in a week, a month, a year or perhaps many years. Our men and women who stood on the picket line to improve the lives of families have much to teach us about working on behalf of others. Jake will be honored Saturday, April 7, 2001, with induction into the U.P. Labor Hall of Fame at a banquet in Northern Michigan University in Marquette, Michigan. It is recognition long due. to choose between their civil rights and their job denies  them  their right  to equal  justice. Employees who consent to mandatory arbitration give up their right to due process, trial by jury, the appeals process, and full discovery. By no means does this legislation ban all use of arbitration. Voluntary arbitration in an impartial setting can be a fair and inexpensive way to resolve a wide range of disputes. But when it Is forcibly imposed on one party with inherently less bargaining power, it ceases to be fair and just. Our  legislation would protect  the rights of workers to bring claims against their employers in cases of employment discrimination. By amending seven Federal civil rights statutes to make it clear that the powers and procedures provided under those laws are the exclusive ones that apply when a claim arises, the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act would prevent discrimination claims from being involuntarily sent to binding arbitration. In short, this bill prevents employers in all industries from forcing employees to give up their right to go to court when they are discriminated against on account of race, sex, religion, disability, or other illegal criteria. By reinforcing the fundamental rights established under various civil rights and fair employment practice laws, our bill restores integrity  to employer-employee  relationships. No employer should be permitted to ask workers to check their Constitutional and civil rights at the front door. f f INTRODUCTION  OF  THE  CIVIL RIGHTS  PROCEDURES  PROTECTION ACT OF 2001 HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY OFMASSACHUSETTS INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 4, 2001 ",2001
171,,107,-0.502,145,2001-04-05,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join  today with a bipartisan group of colleagues  to  introduce  the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act of 2001. This bill is designed to reassert workers’ rights to have their claims of unlawful employment discrimination. On March 21, 2001 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5– 4 that under existing law an employer can require its employees to waive their right to file job-related lawsuits including those involving civil rights, sexual harassment or discrimination.  Approximately  10  percent  of American workers  are  covered  by  similar agreements, which are  increasingly used by Wall Street firms, high-tech companies, retailers and other employers seeking to avoid the cost and risks of court cases. This month’s Court ruling, encourages more companies to follow this increasingly common practice. This practice, called ‘ ‘mandatory arbitration’ , requires employees to sign away their fundamental rights to a court hearing. As a condition of hiring or promotion, employers require workers to agree to submit any future claims of job discrimination to binding arbitration panels. Mandatory arbitration is increasingly relied upon by employers in information technology, health care, engineering and other fields. Such requirements are reducing civil rights protection to the status of the company car: a perk which can be denied at will. The Constitution guarantees every citizen ‘equal justice under law’ . Forcing employees THE GET ARSENIC OUT OF OUR DRINKING WATER ACT HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN OFCALIFORNIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, April 4, 2001 ",2001
172,,107,-0.473,145,2001-04-05,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the ‘ ‘Get Arsenic Out of Our Drinking Water Act.’  This  legislation  is necessary  in order to prevent the Administration from irresponsibly  weakening  safe  drinking  water standards for arsenic. Without question, safe drinking water is critical to protecting public health. Yet two weeks ago we witnessed an extraordinary reversal in our  nation’s  commitment  to  safe  drinking water. Following extensive lobbying by special interests who contributed millions of dollars in campaign contributions, the Bush Administration  revoked  the new  safe drinking water standard for arsenic. This decision threatens the health of millions of Americans who now drink water with elevated levels of arsenic. In response to this indefensible action, I— along with one hundred and sixty of my colleagues— are  introducing  legislation  that will codify the standard so that the Bush Administration will not have the authority to revoke it. In January, the EPA responded to the scientific consensus on the health effects of arsenic and ordered that arsenic levels be reduced to 10 parts per billion. EPA took this action  in  response  to a National Academy of Sciences  report  that  recommended  that  the 1942 standard of 50 ppb be  reduced  ‘as promptly as possible.’  The Academy determined that arsenic is an extremely potent carcinogen  that causes bladder,  lung, and skin cancer and may cause kidney and liver cancer, birth defects, and reproductive problems.

173,,107,-0.334,152,2001-04-05,Mr. ISRAEL.," Mr. Speaker, Getting married shouldn’t mean saying ‘I do;’ to higher taxes. In my state of New York over one and a half million couples are burdened by the marriage penalty, nearly 60,000  in my district alone. This occurs when married couples pay more than an unmarried couple with the same income. For example two individuals, living together, but  not married,  each  with  incomes  of $30,000— their combined standard deduction would be $9,100 and their tax rate would be 15%.  If  that same couple got married,  their standard deduction would drop to $7,189 and they would move into the 28% tax rate. The only difference is that they got married. We should eliminate  this  inequity by widening the 15% tax bracket to allow joint filers to have  two  times  the  income of  individuals and still remain taxed at 15%. We should also double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that of singles. We’re talking about people who work hard and play by the rules. At a time when parents are working harder for less money, we need to encourage families, not punish them. Ending the marriage penalty is particularly urgent for the middle-class. This is a wrong that should have been righted a long time ago— making the tax code more fair while providing families with meaningful tax relief for the things that matter— buying a home, ensuring  quality  family medical  sending kids to college. f NAVY EP–3 AIRCRAFT IN CHINA HON.

174,,107,-0.343,152,2001-04-05,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Mr. Speaker, the emergency landing of the Navy EP–3 aircraft in China demonstrates the nature of the risk that our service members endure each day. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, brave men and women put themselves in the face of danger. My heart goes out to those on the ground in China and to their families who anxiously await their return. I call on President Bush and President Jiang to engage in a dialogue that results in the quickest possible reunion of our Navy personnel and their families. As we all wait, let us remember the dangers abroad and  the sacrifices endured by our service members. Let us also remember the demands that military service places on their families. I recently spoke with a young woman who had just recently married a young sailor. Until now, she had always expected her husband to return home each night. Now  the  impact of being a Navy wife hits home. There is always the possibility that ‘ ‘he may not come home.’ f REMARKS  BY  THE  HONORABLE MIKE  THOMPSON RECOGNIZING DAVID WOLPER FOR HIS EXCELLENT WORK AND SUPPORT TOWARDS  THE  COMPLETION  OF THE  NAPA  BOYS  AND  GIRLS CLUB HON.

175,,107,-0.395,152,2001-04-05,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize renowned filmmaker and noted philanthropist David L. Wolper. His contributions have made the Napa community a better place for California’s youth. His invaluable aid was instrumental in the construction  of  the Napa Boys  and Girls Club’s new facility in the city of Napa. This important endeavor simply could not have been completed without his vital  leadership. The new facility at 1515 Pueblo Avenue will be a great asset to the Napa community for many years to come. Mr. Wolper  is a member of  the National Board of Directors of the Boys and Girls Club of America and is a member of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America Hall of Fame. In addition, David Wolper is a member of the Foundation Board of the Queen of the Valley Hospital in Napa and a member of the Board of the American Center for Wine, Food, and the Arts. He is an asset in so many ways to the community of Napa and the entire country. Mr. Wolper, in his fifty years in show business, has made over 700 films, which have won more than 150 awards, including 3 Oscars, 50 Emmys, 7 Golden Globes, and 5 Peabodys.

176,House,107,0.646,2,2001-04-24,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today disappointed by the news that NASA has again acquiesced to inappropriate Russian demands to the Space Station program. Russia will be sending Dennis Tito, a 60-year-old American millionaire, as one of  its contributions to this week’s mission to the Space Station. What unique characteristics does Mr. Tito possess that earned his place on this mission? Cold hard cash. $20 million of it from Mr. Tito to the Russians is all it took for a rocket-powered trip to the Space Station. Unfortunately, this partnership based on a core scientific mission apparently is now the next Club Med for those able to pony up millions of dollars to the Russian Government. So how is it that the Russians, whose Station nonperformance cost the U.S. taxpayers at least 2 years’ delay and over $5 billion in cost overruns, can brazenly increase the safety risk of the entire mission?  They  can  because NASA’s management did not provide the necessary safeguards earlier in this so-called partnership. NASA’s  forced acquiescence to Russia regarding Mr. Tito is just the latest example of the Russians taking NASA’s management to the cleaners. f AMERICA  HAS  BEEN  BETRAYED BY JANET RENO AND FATCATS AT TOP, AND THERE HAS NOT EVEN BEEN AN INVESTIGATION (Mr. TRAFICANT  asked  and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

177,House,107,0.52,2,2001-04-24,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, High Point, North Carolina, is known far and wide as the furniture capital of the world. High Point is hosting this week the largest  wholesale  home  furnishing show  in  the world, where  approximately  80,000  industry  professionals have come from 50 States and 110 countries to buy, sell, and discuss furniture. The market was established in 1921 when  149 American companies organized their own show at a location central to the country’s leading furniture manufacturers, and that is High Point, North Carolina. We extend best wishes to those at High Point this week for a successful market and extend furthermore a cordial welcome for all to return to High Point in the fall, in October specifically, for the fall market. ",2001
178,House,107,-0.256,9,2001-04-24,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Speaker, just in response, what we are trying to do here is make a decision as to which is better. The Senate had a choice. They could do more for tax cuts and less for education, or more for education and  less  for tax cuts. They decided to do substantially more for education. By the same token, they decided to adequately fund a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BENTSEN) to talk about double counting and overobligation of the Medicare Trust Fund. ",2001
179,House,107,-0.292,9,2001-04-24,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding me  this time. Mr. Speaker, like my colleagues, and in particular the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, I just returned from my district where I had a number of town meetings with my constituents. We talked about the budget, and we talked about the budget not just being a 1-year budget, but the decisions we might make this year would have implications far beyond the next fiscal year, implications far beyond the next 10 fiscal years. What we are saying with respect to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Medicare Trust Fund, is it is not so simple that we can take that money today and spend it on something else and not have to make it up later. My colleague from Iowa uses the do-not-worry, be-happy defense,  that we can add prescription drug benefits using this money, we can modernize Medicare and use this money, and it will all work out in the wash. But the fact is that it will not work out in the wash because the money that you want to use, the trust fund money, is already obligated. It is already obligated to pay Hospital Insurance Trust Fund benefits. Mr. Speaker, we all know that the demand on that money is not declining, it is increasing as America ages. It is  interesting because my colleagues some years back, in fact my first year in the House when we went through all of the debates over the budget and whether we were going to cut Medicare or not, and the Speaker of the House at that time said we needed to cut Medicare in order to save it because the trust fund was going bankrupt; and yet today  the  Republican  Party  has brought a budget to the  floor that would in fact shorten that trust fund, shorten the life span of that trust fund after all of the work we have gone to to extend the life span of that trust fund. Legally and logically it is not correct that you can take Medicare Trust Fund moneys and spend them on anything, whether  it  is prescription drugs or highways or Howitzers or whatever. Those moneys are obligated  to  the beneficiaries currently and those in the future who will enjoy the benefits of the inpatient hospital trust fund. Mr. Speaker, all we are saying is let us use some honest bookkeeping and set those funds aside. If we do not do that, what we are going to end up with in this budget, not just in fiscal year 2002, but for many years to come, is a budget which is borrow and spend. We are going to spend today, and then we are going to borrow tomorrow much deeper than we would otherwise. ",2001

Mr. Speaker, I want to understand the message. I think I heard the gentleman from Iowa, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, say that one of these points he had some problem with. I do not know why my colleagues would have any problem with any of the points. First of all, we are trying to make sure that we have a minimal amount of moneys, and that is the same amount that the Senate put for Medicare. We are trying to make sure that at least that amount of money, which has been recognized by both Republicans and Democrats, on this floor as well as in the Senate bicamerally, that the 147 was an insufficient number, and that $300 billion is closer. Mr. Speaker, so first, it is to make sure that we have adequate amounts of money for prescription drugs. Is that what we are trying to achieve? ",2001

184,,107,0.581,16,2001-04-24,Mr. DEAL of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend the Junior League of Gainesville-Hall County, Georgia as that group celebrates its 50th anniversary of service to our community. The Junior League is an organization of women committed to promoting volunteerism, developing the potential of women, and improving the  community; and  the women of Gainesville and Hall counties have certainly demonstrated during the past half century that hard work and good spirits can make a powerful difference in the community that we live in. The Gainesville-Hall County chapter of the Junior League was founded by Ms. Idalu Haugabook Slack and chartered on May 21, 1951. The group began making a strong impact then, and I am proud to report that their work has not only  continued  but  has  intensified since that time. In 1951, the 21 charter members donated some 515 hours of community service. This year’s membership donated over 8,000 hours, all while raising some $80,000 in a single year. Early projects from the GainesvilleHall County Junior League  included services to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, a story hour for children at the Hall  County  Library,  and  school lunches for less fortunate children. In 1952, this strong group of women began two permanent projects as well, the Green Hunter Homes Nursery, and the Charity Ball. Their list of accomplishments continued  through  the years, and in 1954 the first ‘‘Fall Thrift Sale’’ began. The Junior League of GainesvilleHall County has a special tradition of helping children with speech problems. After  spending  4 years  transporting children to the Atlanta Speech School, the  members  retained  a  speech correctionist to allow the children of Gainesville and Hall counties to get help closer to home. In the early 1970s, the Northeast Georgia Speech  and Hearing Center was opened, and I had the honor of serving on that first board of directors. The Junior League also donated money for newborn intensive care equipment. In recent years, the Junior League of Gainesville-Hall County underwrote a $30,000 grant to help open a new child advocacy center and has participated in  the massive  restoration  of  the Gainesville Civic Center. Joining with the Association  of  Junior Leagues International, health concerns emerged as major initiatives and projects were begun, including the creation of a mobile health van and the hosting of a Child Welfare Forum. History shows that  the women of Gainesville-Hall County Junior League are able to continue old projects even as they engage in new endeavors that help our community. Mr. Speaker, one of the main problems of  the Junior League  is demonstrating the effectiveness of trained volunteers,  and  they  are  certainly doing a great job at it. League members have a strong history as State and community leaders, and I commend the Gainesville-Hall County Junior League for their continuing legacy of service and achievement. f REMEMBERING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE ",2001

186,House,107,-0.473,23,2001-04-24,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues  in  commemorating  the  Armenian Genocide. Today we solemnly remember the April 24, 1915 onslaught of the Ottoman Government’s eight-year campaign of terror against its Armenian population. We mourn the systematic destruction of Armenian communities, the murder of one and a half million men, women, and children, and  the  forced deportation of over nearly one million others. This  somber  anniversary,  however,  also bears a stark warning. Eighty-six years ago, the world’s willingness to ignore the bloodshed against Armenians set the stage for its complacency during Hitler’s attempt to annihilate the Jews. Today, the world’s resolve against historical revisionism of the Armenian Genocide will be a key determinant of our ability to stand against similar attempts at Holocaust denial. I am proud  to acknowledge  the Armenian Americans in my district and across the country who have dedicated  themselves  to preserving the memory of those who were persecuted, and to publicizing the United States records documenting this period. I join them and my colleagues  in renewing our commitment to stand against governments that persecute their own people, and to insuring that no act of genocide will ever again go unnoticed or unmourned. ",2001
187,House,107,-0.376,23,2001-04-24,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the Armenian victims of the genocide brought upon them by the Ottoman Turkish Empire and to commend my colleagues, the gentleman  from New Jersey, Congressman FRANKPALLONE, and the gentleman from Michigan, Congressman  for organizing this special order today so that Members of the House may take the time to remember this solemn occasion. April 24th marks the beginning of the systematic and deliberate campaign of genocide perpetrated by the Ottoman Turkish Empire in 1915. Over the following 8 years, 1.5 million Armenians were tortured and murdered, and more than half a million were forced from their homeland into exile. Regrettably, in the years since, the Turkish Government has refused to apologize for these atrocious acts, or even acknowledge  the Armenian Genocide, despite overwhelming documentation. By recognizing the victims of the genocide, we commemorate both  those who perished and those who were able to begin a new life in communities like my home State of Rhode Island, where many Armenian  families conKNOLLENBERG, JOE tinue to thrive today. I hope that recognition of this atrocity will help erase the remnants of an era in which propaganda and deceit held precedence over truth and human dignity. Our nation must never allow oppression and persecution to pass without condemnation. Armenians are a strong,  resilient people, struggling  to heal  the wounds of  the past. However, until the Armenian genocide is officially acknowledged,  these wounds will  remain. We should not deny the Armenian people  their  rightful place  in history. To do so would dishonor  them, and blight our understanding of the past. It is the best interests of our nation and the entire global community to remember the past and learn from history. Even as we  remember  the  tragedy and honor the dead, we also honor the living. Out of  the ashes of  their history, Armenians all across the world have clung to their identity and have prospered in new communities. The State of Rhode Island is fortunate to be home to such an organized and active community, whose members contribute and participate in every aspect of civic life. As an ardent supporter of  the ArmenianAmerican  community  throughout my public service career, I am proud to honor the victims of  the genocide by paying  tribute  to  their memory, showing compassion for those who have suffered  from such heinous prejudice, and never forgetting the pain that they have endured. Let us never forget their tragedy, and ensure that such crimes are never repeated. ",2001
188,House,107,0.043,23,2001-04-24,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our two distinguished cochairmen of the Caucus on Armenian Issues, the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. KNOLLENBERG) and  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) for arranging this special order today. I also want to extend my concerns  to  the Armenian-American community on this somber occasion. Armenian-Americans have every reason to be proud of  their heritage and  their accomplishments in this country as well as their efforts in preserving their culture their attention to the memory of their matryrs. I join Armenians and  their  friends  throughout  the world who gather this week to honor the memories of  the countless men, women, and children who perished 86 years ago in the Armenian Genocide. Future generations should not be around to forget such horrible crimes, much less to deny their existence. Moreover, we can not say with any certainty that the atrocities of the American Genocide are  left  to history. We only have to recall the Holocaust, the killing fields of Cambodia, the massacres in Rwanda, and the ethnic cleansing  in Bosnian and East Timor. That is why, in addition to never forgetting the first genocide of the 20th century, we must make certain that the fate that befell the Armenian people will never again be repeated. Yet there are many governments which fail to acknowledge the existence of the Armenian Genocide which  is a great disservice  to all peoples who have suffered persecution and attempted annihilation. It is important therefore that our nation recognizes the Armenian Holocaust as an historical fact and history is preserved. Accordingly, it is fitting that we pause and join  in  this commemoration, and asking all Americans to join in it. We must understand the  lessons of  the  tragedies of  this century such as the Armenian Genocide, and most important to resolve to prevent their repetition. ‘ ’ ’ ‘ ’   ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ",2001
189,House,107,0.316,30,2001-04-24,Mr. RAMSTAD.," Mr. Speaker,  the people of Eden Prairie, Minnesota are in mourning today as they grieve the loss of a favorite son, West Point Cadet John Heinmiller. There are no words to adequately convey  our  sympathy  to  Cadet Heinmiller’s  family. Our hearts and prayers go out to John’s father John, his mother Julie, and younger brothers and sister Joe, Jimmy and Sue, on Cadet Heinmiller’s tragic death early Sunday in Garrison, New York. John’s loving family and countless friends are in shock over the passing of this remarkable young man who ‘‘left an indelible mark on friends, coaches and teachers,’’ to quote from today’s front page article in the Star Tribune. Mr. Speaker, John’s death is not only a great tragedy for his wonderful family, but also a great tragedy for Eden Prairie High School and the United States Military Academy. John was loved and respected by everyone who knew him. Of the several hundred service academy nominations that I have made over the past decade, John truly stands out for his remarkable personal qualities. John was not only a star in hockey, football and the classroom, John was a star in the way he conducted his life. As I said, when I nominated John to West Point: ‘‘John Heinmiller is destined for success at the Military Academy and beyond because he has it all: highly intelligent, a great student athlete, personally charming, a quick wit and, most importantly, integrity and character that we need in our future leaders.’’ It  is not easy  to  stand out, Mr. Speaker, the way John Heinmiller did at a high school renowned for its athletics with more than 3,000 students. An honors student, John was so highly respected for his leadership qualities that his teammates at Eden Prairie High School voted him senior captain of both his football and hockey teams. He also earned his school’s highest athletic honor the Scott Ryski Award. As his Eden Prairie High School football coach Mike Grant put  it best, ‘‘John was a good football player, but above that, he was an outstanding person. This is a devastating loss to our school, our community and our city. This is a kid who would have been leading our country someday.’’ Eden Prairie’s boys’ hockey coach, Lee Smith, also coached John and said, ‘‘He was also the kind of person that if you spent 2 minutes around, you would see dedication, love, charisma and energy. John was one of the greatest role models who has ever gone through our high school.’’ At West Point, John was a freshman hockey player and was called up to play with the varsity this past season. From all reports by West Point officials and coaches, John had already distinguished himself and was headed for great success. Above  all,  Mr.  Speaker,  John Heinmiller loved his family very dearly. His younger brothers and  sister were his best friends. As John’s dad told me yesterday, ‘‘His mother and I could not have asked for a better son in every way.’’ Mr. Speaker, my prayer today is that Cadet John Heinmiller’s legacy will inspire all of us to greater heights. We thank God for the way John lived his life and the wonderful role model he was. We are also grateful to John for his service to country at West Point. May John Heinmiller’s  spirit continue to live in each of us and may God bless his family and friends. f ARMENIAN GENOCIDE ",2001
190,House,107,-0.428,37,2001-04-24,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate  the  gentleman’s  observations, the hard work that he has done in protecting the environment, and the admonition that we need to be vigilant not just on Earth Day, but this is an ongoing effort. I must confess that I share the gentleman’s observation. My assessment is that our commitment is to protect  the environment.  I have deep concerns about some of the administration’s  policies,  as  the  gentleman mentioned.  I hope, however, that we can on this floor reach common  cause across party  lines, geographic and philosophical divides, because the American public desires that we are able to move forward and be productive in this fashion. Mr. Speaker, I came from a very environmentally aware State. I think we both share that kinship and that consensus. In our State, in Oregon, much of the environmental leadership transcended party politics. It came from an era, particularly  in the 1970s, where half the time there was a Republican governor who was working with Democrats in the legislature; and when the Democrats took control of the State house, the governorship, it continued on. Most of the major pieces of legislation that we are working on actually have bipartisan  support, and  if we could ever get them to the floor of this chamber, I think we would find that there would be strong votes, including significant Republican support. I think it is important for us to walk that line, to fight back when there are items that are at odds with what the American public wants. As the gentleman pointed out with the budget, we need to acknowledge some of the positive things that are not where that takes place, and Congress must be willing to step up and lead by example in terms of walking the walk. I had a couple of other observations that were positive  in nature that  I wanted to share, because  I thought they  were  very  significant.  Joe Albaugh, the new director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, maybe created some waves the last couple of days when there was high water around Davenport, Iowa, but I think he  raised an  important  issue about the responsibility of the Federal Government to help, but not to continue to step  in and subsidize areas where it appears as though people are not moving out of harm’s way. There are in this country over 8,000 properties that have a history of repeated loss claims  from  floods. Over the  last 8 years, we have lost over $89 billion of damage as a result of flooding. We have lost over 800 lives. And there are still a number of people who live with Federal subsidy in places where God has repeatedly shown that he does not want them to live. I appreciate that this administration is willing to raise the  issue. In the budget there are some budget savings that have been claimed as a result of modifying and reforming the Federal flood  insurance  program. The  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BEREUTER) and I have legislation that we have introduced, the ‘‘Two Floods and You’re Out of the Taxpayer Pocket,’’ which would help provide a mechanism to claim the savings that the administration is interested in; and I appreciate what the FEMA Director is doing, and I know there will be support in Congress to come forward to try and make that important reform. Mr. Speaker, it was my pleasure earlier this week to share a platform with General Robert Flowers, the head of the Corps of Engineers, who made, I thought,  an  extraordinary,  extraordinary statement. I commend people to perhaps go to the Web site, to the Corps of Engineers,  look at General Flowers’ statement. It was one that I think any Member of the House of Representatives would have been proud to make. The General committed to environmental  sustainability,  that  all Corps of Engineers work will be based on the need for people and nature to coexist  in a healthy, supportive, diverse and sustainable condition; to recognize the interdependence of activities,  that we will  recognize  interdependence with nature, we will consider  the possibility of  second- and third-order effects on his projects; that the Corps would be responsible for cumulative impacts. The Corps would accept  responsibility for the consequences of planning, design,  and  construction  decisions upon the continued viability of natural systems and human  life. The Corps would be committed to long-term public safety, creating engineered objects of long-term value; that it would support a systems approach in all aspects of design and construction. The Corps will evaluate and optimize the life cycle of products and processes so that as much as possible, we approach the natural state of systems in which there is no waste; to understand and utilize the dynamic nature of the environment. Their products will continue to rely to the fullest extent possible on renewable energy sources and recyclable products, and to seek continuous  improvements,  seeking  constant  improvements by sharing, promoting, collaborating and integrating knowledge. Mr. Speaker, I thought it was an outstanding statement by General Flowers, and I, for one, am standing willing to help him achieve  that with  the Corps of Engineers in terms of policy and budget and to make sure that Congress is supporting, rather than interfering. b2045 I wanted to acknowledge that as, I thought, one of the most  important ",2001
191,House,107,0.391,44,2001-04-24,Mr. MCINNIS.," Madam Speaker,  I have talked about the economy. I have talked about the hoof and mouth disease, and we visited a little about energy. Let me visit a little about another issue that has come up consistently throughout my district, consistently  in my travels throughout this Nation, and I think most of my colleagues have experienced it as well. I intend to follow up on my remarks tomorrow evening from the House floor here, but that is this death tax. Now some may think that I am being repetitive about this, but there are some people out there that just do not get it. There are some people out there that are being swayed by the advertising of the billionaires who, by the way, not all billionaires but a select group of billionaires who have taken out ads in the Wall Street Journal and said we do not need this. To the person, every one of those people that signed on that Wall Street Journal article or advertisement that there should be a tax on death, every one of those families has already done their trust planning, their legal planning. They have had  their attorneys  figure out how they pay the least amount, how to protect them from those taxes upon their death. b2145 In my opinion, they are acting very hypocritically. After  they have provided protection for themselves and the death tax, they turn around to us representing  the government,  they  say you should continue this tax against the rest of America. That is pretty inequitable. Madam Speaker, I think when you talk about the death or estate tax, the first step you need to take is ask what is its history. What is its justification? Should death be a taxable event? Because somebody dies, should that be a reason for the government to jump in and tax on property, by the way, which has already been taxed. This property that we are talking about in my discussions on the death tax, this is not property which has escaped taxation, this is property which has been taxed already once but in some cases, two or three times; in some cases, for multigenerations. So the first question you ask, should death be a taxable event. I venture to say that it should not be, no more than we should have a marriage penalty tax because you get married. This should be a country that encourages marriage. This should be a country that encourages one family farm, one generation to move it to the next generation, that one family business go to the next generation. That is what this country is about. This country, after all, is built on capitalism. This country is built on private property rights. This country is built on the concept that the government works for the people, the people do not work for the government. So I do not think that you can justify death as a tax. Do you know where the history of this came about? It was in the days when people wanted to move this government towards a socialisttype of domineerance, to punish the people that were successful, to go after the Carnegies  and  the Rockefellers that amassed all of this wealth, and take that money back for redistribution of wealth. The old theory that you do not allow a person to be paid based on what they are worth, they are paid on what they need. It brings to mind the Ayn Rand book, Atlas Shrugged. Read that book, colleagues, or listen to Books on Tape. Is that the direction that we want to go with this death tax. It has certainly been the direction we have gone since the death tax has been put into place. Let me say I was at a meeting the other day, and a gentleman asked, Why do you worry so much about the death tax. Those kids are taken care of anyway. They do not need all of that money. That is exactly the point. I am not talking  about  the  billionaires  that signed the ad in the New York Times, I am talking about the  family, the small contractor who owns a pickup, a backhoe, maybe a shed to do his maintenance in and if he is killed on the job, what about the  family’s opportunity the next day to continue that small business. That  is who  I care about. That is who I am talking about. And the very point is those people do need it. Those people do need that business to continue on to the next generation, and in many cases the families are dependent upon that business. I have an entire group of letters here, some of which I am going to read this evening who are impacted, not billionaires, how this has affected a lot of your neighbors, especially in an area like my district. In the Colorado mountains, our real estate values have continued to spiral at an increasing rate. So we have seen a challenge the likes we have never seen in the past on our family farms and our family ranches. This death tax is not right. I was at another meeting and I had a lady who was very justified in her thoughts and very professional in her approach. She said what right do the children have to inherit this property. I said they have every right, but now I have had second thoughts about it. Under our concept of government,  it  is not the children’s right to inherit, it is the parents’ right to  determine where  their  property, which they have accumulated by following the laws, by working hard, they have accumulated property, it is their right of private property which is a basic,  fundamental part of our Constitution, a fundamental part of the government that we enjoy is the right of private property. It is without question, in my opinion, the right of the person who owns the property to determine where property will go after their death. I do not think the government, who did not put out the risk, and the government had  something  to do with somebody obtaining property, I admit that, we have a government of laws, you do not have to worry about somebody stealing, but that is why you pay taxes. So the government has already gotten its share of taxes off the private property. I think it is the right of the owner of that property to determine to whom and in what amounts that property should pass after that person’s death. Let me tell you that the hardships, and I have experienced some of those hardships,  I have seen them  in the ",2001

OFWISCONSIN INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, April 24, 2001 ",2001
231,,107,0.646,135,2001-04-24,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  re-introducing  legislation,  the Freedom from Unfair Energy Levy Act or ‘ ‘FUEL Act,’  to alleviate the impact of current high fuel prices. My legislation would place a six-month moratorium on federal motor fuel excise taxes, including  the 18.3 cent per gallon  tax consumers pay for gasoline and the 24.3 cent per gallon tax on diesel fuel, and eliminate permanently the 4.3 cent per gallon tax increase approved in 1993. Last year, when I first introduced the FUEL Act, I warned of the threat that high energy prices posed  to our economy. As was  illustrated clearly in the 1970s and early 1990s, fuel price hikes can cause widespread damage  to economic well being. Unfortunately, high energy costs have continued  to plague the U.S. since that warning and our economy is  beginning  to  suffer  the  consequences. Some have argued that money from fuel taxes is more useful in Washington than in Americans’ pockets, helping motorists afford  the high price of gasoline. In reality, the economic damage caused by high  fuel prices  far outweighs any impact on federal spending that a six-month moratorium could cause. Congress should act now to mitigate the economic damage caused by steep energy costs. The current high gasoline prices across the country are a continuation of the energy problems that began during the Clinton administration. In recent years, domestic energy production has fallen to its lowest level since before World War II. The failure to increase domestic production has made the U.S. increasingly vulnerable to the whims of OPEC nations, who recently slashed their oil production in order to increase  their profitability. Compounding  the problem  is  the  increase  in  the gasoline  tax that was enacted  in 1993. That year, when fuel prices were low, Democrats in Congress, President Clinton, and a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Gore combined  to  increase federal  fuel  taxes. The FUEL Act would reverse  that  increase and represents a sound first step in the development of a comprehensive, long-term policy to lower energy costs. Besides addressing long-term concerns, my legislation provides  immediate assistance  to the problem of high fuel costs. By halting the collection of federal fuel taxes for six months, consumers will see an immediate dip of nearly 20 cents in the cost of gasoline at the pump. This six month moratorium will help to keep prices down over the summer months which often see steep fuel cost increases. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to fight rising energy prices. f TRIBUTE TO LT. COLONEL HUGH PENTLAND DUNN HON. LYNN C.

232,,107,-0.556,135,2001-04-24,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lt. Colonel Hugh Pentland Dunn’s 100th Birthday. Mr. Dunn was born in New York City on April 24, 1901. He is a veteran of three wars: World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. Hugh Dunn lives in Santa Rosa, CA, with his wife Patricia. He has a humor and brightness that shines with every story he tells. People who visit Hugh Dunn find him refreshing and entering  to be around. We are all enriched by his first-hand memories of the early 1900’s. At age 17, he lied about his age to join the Canadian Army’s Expeditionary Force and entered World War I. After the war, he attended college at Columbia University  in New York City and joined the ROTC as an officer. Eventually he transferred to City College because of protests at Columbia against the ROTC. Mr. Dunn served in World War II in the Korean conflict, ending his career in Germany in the Army of Occupation. Mr. Speaker,  I am honored  to  represent such a dedicated and knowledgeable veteran. Please join me in celebrating his 100th birthday. VerDate 11<MAY>2000 05:12 Apr 25, 2001 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24AP8.020 pfrm04 PsN: E24PT1 ‘ ’ ’ ’ ",2001

The blessed Felician Sisters opened  the doors to this beautiful new facility in 1956, and with  the  leadership of  its  first administrator, Sister Mary Liliose, started to minister quality and compassionate health care  to  those  in need. In the years that have followed, St. Francis Hospital has grown and matured, combining a patient-centered, healing ministry with the latest in advanced technology. Today, the facility offers an array of services, specializing  in areas such as laser/laparoscopic surgery, orthopedics,  sports medicine  and  women’s health services. In addition, this 260 bed, general acute care hospital is internationally recognized for its outstanding cardiac care programs. Now a St. Francis Hospital Center for Cancer Care  is currently being constructed  in Franklin, Wisconsin, to provide comprehensive services to cancer patients throughout southeastern Wisconsin. The facility has been designed with  input  from cancer survivors and will provide a healing environment to attend to the unique medical and spiritual needs of cancer patients and their families. A large part of what makes St. Francis Hospital such a special place is its strong commitment to building a healthier community. From its free health care screenings for seniors to its Angel of Hope Clinic located in a homeless shelter on Milwaukee’s south side, the staff of St. Francis consistently serves with great care and compassion. On behalf of all the people whose lives have been touched by the Felician Sisters and the physicians, nurses and support staff at St. Francis Hospital,  thank you  for 45 years of outstanding care to the community, and God’s blessings for many more years of exceptional service to the people of Wisconsin. f IN RECOGNITION OF JUAN NEKAI BABAUTA AND HIS WORK WITH THE CLOSE UP FOUNDATION HON.

The Local law  Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new  categories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of  any kind is unacceptable in our society.  Today, I would like to detail a heinous crime that occurred August 24,  2000 in Allentown, PA. A 24-year-old fatally shot a 15-year-old youth attending a party in his home after the teen  touched him on the arm and other partygoers suggested the teen was gay.  According to the Allentown Morning  Call, a witness said that the alleged  perpetrator,  Michael  Gambler,  retrieved  a  shotgun  and  shot Kevin  Kleppinger in the forehead. Friends say  that Kleppinger was not gay and had  been rubbing the perpetrator’s arm because he thought he had accidentally  spit on it. Other teens in the apartment began teasing the victim that he  might be gay before the perpetrator  shot him.  I believe that government’s first duty  is to defend its citizens, to defend them  against the harms that come out of  hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol  that can become substance. I believe  that by passing this legislation, we can  change hearts and minds as well.  f  ON  OF  CONGRATULATING  POLAND  THE  210TH  ANNIVERSARY  THE POLISH CONSTITUTION  ",2001

239,,107,0.096,246,2001-05-03,Mr. HALL of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation that will help to improve K– 12 science and mathematics education  in the nation’s schools. The Science Education for the 21st Century Act authorizes a range of activities  to  increase  the numbers and enhance  the capabilities of science and math teachers, to advance knowledge on the most effective uses of educational technologies, to increase participation  in science and  technology careers by women and minorities, and to provide more effective coordination of public and private sector efforts to improve science and math education. JOHN Rep. EDDIEBERNICE I want particularly to acknowledge the assistance and contributions of several of my Science Committee colleagues in the development of this legislation. The bill incorporates JOHNSON ’s provision  to establish school/business partnerships to improve science and math education and to support students  in pursuing undergraduate degrees in science and engineering; Rep. LYNN WOOLSEY’s Go Girl Grants to encourage girls and young women to study math, science and engineering; Rep. JIMBARCIA ’s provision  to establish an educational technology extension service to support K– 12 schools; Rep. MARK UDALL’s scholarships  for science, math and engineering students willing  to become certified and to serve as science teachers; Rep. LARSON ’s provisions on assessing  the means for deployment of broadband networks for schools and libraries and on demonstrating educational applications  for such networks; and Reps. BOBETHERIDGE’s and JOEBACA’s provisions on  improving  the preparation and in-service professional development of science and math teachers. The  importance of providing all students with a sound grounding in science, math and technology education  is evident. Looking at the overall economy, worker skill  level correlates directly with productivity growth. More than one quarter of the growth in labor productivity during the boom years of the 1990s is attributed to increases in worker skills, as measured by education and work experience. The Department of Labor estimates that a 1% increase in worker skill level has the same effect on output and productivity growth as a 1% increase in hours worked. Moreover, national economic, policy and cultural matters are increasingly influenced by science  and  technology. Having  a  basic grounding in science and technology is necessary for individuals to make informed judgments about public policy issues and to lead fulfilling lives. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have problems both  in  the quality of K– 12 science and math education and in attracting students  to careers  in science, engineering and technology. The National Assessment of Educational Progress, the national report card, reveals that fewer  than one  third of 4th, 8th and 12th grade students attain proficiency  in science and math. International comparisons of math and science skills show  the performance of U.S.  students declining with  years  in  the school system, and falling below that of students from most of our economic competitors. Poor preparation in elementary and secondary schools is reflected in the findings that over 40% of freshmen at public 2-year colleges are enrolled din remedial classes. Even at private 4-year colleges, 13% of students are enrolled in such classes. Moreover, approximately 35% of companies provide remedial math education for their employees. Although college attendance  is  increasing, relatively fewer students than in the past are pursuing undergraduate degrees  in science, math and engineering. From peak levels in the mid-1980s, engineering majors have declined by 30%, and math majors by 45%, relative to other fields of study. One reason that the pool of scientists and engineers  is growing more slowly  is simply that the group traditionally most likely to enter these field, white males, is declining as a percentage of new workers. At present, white males constitute a little over 40% of the workforce and nearly 70% of scientists and engineers.  In contrast, white  females are about 35% of  the workforce and only 15% of scientists and engineers. The corresponding figures for African Americans and Hispanics are each about 10% of the workforce and 2% of scientists and engineers. Clearly, we must do a better job of attracting women and minorities  to science and preparing them to pursue postsecondary studies in science, math and engineering. The Department of Labor projects that new jobs requiring science, engineering and technical  training will  increase by 51% between 1998 and 2008— roughly  four  times higher than  average  job  growth  nationally.  The changing economy will not only require more scientists and engineers, but will require most workers to have increased skills. Sixty percent of all new  jobs will  require at  least a high school education, and only 12% of new jobs will be filled by those with less than a high school education, and  the number of such jobs will continue to decline. These trends suggest the need to improve K– 12 science and math education, both  to prepare more students to pursue science and engineering studies in college and to raise the skill levels for all students, who will find themselves in an increasingly technological workplace. The Science Education for the 21st Century Act will establish a range of education programs, primarily at the National Science Foundation, to address key factors that affect the quality of science and math education, as well as the associated problem of attracting individuals  to careers  in science, engineering and technology. First,  the bill establishes programs  to  improve  the  training and professional development of science and math teachers, including incentives  for science and engineering students to become science and math teachers. Clearly, an essential  first step  in  improving science and math education in the schools is having teachers with both a sound knowledge of their subject and effective teaching skills. Next, the bill will institute programs to explore ways to use information technologies effectively  in  the classroom. Computers and communications networks have revolutionized the workplace, but have yet to reach their potential  for educational applications. The emphasis will be on quantifying  the  techniques and approaches for employing technology that will lead to improved student performance, so that schools will know which approaches actually work and are worth the substantial investments needed to implement them. In addition, the bill authorizes programs to encourage the interest of women and minorities in science and math, and to help prepare them  academically  to  pursue  careers  in science, math and engineering. The changing composition of the nation’s workforce makes it essential that the talents of all segments of society are fully developed and utilized. And, finally, the bill establishes mechanisms to improve the coordination among the federal agencies that support K– 12 science and math education  activities. The  federal  resources available for this purpose are limited. Therefore,  it  is  imperative  that  the  resources be used  for maximum benefit  in helping  the states and  local school system  that are engaged  in  reform of science and math education.

240,,107,-0.491,253,2001-05-03,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay my final respects to Robert E. Burton. Bob’s family and friends will gather on Friday to remember him, and it is with great sadness and deep respect  that  I share with my colleagues  the following words from his obituary in the San Francisco Chronicle: Robert E. Burton, a prison teacher, public servant, sailor and middle brother in San Francisco’s most powerful political dynasty, died Sunday at California Pacific Medical Center at the age of 72. From the time Mr. Burton entered the Navy at the close of World War II, he almost never stopped working for the public. He was a merchant seaman, a teacher at San Quentin prison for nearly two decades and a member of various state boards and commissions. But among the three Burton brothers who shaped California politics  for several decades, he was the least publicly visible and the least involved in the machinery of politics. Mr. Burton’s older brother, Phillip Burton, was a powerful U.S. representative and legendary political tactician who died in 1983. His younger brother—whom Mr. Burton still called ‘‘the kid’’ even into his 60s—is Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, the state’s most powerful  lawmaker. ‘‘Everyone used to say he was the nice brother,’’ Sen. Burton said yesterday. ‘‘And I think innately he was the smartest of the three of us.’’ Mr. Burton was born in 1928 and lived much of his life in the same Sloat Boulevard house in which he was raised. But friends said his greatest memory was somewhere else: a sailing trip across the Pacific in a 30-foot boat, which he took with three friends after he left the Navy in 1947. ‘‘He was fearless,’’ Sen Burton said.  was a hell of an adventure.’’ When he returned from Tahiti, Mr. Burton joined the merchant marine as an able-bodied seaman, then got a degree in history from San Francisco State College when he decided to settle back in the city. Mr. Burton then took a job teaching in the loneliest, most  dangerous  place  in  the state—the bowels of San Quentin State Prison. It was there that he often divided his time between African American militants and white supremacists, teaching them how to read and write. ‘‘He would tell people stories and start with, ‘When I was in the joint,’ like he had ‘‘It done 20 years of hard time,’’ Sen. Burton said.  ‘‘I guess at the time there weren’t many jobs, so he took it. He just loved it, and the cons loved him.’’ When Mr. Burton retired from the prison in 1976, members from both militant groups told him there was a ‘‘hit’’ out on him. But this was a good thing, he was informed: Anyone  threatening  or harming Mr. Burton would face their wrath. He was protected. ‘‘He connected with the guys, and they connected with him,’’ said Bill O’Brien of San Francisco, a longtime friend. ‘‘It was a passion for him. He wanted them to learn; It really wasn’t about having a job.’’ Mr. Burton was a lifelong Democrat and founding member  of  the San Francisco Democratic League. He was co-chairman of the voter registration efforts for the California Democratic Party from 1962 to 1982. At the time of his death, Mr. Burton was a commissioner on the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board and a member of the City College of San Francisco Board of Trustees. He also had served for 15 years on the prison Industry Board and on two parole boards for the state. Former Gov. Jerry Brown appointed him to the adult parole board in 1976, after two commissioners were removed for voting to release Robert Kennedy’s killer, Sirhan Sirhan. Friends said Mr. Burton  loved the San Francisco Giants,  gambling  and  playing bridge. Ken Harrington of San Francisco, a longtime friend, said he ‘‘didn’t know a single person when you mentioned Bob Burton who didn’t get a smile on their face.’’ ‘‘He was, at least, the most outwardly compassionate  of  the  three  brothers,’’ Harrington said. ‘‘John doesn’t want anyone to know his soft spots, but Bob kind of wore it on his sleeve.’’ Mr. Burton is survived by his brother, Sen. John Burton, and a niece, San Francisco Public Defender Kimiko Burton-Cruz. His wife of more than four decades, Shirley Burton, preceded him in death. Bob Burton was a man of the people. He never asked for recognition or reward for his work and was rarely in the public eye, but his life touched the lives of so many others. Bob joined his brothers Phillip and John in typifying the  true Burton  tradition of helping  the disadvantaged. It is my honor to pay tribute to Bob and to express my appreciation for his life of service and for his friendship. My thoughts and prayers are with his brother, John, and niece, Kimi. f TRIBUTE TO MARY HOLDSAMBECK OF HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA HON. ROBERT E. (BUD) CRAMER, JR.

She has been a vital leader in the Madison County Democratic Women since she moved to Huntsville. She has served  two  terms as Chairman of the group and has been involved in state politics as a member of the State Coalition for passing the Equal Rights Amendment and in the current Alabama Constitutional Reform Movement. She has even been a candidate, running  in a special election  for  the State of Alabama House of Representatives. However, Mary’s commitment  to her community is not limited to the political arena. She played a pivotal role  in helping  to organize Hope Place, now Crisis Services,  serving abused women and  families. She has also contributed her  time and manifold  talents  to Trinity United Methodist Church,  the Wesley Foundation and the American Association of University Women. I believe this is a fitting honor for one who has given so much to the betterment of our community and our nation. I commend Mary for her lifetime of achievement and I want to express my sincere gratitude for her bold work for  the Democratic Party and  the patriotic ideals she believes in. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON.

242,House,107,0.274,6,2001-05-16,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Chairman,  I reluctantly rise today to urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Recent research  shows  that voluntary  family planning reduces abortion. Two separate studies, one by the RAND Corporation in Bangladesh and one by Princeton demographers in Kazakhstan, show the same conclusion: Abortion rates fall when contraception is prevalent. Mr. Chairman, across the former Soviet Union, abortion was the principal method of birth control under Communism. Princeton University studied Kazakhstan through the 1990s, looking at the effect of increased access to voluntary  family planning. The results are clear. Contraceptive prevalence increased by 50 percent since the beginning of the 1990s, while abortion decreased by the same amount. ‘‘The proposition that the occurrence of abortions can be  reduced by  increases in the use of contraception has been demonstrated again in the analysis of data from the 1999 Kazakhstan Demographic and Health Survey,’’ said Charlie Westoff, Princeton University’s demographer. b1100 This  amendment will  not  reduce abortion but the real way to reduce abortion is to increase voluntary family planning. ",2001
243,House,107,0.547,6,2001-05-16,Mr. RYUN of Kansas.," Mr. Chairman, today as we consider a bill to authorize funding for foreign relations, I find it puzzling that some of my colleagues would wish to include language to repeal President Bush’s Mexico City policy. The issue of abortion as a method of family planning is one of the most divisive and controversial that we face as a Nation. Why should we be thrust into that debate in other countries? President Bush was right to remove the United States  from  promoting abortions in developing nations. After all, abortion is legal only in a fraction of these countries. Those who want American taxpayers to fund abortions overseas should consider the destructive  impression that  it gives others about the United States. As a Nation, the image we promote to the rest of the world should be one of life, health, and hope. The Mexico City policy allows the U.S. to support overseas family planning programs without tying those dollars to abortion. I urge my colleagues to  support President Bush’s Mexico City policy. ",2001
244,House,107,-0.386,6,2001-05-16,Mrs. MALONEY of New York.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition. First and foremost this is not about abortion. It is about women dying to the tune of 600,000 a year. That is equal to one or two jumbo jets crashing each day. And it is about saving women’s lives. Since 1973, no U.S. Federal funds have been or are used  for abortions around the world. During the time that we are debating this amendment, 65 women will die from pregnancy-related complications. The global gag rule restricts foreign NGOs from using their own funds. In America, this language would be unconstitutional.  It  is  unconscionable that we would impose it on the world’s poorest women. The global gag rule is enough to make you gag. The rule puts the U.S.  in the position of deciding what speech  is acceptable and what speech is unacceptable. Current Mexico City policy  is not abortion neutral. Organizations receiving U.S. funds can use their own money to lobby against abortion but cannot use their own money to lobby to make abortion legal. Vote no on this amendment. Mr. Chairman, as a supporter of family planning, I rise in strong opposition to the HydeSmith amendment which reinstates  the antiwoman antidemocratic Global Gag Rule. First and foremost, this is not about abortion. It’s about women dying, to the tune of 600,000 a year. That is equal to one or two jumbo jets crashing every single day. And, it’s about saving women’s lives. Since 1973, no U.S. Federal  funds have been or are used around the world for abortions. During the time we are debating the gag rule, 65 women will die  from pregnancy related complications because they don’t have access to the most basic health care. The Global Gag Rule  restricts  foreign NGO’s from using their own funds. In America, this  language  is unconstitutional.  It’s unconscionable  that we would  impose  it on  the world’s  poorest women. The  gag  rule  is enough to make you gag. It cripples foreign NGO’s ability  to practice democracy  in  their own countries. We can’t afford to stifle the international debate on family planning by tying the hands of NGO’s with an antiwoman gag rule. The gag rule forces NGO’s to choose between their democratic rights to organize and determine what is best in their own countries and desperately needed  resources of U.S. family planning dollars. We know that family planning reduces the need  for abortions. We know  that  it saves lives. The gag rule reduces the effectiveness of family planning organizations and should be eliminated. I urge my colleagues to support the Lee language and oppose  the Hyde-Smith amendment. ",2001
245,House,107,0.16,13,2001-05-16,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr. Chairman, I just want to make a couple of points in rebuttal to those comments made by my friends on the other side of this issue. A couple of their speakers have said that somehow the fungibility argument is analogous, to what we were doing with  the  faith-based  initiative  proposed by President Bush. I would suggest that  in the  faithbased initiative, there is a benign outcome, a benign consequence. If, as a matter of fact, because we give money to a religious organization, which inturn frees up money, for example, for them to proselytize their religion, I think most of us would agree that is not a bad thing. That is why we give tax breaks to religious organizations, regardless of denomination or belief, because we do believe that religious beliefs are a positive good for society. That is not the case when we are talking about money and  fungibility with regard to  family planning and abortion. If the organization, a proabortion organization,  is performing and killing and decimating, destroying, chemically  poisoning  and  dismembering unborn children, because U.S. funding allows them to use their own money for abortion, that is not a benign consequence, that is a horrific consequence. If our U.S.  funding  for  family planning  is used to free up other money for abortion, we have a responsibility to step in and protect the child and only fund those groups that just do family planning. I  believe  as  reasonable men  and women we can make choices and say, we do not want that consequence. So here  in the Mexico City policy, the fungibility argument has real teeth, it has real grip. It ensures that we do not subsidize groups that engage in abortion, the killing of unborn children. Let me also point out to my colleagues again that when the Mexico City policy was  in effect,  350 nongovernmental organizations accepted the pro-life Mexico City provisions, including  57  affiliates  of  the  International Planned Parenthood Federation based in London. That is 57 mostly in-country affiliates who said, we will divest ourselves of killing. Abortion is killing. Family planning is not. SON). ",2001
246,House,107,-0.045,20,2001-05-16,Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding me this time. If you stay here for a little while, you will see almost anything. I remember about 10 years ago the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. NUSSLE) came down to the House floor, placed a brown paper bag over his head and said he was doing that because he was embarrassed to be associated with a Congress that had its own bank, that was giving Members free overdraft protection, that they in effect could write checks  for money that was not  there. The gentleman from Iowa, if the truth be known, did a good thing in bringing the public’s attention to that. The bank is gone. We all bank at the same credit union that every other Federal employee on Capitol Hill does now. But what  troubles me  about  the present budget chairman and what is going on on the House floor today is if we should have been embarrassed for Congressmen writing checks on money that was not there, should we not be ashamed that we are passing tax cuts on a day when we owe the Social Security  system  $1.1  trillion? We have taken their money, we have spent it on other things and now when we have a small surplus, instead of putting that money aside for Social Security, we are giving some Americans a tax break. It goes beyond that. For years we have been taking money out of the defense budget. Since the 1980s, we have pulled $162 billion out of the Department of Defense budget with the promise that we were setting it aside to pay future  military  retirees’  benefits. Every penny of that has been spent. Again, if we were ashamed that some Congressmen were writing checks for $500, $200 over their amount, should we not be embarrassed to look a veteran in the eye and say we have spent your retirement and we are not putting any money in to pay it back? Since the 1980s, we have taken money out of all of our civil servants’ paychecks, again with the promise that it would be there for their retirement. To date we owe them $501 billion. Now, a billion is a thousand million. A million is a thousand thousand. Now, for folks who want to, you can visualize probably a thousand dollars. So $501 billion is a thousand, thousand, thousand. Money has been taken out of their paychecks with the promise that we would spend it only on their retirement, but it has been spent on other things. This budget does nothing to pay it back. Lastly, the Medicare trust fund. Everybody up here, everyone in the gallery, everyone in this room who has a job, money is taken out of your paycheck with the promise it is going to go to your Medicare retirement. To date, we owe that system $229 billion. There  is nothing  in  that  so-called lockbox but an IOU. But instead of taking the small surplus we have and applying it to pay off our military retirees, our Social Security recipients, our civil servants, and the folks on Medicare, we are going to pass tax breaks to give some Americans, and incidentally the wealthiest Americans, a tax break while we continue to overcharge people on their Social Security, on their Medicare, on their military retirement, and the civil service retirement. I hope at some point today someone will tell me why that is fair because I think you are going to have a heck of a hard time explaining that to the American people.

249,House,107,0.518,27,2001-05-16,Mr. BRADY of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I think too many people in Washington are out of touch with the real world and the way families have to struggle these days. It is true that tax relief under this plan starts pretty modestly and grows. It is done so that it increases as we pay off more of our national debt; and as our  surplus  increases, the tax relief increases. That is the responsible way to do it. But they will tell us it is only for the wealthy. But  if we  look at  families today, we just had tax freedom day, which meant, from January 1 to May 3, the average American family worked for that time period just to pay their taxes. Starting last week, we started to work for ourselves. No wonder it is so hard for families to make ends meet. Under the President’s proposal and under  the Republican proposal here today, in this first year, for a teacher whose husband works at the auto dealership as a mechanic, who has two kids, it means tax relief for about $500 this first year; and it increases each year to about $1,600. Now, in Washington, people do not think that counts. But I can tell my colleagues, when one is raising children, an extra $120 or $140 a month for school clothes or to fix the car or to pay for utilities or all the things that come up  for health care when your child is sick, that is real money. My colleagues will hear today about a rebate scheme. But let me tell them, they will love the rebate scheme as long as they do not mind overpaying at the cashier, at the counter, and watching the clerk hand the change to the next guy in line. They will love rebates. But  if my colleagues think  if one overpays  that  the change ought  to come back to one in proportion of what one overpaid, then my colleagues are going to support the President’s plan and the principles in the Republican plan. What is wrong with eliminating the marriage penalty? What is wrong with not taxing people at death? What is wrong with encouraging  small businesses to create new jobs? We know if we head into recession, we will lose 3 million jobs in America. That is 3 million families that are going to hurt very badly. If we can make changes today, maybe we cannot save all those jobs, but we can save some of them, and we ought to try. ",2001

This is a serious debate. That is why today I seriously oppose the majority’s tax reconciliation bill before us and strongly support the Democratic substitute which I feel is much more fiscally responsible, long-term in outlook at better enables us to pay down our national debt. Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of problems with this tax reconciliation bill, not least of which that this is the single most important act we can do if we are interested in setting up for failure future generations of  leadership and our children and grandchildren. The great unspoken truth in this debate is all the focus has been on the ",2001
251,House,107,0.384,34,2001-05-16,Ms. DUNN.," Mr. Speaker, one of the previous speakers asked the question, how can we afford the tax cut? Well, I say if we cannot afford the tax cut at this time of surplus, when can we ever afford a tax cut? It is the taxpayers who created this surplus for us and it is they whom we should be rewarding by turning back some of those dollars for them to spend. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the reconciliation measure and in opposition to the substitute motion. President Bush has very wisely made rate reduction the foundation of his tax relief proposal. He wants to help all income tax payers, especially low- and moderate-income tax payers as quickly as possible and this bill embodies his commitment to give Americans broadbased tax relief. The bill is fair, it is fiscally responsible, and it is good for the economy. Rate reduction is fair. Everybody who pays income taxes will receive tax relief under this proposal. It targets no one in and no one out. In addition, it provides retroactive tax relief for people in the lowest brackets by reducing the 15 percent rate to 12 percent effective at the beginning of this year. This tax relief bill takes 6 million people off the tax rolls, and it enables a woman on her own with two children to earn up to $31,000 in a year without having to pay income taxes. Rate reduction is fiscally responsible. The tax cut is phased in over 10 years, and it represents a very small fraction of the estimated $20 trillion the government is expected to take in over the next decade. And rate reduction will help American families. Once the cuts are fully implemented, an average family of four with $55,000 in income will see $2,000 a year  in tax reduction. $2,000  is the same as 10 weeks of groceries, a semester of tuition at a community college, or 2 months’ worth of mortgage payments. These are  real dollars  that should go where the taxpayer chooses to send them. I urge my colleagues to support the reconciliation bill and reject the substitute. ",2001

253,House,107,0.54,34,2001-05-16,Mr. KINGSTON.," Mr.  Speaker,  I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for yielding me this time, and I thank my friend from Florida for bringing up the 1980s. A key element which Paul Harvey may refer to as the rest of the story, who was the majority in Congress in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984 but liberal, big-spending Democrats? And what do they do when they get your money? They spend it. Why are they opposed to a tax reduction? Because they believe in their heart of hearts, and this is the crux of the whole matter, the big philosophical, empirical difference between the parties is that in their heart of hearts  they believe  they can  spend your money better than you can. They believe the American people are  incapable of  spending decisions which might benefit society by creating jobs and creating more tax revenues. I was speaking at a high school recently and I asked a young lady on the front row of a class how many of you have a job. She had a job. She made $7 an hour. I said, ‘‘So if you work for 2 hours, you make $14.’’ She said, ‘‘No, sir, I only get to bring home about $11 because of the taxes.’’ I said, ‘‘I knew that. But let us say you do not really object to paying $3 in taxes or $4 in taxes out of your 2 hours that you work, you pay $4 in taxes and that $4 goes to roads, bridges, education, military, Medicare  and you don’t have a problem with that, right?’’ She said, ‘‘No, sir I don’t mind that.’’ I said, ‘‘What if you knew that instead of $4, that we could run the government on $3.50 out of your earnings, what would you want with the rest of the money, that extra 50 cents? Would you want to keep it or would you want it to go to Washington so you could feel even more patriotic?’’ She said, ‘‘That’s my 50 cents. I want to keep it.’’ That is all that this is about, is saying to the American people, we could run the government on less money. The only question is, who wants the return? Do you want to send it to the government or do you want to keep it yourself? And when you go out as an American taxpayer and you buy washing machines or tires for your cars or clothes or whatever, you create jobs, you stimulate the economy, the economy grows, and it is good for America. Let the American people spend their own money. Support tax relief. ",2001

Republicans in the last days are so committed to this massive tax cut for the wealthiest special interests that they are even suggesting that cutting taxes is a substitute for a real energy policy in our country. This is a full-service operation. To sell a tax plan, they are willing to use any argument that is available to try to convince the country that the tax plan is the right thing to do. First, it was the economy that was in trouble. That is why we needed the tax plan. Now  it  is  the energy problem  that causes the need for the tax plan. I fully expect it is going to be suggested as the cure for the common cold. b1515 We should be voting today, rather than on this plan, for immediate relief ",2001

256,House,107,-0.262,62,2001-05-16,Ms. HARMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Lee Amendment, a provision in this bill included by my friend and colleague from California, BARBARALEE. I would like to begin by reminding my colleagues that since 1973, no U.S. dollars have been used to pay for the performance of an abortion as a method of family planning or for involuntary sterilizations overseas— None! The Lee provision does not alter that restriction, but  instead  restores U.S. support  for international family planning organizations. In my view the best way to reduce the number of abortions worldwide, a goal we all share, is to ensure access to family planning. Yet, supporters of  the so-called Mexico City policy claim that we must limit all funds to prevent United States dollars from being used in clinics that only inform their patients on the option of  abortion— including  clinics  in  countries where abortion is legal. Turning this into a vote about abortion does a disservice to the millions of women throughout the world who do not have access to the health care and  reproductive services, education and treatment that women in this country take for granted. Mr. Chairman, I support a woman’s right to choose whether or not to have a child. I also recognize that for some women, that choice is about whether or not to give birth to a healthy child. More than 600,000 infants become infected with HIV each year worldwide. That is appalling. How can we possibly claim  to be working to prevent the spread of HIV if we do not offer counsel and education in family planning? It seems to me that it is an oxymoron to be both anti-abortion and anti-family planning. Only through family planning efforts can we  reduce  the number of unwanted pregnancies— a result always preferable  to abortion. The Lee provision will prevent international family planning groups from being denied lifesaving funds to carry out their work— both in preventing unintended pregnancies and  the spread of the deadly HIV/AIDS disease. We have the chance to really make a difference for millions of women worldwide. Let’s give women the opportunity to make informed and educated decisions about their reproductive health. Vote for to keep the Lee provision. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, as we consider the authorization bills for our foreign policy agenda, it is necessary to recognize the continuing human rights abuses practiced by governments in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Ethiopia. The U.S. Department of State must carefully  investigate  the continuing human rights abuses in Ethiopia. Just recently, I am outraged by the recent violence in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, especially the loss of life in the face of peaceful demonstrations on  the campus at Addis Ababa University on April 11th. I am deeply disturbed that police forces used excessive force to prevent students from vocalizing their discontent in an academic setting. I understand that as many as 41 brave individuals were killed on or near the campus at Addis Ababa University, while another 250 persons were injured in an indiscriminate attack by the police forces. The recent action taken by police forces can never be justified. Although I have strongly spoken out against human  rights abuses  in Ethiopia before,  I wholeheartedly  join  the Ethiopian community in the United States in denouncing the indiscriminate killings that recently occurred in Ethiopia. Justice must be served swiftly and fairly even though the brutal attack has already exacted an unimaginable  toll. Further,  I am somewhat  relieved  that approximately 2,000 students who were detained by police have now been released. That is not enough, however. As some of you may know, the U.S. Department of State is concerned that dozens of persons who were arrested without warrant remain detained. The United States Government must vigorously call upon the government of Ethiopia  to promptly and unconditionally  release all the students that remain in detention. Their freedom cannot be denied. In the past, I successfully fought for a legislative measure that would prohibit the government  of Ethiopia  from  receiving  aid  until human rights abuses are eliminated. We must do more. The people of Ethiopia deserve to be treated humanely by their government. Mr. Chairman, in the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, ‘ ‘We believe that the only whole man is a free man.’  I hope we can support efforts to bring human rights abuses by government actors in Ethiopia to a halt. ",2001
257,House,107,-0.513,62,2001-05-16,Mrs. MINK of Hawaii.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today  to  thank  the Members of  the House Committee on  International Relations  for  including $13.5 million for the East-West Center in the FY2002 State Department Authorization bill. An amendment to delete this funding was overwhelming defeated  in Committee on a vote of 6 yeas to 30 noes. The last time we considered the State Department Authorization bill  in July 1999, we had to defeat an amendment on the floor to reduce the funding authorization for the EastWest Center, North-South Center, and  the Asia Foundation. That amendment was defeated on a vote of 180 yeas to 237 noes. I am very pleased that we face no such amendment this year. The East-West Center is an internationally respected research and educational institution based  in Hawaii with a 40-year  record of achievement. It is an important forum for the development of policies  to promote stability and economic and social development in the Asia-Pacific  region.  Established  in  1960 through a bipartisan effort of the Eisenhower Administration and the Congress, the Center has worked  to promote better relations and understanding between the United States and the nations and peoples of Asia and the Pacific  through cooperative study,  training, and research. Presidents, prime ministers, ambassadors,  scholars, business executives, and journalists from all over the Asia-Pacific region have used the Center as a forum to advance international cooperation. The Asia-Pacific region accounts  for more than half the world’s population, about a third of the world’s economy, and vast marine and land resources. The United States has vital national interests in connecting itself in partnership with the region. As the Asia-Pacific region continues to develop and change, it is essential that the United States be seen as a part of the region rather than an outsider. The most powerful force of U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region has been our  ideas, and the East-West Center is the only program that has a strategic mission of developing a consensus on key policy issues in U.S.-Asia-Pacific relations through intensive cooperative research and training. I want to thank my colleagues for supporting the mission of the Center with this authorization and  I ask  that  the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee fully fund this important national program.

258,House,107,-0.172,69,2001-05-16,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, has anyone seen the defense supplemental appropriation? I seem to recall that during the recent Presidential election, much was made of the needs of our men and women  in uniform.  ‘‘Help,’’ we were told, ‘‘is on the way.’’ Now we know of helicopters that cannot fly, roofs on family housing leaking, training missions being canceled or deferred, and even major procurements being modified, all because the supplemental that was promised, the supplemental that was planned for, has not arrived. I know that Secretary Rumsfeld is in the middle of a wide-ranging strategy review and I know that he has put most of the Department of Defense on hold while the review runs its course. I will have more to say about that soon in another venue. But  a  supplemental  appropriation has nothing  to do with our  future strategy. The  shape  of  tomorrow’s force  is not  the  issue. The  supplemental is supposed to pay for what our military has already done. So surely, Mr. Speaker, there must be a supplemental around here somewhere, and I would appreciate hearing from any other Member who happens to stumble over it. I have risen on this floor several times in the Congress to point out the need for such a supplemental. Even the commitment to having one would be enough to let commanders carry on, secure in the knowledge that their costs would be reimbursed later. But even that simple assurance has not been forthcoming. And our military services are paying the price today. Readiness  is  lower, aircraft are being scavenged for parts, and all because we cannot find that darn supplemental. Mr. Speaker, if you see it, would you please let me know? ",2001
259,House,107,0.418,76,2001-05-16,Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky.," Speaking of the Kyoto treaty, I was in China a few years ago. I was in Sian, China. The smog, coal, smoke in that city was so bad that the people, the citizens of that city, had to wear like surgical masks. We could not see for the pollution. In the Kyoto  treaty,  it  is my understanding that they were exempt from the environmental restraints that we would  have  been  placing  ourselves under. That did not make a lot of sense to me. We have done a good job in this country with  technology, we have done some good things with our environment, and new technology and reasonable regulations can make  increased consumption of our energy  supplies possible and continue to decrease pollution. But there has to be, again, some common sense built into it. In Kentucky, I can use Kentucky as a good example, through clean coal technology, we use a lot of coal in our utilities, and we have the lowest or I think probably the second- or third-lowest rates for our electric utility bills of any State in the Nation. But through coal  technology, we have  really  reduced emissions, and in fact, it is almost as clean now as the natural gas being used in other utility companies. So with clean coal technologies, we have been able to increase coal by 195 percent over the last 30 years, while cutting coal air emissions by one-third. So we have a 300-year supply of coal, and we have done the right things in being able to use that energy source, but no one wants to reward that. They want to take it even to a greater extreme and say, basically, no coal, no oil; we are going to have to move on to some alternative energy sources that will not meet the demand that we have today. Again, it comes back to getting rid of the extremism and getting into a scientific-based commonsense approach to how we are going to deal with our energy supply in this country. b2000 We are blessed and we need to use those blessings to benefit our population here in this country. I think it is certainly time that we start looking at the handwriting on the wall and today start turning the situation around. I think you can compare the situation in Kentucky and California. We have new power plants coming online. We have the energy. We have low-cost energy, so we could do that across this country, but we have to start. Mr. Speaker, 1,300 or 1,900 new power plants over the next 20 years to just get us to the supply we are going to need in order to provide the electricity for this country, if anything, stands in our way and that does not make sense. We are hurting our economy, and we are ",2001
260,Senate,107,0.239,167,2001-05-16,Mr. VOINOVICH.," Mr. President,  I rise today to make it very clear to my colleagues that I do not oppose constructing new schools. In fact, I firmly believe that more schools should be built, replaced, repaired, and renovated in the United States of America. I suspect there are few people in this country who have done as much as I have to make that happen. Earlier this month, I was in Cleveland, OH, to campaign for a $380 million local school construction bond and levy initiative. That money would be used to leverage $500 million from the State of Ohio. Last week, the voters of Cleveland passed that bond and levy by a margin of 3 to 2. They voted to tax themselves in order to help build, replace, and repair over 100 schools throughout the Cleveland School District. The citizens of Cleveland know that school construction is a State and local responsibility. But I am concerned about the Federal Government  telling State  and local officials they have to spend Federal resources on school construction instead of spending it on education priorities they have determined. Localities should have the freedom to invest their dollars  in  the greatest needs, whether it is teachers, computers, or textbooks, and not be locked in. We also need to consider the fairness factor. Many of our States have committed themselves in a very major way to school construction programs. I am concerned that as the Federal Government becomes more involved in school construction,  the  less  inclined  the States will be to invest their own funds in school construction. There will be an incredible temptation for States to simply sit back and  let the Federal Government take care of things. That is something we see too much of in this body. All we would be doing in passing the Harkin amendment or any amendment is giving those States that refuse to step up to the plate and provide for their schoolchildren, a free pass from meeting their obligations. In my State, we have stepped up to the plate. Under Ohio’s Classroom Facilities Assistance Program we have appropriated more than $2.7 billion to repair and rebuild our schools. By the end of this month, 23 schools will have been built or renovated by our program, and by the end of the year, 50 schools will be completed by the program. For  example,  in Canton, OH,  the State is paying $129 million out of a $176 million  schools project.  In  the Springfield City schools, the State is paying $135 million out of a $165 million project. In Youngstown, the State is picking up $130 million out of $163 million. In other words, the lower the wealth in the district, the less they have to pay for rebuilding their schools. We are going to get the job done in Ohio. In fact, a GAO report pointed out that in terms of investing in school construction, our State ranks ninth in the Nation in percentage terms and the eighth greatest in dollar amount. I think it is important for my colleagues to understand that last year, the National Governors’ Association Center for Best Practices looked into the prevalence of State involvement in school construction. Here is what they had to report: The Center discovered Governors are focusing more attention on school construction and modernization than ever before. The report goes on to cite several examples: 11 States subsidize, reimburse, or match local funding for construction projects; 10 States have an established formula for determining the amount of State funding each school district will receive; six States have established a new agency to oversee school construction with the State; five States provide low-interest  loans  for  low-income school districts to help support their school construction efforts; and  four States require the Governor and State legislature to approve school construction projects prior to State  funding being made available. The States are getting it done, which prompts me to ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, why should the taxpayers of Wyoming, Florida, or New Hampshire have to pay to build schools in Ohio? And, conversely, why should the taxpayers of Ohio, who are meeting their responsibility, pay  for those who have not yet done so? What kind of a message are we sending to these people? They have done the right thing, but we are saying: Tough luck, we are going to take your tax money, the tax money we should spend on true Federal responsibilities, and totally ignore them so we can do something that is politically popular. That  is  just wrong. Mark my words, once the Federal Government gets involved in providing direct grants to build schools, there will be pressure like you would not believe to ramp-up the funding. We just heard from the Senator from New York saying they have already committed schools for the money that has been made available to New York State. I tell you this, they are lining up in New York and every other place. They are letting their Governors and their legislatures and their local officials off the hook.

Today’s children need a balance of guidance and knowledge, and I am glad to see that Chicago’s Public schools and its students are being fortified by teachers like Dr. Hamberlin. Dr. Hamberlin has been  teaching biology and Horticulture Environmental Sciences  for the past 36 years in Chicago public schools. His honors and awards  include City of Chicago Teacher of  the Year,  the Kohl Family Foundation International Educator, Who’s Who Among Black Americans, and  the Golden Apple Foundation Academy Fellowship, and he has been recognized as one of Newsweek Magazine’s America’s 100 Heroes. Dr. Hamberlin has applied a practical application of his science curriculum that includes educating his pupils  in small business and small business enterprises. Through the Ornamental Horticulture Program, he and his students developed a  landscaping club where student were paid for producing public and private landscapes throughout the city. He and his students have also developed an award winning Urban Ecology Sanctuary where  they studied, maintained and housed various  animals,  numerous  plant  life,  and unique ecosystems all within an enclosed courtyard on  their high school campus. Dr. Hamberlin has shown that classrooms can be stimulating experiences  for all  types of students, and  they can have  first hand experience at life’s lessons. Dr. Hamberlin has demonstrated what a great impact a teacher can have on our children, and we are glad to have him teaching the children of Chicago. Dr. Hamberlin, thank you for your years of dedication to the most noble of services, and may you continue to influence and inspire students for many years to come. f TRIBUTE TO DONALD J. SIEGEL HON.

262,,107,-0.579,202,2001-05-16,Mr. CAPUANO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Donald J. Siegel. On May 16, the Israel Bond National Labor Division will honor Don Siegel with  the Habonim Yisrael,  the Builders of Israel, Award. It is fitting that Don will receive this honor in a union hall. It is fitting, too, that Edward C. Sullivan, President of the Building and Construction Trades Department of  the AFL–CIO, serves as honorary chair of  the celebration. This ceremony,  like Don Siegel himself, exemplifies all that is best in our country: men and women of good will working to understand and help one another. Don has served for many years as counsel to the Massachusetts Building Trades Council. He began practicing labor law in 1971, and, since then, he has been a trusted friend and advisor to many unions and employee benefit funds.  In 1994,  the Archdiocese of Boston honored him with  its Cushing-Gavin award, recognizing his moral  integrity, professional competence, and community concern. There is no faith community in Massachusetts, and, I think, few activists of any political or religious persuasion, who do not recognize him as a tireless, persuasive advocate for working people. Don is a man who assumes responsibility as  naturally  as  he  breathes,  and  as unaffectedly. He is the immediate past president  of  the  Jewish Community Relations Council and now chairs  its  Israel Strategy group. He has  taken pains  to educate nonJews— and for this I am personally grateful— about Israeli society, about Israel’s success in absorbing new immigrants, and about the difficult and important attempts, like those in the city of Haifa, to build understanding between Jewish and Arab Israelis. Don Siegel  is a righteous man. He  lives, teaches, and  inspires others  to uphold  the principles of  ts’dakkah v’hessid:  justice and loving-kindness. f TRIBUTE TO DORI PYE HON. HOWARD L.

264,House,107,0.288,5,2001-05-24,Mr. WELLER.," Mr. Speaker, I have been enjoying some of the rhetoric I have been hearing from some of my friends on the other side of the aisle today. Clearly, when it comes to a rise in energy prices, the policies of my friends on the left side of the aisle is very simple, and that is called pass the buck. They talk about the California energy crisis. Who has been in charge in California? A Democratic governor, a Democratic State legislature. Who prevented the power plants  from being built over the last decade? A Democratic governor, a Democratic State legislature. Of course, we at the national level in Chicago are seeing over $2 gasoline. Why? Because a Democratic administration in the White House failed for 8 years to do anything about energy. We have a new President that has been in office now for 41⁄2months, 5 months. He  inherited clearly serious energy problems. He has now come forward with an energy proposal which deserves bipartisan support. The bottom line is we need to conserve. We need to find new domestic sources, and we must reduce our independence on imported oil. f ENERGY CRISIS REQUIRES ACTION (Mr. BERRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

We really need to step back. This, I think, is an emergency in California, in particular, in the next 4 or 5 months during the hot summer of California. But this is a bill about stepping back and taking a look and learning from this so that we can, in an overall plan for the United States, make an energy policy that works for each State and for all business people and homeowners across the Nation.

274,Senate,107,-0.395,68,2001-05-24,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, at the beginning of  this year,  the State of  Michigan enacted a ‘‘shall issue’’ law  that makes it easier to obtain a concealed carry permit and will increase  the number of guns on our streets. The  law, which was scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2001, takes discretion  away  from  local gun boards and requires authorities to issue a license to  carry a concealed weapon to any applicant who meets basic eligibility requirements.  Most  law  enforcement  groups  in  Michigan  reject  the proliferation of  concealed weapons in our communities  and warn that this law will move our  State in a dangerous direction. Similarly, gun safety groups, including the  Michigan Partnership to Prevent Gun  Violence  and  the Michigan Million  Mom March, have voiced their concerns that the expected ten-fold  increase  in  the number of  concealed  weapons on Michigan’s streets would  jeopardize the safety of our children.  These and other groups that oppose the  ‘‘shall  issue’’  law  joined together to  form the coalition of People Who Care  About Kids and successfully collected  more that 230,000 signatures on a petition calling for a referendum on the  law.  Last week, the Michigan State Court  of Appeals came down on the side the  voters of the State, agreeing that they  should be able to decide on the law in  a referendum. The appeals panel stated  that ‘‘the overarching right of the people to their ‘direct legislative voice’ ’’  overrides a constitutional prohibition  against referenda for laws that include  spending provisions. Unless the decision is overturned by the Michigan Supreme Court, the voters of Michigan  will be able to voice their opinions on  the ‘‘shall issue’’ law in a referendum  in November 2002.  This  unanimous  decision  by  the  State Court of Appeals panel  is not  only a victory for the voters of Michigan, but also for the safety of our children and the security of our communities. I am convinced the people of  Michigan want to find ways to decrease  the amount of gun violence in our communities, not remove discretion from  local gun boards with the goal of increasing the number of guns on our  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:11 Dec 20, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\ODA425(cid:1)997-2008-FILES-4-SS-PROJECT€1-S ",2001

Holli is a spirited and dedicated woman who has triumphed through life’s continual ups and downs. Although Holli gave her all  to  the North Bellmore Hair Salon family business, she always wanted to contribute to the community. While managing  the salon, Holli helped  the neighborhood’s homeless, organizing a benefit for the poor from her store. But times were difficult for Holli. In the early 1990s, she lost her home, was divorced, and went on public assistance so she could care for her daughter, Samantha, then seven. But Holli bounced back. In 1996, she enrolled in Nassau Community College, where she received an Associate’s Degree in sociology. Holli was awarded a partial scholarship  to Adelphi University, where she  received a Bachelor’s Degree  in social work last year. On Sunday, May 20th, 2001, Holli  received a Master’s Degree  in social work from Adelphi University. While Holli pursued her Master’s Degree, she interned in my Hempstead District office. I was  impressed by her commitment, and  I hired her as a full-time legislative aide to handle education, IRS, grants and passports. I’m excited to have a second social worker on my staff. Holli  is a  recipient of a $5,000 Maurice Paprin Memorial Fellowship given to students who  demonstrate  commitment  to  social change through past or present work. Holli calls her employment ‘ ‘poetic justice’ since she has gone from the government taking care of her  to being a government employee helping others in tough situations. Holli is proof that hard work and dedication is all you need to make your dreams come true. I  congratulate Holli  and  her  daughter, Samantha, now 15, on their achievements and Holli’s graduation. I am honored to have her as a member of my staff and as my friend. f INTERNATIONAL MIGRATORY BIRD DAY HON. ROBERT A. BORSKI OFPENNSYLVANIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 24, 2001 ",2001
276,,107,-0.416,131,2001-05-24,Mr. BORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in recognition of International Migratory Bird Day (IMBD), which was officially celebrated on Saturday, May  12, with  hundreds  of  events across the country including one at Philadelphia Zoo. International Migratory Bird Day celebrates the annual return of millions of birds from wintering habitats in Latin America and emphasizes  that  the continued enjoyment of  these birds  depends  upon  our  actions  as  consumers, homeowners, and citizens. At  least 200 species of birds migrate  to,  from and through Philadelphia each year. In addition to the sheer enjoyment of watching them, migratory birds are important biological indicators of ecosystem health as well as sentinels  for potential human health  risks. Their populations are declining dramatically due to the destruction and degradation of their habitat throughout the Americas. Making small changes to some of our daily habits can contribute to the conservation of migratory birds and their habitats, as well as the planet’s overall health. One small change is drinking shade-grown coffee, which helps protect habitat for migratory birds. According  to experts at  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  the way coffee  is grown can have a direct effect on many of the birds we  see  in our neighborhoods each spring. Coffee farms or plantations that leave a canopy of shading trees (‘ ‘shade-grown coffee’ ) benefit migratory birds by providing habitat for their wintering grounds in Mexico, Central and South America, and  the Caribbean. The Wilson’s warbler, scarlet tanager, northern oriole,  indigo bunting, and wood  thrush are among  the dozens of migratory birds  that spend part of their lives in the U.S. and that winter in the coffee-growing regions of Latin America. Encouraging our local coffee shop or grocery store to carry shade-grown coffee is one way that each of us can make a difference. Another way is becoming more informed about migratory birds and the threats to their habitats through involvement in bird watching and other programs such as those at Philadelphia Zoo. The Zoo’s  involvement  in avian conservation dates  to before  the opening of  its original Bird House  in 1916. More  recently, scientists at Philadelphia Zoo have played a major role in the conservation of the American bald eagle. Once on  the brink of extinction due to the use of the pesticide DDT, which was banned in the 1970s, the bald eagle is a national  conservation  success  story.  The Zoo’s pair of eagles was brought to the Zoo by wildlife rehabilitators when it Today, America’s First Zoo is building a new Avian Conservation Center  that will  feature state-of-the-art exhibitions and research facilities illustrating the diversity of the world’s bird populations and their varied habitats. A central focus will be  the challenges of conservation and preservation of rare species like Micronesian kingfishers, which are extinct in the wild. A key aim of the Center is to increase visitor awareness of avian conservation and issue a ‘conservation call to action.’ We can also encourage  innovative publicprivate partnerships such as  the bird conservation initiative that was announced at the Zoo, when City and U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials met to formally recognize Philadelphia as the third Migratory Bird Treaty City in the nation. I applaud the City of Philadelphia, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Philadelphia Zoo for their efforts to promote the conservation, habitat restoration, protection and hazard reduction of migratory birds, and all those organizations and  individuals celebrating  International Migratory Bird Day. f INTRODUCTION  OF  THE  COBRA COVERAGE EXTENSION AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2001 HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK OFCALIFORNIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 24, 2001 ",2001
277,,107,-0.631,131,2001-05-24,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to join with my dear friend Representative JOEMOAKLEY (D–MA)  to  introduce  the COBRA Coverage Extension and Affordability Act of 2001. COBRA  is  the  law  that allows employees who face a change in their work status— and would otherwise lose their health insurance— to be able  to continue  that same coverage through their previous employer for a period of generally 18 months and sometimes as much as 36 months depending upon their particular situation. During this continuation period, employees must pay 102% of the cost of their current health  insurance plan. That means they pay their previous employer share, their own share, and an extra 2% to make up for any administrative costs  faced by  their previous employer for maintaining their coverage. COBRA was created in order to provide a bridge  for workers  to be able  to maintain health benefits for themselves and their families. It has been in place since 1986 and is overdue for remodeling. The bill we are offering today makes three key improvements to existing COBRA law: (1) It extends the length of time that COBRA continuation benefits are available for all workers and their families from an average of 18 months to 5 years with workers paying 102% of premiums as required under current law. (2)  It creates a new category of COBRA continuation coverage for people age 55 and ’ ’ ‘ ’ ",2001
278,,107,0.391,138,2001-05-24,Mr. MCINNIS.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize a man that has made numerous contributions to his community as well as  the United States as a whole. Mr. Sam Caudill served his country in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II, and since has served the community of Aspen, Colorado as a leading architect and historian. For his life of service and adventure, I would now like to take this opportunity to honor him. Sam started his illustrious career on a mission  for  the Office of Strategic Services  to China in 1945 to teach guerilla warfare to Chinese soldiers so that they would be able to defend themselves if the Japanese attacked. Although Sam did not realize it at the time, this type of work was the beginning of what was to become the most extensive and complex  intelligence network  in  the world— the CIA. At the age of 21 Sam volunteered to be a mule packer for the American guerilla fighters. Already fighting the Japanese, he had no idea that he would be presented with the opportunity to help start a new wave of national defense. Upon finishing his duty in the army, Sam returned  to Cornell University  to complete his education. After receiving his degree Sam returned to Colorado to make his mark on the skyline of Aspen. Following the lead of Frank Lloyd Wright, Sam has always strived to create buildings that grow out of the environment. Sam was awarded  for his unique design of Aspen High School, which reflects the rolling hill surrounding  the school with  its  rounded shape. He has been commissioned in numerous places throughout the state of Colorado. When people refer to Sam, he is often called the dean of Aspen architecture.’ Sam has also made a significant contribution  to preserving wildlife  in Colorado. He served on the Colorado Wildlife Commission from 1975 to 1983, and was chairman of the commission in 1978. During this time he has been credited with the law that allows Colorado citizens to apportion part of their tax return to the non-game and endangered species program. He also worked on the state’s catch and release  trout program. Sam still enjoys the outdoors and trys to hike and fish whenever possible. An  interest  in  local history has  spurred Sam’s  latest contribution  to society. For  the last twelve years Sam has been interviewing ‘old timers’  about their lives logging, mining and wrangling here in Colorado. Sam hopes to compile all these stories and photos he has gathered  into a book  titled,  ‘Colorado— the Wild Years.’  His love for the old west and his reputation in the Aspen community suggests that Sam may have been born a century too late. Mr. Speaker, like so many of us, Sam has fallen in love with the natural beauty of Colorado. He has spent his life trying to preserve that magical quality that the untamed mountains of Colorado exude. For this I and the citizens of Colorado are grateful.st REMEMBERING HAROLD BERKE HON.

279,,107,0.349,138,2001-05-24,Mr. REYNOLDS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance and to pay tribute to Harold Berke of Williamsville, New York. While Harold Berke is no longer with us, we are blessed that his memory and his achievements  live  on  to  this  day. Born Harold Berkowitz, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps prior  to  the start of World War  II. Harold achieved  the  rank of Master Sergeant, and during his service to our nation, invented a device that allowed a single man to lift the tail sections of airplanes for repair and inspection. Following his graduation from the University at Buffalo, which he attended under  the GI Bill, Harold Berke went to work for Bell Aerospace, where, beginning  in 1954, he  led a group  that provided a solution  to an engine problem on  the X2  rocket. Harold Berke’s leadership and expertise were integral to other projects, such as the Agena Engine, Rascal Missile, Minute Man Missile, and the engine that ensured America’s astronauts were  returned safely from the moon. Harold Berke’s contributions were not  limited  to engineering and aerospace. A  loving husband and father, Harold Berke married the late Leah Rose in 1949. They were the proud parents of two sons, Ronald and Daniel. Together with  his  sons, Harold Berke  built award-winning show cars, including a series of Corvettes, and a 1968 Camaro that won 30 awards in 10 shows. Mr. Speaker, I ask that this Congress join me  in remembrance of Harold Berke’s contributions to American rocketry and aerospace, and that we salute him in memoriam for his ability and leadership. f STARK/MOAKLEY  COBRA  COVERAGE EXTENSION & AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2001 HON.

280,,107,-0.281,145,2001-05-24,Mr. BISHOP.," Mr. Speaker, last July I had an opportunity to participate in a day of celebration and remembrance of the great contribution to agriculture and the economy in general made by the late John Thomas Thornton, Jr., of the community of Parrott, Georgia. If you are not  familiar with  the name, you are not alone. Even in the area of southwest Georgia where he  lived and  farmed most of his  life, many people are not fully aware of his contribution, which impacts our lives even today. J.T. Thornton invented the peanut shaker, a harvesting device that came into common use in the 1940’s. His invention revolutionized the peanut  industry. By making  the harvesting process faster and more efficient, the peanut shaker contributed greatly  to  the economic growth of our area of Georgia and, in fact, to the country at large. Mr. Thornton spent some 40 years developing and perfecting his  invention.  It was a magnificent achievement. The history of  this achievement was beautifully presented in an essay written  by  a  student  from Parrott, Bonnie West, who won high honors when she entered the paper in the National History Day competition. Her accomplishment helped  revive community interest in Mr. Thornton’s invention, which he called the ‘ ‘Victory Peanut Harvester.’ The people of Parrott, including members of the Thornton  family, are establishing a museum on the invention of the peanut shaker, and sponsored the day of celebration that included a parade and a number of other events. It was an exciting and enjoyable day, and it helped bring wider recognition of what this native southwest Georgian achieved. Although  farmers did not have any more spare time back then than they do today, J.T. Thornton somehow found the time to apply his practical knowledge of  farming, and his extraordinary grasp of engineering and mechanics, to overcome all of the difficulties he must have encountered until he produced something that raised the quality of life for countless Americans. This is a story we are proud of in southwest Georgia, and that can inspire other Americans, especially our young people. Mr. Speaker,  it  is,  therefore, a story  I want  to share with our colleagues in Congress. f IN MEMORY OF DENIS NICKEL HON.

282,,107,-0.348,145,2001-05-24,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to honor Mr. Jefferson Stephens, Jr., who is retiring after more  than  twenty years as Headmaster of the Chandler School in Pasadena, California. On June 16th, the school will celebrate Mr. Stephens’ career and the impact he has had on the lives of so many. The Chandler School was founded with a vision to provide young students with innovative, inspired academic programs taught by caring, dedicated  faculty and staff. Under Mr. Stephens’ guidance, the Chandler School treats each child as an individual and strives to create an environment in which children develop self-esteem and self-discipline, as well as respect for their fellow students. As headmaster, Mr. Stephens, has expected high standards of behavior,  courtesy, and academic performance  from each child who has come  to his school, and has fostered a scholastic atmosphere that encourages curiosity and creativity. In addition to serving the academic community, Mr. Stephens has served as an associate pastor for the St. George’s Episcopal Church. He has also participated in a wide range of civic duties, by assisting as a member of the Tournament of Roses Association and serving on  the board of directors  for a community housing project. ’ ‘ ’ ",2001

I think he said it very well, and I feel sort of awkward here following him. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor who I believe  is one of the most distinguished men  ever  to  represent  the State of Indiana in the United States House  of Representatives, my  dear friend  and  former  Congressman, Elwood Haynes Bud Hillis. Those of us that know this gentleman the best, I suppose, all refer to him as ‘‘Bud.’’ Bud honorably and effectively served the people of Indiana’s fifth district in the House of Representatives from 1971 to 1986, 16 years of dedicated service to his country. During his time  in the House of Representatives, he was a reasonable  and  authoritative  voice  on matters of national  security,  trade, and veterans’ issues. ",2001
284,House,107,0.311,13,2001-06-05,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Speaker, nothing gives me greater satisfaction than to hear on this day of retirement of Bill Brown these wonderfully warm words from the Republican leader, because I think the lifeblood of any parliamentary body is the sense that our debates and discussions, the votes and actions taken here, are taken in a context of rules and observance, conventions and procedures, that are fair to each Member of the body. Indeed, I think the history of our House of Representatives, certainly in this recent period, has been one of scrupulous adherence to the rules. As Speaker I have tried to  follow that guide of fairness and objectivity in every ruling I have made, and if I had any tendency to veer from that, I would find resistance, very strong resistance, from the Parliamentarians of the House, who are committed in an almost religious sense to ensuring that the rules are absolutely  impartially observed here, I think there is a record, perhaps, of the fact that this body has hardly ever overruled the Chair, and that  in those cases where there sometimes has been a question of moving to override the Chair, Republican leadership has often joined with our Members and Republican Members have joined with Democratic Members in supporting the Chair. Certainly no small part of the credit for this belongs to Bill Brown. He has been an absolutely sterling Parliamentarian in every way. He has served six Speakers. He has been in this body for almost a longer period than virtually anyone. There are  few Members and very  few professional staff who have served as long. He begins his retirement with the best wishes  and warm  affection  of  an  overwhelming number of Members and those who serve with him in aiding this body to achieve its objectives. He has  compiled, as Bob Michel says, the precedents of the House. They are now available for all. He has in recent months been a special resource of assistance to emerging parliamentary democracies  in Eastern Europe. I think he has found great satisfaction and opportunity for additional service in that work. Charlie Johnson, his very long-time Assistant Parliamentarian, has our full confidence on both sides of the aisle, and I have made his appointment with great satisfaction; and if it is time, in Bill Brown’s judgment, to leave, that a successor as worthy and able and committed and dedicated as Charlie Johnson stands ready to assume the responsibilities. Mr. Speaker, I want to extend again, not only on my own behalf but on the behalf of all Members of this House, my thanks and my appreciation and my warmest best wishes to Bill Brown, and every success and happiness for him and Jean in the years that lie ahead. ",2001
285,,107,0.52,83,2001-06-05,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a bill to authorize the operations of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) for Fiscal Year 2002. Patents, and intellectual property in general, have been part of American jurisprudence and our national economy since  the  founding of the Republic. George Washington signed a patent bill early in his first term as President, and Abraham Lincoln (himself a patent owner) was quoted as saying that the patent system ‘added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius.’  But for the most part, this subject matter— dry and arcane, the province of engineers armed with law degrees— has never inspired great interest for the public. In fact, I am hardpressed to identify two words which are better suited to induce sleep in the average lay person than ‘ ‘patent law.’ My good-natured jab at patent lawyers notwithstanding, Lincoln got  it  right, as he so often did. The Founding Fathers were prescient enough  to understand  that  for  the young nation to survive, its economy had to flourish. This is why our Constitution (Article I, section 8) actually includes provisions authorizing Congress to protect patent owners and their rights. More than 200 hundred years and six-million patents later, the economy and the country are the better for it. Our patent laws have enabled  individuals and businesses  to produce marvelous inventions that touch us in ways which we take for granted but which enhance the quality of our lives on a daily basis. For  that matter, patents are  the very  life’s blood of certain industries, as any biotech executive will acknowledge. Try raising a half-billion dollars in capital to bring a cancer treatment  to market without patent protection  for the underlying work. Unfortunately, the PTO is not currently providing adequate service  to  individuals and businesses.  Innovators must obtain prompt and reasonable evaluations from the PTO on whether they can acquire patents if they are to make sound businesses decisions. The PTO is now taking more than 25 months from filing to process a patent application  to a patent, and the latest projections show it will take an average of 38.6 months by 2006. I am fearful that the agency simply does not have the resources that will allow it to provide quality patents, especially  in such emerging areas as biotechnology and business methods. On top of these problems, the PTO has been unable to adopt the latest information technology that could allow it to provide better service to the public and more efficient patent and trademark processing. If one accepts my point— that patents are vital to the sustenance of our economy— then I hope another point begins to resonate more forcefully among my colleagues. Since 1992, the U.S. Congress, with  the participation of each Administration,  has  steadily  diverted money out of the PTO to other programs. This practice  imposes an unfair  tax on  inventors, because unlike most  federal programs,  the PTO does not receive stipend from the General Treasury. Instead, it raises all of the avenue needed to operate through the collection of user fees imposed on inventors who file for patent protection and businesses that file for trademark registration at the agency. In addition,  the diversion of  revenue  from PTO  to other programs only  inhibits  the expeditious issuance of patents and occasionally compromises  the actual quality of some patents granted, thereby subjecting them to challenge in legal and administrative settings. The bottom line is that time is money in the patent world; and with more money, the PTO can issue quality patents faster, which means more  investment, more  jobs,  and  greater wealth for American industry. The same is true for  trademarks. When  businesses  develop new products or new brand names for existing products,  early  federal  registration  of  the name, logo, or symbol is necessary to protect rights and avoid expensive litigation. My bill would help to correct this problem by authorizing the agency to keep all of the fee revenue it raises in Fiscal Year 2002. At the same time, however, this authorization would still be subject to the availability of appropriations, meaning  that  the PTO must still convince the appropriators that the agency needs and will properly spend any extra funds. In addition, and consistent with  this emphasis on oversight, the legislation sets forth two problem areas  that PTO should address  in  the coming year, irrespective of its overall budget: First, the PTO Director is required to develop an electronic system for the filing and processing of all patent and trademark applications that is user friendly and that will allow the Office to process and maintain electronically the contents and history of all applications. Fiftymillion dollars are earmarked for this project in each of Fiscal Years 2002 and 2003 for this purpose. Second, the Director, in consultation with  the Patent and Trademark Public Advisory Committees, must develop a strategic plan that set forth the goals and methods by which PTO will enhance patent and trademark quality, reduce pendency, and develop a 21st Century electronic system for the benefit of filers, examiners, and the general public. Mr. Speaker, the Patent and Trademark Office Authorization Act of 2002 will allow  the patent  and  trademark  communities  to  get more bang  for  their  filing and maintenance buck, while enhancing the likelihood that the agency will receive greater appropriations  in the upcoming Fiscal Year. It is a bill that benefits  the PTO,  its users, and  the American economy. I urge my colleagues to support it. f TWENTY YEARS OF AIDS HON.

286,,107,0.274,83,2001-06-05,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Speaker, on June 5th of 1981, the first official report on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome was published. Twenty years  later,  the AIDS pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 20 million people worldwide.  In my home state of  Illinois alone, over 15,000 people have perished  in the last twenty years. 36 million people worldwide are presently living with HIV/AIDS. Nearly 70% of those reside in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Zimbabwe, one out of every four adults has HIV. The HIV infection rate in Asia will out-pace that of Africa within the next decade. In Illinois, 35,000 people are living with HIV/ AIDS. HIV infection is growing at an alarming rate among women and African Americans. The demographics of those infected with AIDS in Illinois mirrors that of our nation. There is hope. Twenty years ago, surviving the AIDS virus was impossible. Today, people in developed countries can manage living with HIV, while it is still a death sentence in the developing world. In 1986, I suggested to Congressman John Porter that the U.S. Congress start an International AIDS Control Program. He  joined  forces with Representative Bob Mrazek, and  the program was born. Today, the United States  is  the  leader  in  the  fight against AIDS with so much more to do. Twenty years and we are finally fighting AIDS. f HONORING LYNN SULLIVAN HON. STEVEN R.

Ron is admired in the Inland Empire community for his strong record of business success and public service. He is the owner of Star Kreative Services, a full-service Marketing and Advertising Agency, specializing in budgeting, planning, media purchases, and complete corporate identity design. Ron’s leadership this past year is indicative of a Chamber President who  continuously gives of his time and finances to promote a business  friendly environment  that enhances the quality of life and the economy of Rancho Cucamonga. He has served on the Board of Directors since 1995 and began his term as President July 1, 2000. Some of the accomplishments under Ron’s leadership were: Increased the image and visibility of the Chamber to its members and the community by moving into the historic Thomas Winery Plaza. Reorganized  the community’s 61-year-old Grape Harvest Festival to a true premier  community  event.  Established  a monthly President’s Roundtable of nine Inland Valley Chambers, which discusses  regional economic development and legislative issues. Encouraged the creation of a West End Community Calendar on the Chamber’s Website, which enhances special event planning among the Chambers and service clubs. It offers the community and visitors a complete calendar of events 24 hours a day. Continued the Annual Spring Swing and Vintner’s Dinner as pre-eminent events in the Inland Empire. Formed an effective Business Advocacy Group that tracks all legislation impacting the business community. This enhanced the Chamber’s image as a true watchdog for the business community. He also wrote letters to various legislators urging either support or opposition to various legislation that would have an impact on the community.  Increased  ‘Shop Rancho’  promotion activities encouraging the residents to ‘ ‘Shop Rancho without leaving the home or office.’ Continued the popular one-on-one counseling and Small Business Workshops  for  businesses  that provided  various management and marketing  tools  for  the 21st Century. Reached a three-year goal (set in 1999) of establishing a six-month operating  reserve of $145,000 one year early. Attained a three-year goal (set in 1999) of reaching 1,000 members, for first time in eleven years, one year early. In summary, Mr. Speaker, Ron Stark has set  the bar high  for  future  leaders of  the Chamber. We salute him for his outstanding work, and wish him well in his future endeavors. f HONORING WALTER CAMPBELL HON. DALE E. KILDEE OFMICHIGAN INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 5, 2001 ",2001
289,,107,-0.388,97,2001-06-05,Mrs. LOWEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute to Dr. Glen Applebaum. Congregation Anshe Sholom of New Rochelle has chosen him as the honoree of their annual Testimonial Dinner, to be held on June 10, and they have chosen wisely. Dr. Applebaum has attained an impressive balance between  family, community, and career, making a  lifelong habit of high achievement. Dr. Applebaum received a Regents Scholarship upon his graduation  from Eastchester Senior High School  in New York and was awarded multiple prizes for his research in college before concluding his education at  the New York University College of Dentistry and the New Rochelle Hospital Medical Center. In May of 1983, Dr. Applebaum opened a private practice in New Rochelle, which continues to serve  the community  today. He also shares his expertise with others, through frequent lectures and the wide publication of his work. Despite having achieved such success  in his career, Dr. Applebaum considers family to be the most important part of his life. He and his wonderful wife, Dr. Cynthia Cohen, are valuable members of  the Westchester community, and Dr. Applebaum serves with distinction as a member of the Board of Directors at Congregation Anshe Sholom.  I am proud  to congratulate Dr. Applebaum on his noteworthy achievements and his  contributions  to  the community as a dentist, as a family man, and as a member of Congregation Anshe Sholom. f TRIBUTE TO THE ROXBURY COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASS OF 2001 HON. MICHAEL E. CAPUANO OFMASSACHUSETTS INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 5, 2001 ",2001
290,,107,-0.376,97,2001-06-05,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my strong opposition to the conference report on H.R. 1836,  the Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation Act, because it fails to reflect the priorities of my constituents. This tax cut has been sold to the American public as a cure for an astonishingly wide variety of ills, from a possible recession to spiraling energy prices. The unfortunate  truth, however, is that this package offers nothing to guard against an economic downturn  in  the near  term.  Instead,  it provides a series of back-loaded tax cuts, overwhelmingly skewed to the wealthiest Americans, while jeopardizing our ability to fund other priorities. Equally worrisome is the fact that this legislation creates the very real possibility of a return to deficit spending should the projected surpluses fail to materialize. Just this week, in fact,  the Congressional Budget Office has made a significant downward adjustment  in this year’s surplus estimates, virtually wiping out  the  ‘contingency  fund’ that has already been promised to a variety of needs, including increased military  requirements and a prescription drug benefit. We are kidding ourselves and our constituents if we believe that this is not a sign of worse news to come. To fit this 10-year tax cut under a $1.35 trillion budget ceiling,  the conferees have provided for the entire package to sunset at the end of 2010. While this ridiculous gimmick allows the tax cuts to meet budget restrictions on paper, in reality, the agreement will substantially exceed these targets when all of the costs are factored in. In the meantime, we are left with an  increasingly complex  tax code whose provisions are phased in and then repealed largely at random, making it difficult for taxpayers  to understand, and  impossible  for them to rely upon as they plan for their families’ futures. In addition, the agreement leaves out major provisions whose enactment is widely viewed as  inevitable, such as extension of  the  research and experimentation credit and measures to address serious problems with the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). By sunsetting the tax cuts before the end of the eleven-year budget period and simply omitting foreseeable costs,  the conferees have distorted  the  final cost of  the  tax cut and used  the  ‘extra’ money to throw even more last-minute provisions into the final package. Currently, 1.5 million  taxpayers are subjected  to  the AMT. Under  this conference agreement, over 30 million more would be subject to the AMT by 2010. That is double the number of  taxpayers who would be affected by  this provision under current  law. Consequently, these tax cuts will in effect increase tax liability for many households and may result in even greater income disparities in the future. Some 30 percent of American taxpayers— roughly 51 million people— will not receive the full amount of the tax rebate included in the conference report.  I am strongly  in  favor of providing immediate tax relief to hard-working families, but this legislation will leave out many of  those  families who need short-term relief most urgently. In so doing, the rebate will also fail to jump start a flagging economy, as the Administration continues to claim it will do. For example, sixty-two percent of those taxpayers who make less than $44,000 a year will get less than the full rebate amounts, with 42 percent of these taxpayers receiving nothing at all. In Rhode Island, 44 percent of taxpayers— over  123,000  individuals— making less than $40,000 a year will receive no rebate. Although these taxpayers may not have the highest income tax liabilities, they incur a disproportionately  high  payroll  tax  liability, which is not figured into the rebates. I am also frustrated with the conferees’ decision gradually phase out the estate tax— culminating in its repeal for only one year before the bill sunsets and the estate tax is again in full effect— instead of providing an immediate and permanent  increase  in  the exemption, which would protect the vast majority of families, small businesses and family farms from estate tax liability. The provision contained in this agreement would allow the wealthiest two percent of our population  to pass wealth  to their heirs without taxation, while hard-working families would continue to be taxed on every dollar earned. It would also have a devastating impact on charities,  foundations, universities and other philanthropic organizations. Additionally, I am disappointed that the conferees have failed to provide immediate marriage tax relief for couples. The agreement before us does not even begin to address the marriage penalty until 2005, and relief will not be fully phased in until 2009. Married couples who have been contacting my office seeking relief from this unintended consequence of our tax code will surely be disappointed when they realize that their wait will continue for at least four more years. This tax package will cause enormous revenue  losses and  threaten our ability  to address national priorities like extending the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, reducing our national debt, implementing a prescription drug benefit  for seniors and  improving education and health care for all. Furthermore, the agreement will jeopardize resources and programs that are absolutely vital to our nation ’s small businesses, workforce, environmental protection, energy efficiency and housing needs. We should use our current prosperity to enhance those federal programs relied upon by some of  the most vulnerable members of our society.

291,,107,-0.483,23,2001-06-18,Mrs. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, tonight I am pleased to pay tribute to Frederick Stephens Humphries, one of  the  true giants of higher education in this country. We all recognized early in his 16-year tenure that he is a man of great vision and wisdom. As President of Florida A&M University, he built it into one of  this nation’s premier  institutions of higher education. Dr. Humphries is one of those special individuals in whom there exists not only an immense capacity for service, but also that touch of genius which everyone recognizes but no one can define. Under Dr. Humphries’  leadership, Florida A&M’s enrollment has more than doubled and the number of graduates has tripled. He did this  simultaneously while  raising  standards and improving the overall quality of the student body. Three times in the last ten years Florida A&M has been the top choice of National Achievement Scholars,  tying  last  fall with Harvard for attracting the largest number of these high-achieving students. Thanks  to Fred Humphries, Florida A&M now has the triple distinction of being the nation’s largest single-campus historically black college, the No. 1 producer of African-Americans with baccalaureate degrees, and  the leading producer of African-American  teachers. Perhaps his single greatest contribution to America and to African-Americans is that, during his 26-year career as a college President, Dr. Humphries has taught an entire generation of African-Americans that there was room for intelligence and idealism in our world, and that ‘excellence with caring’  was not just a way to live but a way to live greatly, that with education and knowledge each of us might share in the promise of our age. So to you Frederick Stephens Humphries, I want to thank you for all that you have done not only for Florida A&M, but this nation and our world. f ESPERANZA’S 11TH ANNUAL FIESTA OF HOPE HON. DENNIS J.

292,House,107,0.417,16,2001-06-26,Mr. NUSSLE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2213, the Fiscal Year 2001 Economic Assistance Act. It provides $5.5 billion  in markets  loss payments and other agriculture assistance. I am pleased that the Committee on the Budget was able to work hand in hand with  the Committee on Agriculture to make this bill possible. Recognizing the needs of farmers, the Committee on Budget reported and the House passed a budget resolution that revised the allocations and budgetary totals for the current fiscal year to accommodate $5.5 billion  in additional emergency agricultural assistance for the crop year of 2001. We budgeted for this emergency. This fits within the budget. It is responsible. All the Committee on the Budget asked was that the Committee on Agriculture produce a straightforward bill that avoided accounting gimmicks and reserved sufficient funds to meet future crop year needs and permanently reform agricultural assistance programs so we can move away from this BandAid approach of the past 3 years. H.R. 2213 more than up holds the Committee on Agriculture’s part of this bargain. BEST),  As the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, I have the privilege of reporting to my colleagues that this bill is within the budget. I commend the gentleman from Texas (Chairman COMthe  gentleman  from Georgia (Chairman CHAMBLISS), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. STENHOLM), ranking member, for their hard work on this and all the members of the Committee on Agriculture.

I rise in strong support of this bill. I would say to the gentleman from Oregon  I share the same concerns that he does about conservation, and I hope we can address that to a greater extent in the farm bill. But what we are doing today is coming forward with a market assistance package, and I emphasize that because it is not a disaster bill. A market assistance package is necessary for our farmers because, for the fourth year in a row, we are facing low commodity prices all across the spectrum. This bill is responsible. It addresses the needs of producers.  It puts an amount of money in the pocket of producers as quickly as we can do it. Our folks need that relief now. At the same time, if the American people are going to be assured that they are going to continue to have quality food products at low-commodity prices, we need to pass this bill today. ",2001
295,House,107,-0.302,23,2001-06-26,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. Mr. Speaker, I would urge this body not to force Washington’s local governments to pay $400,000 with local funds to make a name change to a transit station. It does not fit in length. It does not fit with the policy of naming stations after places rather than people. In attempting to honor Reagan, we are contradicting everything he stood for. I have several quotes that I ought not to have to share with the body where President Reagan urged us to respect local government. This is not respecting  local government. What  is being said  is, we stand by Reagan’s principles as long as it suits our politics. That is not right. The principle of deference to local government is correct, and in this case it is being violated not only with the naming of the airport, but certainly with the naming of the transit station. I would urge my colleagues to read George Will. I would urge them to read President Reagan’s statements, and I would particularly urge them to abide by President Reagan’s principles of recognition and respect for local government. ",2001

Mr. Chairman, $65 million  for the Mission Valley East Light Rail Extension is included in this bill, and that is part of the San Diego Trolley, an area that we have been trying to improve for a number of years. Also it includes $2 million for phase 1 of the Mid Coast Corridor Extension. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman  from Alaska  (Mr. YOUNG) and  the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. OBERSTAR) for their long-standing commitment to mass transit. I also want to recognize and thank my colleagues in the San Diego congressional delegation, the gentleman from California (Mr. HUNTER), the gentleman  from  California  (Mr. CUNNINGHAM), the gentleman from California (Mr. FILNER) and the gentleman from California  (Mr. ISSA). We have worked together on this Mission Valley East Extension, and this bipartisan cooperation will make a big difference for all of our constituents in San Diego. What does that mean? It means that we are going to be increasing the trolley ridership by 2.5 million new annual transit riders. It means that students at San Diego State University will now be connected to our light rail system. It means that patients at Alvarado Medical Center will be connected to the light rail system as well. It also means that we are going to close the gap between our blue and our orange lines, and we will take a first step towards linking the University of California at San Diego to our light rail system. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS) for the opportunity  to  acknowledge  these needed transit improvements that will be coming to the San Diego region and the big difference it will be making for all of us.

Mr. Gallardo retired on March 31, 2001 bringing an end to sixty-four years of service to Major Farms Inc. and the entire Soledad community. After moving  from  Orange  County  to Soledad as a young boy, Mr. Gallardo grew up  living on  the property of Major Farms. When he was fourteen years old, he began working  full  time on  the  farm, which at  that time was barely one year into operation. Until his retirement at the age of seventy-eight, Mr. Gallardo continued to work ten hour days, six days a week, and in distant years past, it was common practice during the spinach harvests for Mr. Gallardo to work seventeen hour days. After twenty-three years at Major, Mr. Gallardo moved into Soledad, yet continued to work at Major Farms while simultaneously raising six children. Mr. Gallardo’s dedication and hard work was not exclusively held to Major Farms, rather his positive influence has infiltrated the entire city of Soledad. To honor Jesse Gallardo’s dedication to the community of Soledad, the city of Soledad presented Mr. Gallardo with a plaque and even designated a baseball park in  his  honor. Every  Fourth  of  July, Mr. Gallardo participates  in a softball game at Jesse Gallardo Park. Mr. Speaker, the service of local members of the community are an asset to this nation, and  I applaud Mr. Gallardo’s contributions. The  retirement of Mr. Gallardo signifies  the end to a dedicated sixty-four years of service to Major Farms and the entire Soledad community. It is clear that Jesse Gallardo’s dedication has made a lasting impact on his community, and I join the city of Soledad in honoring Mr. Gallardo. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON.

305,,107,-0.454,170,2001-06-26,Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  before  the House  of Representatives today  to mark  the passing of an  important American, Robert Moody McKinney, editor and publisher of the Santa Fe New Mexican, the west ’s oldest newspaper. Over my years of serving the people of New Mexico,  I came  to know and  respect Mr. McKinney.  I saw embodied  in him  the principles of a dedicated public servant and many of the high standards that we expect from a newspaper editor and publisher. He was a man of great wit, humility, intelligence and integrity, and his many contributions to his country will never be forgotten. I join many in mourning the death of Robert M. McKinney and send my heartfelt condolences  to his  family.  I am  including  for  the RECORDa copy of his obituary, which details his extraordinary career. [From The Santa Fe New Mexican, June 25, 2001] ROBERTM. MCKINNEY: 1910–2001, PAPER’S OWNERDEADAT90 ROBERTMOODYMCKINNEY, editor and publisher of THESANTAFENEWMEXICAN, died of pneumonia Sunday night at New York Hospital. He was 90. His daughter, Robin McKinney Martin of Nambe´, was with him. He was a diplomat,  corporate director,  conservationist, veteran and poet. During a distinguished career, McKinney served as assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency at Vienna, Austria, and as U.S. ambassador to Switzerland. McKinney purchased The Santa Fe New Mexican in 1949 and was its editor and publisher for 52 years. Due to health problems from the high altitude of Santa Fe, McKinney sold the company to Gannett Co. in 1976, retaining the right to continue as editor and publisher. After a protracted and celebrated court battle, which he won, McKinney resumed management of the newspaper in 1987 and repurchased the property in 1989. Through his friendship with U.S. Sen. Clinton P. Anderson, McKinney was  instrumental  in securing the San Juan Chama water-diversion project. He also persuaded St. John’s College of Annapolis, Md., to open its western campus in Santa Fe. As publisher, he supported John Crosby’s efforts to launch The Santa Fe Opera and staged conferences in the early 1960s on the advantages of managed municipal growth in Santa Fe. Born  in Shattuck, Okla., Aug.  28,1910, McKinney grew up in Amarillo, Texas, and graduated  from Amarillo High School  in 1928. As a teen-ager, he was a cub reporter for the Amarillo Globe News. He received a bachelor’s degree, graduating Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Oklahoma in 1932 with a major in literature. Upon graduation, he worked in New York City as an investment analyst at Standard Statistics, now Standard and Poor’s. He served as a partner  in his cousin Robert Young’s investment firm from 1934 to 1950 and became financially successful by investing in bankrupt railroad stock at the depth of the Depression. During World War  II, McKinney, was,.a lieutenant junior grade in the U.S. Navy. He helped develop and manufacture the Tiny Tim rocket and participated in D–Day to observe how the devices pierced the armor of German tanks. In  1943, he married Louise Trigg,  the daughter of a ranching family from eastern New Mexico. His career in government included appointments by five presidents. President Harry S. Truman appointed him assistant secretary of the Department of Interior in 1951. President Dwight D. Eisenhower named him U.S. ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Commission. He was editor and principal author of a multivolume work on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. President John F. Kennedy appointed him U.S. ambassador to Switzerland in 1961. Under Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, he held appointments in the U.S. Treasury Department. He was awarded the Treasury Department’s Distinguished Service Medal. Because of Santa Fe’s proximity to the National Atomic Weapons Laboratory at Los Alamos, McKinney  became  interested  in peaceful uses of atomic energy, became an authority in that field and published several books on the subject. McKinney served on the board of directors of several major corporations, including the Rock  Island Railroad,  International Telephone & Telegraph, Trans World Airlines and Martin Marietta. He was a classical scholar, having mastered Latin at Amarillo High School and Greek at the University of Oklahoma.

Ms. Howard always goes above and beyond her classroom duties, as she works to gradually increase the amount of programs Junior Achievement offers in Rhode Island. She even serves as the volunteer for those new programs herself, always with great enthusiasm and energy. The history of Junior Achievement is a true testament  to  the  indelible human spirit and American ingenuity. Junior Achievement was founded in 1919 by Horace Moses, Theodore Vail, and Senator Murray Crane of Massachusetts, as a collection of small, after-school business  clubs  for  students  in Springfield, Massachusetts. As the rural-to-city exodus of the populace accelerated in the early 1900s, so too did the demand for workforce preparation and entrepreneurship.  Junior  Achievement  students were taught how to think and plan for a business, acquire supplies and talent, build their own products, advertise, and sell. With the financial support of companies and individuals, Junior Achievement recruited numerous sponsoring agencies such as the New England Rotarians, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Boys & Girls Clubs, the YMCA, local churches, playground associations and schools to provide meeting places for its growing ranks of interested students. In a few short years JA students were competing in regional expositions and trade fairs and rubbing elbows with top business leaders. In 1925, President Calvin Coolidge hosted a reception on the White House lawn to kick off a national fundraising drive for Junior Achievement’s expansion. By  the  late 1920s,  there were nearly 800 JA Clubs with some 9,000 Achievers in 13 cities in Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. During World War II, enterprising students in JA business clubs used their ingenuity to find new and different products for the war effort. In Chicago, JA students won a contract  to manufacture 10,000 pants hangers  for  the U.S. Army. In Pittsburgh, JA students developed made a specially lined box to carry off incendiary devices, which was approved by the Civil Defense and sold locally. Elsewhere, JA students made baby incubators and used acetylene  torches  in abandoned  locomotive yards to obtain badly needed scrap iron. In the 1940s, leading executives of the day such as S. Bayard Colgate,  James Cash Penney, Joseph Sprang of Gillette and others helped the organization grow rapidly. Stories of Junior Achievement’s accomplishments and of its students soon appeared in national magazines of the day such as TIME, Young America, Colliers, LIFE, the Ladies Home Journal and Liberty. In  the 1950s, Junior Achievement began working more closely with schools and saw its growth  increase  five-fold.  In 1955, President Eisenhower declared the week of January 30 to February 5 as  ‘National Junior Achievement Week.’  At this point, Junior Achievement was operating in 139 cities and in most of the 50 states. During  its  first 45 years of existence, Junior Achievement enjoyed an average annual growth rate of 45 percent. To further connect students to influential figures in business, economics, and history, Junior Achievement started  the Junior Achievement National Business Hall of Fame in 1975 to recognize outstanding leaders. Each year, a number of business leaders are recognized for their contribution to the business industry and for their dedication to the Junior Achievement experience. Today,there are 200  laureates from a variety of businesses and  industries that grace the Hall of Fame. By 1982, Junior Achievement’s formal curricula offering had expanded to Applied Economics  (now called JA Economics), Project Business, and Business Basics. In 1988, more than one million students per year were estimated to take part in Junior Achievement programs. In the early 1990s, a sequential curriculum  for grades K– 6 was  launched, catapulting the organization into the classrooms of another one million elementary school students. Today,  through  the efforts of more  than 100,000 volunteers in the classrooms of America, Junior Achievement  reaches more  than four million students in grades K– 12 per year. JA International takes the free enterprise message of hope and opportunity even  further . . . to more than 1.5 million students in 111 countries. Junior Achievement has been an influential part of many of today’s successful entrepreneurs  and  business  leaders.  Junior Achievement’s success  is  truly  the story of America— the fact that one idea can influence and benefit many lives. Mr. Speaker, I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations  to  Jeannine  Howard  of Rumford for her outstanding service to Junior Achievement and  the students of Rhode  Island. I am proud to have her as a constituent and congratulate her on her accomplishment. f TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY STEVENS ENOMOTO HON. ROBERT T. MATSUI OFCALIFORNIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 26, 2001 ",2001
307,,107,-0.404,177,2001-06-26,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in tribute to Dorothy Stevens Enomoto,  the  first African American woman to manage a California Department  of  Corrections  institution.  Mrs. Enomoto, one of Sacramento’s most notable citizens, will receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree  from California State University, Sacramento on May 25th, 2001. As her friends and family gather to celebrate Mrs. Enomoto’s outstanding achievement, I ask all of my colleagues to join with me in saluting this truly remarkable citizen of Sacramento. Born  in Atlanta, Georgia, Mrs. Enomoto graduated from Booker T. Washington Senior High School, where she shared valedictorian honors with the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Mrs. Enomoto attended Clarke College, now Clarke Atlanta University, where she attained Senior status before she was forced to withdraw for family and economic reasons. In hopes of securing a better future for herself and her children, Mrs. Enomoto moved to California. In time, Mrs. Enomoto obtained a Correctional Officer’s position with  the California Department of Corrections, where she rose  through  the ranks and became a  trailblazing pioneer. During her tenure at the California  Department  of  Corrections,  Mrs. Enomoto became  the  first African American woman to manage a California Department of Corrections institution, the Women’s Civil Addict Unit at the California Rehabilitation Center.  In addition, Mrs. Enomoto was also  the first African American woman to hold the position of Deputy Director in the Department. Following her retirement, Mrs. Enomoto has remained active and dedicated to making Sacramento a better place for all. Mrs. Enomoto is  currently a Commissioner on  the Sacramento City and County Human Rights/Fair Housing Commission, having served as Chair in 1997. In addition, Mrs. Enomoto is also cochair of  the Greater Sacramento Area Hate Crimes Task Force. Mrs. Enomoto’s considerable expertise on the issue of hate crime prevention prompted her appointment by President Clinton  to a national hate crime conference. Widely touted as one of Sacramento’s most cherished  and  prominent  citizens,  Mrs. Enomoto has been recognized with numerous awards over the years. Some of these include the United Negro College Fund Frederick V. Patterson ‘ ‘Outstanding Individual of the Year’ award in 1994 and her induction into the African American Criminal Justice ‘ ‘Hall of Fame’ in 1994. In addition, she is the recipient of the ‘Bridgebuilder’  award from the Jewish Community Relations Council  in 1997 and  the 1994  Sacramento  YWCA  ‘Outstanding Woman of the Year’  award. Mr. Speaker, as Mrs. Dorothy Enomoto’s friends and family gather for the commencement exercises, I am honored to pay tribute to one of Sacramento’s most honorable citizens. Her successes are unparalleled, and  it  is a great honor for me to have the opportunity to pay tribute to her contributions to the city of Sacramento. I ask all of my colleagues to join with me  in wishing Mrs. Enomoto continued success in all her future endeavors. f HONORING JOHN S. KOZA HON. JAMES A.

308,,107,0.426,184,2001-06-26,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my disappointment that funding for the Hershey Intermodal Center was not included in the FY 2002 Transportation Appropriations bill. Hershey, PA is in need of a modernized central business district with a vibrant center of activity to meet the transportation and commercial realities of the 21st Century. To address  this need,  local government officials have been working with private concerns in a public-private partnership  to  renovate downtown Hershey. At the heart of the downtown improvement plan  is  the construction of an intermodal  transportation center. This  facility will link bus transit, park and ride, and transit parking in a central location. It will also provide parking for the overall downtown development and is situated to provide a stop for the commuter rail service that is envisioned in the CORRIDORone long-term plan. I strongly support  this  regional  economic  development project and believe that funding for this important project should have been included in the Transportation Appropriations bill. Although $2.5 million was not added to this year’s House version of the Transportation Appropriations bill, I plan to continue my efforts to seek funds which are seriously needed to revitalize  central Pennsylvania.  I hope  the Senate will correct this oversight, and recognize the needs of the hard working people of our commonwealth. f TRIBUTE TO PAUL BEAZLEY HON. JAMES E.

311,House,107,0.513,11,2001-07-17,Mr. BOEHNER.," Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Illinois, the chairman of  the Committee on International Relations,  for bringing this bill to the floor today, and I do think that it is certainly fitting. I also want to thank my colleagues from the Georgia delegation for their hard work. Our committee shared some of this jurisdiction early on, and in an effort to move this bill today, I yielded to the gentleman from Illinois to bring this bill up. Why? Because Paul Coverdell was our friend. Not only was he a director  of  the Peace Corps under President George Bush’s reign in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was a respected member of the Georgia legislature. Paul was an insurance agency owner. He understood  the private  sector.  I know Paul because he and I worked closely during my years in the Republican  leadership here  in  the House, with Paul representing the Republican leadership in the Senate. We worked closely  in a meeting  that occurred every single week for about 4 years. I can tell my colleagues that Paul Coverdell was a man of great  integrity, someone who worked very hard on behalf of his constituents and on behalf of his Members of the Senate. Not only did he work with his Republican Members but with his Democrat Members as well. And when I look back through the 10 years I spent in this Congress, I can tell my colleagues that there are but few people who rise to the stature of former Senator Paul Coverdell. Why? Not just because he worked there, not just because he worked with all his colleagues on both sides of the aisle, but because Paul Coverdell was a man of great integrity who believed strongly in the words of freedom. He understood the private sector, understood the need to allow the genius of the private sector and individuals to be all that they can be and stood up proudly for that each and every day. We miss Paul Coverdell here in the halls of Congress. I rise today to support this resolution to honor him as a man that we all can look up to, not only  today  but  for  generations  to come. ",2001
312,House,107,-0.666,18,2001-07-17,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker,  I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, apparently  I am the only person who is going to come out here and raise a question. Everybody who has watched the military industrial complex develop weapons systems must be amazed that the day after something happens in the Pacific, we run out on the floor in this virtual reality Congress to make a PR event, which will be  in the newspapers, as though we have  succeeded. Now we must put out $60 billion or $100 billion. If you listen carefully to the words of the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. SPRATT), this thing has failed over and over again. This is only the second time out of four, in a system where you put the problem out there and you have the answer, and you shoot at it, and two out of four times you have missed. Now, how can anybody be excited about a system like that? If I know what the pitcher is going to throw and I stand here, I am going to hit it. Everybody knows that. That is why they hide the pitcher’s signals between the catcher’s legs. They do not want people to know at bat what the pitcher  is going to throw. But here we have this system, right here and right here, and twice we missed it; and we are out here congratulating. I do not say anything about the employees. Boeing has worked  on  all kinds of these programs, but we never came out and congratulated them the first time they succeeded. This is simply to build up a momentum in this society for a system which, as the gentleman  from Ohio  says, is driving the Chinese and the Russians together. To put this system up, we have to tear up the ABM treaty. The Russians have said do not do  it;  it has kept peace for 50 years. The Chinese have said do not do it. (Mr. TRAFICANT) b1115 Why are we out here whipping up the public to believe this is a good idea? I am going to vote against the resolution;  not  against  the  people,  but against the purpose of it. ",2001
313,House,107,0.47,18,2001-07-17,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I think one aspect of this resolution that the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. SPRATT) and  I have coauthored is that it does not speak to the politics of missile defense or the ABM Treaty or the relationship of the Soviet Union and the United States. What it does speak to is a technological challenge that we gave lots of people, many of whom make great sacrifices to work in the uniform of the United States or who go to work everyday in various places around this country, working either for the government or for private business, whether they are physicists or engineers or blue collar workers, working on a program that I would state again is monumental in its success. Once again, both of these systems were going three times faster than a high-powered rifle bullet, and they collided 148 miles above the earth, some 4,800 miles off into the Pacific, an extraordinary thing.  It  is  like having somebody stand in San Diego with a high-powered rifle shooting to the center of the country and somebody standing in New York doing the same thing, except the high-powered rifles really went three times as fast as an ordinary high-powered rifle, and having those little bullets collide in midair. Now, I think that is an extraordinary thing. Indeed, it is something that a lot of critics of this system said was impossible: hitting a bullet with a bullet. But I think if we look at the resolution that the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SPRATT) and I have cosponsored, it does not say that this is the end of the line and that somehow we have now achieved absolute defense against incoming ballistic missiles. What it does say, and I quote: ‘‘The House of Representatives understands that  testing of ballistic missile defenses will  involve many  failures as well as successes in the future. The House of Representatives, nonetheless, commends the effort and ingenuity of those who worked so hard to make the test a success.’’ Mr. Speaker, when Billy Mitchell came back to the Coolidge administration in the 1920s, one of his messages was that we had entered the age of air power, whether Americans liked it or not. He recommended to a then Republican administration that they spend a lot of money developing air power. Well, we had a number of budget hawks who did not want to do that, and we did not do as much as we should have. As a result of that, we were not as ready as we should have been for World War II. Well, today, Mr. Speaker, and particularly  since  the Gulf War when Americans were killed  for  the  first time with ballistic missiles  fired by Saddam Hussein, we realize that we live now not in the age of air power but in the age of missiles. When we look at the array of military systems across the board that we have, and the gentleman from South Carolina and I work on a daily basis with lots of other great Democrat and Republican members of the Committee on Armed Services, we know that we build systems to stop ships. We build systems to detect submarines. We build systems to handle tactical aircraft, fighter aircraft. We build systems to take down bombers. We build systems to handle and that can handle capably just about every type of offensive weapon that an enemy could throw at us, except one. So the one question I have always asked the Secretary of Defense when he appears before myself and the other members of the Committee on Armed Services is: Could you today, could you today stop a single  incoming ICBM, Intercontinental  Ballistic  Missile, coming into an American city? And the answer always is, whether it is a Democrat or Republican administration: No; today we cannot do that. Well, that is what we are working toward, Democrats and Republicans, people in uniform and people out of uniform, is to achieve that capability. I think that it is very important for us to understand, and the reason the gentleman  from South Carolina  (Mr. SPRATT) and I put this language in, acknowledging that there are going to be failures in this testing program as well as successes and the difficulty of this program. We are going to have decoys. That is, when the offensive missile puts its warhead, projects its warhead off of the booster system, it is going to have perhaps decoys that would attract the interceptor missile; and the interceptor missile would end up hitting decoys, not being able to discriminate between a decoy and a real warhead. We have to work that problem. We have to be able to handle that problem. We are going to have, in some cases, perhaps  evasive maneuvers. We are going to have lots of problems. We are going to have in some cases multiple shots; that is, a number of warheads coming in that we have to handle at one time. We may have to handle the effects of a nuclear burst at  some point. On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, the alternative is for us to do nothing. The old saying is, ‘‘You don’t do anything until you can do everything, so you do nothing;’’ and I think that is an inappropriate  position  for  the  United States to take. If we do not try to build a defense and do not try to develop this interception capability, this will be the first time  in this century that the United States has looked at a weapon, at an offensive weapon, and decided that they are not going to try to learn how to defend against it. I think that would be a mistake. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2001
314,House,107,-0.658,32,2001-07-17,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Ms. CARSON) who, previous to her congressional experience, worked in the field of labor with my late father. ",2001
315,House,107,-0.464,32,2001-07-17,Ms. CARSON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker,  I certainly thank the honorable gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr. CONYERS) for yielding me time. I did have the benefit of working for his father as an  international representative when John was still running around trying to find out whether or not he was going to Congress. So  it  is a pleasure to come, Mr. Speaker, to the floor and benefit from all of this historic and intellectual dialogue that preceded me. I come here today to exercise a constitutional right granted to me as a citizen of the United States, and that is freedom of speech. I have a great deal of reverence for the United States flag. I wave it at my residence every opportunity, and am very saddened by those flags that are often lowered over capitols and buildings in commemoration of some fallen hero, if you will. My adoration and respect, however, does not exceed my commitment to the integrity of the first amendment of the United States Constitution. Many of us learned in our educational experience of Patrick Henry, who said, ‘‘I may not agree with the words that you say, but certainly would defend your right to say it.’’ As I recall, Patrick Henry was in fact one of the signers of the Constitution. One of my first and foremost commitments as a Member here is on behalf of our  country’s veterans. My name, Julia Carson, is derived from a Korean War Marine, 100 percent service-connected veteran, who struggles now to even gain any type of mobility. I am very supportive of veterans and recognize their interests in preserving this flag. My son, Sam Carson, is a former member of the United States Marine Corps. So, as a ranking member of the Committee  on  Veterans’  Affairs  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation, I am working hard to address the needs of our veterans, to assure that the  fight  for  freedom does not go unappreciated or uncompensated. Great Americans such as Vietnam veteran  and  former Senator Kerry, former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and our current Secretary of State, the Honorable Colin Powell, have expressed their opposition to this amendment. These are great men who served this country with distinction. General Powell has stated, ‘‘If they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else, that is a prosecutable crime. But if it is a flag they own, I really don’t want to amend the Constitution  to  prosecute  someone  for foolishly desecrating their own property. We should condemn them and pity them instead.’’ These men feel that in spite of their own commitment to the integrity of the American flag, they do not want their personal views to infringe on the rights of free speech of other Americans. Francis Scott Key wrote, and we all recall that tune, ‘‘O’er the ramparts we watch’d, were so gallantly streaming. And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. O ’ ’ ’ ‘ ’ — ",2001
316,House,107,0.536,39,2001-07-17,Mr. COLLINS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my strong support for House Joint Resolution 36, which  I have cosponsored, and thank my colleague, Mr. Cunningham, for his continued effort to protect this important symbol of our freedom, the United States flag. The vast majority of my  constituents  in Georgia’s Third District have contacted me and stated  that  they share  this belief  that among  the countless ways  to show dissent, the desecration of the flag should not be one of them. Opponents of this amendment state that it would reduce our First Amendment freedoms. This is simply not so. Rather this amendment would serve to restore the protection our flag had been accorded over most of our nation’s history. The American flag represents not only our freedom but serves as a constant reminder of the  ideals embodied  in our Declaration of Independence that countless Americans have served to defend, preserve and protect over our nation’s 225 year history. In  the Declaration of  Independence,  the founders acknowledged  that we are created equal and that we have been endowed by our Creator with certain rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These are  the  ideals  for which countless Americans have fought, bled and died and it is these ideals upon which our Constitution is founded. It is these ideals which we are elected to preserve. Today, we can renew our affirmation of these principles, so clearly stated in the Declaration  of  Independence,  by  preserving the most visible symbol of our Republic. Upon three separate occasions, this House has rightfully voted to protect our nation’s flag. Today, the United States House of Representatives will again affirm its commitment to protect this symbol of our great nation. For the thousands of Americans who have fought and died for their country, the flag is more than a piece of cloth. ",2001
317,House,107,0.162,39,2001-07-17,Mrs. ROUKEMA.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in strong support of the Flag Protection Amendment. Why are we here today. The Congress of the United States has already acted to pass flag protection legislation. However, a majority of  the Supreme Court— by  the narrowest of margins— has  ruled  that Congress does not possess the authority to legislate in this important area.  It has  twice overturned  laws  that prohibit flag burning. In both cases, the decision has been handed down by a narrow margins of 5 to 4. I happen to disagree with the Court. So do such distinguished constitutionalists as Justices Stevens and White. They hold that burning of the U.S. flag is not an expression protected by the First Amendment. Instead, they believe that flag burning is an action, and a repugnant one. Therein lies the distinction. Burning a flag is conduct, not speech. Still, we need  to pass  this Constitutional amendment  today and begin  the process of ratification. Only then, can Congress honor its responsibility  to protect  this sacred national symbol. I believe strongly  in  this amendment, although I believe it to be an issue on which patriotic Americans of good  faith can, and do, have legitimate differences. Many assert that burning a flag endangers no one. Using that standard, one would  then assume  that we would not see  the  inherent violation of decency of throwing blood on the U.S. Capitol, painting a swastika on a synagogue, or defacing a national monument. These actions also endanger no one. And, yet, laws have been wisely enacted to prohibit these actions. How can we not protect our country’s most treasured symbol from such actions? The American flag was created to honor our country.  Let  us  pass  this  Constitutional amendment created  to protect  the honor of our flag. Support  this  joint  resolution. Support  amendment. Protect the flag. ",2001
318,House,107,-0.526,46,2001-07-17,Mr. WATT of North Carolina.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First of all, let me address the comments made by my colleague, the gentleman  from Florida  (Mr. STEARNS), and make it absolutely clear to him that for those of us who have different opinions about what the first amendment covers than yours, it does not mean that we do not have political heart. It  just means we have a difference of opinion. Those of us who have stood for the first amendment to the Constitution are people like myself who, in the practice of law, actively defended the right of the Ku Klux Klan to march. Mr. Speaker, maybe my colleagues can say I do not have any heart. Maybe my colleagues can say I am looking for political cover. But when I go back into my community and stand up for the right of the KKK to march and express themselves, I think that gives some indication of what I feel about the first amendment and the right that all of us, I think, are fighting to protect, which is the right of people to express  themselves, whether we agree with what they are saying or disagree with what they are saying. This is not about seeking political cover. This  is about protecting  the very Constitution that we are operating under and have been operating under for years and years. Mr. Speaker, I want to make that clear to the gentleman. This is not, as the gentleman characterized it, a political  exercise.  And  the  gentleman should also be clear that this is not the Republican side versus our side, that is the Democratic side. The last time I checked, there were people of goodwill, both Republicans and Democrats, on both sides of the aisle on this issue. The one thing that I think we all agree on  is that we believe  in this country and the principles on which it was founded, and we will all fight and defend those principles. I finally got to that point with the gentleman  from California (Mr. CUNNINGHAM), my good friend, who is in the Chamber. We got past that. Let us not call names. ",2001

I have  been pleased to support this amendment, which would place a moratorium  on drilling for oil in the Great Lakes.  As a Senator from a State which has a  large urban area—namely, the city of  Chicago—and the surrounding communities that rely on Great Lakes water  for drinking water, I think this moratorium is well advised.  Illinois,  as  a  practical matter,  doesn’t allow any drilling off its Lake  Michigan coast. The issue has arisen,  however, in Senator STABENOW’s State.  I think this amendment has worked  out very well.  I appreciate Senator  DOMENICI’s commitment to work to try  to hold this amendment in conference.  With that, I yield the floor.  ",2001

322,Senate,107,0.091,193,2001-07-17,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to join with my friend and colleague, Senator RONWYDEN, in the introduction of the Seniors Prescription  Insurance Coverage Equity Act of 2001,  or ‘‘SPICE.’’ I want to thank him for  his enthusiasm about and his commitment to this joint venture.  It was just about two years ago now  that Senator WYDENand I introduced  this bill for the first time. SPICE 2001  is the product of almost three years of  work  and  development. Since  1999,  when we first tackled this issue, there  has been much discussion about how to  design a prescription drug coverage  plan that is both comprehensive and affordable, that provides choice but guarantees availability of basic coverage.  And, perhaps most  importantly, one  that is workable for seniors, the Medicare program and one that private providers will offer. We believe we have  struck this balance in SPICE 2001.  I believe that this bill is a benchmark for the Senate’s consideration of  a comprehensive out-patient prescription drug program under Medicare. I  offer this bill today, with my friend  Senator WYDENbecause it is the product of a three year collaborative effort  to provide our Nation’s seniors with  prescription drug coverage, and I offer  it with the hopes that it will be considered as part of a broader reform when  the Senate takes one up.  Americans age 65 and older are only  12 percent of the population but account for over 40 percent of all drug  spending. Which isn’t surprising considering that over the past five years,  per capita drug spending for the Medicare  population  has  approximately  doubled, reaching an estimated $1,756  this year.  This comes at a time where fewer retirees have health coverage from their  former employers than ever before. In  1998, an estimated 66 percent of large  employers offered retiree health coverage, fewer than 40 percent did so in  2000. At a time when fewer and fewer of  our seniors have retiree health care  coverage from their former employers,  and when the cost of prescription drugs  are skyrocketing, no one can argue  that it isn’t essential we ensure that  Medicare  beneficiaries  have  comprehensive coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. And, this is a problem,  I might add, which will only grow when  the 77 million Baby Boomers begin to  enter Medicare in 2011.  For the past several years, Senator  WYDENand I have been united in our  belief that we owe it to our seniors to  develop the best and most practical solution.  SPICE  2001  represents  a  straightforward,  comprehensive,  and  responsible approach that should appeal to anyone who believes that seniors need prescription drug coverage.  To accomplish these goals we have  built upon the model of the first SPICE  bill and added components that have  continued to be part of the larger debate on this issue—that of public programs versus private competition. As a  result, SPICE 2001 now creates a partnership between the Federal Government and private insurers to share the  cost, and  the  risk, of offering outpatient prescription drug coverage for  our senior population.  Specifically, SPICE  2001 creates a  prescription drug coverage program for  all Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in  both Part A and Part B, and who  choose to enroll. SPICE offers a premium subsidy of at least 25 percent to  all enrollees. To provide extra assistance to those who need it most, there  is a 100 percent premium subsidy for  those whose income is at or under 150  percent of poverty, $12,885 for a single  person and $17,415 for a couple. Those  whose income is between 150 percent  and 175 percent of poverty, $15,033 for  an individual and $20,318 for a couple,  will receive a subsidy based on a sliding scale down to 25 percent of the cost  of the premium.  SPICE 2001 offers two choices in the  coverage so they can pick a plan to  best serve their needs. One option is  basic coverage, with a $350 deductible  and a 25 percent coinsurance requirement. This can be purchased with a  Stop-loss plan of $3,000 or separately.  The second option is stop-loss coverage. While only 17 percent of beneficiaries have costs above $3,000, they  account for almost 54 percent of all  spending on prescription drugs. This  coverage  is  provided  completely  through the private insurer. According  to CBO’s January 2001 baseline projections, 83 percent of those enrolled in  Medicare fee for service plans pay less  than $3,000 for their drugs. For these  seniors, they might only want to purchase the basic coverage. Those who  need more than just the basic coverage  can buy them both. For those who can  manage their spending and only want  to  protect  themselves  from  catastrophic expenses, they can purchase  stop-loss coverage.  And, importantly, all SPICE enrollees receive the benefit of the negotiated discount on the cost of their prescription drugs,  starting with  their  first prescription.  Choice is one of the cornerstones of  this program. Seniors will not only  have the choice of their level of coverage but will be able to choose from a  variety to have their care delivered.  SPICE can be run through Medigap,  Medicare+Choice plans, or private entities. In areas where there are no insurers, the SPICE Board will have the authority to negotiate with entities to  bring them into the market.  One  of  the  perennial  arguments  against government sponsored or assisted prescription drug coverage  for  our retirees has been that if we did it,  employers wouldn’t. We already know  that fewer employers are offering retiree health benefits than just 12 years  ago, this is a trend we hope to discourage. This is why the SPICE Board is  authorized to provide the 25 percent  premium subsidy as an  incentive to  employers who  provide  prescription  drug coverage for their retirees. It is  critical we  encourage  employers  to  continue to offer this type of coverage  and we acknowledge that in this bill.  According to a 1998 Wall Street Journal poll, 80 percent of retirees use a  prescription drug every day. The average Medicare beneficiary  fills a prescription 18 times a year. It is long  past time that we ensure that these  prescriptions are covered.  SPICE 2001 offers something for everyone interested in providing our seniors with prescription drug coverage. It  is a program that can be incorporated  in existing health plans, will be run  through a government Board whose  sole purpose is ensuring that this program runs well, and will foster competition and allow for choice in both  coverage and providers.

325,,107,0.333,207,2001-07-17,Mr. CRENSHAW.," Mr. Speaker, recently my family had the honor of participating in the renaming ceremony for the USNS Gunnery Sergeant Fred W. Stockham at Blount  Island Command in Jacksonville, Florida. The event was  held  to  rename  the  Maritime Prepositioning  Force  (Enhanced)  ship Stockham after Medal of Honor recipient and World War I hero, Fred. W. Stockham. The USNS Stockham will be part of  the Maritime Prepositioning Force of ships operated by the United States Military Sealift Command. These ships carry additional airfield matting, fleet hospital equipment, construction battalion equipment and other supplies needed to supplement the requirements of a forward-deployed military force. The  ships  that make  up  the Maritime Prepositioning Force of  the Military Sealift Command play a vital role in our nation’s national defense. Our military relies on its capability to be a sustainable force and project its power  throughout  the  world.  Maritime Prepositioning Force ships perform  this mission by offering our military  the equipment needed  to be a  fast deploying, mobile and sustainable force. The July 6th renaming event for the newest of our Maritime Prepositioning Force ships offered my family the chance to incorporate the personal background of the ship’s new namesake with that of our own life experiences. My wife, Mrs. Kitty Crenshaw, was given  the honor of being the Stockham’s official sponsor. She performed the ceremonial breaking of the champagne bottle over  the ship’s railing and was given the opportunity to offer her personal thoughts of motherly pride for the men and women that would man the Stockham. Mr. Speaker, I submit the speech given by Mrs. Kitty Crenshaw at  the  renaming ceremony for the USNS Fred W. Stockham into today’s RECORD. This speech is an example of the pride our nation holds for our military personnel and the pride a mother feels not only for her own children, but also  those  in her heart. Thank you Mr. Speaker for the time today to discuss the USNS Fred W. Stockham renaming event and  the vital  role  the men and women of the Military Sealift Command play in the capabilities of our military force. I was thrilled when I was asked to be the sponsor of this ship. It seemed like an exciting and wonderful thing to experience. As I read about Sgt. Stockham and the traditions of this time-honored ceremony, I became increasingly humbled and grateful for this rarest of honors. As a mother,  I  felt especially honored and even singled out for this particular ship named VerDate 11<MAY>2000 05:06 Jul 18, 2001 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A17JY8.008 pfrm04 PsN: E17PT1 ’ ",2001
326,,107,0.554,1,2001-07-23,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, as we all know, we are in our busiest legislative session in July; and it is important to go back and consider all of the accomplishments we have had in the last 6 months. All of us have worked alongside with the President in tackling  some very  tough  issues, and  I think it is important that we remind everybody of the important victories that I think are a great benefit to the American people. When thinking about the  first 180 days of President Bush’s service to our Nation, there are many accomplishments across a broad spectrum, both national and international issues, that I think are clearly evident; and I wish to bring to my colleagues’ attention. From education and the environment, to health care and national security, the President has  taken  an  active stance  in promoting an agenda that has received both public and bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker, let me be specific here. For example, the President’s budget, with bipartisan support, funds essential priorities, pays down a historic level of debt in this country, while, of course, simultaneously providing tax relief to every taxpayer in every tax bracket. The President inherited a faltering economy. He signed into law the largest tax cut in 20 years. This was important because it provided a needed boost while simultaneously proposing measures to increase trade and stabilizing energy prices. President Bush’s efforts to expand the quality of health care for all Americans has led to the largest increase in medical research funding, the development of 1,200 new community health care centers for rural and low-income Americans, as well as immediate assistance to seniors in the form of a prescription drug discount card that will reduce their bills by 10 to 15 percent or more. While working  to  improve health care for American seniors, the President has also taken action to increase access for disabled Americans for better housing,  transportation,  greater employment opportunities, and overall access to community  life. Moreover, Mr. Speaker, his appointment of a bipartisan commission to improve Social Security reveals his deep concern for working Americans and the effect Social Security will have for them long after retirement. While working to protect the interests of American citizens at home, the President has also worked diligently in order  to protect American  interests throughout our global community. The $8 billion increase of defense spending that we passed will improve the quality of life for all men and women who have committed their lives to military service. President Bush’s commitment to those  in the armed services was no more clearly seen than in his efforts to ensure the safe and expedient return of the U.S. crew that was detained  in China. That was no small feat, a diplomatic coup; and I think this is a great success that we, as a Nation, can be proud of. His efforts have also led to the development of a comprehensive review of all areas of the military while also carrying out a successful missile defense test. President Bush’s agenda also focuses on  strengthening  the  ties with  the global community. His travels to Europe reflect his efforts to promote key foreign policy tenets that aim to assist developing nations in fighting poverty and improving global health care while also promoting an international awareness  for environmental conservation. These can be clearly seen in his efforts for partnership with the African nations on issues ranging from the fight against HIV/AIDS to the greater development of international trade. Mr. Speaker, his commitment to the international treaty that will reduce the worldwide use  of  12  dangerous chemicals exemplifies his concern for the global  environment. The President’s foreign policy efforts also reflect a  sincere  commitment  to  strengthening the young  independent democracies of Eastern Europe. Moreover, as the first President to give a radio address in Spanish, the President has also worked to strengthen the alliance of the North American nations through active participation during the Summit of the Americas. President  Bush  has  successfully strived to replace Washington culture bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

327,House,107,0.357,22,2001-07-23,Mr. NETHERCUTT.," Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. I am delighted to support this resolution, H.R. 201, which was introduced by my dear friend and colleague,  the  gentleman  from Washington (Mr. HASTINGS), who just happens to not be able to be here today because he is out West preparing to attend the funeral for these four young people who died and who are the subject of this resolution. My colleague introduced the legislation out of respect for those in the West who fight fires and especially out of respect for these four people who lost their lives trying to save the lives of others. And he is joined, along with myself, with the rest of the congressional delegation  from our State  in paying tribute and honor to these fine people. We in the West are used to fighting fires. We are used to the dangers of firefighting wildfires  throughout  the Pacific Northwest States. Yet it is very difficult for us today as we pay tribute and recognize the danger of fighting fires and the hazards that many men and women go through not just in our State but other States across  this country to put out fires and to save lives. These  four young people were moms and dads and the children of moms and dads and brothers and sisters and uncles and aunts and friends to many who respected what they do and what they have done. Tom Craven, Karen FitzPatrick, Jessica Johnson, and Devin Weaver gave their lives to their country and in service certainly as Federal firefighters. There were some bright spots that came out of this tragedy, I must say. Amid the sadness and great loss were a few encouraging moments. Firefighter Rebecca Welch embraced two hikers in her emergency shelter as the flames approached and saved their lives and her own. Firefighter Jason Emhoff suffered severe burns, and he is successfully recuperating. Others continue to fight the blaze in honor of their fallen colleagues. I think this resolution is a way to pay tribute to these fine people and to recognize  the  seriousness  of  firefighting and the importance of these young people as they jeopardize their lives. So I am delighted that the House is taking this action. I urge my colleagues to support this, and I especially say congratulations to the gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr. HASTINGS) for taking the initiative to recognize these four young people. ",2001
328,House,107,0.411,29,2001-07-23,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr.  Speaker, many of us were revolted when the Democratic leadership took $1 million from Bernard Schwartz  from Loral that gave military secrets to the Chinese who in turn gave them to North Korea that can now hit us with a Taepo Dong  II missile. We were  sickened when the DNC used our military as waiters in a White House fund-raiser. But the latest tops all of that, I believe. Democrat leadership had a fundraiser this weekend with Hanoi Jane, Hanoi Jane Fonda, that stood beside Vietnamese gunners as they were trying to shoot down American airplanes; Hanoi Jane and Tom Hayden, who stood beside those gunners, knowing that our POWs were tortured and brutalized, and said nothing. Yet the Democrat  leadership this weekend has a fund-raiser in the face of campaign finance reform with Hanoi Jane Fonda. I hope you choke on every dollar. f FAITH-BASED INITIATIVES (Ms. WATSON of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) ",2001
329,House,107,-0.531,29,2001-07-23,Ms. WATSON of California.," Mr. Speaker, one of the most fundamental guiding principles of our Nation is that individuals should be judged on their talents rather than on their heritage or their beliefs. It has been a long struggle for many Americans to secure the benefits of this principle. Even today, unfair discrimination prevents many Americans from achieving all they can. But most Americans can agree that our Federal Government should not sanction unfair discrimination but rather should fight it wherever it exists. Last week, Congress took a decision that compromised this principle. The passage of the Community Solutions Act last week by this House would permit groups  to discriminate unfairly against certain Americans. Worse yet, the bill actually would take away the right of communities to establish their own antidiscrimination laws. Mr. Speaker, it is not too late for Congress to correct this House mistake. I encourage you to work with the Senate to see that any final version of this bill respects the rights of communities  to  enforce  their  own  antidiscrimination laws and thereby protect one of our most cherished American principles. f SPECIAL ORDERS The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. OTTER).  Under  the  Speaker’s  announced policy of January 3, 2001, and under a previous order of the House, the following Members will be recognized for 5 minutes each. f H.R.  2246, ACCOUNTINTRODUCTION  OF  MEDIA  MARKETING  ABILITY ACT ",2001
330,House,107,0.122,36,2001-07-23,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," My colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS), has made a series of very important points, but the most important point is that health insurance  is  the most  important benefit that employees receive from employers and that in fact the only place people can get affordable health insurance is through their place of employment. If we provide access to specialist care and all of those access rights that we provide in this bill, which both bills provide and which do not in themselves cause any of the problems the gentleman is talking about; and if we provide a national process of independent review of decisions made by insurers to guaranty that those decisions do not deny needed care, which both bills provide and 41 States provide, that will not have the consequences that the gentleman fears. But if we provide the right to sue wrong, we will have the consequences the gentleman fears. And if businesses think they can be sued for what are essentially malpractice decisions, they will drop their plans or increase costs. Just to give my colleagues a little example of how important this is, in last year’s alternative bill we had a system for protecting employers. The employers, frankly, did not think we were right, and they did not support it. But it was the best we could think of at the time. It said if you did not directly participate in the decision, then you could not be sued. But direct participation turned out to be a pretty long chain, and a lot of people got swept into it. So this year, as we move forward, we thought harder about that issue of protecting the employer, who, after all, is only doing his  employees  the good service of having a plan and paying for it for them. So we came up with a new way of protecting employers. And one of the things about our bill, the Fletcher-Peterson-Johnson bill is that it has a simple, clean mechanism  for protecting employers. The employer simply  appoints  a  dedicated  decisionmaker, and under his plan he then is protected from suit. Now, in the other bill, realizing what a good idea we had, in the Senate they added that designated decisionmaker into the bill. But they just laid it on top. So now their bill has two systems. What that does is to create court cases about which system. That is the kind of way in which the other bill, in its complexity, invites litigation, explodes litigation, drives up costs, drives up premiums or copays, or reduces coverage or, in fact, forces employers to drop their plans. So when we talk about the fact that our bill better protects employers and protects the employees’ insurance, it is right there in black and white. It is in the provisions. Their provisions drive inappropriate litigation. Our provisions only help the person who was harmed by not getting the medical care they deserved. And that person, under our bill, has the right to sue. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for joining us and talking about this. ",2001

348,House,107,-0.321,38,2001-07-31,Mr. REYES.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. As an original cosponsor and strong supporter of H.R. 2540, the Veterans Benefits Act of 2001, I am pleased that we are moving forward to assure a cost of living increase for our Nation’s disabled veterans and their families, and the other benefits provided in this legislation as well. The sooner the benefits provided in this bill can be enacted into law, I believe the better. I want to acknowledge the cooperation  of  our  chairman  and  ranking member, the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. SMITH) and  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. EVANS), as well as our new subcommittee chair, the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON), in moving this bill forward. I appreciate their commitment and  leadership to the benefits accorded to our veterans. I want to highlight the provisions addressing the needs of Gulf War veterans. A new report of the Institute of Medicine acknowledges that symptoms experienced by Gulf War veterans have a significant degree of overlap with symptoms of patients diagnosed with conditions such as fibromyalgia, chronic  fatigue  syndrome,  and  irritable bowel syndrome. When  legislation  was  originally passed  to  provide  service-connected compensation benefits to our Nation’s Gulf War veterans, it was the intent of Congress that those who were experiencing these symptoms, such as  fatigue, joint pain, and others noted in the recent IOM report, would be compensated. Unfortunately, VA’s General Counsel ruled that only veterans whose symptoms did not carry a diagnostic label would be compensated. Currently, VA’s ability to receive compensation depends on the happenstance of whether or not the examining physician attributes a diagnostic label to the symptoms. This is unfair to our Nation’s veterans and must be changed. The Gulf War provisions of H.R. 2540 place the emphasis where it was originally  intended  by  focusing  on  the symptoms  experienced by Gulf War veterans rather than a particular label which may be attributed to them. The term chronic multi-symptom illness is intended to include veterans who experience more than one symptom lasting at  least 6 months.  It  is my understanding that thousands of Gulf War veterans have had claims denied because their symptoms were attributed to a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. Most of  these war veterans would be eligible for benefits provided by this bill as of April 1, 2002. I deeply regret that the large tax cut recently  signed  into  law  leaves no funds available to make this provision effective any sooner.  I would prefer that this bill provide those benefits and be effective as of November 2, 1994, when the original law was passed. b1245 Nonetheless, I recognize that under the financial constraints that we must now live with, there is no money to provide for an earlier effective date. Sick Gulf War veterans deserve the compensation provided by this bill. Mr. Speaker, I would also  like to state  that  I  support  the manager’s amendment extending until December 31, 2003, the period in which Gulf War veterans  may  manifest  symptoms qualifying  for  compensation  as  an undiagnosed illness. The measure before us moves us towards the goal of meeting the needs of our sick Gulf War veterans in a responsible manner. Again, I want to thank the chairman, the ranking member and the chair of the Subcommittee on Benefits for their leadership and their vision to our Nation’s veterans. H.R. 2540 is a good bill and I urge all the Members to support it. ",2001

350,House,107,0.471,45,2001-07-31,Mr. WELDON of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time. We are going to have a lot of debate and I assume some of the arguments that the gentleman has put forward will be debated  further  in the course of the afternoon.  I will  just point out one or two quick things. The procedure that they would like to make legal is illegal in several European countries. There  is really only one that currently allows it, and they have come under a lot of criticism. I think by passing my bill, we actually bring  the United States  into  conformity with a lot of thinking that is going on in the world. The gentleman  from Florida  (Mr. DEUTSCH) mentioned a ‘‘study’’ where paralysis had been reversed. I do not know where he got that reference from. There was a story in the press of a rat that had paralysis and a  lot of the press reported  it as embryonic stem cells. It was not embryonic stem cells, it was fetal stem cells. It was not even a study, it was a scientist who took some video footage. It was not peer reviewed. Nevertheless, it was reported in the press as a ‘‘study.’’ This  is not about embryonic stem cell research, it is about whether or not we are going to carry this whole issue one step further, no longer using the excess embryos in the clinics, but now creating embryos for research purposes. ",2001
351,House,107,0.225,45,2001-07-31,Mr. GREENWOOD.," Mr. Speaker,  I thank the gentlewoman  for yielding time. I also want to thank my opponent  in  this debate,  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. WELDON), for letting me use one of his charts to which I will refer in a moment. This rule makes in order the Greenwood-Deutsch substitute. The Greenwood-Deutsch substitute, just like the base bill, makes it illegal to create a human being through cloning. We all, the  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr. WELDON) and I, and all of the speakers we will hear from today, all believe that it is not safe and it is not ethical to create a new human being through cloning. We need to ban that. What we do not want to ban is, as has been  said,  the  somatic cell nuclear transfer  research, because  that, my colleagues, that is what gives us the most promising opportunity to cure the diseases that have plagued humanity for centuries. b1345 Every one of us has had the experience that I have had in my office over and over again: a mother and father bring  in  their  little diabetic  child, sometimes with a big bottle of needles showing how many times they must inject themselves while they buy time to see  if diabetes will  eventually kill them. Every one of us has had the experience that I have had where a beautiful young mother comes into the office, she cannot  raise her arms  for Lou Gehrig’s disease, and is trying to raise VerDate 30-JUL-2001 05:34 Aug 01, 2001 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K31JY7.082 pfrm02 PsN: H31PT1 ",2001

353,House,107,0.632,66,2001-07-31,Mr. BARR of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives took an important step in banning the cloning of human embryos. As this debate moves forward in Congress,  I believe  the National Right  to Life Committee has made some very  important points which we need to keep in mind: NATIONALRIGHTTOLIFE COMMITTEE, INC. Washington, DC, July 26, 2001. AMERICANSOPPOSECLONINGHUMANEMBRYOS FORRESEARCH The biotechnology industry is pushing for a  deceptive  ‘‘cloning  ban’’  sponsored  by James Greenwood. This bill actually permits, protects, and licenses the unlimited creation of cloned human embryos for experimentation as long as those embryos are destroyed before being implanted in a mother’s womb.  It would more accurately be termed a ‘‘clone and kill’’ bill. In the past, even major defenders of harmful research on human embryos have rejected the idea of special creation of embryos for research. ‘‘The creation of human embryos specifically for research that will destroy them is unconscionable.’’—Editorial,  ‘‘Embryos: Drawing the Line,’’ Washington Post, October 2, 1994, C6. ‘‘What the NIH must decide is whether to put a seal of approval on . . . creating embryos when necessary through in vitro fertilization, conducting experiments on them and throwing them away when the experiments are finished. . . . The price for this potential progress is to disregard in the case of embryos the basic ethical principal that no human’s bodily integrity may be violated involuntarily, no matter how much good may result for others.’’Editorial,  ‘‘Life is precious, even in the lab,’’ Chicago Tribune, November 30, 1994. ‘‘. . . We should not be involved in the creation of embryos for research. I completely agree with my colleagues on that score.’’— Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D–CA), 142 Congressional Record at H7343, July 11, 1996. ‘‘. . . I do not believe that federal funds should be used to support the creation of human embryos for research purposes, and I have directed that NIH not allocate any resources for such research.’’—President Bill Clinton, Statement by the President, December 2, 1994. ‘‘We can all be assured that the research at the National Institutes of Health will be conducted with the highest level of integrity. No embryos will be created for research purposes.  . . .’’—Rep. Nita Lowey (D–NY), 142 Congressional Record at H7343, July 11, 1996. ‘‘. . . The manufacture of embryos for stem cell research . . . may be morally suspect because it violates our desire to accord special standing and status to human conception, procreation, and sexuality.’’—Arthur Caplan, Director, University of Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics, Testimony before Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, December 2, 1998. PUBLICOPINIONSPEAKS ‘‘Should  scientists  be  allowed  to  use human cloning to create a supply of human embryos  to be destroyed  in medical  research?’’ (International Communications Research Poll,  June  2001): No—86%, Don’t Know/Refused—4.3%, Yes—9.8%. ‘‘Do you think scientists should be allowed to clone human beings or don’t you think so?’’ (Time/CNN Poll, April 30, 2001): No— 88%, Not Sure—2%, Yes—10%. So-called ‘‘therapeutic cloning,’’ just like ‘‘reproductive cloning,’’ creates a human embryo. These embryos are killed when their stem cells are harvested  in the name of ‘‘medical research.’’ ‘‘. . . Any effort in humans to transfer a somatic cell nucleus into an enucleated egg involves the creation of an embryo, with the apparent potential to be implanted in utero and developed  to  term.’’—Cloning Human Beings: Report and Recommendations of the National Bioethics Advisory  Commission (Rockville, MD: June 1997, Executive Summary). ‘‘We can debate all day whether an embryo is or isn’t a person. But it is unquestionably human life, complete with its own unique set of human genes that inform and drive its own development. The idea of the manufacture of such a magnificent thing as a human life purely for the purpose of conducting research is grotesque, at best.

358,Senate,107,0.403,32,2001-09-04,Mr. THOMPSON.," Mr. President,  I  would like to address S. 149. I believe  my colleagues who have spoken are  correct in that they have substantial  support for this legislation. I do not  doubt  they have a majority of  the  Democrats and a majority of the Republicans. I do not doubt they have the  support of the administration. My understanding was  that  the President  made a campaign statement or commitment with regard to this issue during the last campaign. President Clinton made the same commitment during  his campaign for President.  The President had a group of high-  tech executives to the White House,  just as President Clinton did, to promote this sort of legislation. My colleagues are correct in that the President now supports essentially a continuation of the Clinton policy with regard to the liberalization or loosening  of our export controls law. I disagreed  with  it when President Clinton was  President. I disagree with it now.  While we need an Export Administration Act and while we need to take into  consideration  commercial  circumstances and changes in the world, I  think the balance between our national  security interests and our commerce  interests is not there.  This is not really a bill, as I think  about it, that is supposed to balance as  such. It is a bill that has very specific  purposes. It is consistent with our export administration process that we  have had for decades in this country. It  is based on the notion that there are  some items we need to try to keep out  of the hands of some people for as long  as we can. The most ardent proponents  of  liberalized  trade  restrictions,  of  course, would acknowledge that. We  have the so-called rogue nations, and  so forth, to which, we all acknowledge,  we should not let any of this high-tech  stuff get through. If we were really in  a world where the technology genie  were totally out of the bottle, I suppose we would not bother ever making  the distinctions between  really bad  countries and pretty bad countries and  friends because it would be out there  for all to have. This is based on the  proposition that is not the case, that  there are some things controllable and  that we should try to keep these things  out of the hands of some entities and  some countries for as long as we can.  When you look at the purpose of the  act we are dealing with today, I think  it correctly states that the purpose is  about national  security export controls,  it  is not about enhancing exports. In fact, you might say it is kind  of anti-export. I think the norm is and  should be that this country is for free  trade. I certainly have tried to be one  of the leaders in that area. I think the  President ought  to have  trade promotion authority. I think we need to  do more in that area. I think it is the  basis for a large segment of our economic security and prosperity in this  country.  We had a debate with regard to a section of NAFTA recently. I think most  of us are very committed to the process. But the fact that we have an export administration process and an Export Administration Act acknowledges  that, be that as it may, there are some  things that bring in extremely serious  national security considerations.  I refer to S. 149. It says the purposes  of this act are to restrict the export of  items  that would contribute  to  the  military potential of countries so as to  prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. It further  says the purpose is to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It doesn’t really talk about a balance of those grave and primary considerations that we all must acknowledge are, more  than anything else,  against  some  commercial  considerations. Here we are talking about I  think our total exports to these control countries, which are about 3 percent of our exports. So we are talking  about a small  fraction—3 percent of  our exports as balanced against what I  just described in the act.  I am not for some kind of equipoise,  or some kind of a balance, when  it  comes to these things. We shouldn’t  control things that are uncontrollable.  We shouldn’t be foolish about it. But  we ought to have a very careful process  that is not weighted or prejudiced in  any way by those whose interest it is  to get things out the door, whose interest is to export, whose interest is to  come to the White House and come to  the Congress and lobby on behalf of  more and more exports for economic  reasons. You don’t have the average  man on the street with a  lobbying  team coming up here saying be very,  very careful about how you liberalize  our export control laws because we are  concerned about what we read about  what is going on in the world in terms  of proliferation.  The world has changed a  lot. We  should look at these matters from time  to time to see whether or not we are  operating  in  the  right century. We  don’t have the old Soviet Union anymore. We don’t have the threat that  posed. But in its place are several new  threats which, in many cases, are more  dangerous than the ones we had.  We know, for example, that with the  development of technology, weapons of  mass destruction can now kill many,  many more people than they otherwise  could. There are ways of delivering  weapons of mass destruction that did  not exist a short time ago to countries  such as the United States.  We  have  biological weapons  that  stagger the imagination with the description of the devastation that just a  small amount of it can wreak, again,  accompanying that with the means to  deliver them, the means that did not  exist a short time ago. That  is the  other side of the technological coin,  the technology that has helped us in so  many ways and has made the world a  better place. That is the other side of  that coin. It is real.  Of course, the world has changed in  another way. My colleagues are correct  when they say that more of this technology is available around the world.  In some cases, to some extent perhaps,  there is nothing we can do about it.  But  in some cases, to some extent,  there is something we can do about it.

359,House,107,0.478,6,2001-09-17,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a  few minutes to talk about a number of very  important issues, building in many ways on the remarks of my friend from Huntington Beach, who, as he said very appropriately, was one of the key leaders in our effort to ensure that the Soviet Union was extricated from Afghanistan during the 1980s. It was a very troubling time; but, Mr. Speaker, as you recall, there was a tremendous victory, a victory because  forcing  the Soviets from Afghanistan was critically important to the demise of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union. So that is why we should celebrate what it is that we were able to do during the 1980s; but at the same time, we need to  look at where we are today and what we need to do as a Nation. It is very true that over the past several years we have seen a crumbling of our relationship with some countries that had been traditional allies of ours during the war between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union, and specifically Pakistan, the country to which my friend, the gentleman from (Mr. ROHRABACHER), referred.

The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: H. RES. 245 Resolved, That at any time after the adoption of this resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2944) making appropriations  for the government of the District of Columbia and other activities chargeable in whole or in part against the revenues of said District for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for the other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. The amendments printed  in part A of the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution shall be considered as adopted in the House and in the Committee of the Whole. Points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI are waived. The amendment printed in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules may be offered only by a Member designated in the report and only at the appropriate point in the reading of the bill, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against the amendment printed in part B of the report are waived. During consideration of the bill for further amendment, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole may accord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member offering and amendment has caused it to be printed in the portion of  the Congressional Record designated for the purpose in clause 8 of rule XVIII. Amendments so printed shall be considered as read. At the conclusion of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill, as amended, to the House with such further amendments as may have been adopted.

361,House,107,-0.45,18,2001-09-25,Mr. OBEY.,"  Mr.  Chairman,  Chairman KNOLLENBERGhas done a good job with this bill, and I thank him. He has approved the overall budget for the use of local funds, judiciously used the Federal allocation to fund required services and boost several  local  initiatives, cut back  the number of general provisions, and worked with Mr. FATTAH, the ranking member, to restore a lot of the District’s specific spending plans. In  full Committee, Chairman YOUNG and  I presented an amendment to redirect $13 million in Federal funds to help the District prepare and begin to implement a revised Emergency Operations Plan. In the aftermath of September 11th, it became apparent  that many government entities— Federal, state and local— were not prepared for the new reality. In the District, the Police said there was no plan. The fire department said it had a plan— but it was over thirty years old. The Federal government never told the city it was sending its workers home for the day— the District had to learn that from the press. So we took this opportunity to help the District make certain that it had an excellent, coordinated Emergency Operations Plan. The bill withholds about $8 million in unrelated Federal funds until the plan is done to make the point that this was a very serious matter. Those other  funds are not needed  right away; this will not have any immediate impact on the District or its citizens. Now, it turns out the district does have an emergency operations plan, but  it  is clear  it has some very serious problems. These problems cannot be addressed by a hasty revision. I trust this bill provides adequate resources to do a careful and complete revision of the Emergency Operations Plan, fully coordinated with other entities in the District, like the U.S. Capitol Police, the Federal Office of Personnel Management and other local governments. The District should not  rush  through  the process of developing  its Emergency Operations Plan— it owes its citizens and the nation the best product possible. ",2001
362,House,107,0.366,18,2001-09-25,Mr. KNOLLENBERG.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I would like to thank all Members of Congress who took such an active interest in the District of Columbia appropriations bill this year. The subcommittee received an unprecedented number of requests from Members, which I think shows, as much as anything, how committed they are in this body to our Nation’s Capital, and how far this city has come in the last 6 years. Mr. Chairman, the bill before us is a good, bipartisan bill that reflects the priorities I set when I  first became chairman, that being economic development, public safety, and education. As was mentioned, this fully funds every penny of the city’s budget, and it ensures that all Federal obligations are met.  I want to reemphasize, as has been attested to here, that we have eliminated more than half of the general provisions that were included in last year’s bill and by our manager’s amendment that was included in our rule, we have shown our commitment to addressing any remaining concerns with the bill. I intend certainly to do that with the various participants, including the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr. FATTAH), obviously, and  the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON). My first year as chairman of the Subcommittee on the District of Columbia of the Committee on Appropriations has been a very positive experience for me. I began to meet the leadership of the city, I began to meet the people in the city, and I got an understanding from them as to what was on their minds. Their input has been invaluable to me in crafting this bill.

Mr. Speaker, to place your life in harms way in order to defend our Nation is indeed a noble and honorable action. Hubert Douglas Tabor dedicated himself by serving in World War  II and  is certainly worthy of  the praise and admiration of this body. During the campaign  in Northern Burma, Hubert placed his well-being before all else in order to ensure a victory for the Allies in that war-stricken area. Hubert was raised on a farm in Colorado. Throughout his  time  there, he grew  tired of horses and wished to escape from the farm life by signing up for the Army. However, after entering the Army, the Army recognized that Hubert possessed superior  riding skills and was sent to Ft. Riley, Kansas to be a member of the 124th Cavalry. This unit was the last mounted cavalry in the Army and it was with the 124th that Hubert deservingly received his silver spurs due to his accomplishments in the service. Upon his relocation to Burma, his role was that of a packer. The 124th Cavalry,  teamed with  the 56th Cavalry and the 613th Field Artillery Battalion, was charged with  the duty of opening  the Burma Road  that was closed by  the Japanese. As the team trekked across the Himalayan  landscape,  the Japanese enemy was encountered at night. Although Hubert had several close calls during his service, perhaps ‘ ’ ",2001

DOUG BEREUTER OFNEBRASKA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, September 25, 2001 ",2001
373,,107,0.231,158,2001-09-25,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, this Member commends to his colleagues the following editorial, entitled President Needs Trade Authority, from the September 5, 2001, edition of the Norfolk Daily News, which emphasizes  the need to grant the President ‘ fast track’  trade negotiating authority. This Member  is a  longtime supporter of Trade  Promotion  Authority  (TPA),  or ‘FastTrack Authority’ (as  it was previously called), because TPA is necessary to enable the United States  to commence, conclude, and implement trade agreements with foreign nations. Without  the enactment of TPA,  the United States will continue to fall further behind  in expanding  its export base, which  in turn will cost America thousands of potential jobs. Congressional passage of TPA  for  the President is absolutely essential for America to live up to its export potential. Therefore,  this Members  urges  his  colleagues not only to carefully read this editorial, but also to support granting trade promotion authority to the President now! [From the Daily News, September 5, 2001] PRESIDENTNEEDSTRADEAUTHORITY FORMERSECRETARIESOFAGRICULTUREOFONE MINDREGARDING‘‘FASTTRACK’’ ISSUE Members of Congress ought  to be  impressed that 10 former secretaries of agriculture, Democrats and Republicans alike, are in agreement on an important matter of trade policy. From Orville Freeman, who served under President Kennedy,  to Dan Glickman, who served under President Clinton, all were in agreement that President Bush ought to be granted ‘‘fast track’’ trade negotiating authority. With some exceptions among those in farm organizations who fear only big companies find ways to profit from exports, the agricultural community seems unified regarding benefits of foreign trade. That accounts for broad bipartisan support of measures to promote it. Presidents had fast-track authority beginning in 1974, and until congressional Republicans failed to renew it for the Clinton administration in 1994. They erred, and that error should not now be compounded. Trade negotiations are already conducted under broad guidelines approved by Congress and the president. Having  arrived  at  specific  trade  pacts under such authority, Congress must not pick and choose, second-guess and thereby jeopardize agreements. With the  fasttrack arrangements, it can either accept or reject an agreement, not nitpick and rewrite the terms. Thus Congress  retains an overall veto;  the  president  retains  negotiating power. It is the right balance. Through the administrations of Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush I and early in the first Clinton term, the fast-track authority existed in the White House. The error of failing to restore it after 1994 should not be compounded now by defeat of the proposal. America’s efficiency in all phases of food production means it can compete effectively on a worldwide basis. This advantage cannot be exercised to improve the economic status of agriculture by tying the hands of the one individual who can, with a cooperative Congress, do most to encourage beneficial trading terms to reach consumers in foreign nations. The letter to current Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman, signed by those 10 former  secretaries,  said,  ‘‘American agriculture has much to gain by passage of Trade Promotion Authority and too much to lose if Congress fails to seize this opportunity.’’ Re-establishing this authority would do much to assure Americans, and especially those involved in farming and ranching, that their economic opportunities will not be hostage to narrow partisanship. f HONORING 76 YEARS OF THE NEW ENGLAND COUNCIL HON.

375,,107,0.375,165,2001-09-25,Mr. PORTMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Stan Matlock, a friend and Cincinnati broadcasting legend, who passed away on September 16, 2001. Stan’s WKRC–AM morning radio program, ‘Magazine of the Air,’  was a Cincinnati area institution for 27 years. It was a simple concept — he would  tell human  interest stories, then play a record, then tell another vignette— but he did it better than anyone. The popularity of his program was extraordinary; at times fully 50 percent of radio listeners in the Cincinnati area  tuned  in  to Stan Matlock’s Magazine of the Air. And he was more than a great storyteller. He  loved  research and writing and always considered himself first a writer. It’s not surprising  that his poignant stories were commentaries on our times. Impeccably organized, it was said that he had his vignettes crossfiled by subject and appropriateness for a particular time of day or national holiday or event. He was said to have over 30,000 ‘ ‘Magazine of the Air’  scripts on file. Thankfully, some of his stories can still be heard on Saturday mornings in Cincinnati on WVXU–FM. Stan grew up  in Pleasant Ridge  in Cincinnati, was  a  graduate  of Withrow High School, and began his career as a newswriter in 1945 at WKRC–FM while a student at the University  of  Cincinnati.  He  switched  to WKRC–AM in 1946. He retired from WKRC– AM 29 years  later  in 1975, but returned  to broadcasting with stints at WLQA–AM  (now WRRM –AM) in 1976, and again with WKRC– AM in 1993. Stan ’s  influence on broadcasting  in Cincinnati was summed up by John Soller Sr., former general manager of WKRC–AM, who said, ‘ ‘He set the standard for excellence in radio here.’ Stan was devoted to his family, and is survived by his wife, Louise, and daughter, Anna. All of us in Cincinnati have suffered a great loss with Stan’s passing, just as we so benefitted from his full life. f ECONOMIC REVIVAL PLAN FOR AMERICA HON. PAUL RYAN OFWISCONSIN INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, September 25, 2001 ",2001
376,,107,0.556,165,2001-09-25,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker, I submit for the RECORDa letter to the President of the United States from a large number of reputable economists and public policy advocates who have  identified a pro-growth pro-jobs strategy to revive the U.S. economy. DEARMR. PRESIDENT. We, the undersigned, believe that quick and decisive action  is needed to rebuild the nation’s capital stock and restore economic growth. The economic slowdown that began in the middle of last year was perilously close to becoming a recession. But, because of what happened on September 11, what was a cause for concern is now a threat to national security. The terrorist attacks destroyed a significant amount of wealth and damaged the short-term  capability  of key  sectors  of America’s economy. Recovering from these despicable assaults will be a tremendous ordeal, but dealing with this challenge is only part of the problem. Equally important is the need to restore the economy’s overall performance. If America is to successfully wage war on terrorism, we will need the resources that only can be generated by an economy firing on all cylinders. This means substantial tax reform and significant tax rate reductions. We believe the core elements of an Economic Rebuilding and Recovery Package are: A shift toward ‘‘expensing’’ of business investment.  It  is counterproductive not  to allow companies to fully deduct the expense of investments in new factories, machines, structures, and technology. Replacing the current ‘‘depreciation’’ rules with immediate expensing—or at least a significant shift in that direction as contemplated in the HighProductivity Investment Act introduced in the US House of Representatives—will boost capital  formation  and  help  rebuild  the wealth destroyed by terrorists. ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ’ ’ ",2001
377,,107,0.421,4,2001-10-05,Mr. GOSS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, at the outset, let me thank the members of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, each and every one of them, both sides of the aisle, for their very hard work, especially over the past 3 weeks, which have been extremely trying for all of us and certainly for our committee. The hard work in the last 3 weeks have allowed us to get to this point where we have, I think, an excellent piece of authorization legislation to bring to the House. Mr. Chairman, we will hear  from many of our Members over the next hour. I would especially like to thank our ranking member, the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. PELOSI)  for extraordinary efforts  in ensuring  that our thorough review of the President’s budget put the good of the Nation first in a manner that has been truly bipartisan and, perhaps more appropriately, we should say nonbipartisan. There  are many  other  people  to thank, of course, including our amazing staff, and we will get to that by and by. b0930 Mr. Chairman, the bill before us is part of our normal annual authorization by which by law must be passed in order for the intelligence community to spend appropriated dollars. But the setting  in which we  find ourselves today as we debate the bill is hardly normal. Over the debate, we surely will hear several  references  to  the  infamous events of September 11 and the efforts to handle these and other types of threats  to Americans at home and abroad. There is no way to overemphasize the importance of the demoniacal acts we witnessed. They do bear tragic witness to how the world has changed and how critical it is to have knowledge about our  surroundings, about those who have made  it their  life’s quest to destroy American freedoms, rights  and  values. That knowledge CONGRESSIONAL RECORD—HOUSE October 5, 2001 comes from intelligence, pure and simple and we have to have it. No one can seriously doubt that we need the best possible intelligence to prosper and be safe at home and abroad in today’s world. There are some who believe that the September 11 terrorist acts were successful because of, quote, ‘‘intelligence failures.’’ I will certainly agree there are  intelligence community shortcomings, that must be reviewed and fixed. That is what we do. What went wrong relative to September 11 goes well beyond the intelligence community however. Moreover, those who have complaints often do not understand what threats we actually face today, what capabilities we really do have and do not have, and, more importantly, what vital distinctions exist between  intelligence and law enforcement and how we cope with those distinctions. The intelligence community operates overseas and  cannot arrest anyone. Law enforcement is domestic and does not do spying; and somehow we have to have a good marriage of the two. If we look back over the past 6 years worth of our authorizations, we will see that the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence have  consistently highlighted shortfalls and concerns calling on the administration to take action so that risks to our security could be reduced, not removed but reduced. Certainly our committee was stunned and deeply saddened by the events of September 11 as we all were. We were aware homeland America was vulnerable to terrorist attack of some type from some quarter, and we were and are aware of limitations of our intelligence system to provide specifics or better early warning or 100 percent guarantees. This bill again addresses ways  to overcome some of those  limitations. The solutions that get us the intelligence community that we need to protect our future must be new and it must be innovative. This bill starts us on that course while sending I think a good message  to  the administration about how to do it. We are working closely with  the  administration  to translate these ideas into real capabilities which will protect Americans. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2001

379,House,107,0.129,25,2001-10-05,Mr. SHAYS.," Mr. Chairman, during my service in Congress, I have consistently opposed agricultural welfare programs. This Farm Bill, for  the most part,  represents business-asusual for our nation’s heavily-subsidized farmers. It ’s unfortunate to know that at a time of such advances  in every other area of our lives, our agriculture sector has all the sophistication of a Soviet commune. But there is something to smile about, because this Farm Bill contains one vital reform: the abolition of the federal peanut quota program. This program is truly a relic of the Great Depression, and today it’s put on notice that its days are numbered. The General Accounting Office has  found the peanut program provides substantial benefits to a small number of producers who hold most of the quota, restricts peanut production by other  farmers, and  increases consumer costs by between $300 million and $500 million annually. For years,  I’ve had a hard  time understanding why  our  government  favors  one group of American peanut farmers— those who own quotas— over other American  farmers who don’t own  this privilege. This program harms so many for the benefit of such a select few. My partner  in  reform, Congressman PAUL KANJORSKI, and I have always maintained that it was not our intention to pull the rug out from under our nation’s peanut farmers. Rather, our goal has always been to bring peanuts in line with other commodities, and the legislation we introduced replaced quota restrictions with the same non-recourse  loan system enjoyed by other commodities. Some of my colleagues may be concerned with the Farm Bill’s approach, which shifts the burden from consumers to taxpayers. I agree this compromise isn’t perfect, but it does meet two essential criteria we’ve set for reform. First, and most  important,  it repeals the quota system. This is the key to making the peanut industry more market-oriented, providing a  level playing  field  for  farmers, and promoting international trade. Second, as GAO confirmed in correspondence  I will submit  for  the  record,  this bill ‘Would essentially bring the peanut program in line with other commodity programs.’ Why is this important? Because taking peanuts off a separate track will ultimately make it easier  to enact  future reforms.  It also exposes  the hidden costs of  the existing program by putting it ‘ ‘on the books.’ There are still some concerns I have with what we’re accomplishing today. First, this legislation compensates quota holders  for  the loss of  their asset, which  I must confess  I think is fair. While those of us who want reform are willing to accept this provision, it is only under the understanding that the Chairman shares our commitment  to  let  it expire after five years specified in this bill. Second, at a cost of $3.5 billion over 10 years,  these reforms will come at some expense. With a rapidly shrinking budget surplus and tremendous needs in other areas, we are going to have to reexamine whether this is the best use of taxpayers’ dollars. Finally, I’m concerned about findings by the GAO  that several of  the new subsidies  for peanuts may be identified as ‘ trade distorting’ under the 1994 Uruguay Round of trade talks. If we expect other nations to lower their trade barriers, we need to ensure we’re not erecting barriers of our own. Mr. Chairman, during the course of debate on this bill, I’m going to continue to express reservations about our overall agriculture policy. But at this moment, I want to commend the Chairman of  the Agriculture Committee, Mr. COMBEST, for bringing us closer that we’ve ever been to ending the Byzantine system of price supports for peanuts. I would also request unanimous consent to submit for the CONGRESSIONALRECORDa September 26 letter from the General Accounting Office reviewing the peanut title of this Farm Bill. UNITEDSTATESGENERALACCOUNTING OFFICE, Washington, DC, September 26, 2001. Hon. CHRISTOPHERSHAYS, House of Representatives. Hon. PAULE. KANJORSKI, House of Representatives. Subject Peanut Program: Potential Effects of Proposed Farm Bill on Producers, Consumers, Government, and Peanut  Imports and Exports. The current federal peanut program, administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is designed to support producers’  incomes while ensuring an ample supply of domestically produced peanuts. To accomplish these goals, the program controls the domestic supply of peanuts and guarantees producers a minimum price for their crops. This price substantially exceeds the price of peanuts in world markets. The program uses two mechanisms to control the domestic supply of peanuts: (1) a national quota on the number of pounds that can be sold for edible consumption domestically and (2)  import restrictions. While anyone can grow peanuts, only producers holding quota, either through ownership or rental of farmland, may sell their peanuts domestically, as ‘‘quota’’ peanuts. Generally, all other production, referred to as ‘‘additional’’ peanuts, must be exported or crushed for oil and meal.

380,,107,-0.328,46,2001-10-05,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker, as our economy enters a period of great uncertainty, Congress can take at least one step that will protect the families most  imperiled  by mounting  job losses, while simultaneously stimulating consumer demand and economic growth. In short, we should  improve our unemployment compensation (UC) system. Expanding, extending and supplementing UC coverage will put more money into the pockets of the families most affected by economic dislocations and most likely to spend quickly. I am  therefore  introducing  the Temporary Unemployment Compensation Act to improve our Nation’s response to rising unemployment levels. The bill would draw down funds from the  federal unemployment accounts  for one year to: (1) provide benefits to certain unemployed workers who are now not covered by the Unemployment Compensation system; (2) extend  benefits  by  13 weeks  to workers whose regular UC has expired; and (3) supplement the amount of unemployment benefits. Over  the next  year,  these provisions would provide UC benefits to over one million jobless Americans who otherwise would go without any assistance, they would extend UC coverage  to  roughly  3 million  individuals whose regular benefits have expired, and they would increase the amount of unemployment payments to 9 million displaced workers. With new  claims  for unemployment benefits  recently  reaching  their highest  level  in nine years, it is imperative that Congress and the Administration consider  these reforms  in  the quickest possible time frame. Any effort  to  improve our unemployment system must start with  the  recognition  that many  dislocated workers,  particularly  lowwage workers, do not receive assistance from the current system when they are laid off. The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported last December that while low-wage workers were twice as  likely  to become unemployed,  they were only half as likely to receive UC benefits compared to higher-wage workers, even when employed for similar periods of time. The GAO cited  the  fact  that only 18% of unemployed lowwage workers were receiving Ul benefits compared  to 40% of higher-wage workers. This problem may track a general reduction in the percentage of unemployed Americans who actually receive UC benefits (which has declined over the last few decades from about one-half to about one-third). Over the last few years, Congress has received repeated recommendations  to correct this situation. Groups suggesting changes include: the Advisory Council on Unemployment Compensation, which was jointly appointed by Congress and  the President;  the Committee for Economic Development, which  is  led by leaders  in business and academia; and a group of state,  federal, business and  labor stakeholders in the UC system. All of these organizations highlighted  two  issues  that must be addressed. First,  too many unemployed workers are denied UC because their most recent wages are not counted. (Many States do not count the last completed quarter of work). And second, part-time workers are sometimes discriminated against  in  the UC system. To begin to address these inequities, the TUC Act would provide  federally-funded UC coverage for one year to jobless workers who would be otherwise  ineligible because  their  last completed quarter of employment was not  included  in  their wage  record, and  to unemployed workers seeking part-time employment. As unemployment creeps up, it becomes increasing difficult  for dislocated workers  to quickly find new jobs. For this reason, Congress also should consider increasing the duration of unemployment benefits, particularly since  the current  law provision providing an extension of benefits has proven ineffective. In fact, since 1983, only 12 States have triggered on to the current Extended Benefits (EB) program. Because changes  to  the existing EB program  would  demand  time-consuming changes to many State’s laws, this legislation would establish a new,  temporary program that would provide an additional 13 weeks of benefits to individuals whose regular UC expires. Like the coverage for certain newly eligible workers, these extended benefits would be federally-funded and would continue requirements that recipients seek work. One final area that deserves attention is the adequacy of UC benefits. Unemployment benefits generally  replace 50% or  less of  lost wages, leaving many workers hard-pressed to meet  their monthly bills. This  is particularly true in many urban and suburban areas where housing costs have exceeded  inflation over the  last decade. Furthermore, many States have relatively low average and maximum UC payment rates (the average weekly UC payment  in  the US  is about $230). Finally, UC wage replacement rates were never adjusted to account  for  the  fact  that unemployment benefits were made fully taxable in 1986. This tax  policy was  enacted  to  ensure  equity among families with the same amount income but  from different sources. However,  it has had  the effect of reducing  the value of UC benefits by about 15%. Therefore, to restore the value of unemployment benefits, while also maintaining equity in the tax code, this legislation would increase every UC recipient’s weekly check by 15% for the next year. Mr. Speaker, we have over $38 billion in the Federal Unemployment Trust Funds. Those reserves are designed just for this purpose— responding  to  rising  unemployment. We should spend a portion of those funds to help Americans  face  the uncertainties and hardships  that come with  increased  joblessness. The Temporary Unemployment Compensation Act will put those monies to good use by expanding, extending and increasing unemployment coverage just when it is needed most. Thank you. f A TRIBUTE TO MARY R. WRIGHT HON. SAM FARR OFCALIFORNIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, October 4, 2001 ",2001

It  is also necessary  to pause,  reflect, and honor  the over 300  fire service personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of public safety on the 11th. Remembering  the events  that  transpired on the 11th conjure up horrific images, but also images that inspire— images of true dedication to others, devotion to duty and bonafide heroism. It also triggers memories of a fire-service veteran and true hero from my congressional district— Walter G. Morrison— an  individual who would have, without equivocation, been nowhere other than at ground ‘ ‘0’  assisting victims on that fateful day. Walter died on July 18, 1981, in the line of duty— selflessly attempting  to help others. A  fire and civil defense coordinator  in Otsego County, Walter also served as Chief of the Fly Creek Fire Department, a board member of the Central New York Firemen’s Association, and Secretary of the New York State Fire Service Council. Walter exemplified the fire service and all it stands for. He was 46. Today,  it  is  fitting  that he, along with four of his fellow firefighters from the great state of New York, and numerous others  from around  the nation, have  their names permanently etched upon the National Fallen Firefighters monument in Emmittsburg, Maryland for all to see and remember. It is our duty— our responsibility to never forget that it is people much like Walter— a neighbor; a colleague; an friend; a father; a son; a brother; a mother; willingly placing themselves in danger for you— for all of us. f DISPLACED WORKERS’ RELIEF HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD OFCALIFORNIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Friday, October 5, 2001 Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, on September 21, Congress approved  the Air Transportation Stabilization Act to provide $15 billion  to help stabilize our nation’s airlines, save  jobs and moderate  the negative economic  impact of  the September 11 attack. Helping our ailing aviation industry was important; helping the workers affected by the economic impact of this national tragedy is equally as important. Over 100,000 people who worked in the airline industry have become unemployed as a result of the terrorist attacks, and even more are expected to lose their jobs in the future. If Congress does not act quickly, these men and women will be unable to pay for the necessities of  life, such as  food and rent. These workers need help now. I encourage  the  leadership  to work with Democrats, who have a plan  to provide retraining programs, health insurance, and unemployment benefits to displaced workers and their families. This proposal will give critically needed assistance now, while providing workers with the tools necessary to find new employment and rebuild long term economic security for themselves and their families. I supported the Air Transportation Stabilization Act not only because  it was needed  to help stabilize the airline industry and our economy, but also because congressional leaders committed to quickly bring forth legislation to address the needs of displaced workers, who deserve the same attention and quick action Congress gave  to  the aviation  industry. The time has come to make good on that promise. f FARM SECURITY ACT OF 2001 SPEECHOF HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON OFTEXAS INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, October 4, 2001 The House  in Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2646) to provide for  the continuation of agricultural programs through fiscal year 2011: Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas, Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to provide $25 million for child nutrition programs. These programs provide funding for our nation’s schools to purchase commodities for  their National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. The National School Lunch Program serves more than 27 million children every day, slightly over half to children who live at or near the poverty level in this country. More than 85% of the 7 million breakfast served in schools each day go  to poor children. For  these children, our  federal school meal programs are  their most secure link to good nutrition. These commodity food programs also allow school districts to offset the costs of lunches for children who do not participate in the program. In essence,  these programs benefit  the child  receiving the free or reduced cost meal as well as the child who pays full price. Research has confirmed a link between nutrition and children’s cognitive development, cognitive performance, and ability  to  concentrate. Preschool and school age children need to receive proper and adequate nutrition. Studies also show that those nutiritonal programs have contributed positively to scores on test of basic skills, reduced tardiness and absenteeism. Also clear  is  the  link between our  federal nutrition programs and our agricultural communities. The United States began providing agricultural commodities to our schools more than a decade before we started grants in aid to schools to provide meals, and three decades before we recognized the special needs of our poorest children through the free and reduced price meal subsidies. In 1994, Congress amended the National Lunch Act to require that at lease 12% of all federal support for schools meals must be in the form in commodities. However,  in 1998  the Congress again amended the National School Lunch Act to count bonus commodities,  food products purchased under separate authorizations and for a very different purpose, to meet the 12% statutory requirement. While some thought this ’ ",2001
382,House,107,0.221,128,2001-10-11,Mr. REGULA.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I have just two things. I would like to read from the Administration letter. It says: ‘‘The Administration appreciates that the House has retained the current  language provision concerning Federal  funding  for needle  exchange  programs  and  the Hyde language regarding the Federal funding of abortions.’’ So I want to make clear that this is the same language as has been in the past. I also want to point out that we do have now the statement of administration policy. It has been coordinated by OMB with all the agencies, and it is a good statement supporting the provisions of this bill. So it truly is a bipartisan bill. It has the support of the leadership on the other side of the aisle and it has the support of our leadership and the support of the White House. I would urge when we get to the final vote, that all the Members of this body support it. It is truly, as Mr. Natcher used to say, a people’s bill. ",2001
383,House,107,0.492,135,2001-10-11,Mr. ISTOOK.," Mr. Chairman, I wish to be heard. The  CHAIRMAN.  The  gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized. ",2001
384,House,107,0.449,149,2001-10-11,Mr. TIAHRT.," Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this amendment to increase IDEA funding by more than $1 billion. Year after year we pass resolutions asserting  Congress’s  commitment  to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act. Many of our fellow colleagues join with me at this podium and assert our responsibility to live up to our promise to our school districts. We declare that the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act is the highest priority among Federal elementary and  secondary education programs,  the highest priority. Yet year after year, we increase funding for other programs that are less vital to our local school districts. My home State of Kansas can expect to see about one-fourth of the promised $69 million this year for IDEA mandates. Anyone who has spoken with school officials in their district knows that this is inadequate. While school districts are  forced to rob Peter  in order to pay Paul to meet IDEA mandates at the expense of both children with and without disabilities, Congress has increased funding for Department of Education programs that I consider are not vital to our children’s education. I do not know how many Members have toured special education  facilities. I have. I have toured Levy Special Education Center in Wichita, Kansas, and seen the special education children. I have met with special education teachers and listened to their frustration about the lack of funding, combined with the burden of increased paperwork. Twenty-five years ago with the passage of IDEA, the Federal Government mandated that our  local school systems educate all children, even those with severe mental and physical disabilities. IDEA has placed an extreme financial burden on our public schools which could be partially alleviated by keeping our commitment to fully fund the 40 percent of the program, the 40 percent originally promised. To not do so we are  completely  ignoring  the needs of our local school districts. I challenge my fellow colleagues to live up to our responsibility and support  the  effort  today  to put more money in IDEA. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. ",2001
385,House,107,0.351,163,2001-10-11,Mr. HAYES.," Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, let me say that the last time I checked, the item before this Congress at the moment was the Labor-HHS bill.  I  totally and  thoroughly disagree with the gentleman’s characterization of the activity of this Congress. Twenty-four hours a day, 7 days a week for the last 30 days we have been working very hard to deal with the issues that he says we are ignoring. Back to the bill. I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. REGULA) and to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY)  for their consideration  in  increasing spending  for a very crucial issue, which  is abstinence-until-marriage funding. I do not know of too many things  from a security standpoint that is any more important than the health of our young people today. As we look at ways to increase the funding which will improve health conditions for our young people, I appreciate their concern, their approval of the funds; and I hope if this is not the right place, I am sure that my colleagues will find the right place to do this. In North Carolina we have a law that we worked very, very hard in a bipartisan fashion to pass; and that law says that we will have in our health education  curriculum  that  abstinence until marriage is the expected standard of behavior. Young people, teenagers in particular, are very, very bright. They respond to proper leadership and good examples. If we tell them that this promiscuous behavior is going to happen, they cannot make the right choices, and  then offer  them  contraceptives which have a 20 percent failure rate, we have not done our duty. We have not protected our young people. But if we say to them, abstinence until marriage is the healthy way to 100 percent provide protection  from sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies, then I say to my colleagues, we have done our job. So I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. ISTOOK) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. REGULA) and the gentleman  from Wisconsin  (Mr. OBEY) for their attention to this matter. I commend the amendment, I support it very strongly, and I would love to work with my colleagues in any way to make sure we make this happen. By the way, the President in a recent letter does support funding at the $73 million level. ",2001
386,House,107,-0.529,170,2001-10-11,Mr. HONDA.," Mr. Chairman, what I have is going to take a little bit more than the time allotted. It is interesting in this country, in America, we talk about diversity and understanding. We also talk about inclusion rather than exclusion. This amendment  is exclusionary. What the executive order does from 1964, as the gentleman had explained, was that this is fine-tuning, and people need direction. As an administrator myself, when I take a law, an administrative regulation, the right to be able to extend it even further is our prerogative. That is probably what  that department did when you read that memo. That is all about  service. That  is about client service. We in this office, we in our jobs, we understand client service and we want to extend ourselves the best that we can. The real point of this in terms of language is comprehension. If you do not have comprehension, you are not going to be able to take medicine properly. You are not going to be able to understand things properly. As an educator, comprehensive input is key. ",2001
387,House,107,-0.33,184,2001-10-11,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s remarks. I hope people understand, this is not the only security issue that we are concerned about; it is one of many. Perhaps it is the most glaring omission in our entire security system, but there are many that we need to make sure of. That is a package that we should have been voting on tonight. Instead of just talking about it, we should have been talking about a security package to increase security at our borders. We have had a porous border, both north and south. We now are trying to improve it, and as a result, we have lines that are 5 hours long for honest citizens to try to get across the Canadian border. This is killing the economics both of Canada and the State of Washington. Instead of putting on additional security personnel and funding that out of our  general  funds, we  are  arguing about all these other things here instead of  security. We need  to  talk about border security. It should be part of our stimulus package; not just $60 billion as a tax cut for corporations, but let us talk about security. Public health. We know, and this is hardly a secret, that we are not where we should be and can be in dealing with biological and chemical threats in the United States. Our people are concerned about that. We do not want to be overly concerned. We want to respond in a rational, confident way of developing a public health system that can give Americans confidence that we can deal with this type of threat. We are not there yet. But instead of proposing and giving us a vote on a security measure that will significantly increase our ability to respond to bioterrorism and chemical threats, we are going to see a stimulus package with $60 to $120 billion more tax cuts. I have to tell the Members, when I go home  to Edmonds  and Bainbridge, Washington, people are coming up to me and saying,  ‘‘Jay, what are you going to do about bioterrorism and making sure my airplane does not get blown out of the sky?’’ That is what they are asking me to do. That is what we should be doing. We have been here for 30 days since this terrible attack and we have not had a chance to vote. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. STRICKLAND) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. JACKSON) and myself, we have not had a chance to vote. This is our job. The Speaker, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HASTERT), who has done I think a great job trying to help us find unity in the first several weeks since this tragedy, I think he has been very sincere in trying to find bipartisan consensus, and we have had other Republicans support us on this security effort. But somewhere in there somebody is blocking bipartisanship here. We are very hopeful that the gentleman from Illinois (Speaker HASTERT) will be successful in an effort to free these security measures for a vote on this floor. We need to have a bipartisan vote, because I think we are going to pass these things. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. STRICKLAND). ",2001
388,House,107,-0.538,184,2001-10-11,Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I just want to congratulate the gentleman for his noble efforts on behalf of the American people. My wife and my 18-month old daughter are enormously grateful  for the gentleman’s efforts, and I am sure all of us who have family members, as much as Members of Congress travel, are very greatful for the gentleman’s efforts. But  for the millions of Americans whom many of us have never met and still do not know, in the gentleman from Washington  (Mr.  they have the kind of leadership on the floor of the Congress that is thinking about them and that is going to make a significant difference. ",2001
389,Senate,107,-0.326,205,2001-10-11,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Reserving the right to object, this amendment, as I understand it, is the first amendment that will be unrelated to the bill. I don’t want  to  comment  further on that. We are going to have our cloture vote at 1:35. I object, at least for this period of time. ",2001
390,,107,-0.276,1,2001-10-18,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, as has been  ordered, this morning the Senate will  be in a period of morning business until  10:30 a.m. At  10:30,  the Senate will  begin consideration of the conference  report to accompany the Military Construction Appropriations Act. There  will be 30 minutes of debate equally divided between Senators HUTCHISON of  Texas and Senator FEINSTEIN. The vote  on adoption of the conference report  will occur at 11 a.m.  I have been asked by the majority  leader to announce this will be the last  rollcall vote of the day.  ",2001
391,Senate,107,-0.318,8,2001-10-18,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, to wrap  up briefly, we have tried for 18 months  to bring the parties together. For example, I proposed—in spite of the fact  that I see absolutely no evidence that  any  jurisdiction  in this country has  been hurt by their inability to impose  discriminatory taxes, I proposed, over  the opposition of many  in business,  that when the mayors and Governors  have a proposal that is ready to go,  they be given an opportunity to have a  vote in the Congress, an opportunity to  vote on a proposal of their choosing.  So I have clearly gone to considerable lengths to try to be sensitive to  the concerns of mayors and Governors.  I hope we will continue the effort to  try to bring the parties together.  I was not aware there was going to be  an effort to proceed to this bill by UC  today, otherwise there would have been  many colleagues, who share my view  and support the legislation I offered  with Congressman COX that passed 98  to 2 in this Chamber, to support those  positions to carry on this debate. The  only way we are going to get this done  is to bring the parties together.  I point out finally with respect to the  time period, the National Conference of  State Legislatures, known as NCSL,  said  recently  they wanted a  4-year  moratorium  because  they were not  ready, from a technological standpoint,  to advance the solutions that would address this issue without putting burdens on out-of-state sellers.  We  are  dealing with  an  extraordinarily  important  issue. The  technology sector has been very hard hit,  as all of our colleagues know. The last  thing they need  is to be shellacked  with discriminatory taxes. There are  more than 7,600 taxing jurisdictions in  this country. If you are talking about  overturning the Quill case, which  is  what this debate is all about, which  says that you cannot impose taxes unless there is physical presence in a particular jurisdiction—a case I strongly  support—you are dealing with very serious matters with respect to the economy of this country.  I would like to see us go back to the  way we tried to deal with this for the  last 18 months, which was in a conciliatory way, trying to bring the parties  together. Starting Monday, there is an  opportunity for considerable economic  mischief. Fortunately, only four State  legislatures are in session right now,  but there is an opportunity for considerable economic mischief.  The legislation that Senator MCCAIN  and I have advanced on a bipartisan  basis provides the framework to proceed, but Senator Enzi, who has been  very  constructive on  this  issue  for  quite some time now, has made for me  and others a copy of another proposal  he has. I assure him and those with  whom he is working that we will look  at it very carefully and work with him.  I yield the floor.  ",2001
392,Senate,107,-0.231,8,2001-10-18,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I had  not intended to speak this morning,  but I arrived in the midst of the discussion of an issue which I think is very  central to our federalist system of government. The Nation depends upon our  States and local governments to deliver some of the most basic services  that protect the security and advance  the well-being of our people and our  Nation as a whole.  We just had a dramatic demonstration of that with what happened after  September 11. While there were a number of Federal personnel involved, the  front line, the first responders, the people who lost their lives in the collapse  of those buildings serving the public interest were largely employees of State  and local governments.  We know, and we all applaud the importance of education for the future of  our Nation. That is predominantly a  State and local responsibility. What we  are talking about today is the capacity  of State and local governments to have  sufficient control of their sources of  revenue to continue to provide those  very services.  While the current law, as the Senator  from Oregon has correctly stated, focuses on prohibiting the States from  adopting discriminatory tax systems  that will single out and adversely affect distance sellers, particularly those  who sell over the Internet, the fact is  there is another form of discrimination, and that is the discrimination between the Main Street retail seller and  that distant seller.  The discrimination is that in times  past, we have adopted a philosophy  that said in order for a State to require  a seller to collect its sales tax, there  had to be a physical presence of that  seller within the State. That was a  concept that made sense in a previous  era, but that era has passed.  We just passed a major antiterrorism  bill, and one of the basic changes we  made had to do with wiretaps. Our  wiretap law was basically written for  the old rotary phone. It proved to be  inadequate to deal with the issues of  the cellular phone, computer communication, and all the things with which  we are now familiar and in daily personal use.  The  same economic and  technical  changes that have caused the Congress  to reevaluate its concept of what it  takes to fight terrorism have affected  the way in which commerce is delivered in America.  We now have a situation where if you  sell the same book at a retail store on  Main Street, that seller is obligated to  collect the sales tax of the State and  local jurisdictions that might be imposed on that book. If you buy the  identical book over the Internet, there  is no obligation to collect sales tax.  I do not think that is a defensible differentiation, and the practical effect of  that is going to be over time to erode  the competitive position of the Main  Street seller, and through that erosion  also affect the ability to properly finance our police, fire, and education  systems that are so critical to the  functioning of our Nation.

393,House,107,0.739,33,2001-11-07,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, the necessity of passing H.R. 3005, a bill to renew trade promotion authority,  is epitomized by the experience of Caterpillar, headquartered in my home State of Illinois.  Caterpillar’s motor  graders made for export to Chile face nearly $15,000  in  tariffs. Caterpillar motor graders manufactured in Brazil for export to Chile face a tariff of only $3,700. And when Caterpillar’s  competitors produced the same product in Canada, it can be exported to Chile free of tariffs because of the Canada-Chile free trade agreement. Caterpillar employees in Illinois are forced to watch as workers  in  other  countries  provide products to our neighbors. Mr. Speaker, while other countries are making preferential trade deals, we are sitting on the sidelines lacking the authority to negotiate. Make no mistake, our foreign competitors have this authority, and they use it to their advantage. Of the more than 130  free trade agreements in force today, the U.S. is party to only three. Trade works for America. Let us pass H.R. 3005 and keep America’s economy growing. f AFTEREFFECTS OF SEPTEMBER 11 TRAGEDY The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. OSBORNE). Under  the Speaker’s  announced policy of January 3, 2001, the gentlewoman  from Texas  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I do have an opportunity now to speak with a sense of appreciation as well as a sense of questioning. Many of us have come to the floor of the House in the weeks after September 11 to raise many issues to help heal this Nation or to help solve the crisis that was created. I am never far from thinking of the enormous loss of life that occurred on September 11. For that reason, I believe that there is certainly never enough commentary and solutions that could be offered to help heal us from September 11. b1730 We, of course, have been told to get on with our lives, to go about our business as Americans, to not be intimidated by the terrorist acts, and I would add something else, to not turn, if you will, into the kind of people who would perpetrate hatred so deep that it would take innocent lives. I am very gratified Americans have not done any of that, that there is a great deal of charitableness, there is a great deal of desire to be involved in how we can be problem solvers. For that reason, I see it fitting that we continue doing our work in the United States Congress to be problem solvers. So to my colleagues tonight, I believe there is a degree of work that is yet undone, and we must keep busy to help  solve  these problems. There  is work undone with respect to airline security, Federal security,  federalizing the airline security in our airports. We have yet to address the approximately 5.4 percent unemployment, the surge in unemployment, the many industries that have been hit so hard because of the tragedy of September 11, such as the tourist  industry, hotels, hospitality, those particular employees, and many others. I was riding on a plane with a constituent who said that an accounting firm had laid off 400 workers. Every day we are finding different industries that  are  being  impacted  from  the events of September 11. Is American going about its business? Yes. Americans are cheered and buoyed by their values, and they are committed to the wonderfulness of this Nation. I also see the effort by Americans to draw closer together, as diverse as this Nation is, from the many walks of life and many ethnic backgrounds that our citizens have come from, and I have seen a renewed zealousness around our values, our songs, our spirit, our charitableness; and  it has been done not with any particular negativeness. We have overcome or maybe we have spoken about or spoken out against the idea of targeting any particular group. We have joined together to say that this is not a fight against Islam, this is not a fight against the Muslims, but clearly what this is is to recognize that we  are  standing  against  terrorism. That is why we acknowledge the fact that September 11, 2001, left thousands of victims from around the world. The attacks killed hundreds from Britain, from Israel, 250 from India, and scores of others from Japan, Mexico, Iran and elsewhere. As I have said previously and as the mayor of New York City has said, these attacks were crimes against all humanity, and much of it was more than any of us could bear. But I think as we look at our challenges and before  this Congress  recesses this year, there is still work to be done. As chair of the Congressional Children’s Caucus, I am very gratified that we will have an opportunity to debate H. Con. Res. 228 on the floor, and I would like to thank my colleagues for VerDate 06-NOV-2001 01:07 Nov 08, 2001 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07NO7.088 pfrm04 PsN: H07PT1 ",2001

LEE HARTWELL HON. JAY INSLEE OFWASHINGTON INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 7, 2001 ",2001
395,,107,-0.33,124,2001-11-07,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to pay very special tribute to a truly outstanding individual from Seattle, Washington. On October 8, 2001, Dr. Lee Hartwell, president and director of  the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2001  for his pioneering work in yeast genetics. Dr. Hartwell’s three-decade devotion to the study of and his insight into yeast cells provide the foundation for understanding how normal cells divide and  the mechanisms  leading  to the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. He has consistently contributed experimental and theoretical  insights. Thanks  to Dr. Hartwell’s groundbreaking efforts, scientists have a fundamental understanding of how cancer cells mutate. This research is allowing the development of approaches that predict, prevent or reverse that mutation so that someday we can develop cancer cures. Today,  the yeast  related  research of Dr. Hartwell and his colleagues is being used at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to develop drugs for use against cancer and other diseases. Dr. Hartwell is a man of great accomplishment. After earning B.S. at the California Institute of Technology and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, he did postdoctoral work at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. In 1968 he joined the University of Washington’s faculty and, since 1973, has been a professor of genetics at that institution. He joined the faculty of Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in 1996 and became its president and director in 1997. Dr. Hartwell is the recipient of many honors including the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award, the Gairdner Foundation International Award and the Alfred P. Sloan Award in cancer research. The 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is the ultimate recognition of his life’s work. I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Dr. Lee Hartwell, a man whose dedication and achievements are a credit  to  the State of Washington,  our  country,  and  indeed  the world. f A TRIBUTE TO ELIE WIESEL ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RECENT ARTICLE IN ‘‘PARADE’’ WITH REGARD TO TERRORISM AND RESISTANCE HON. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN OFNEWYORK INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 7, 2001 ",2001
396,,107,0.043,124,2001-11-07,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  the evil, despicable, barbaric terrorist acts that are still producing fear among the people of our country— and the tragic scale of which we still have not fully realized— were not motivated by the zeal we usually associate with  individual acts of crime. These acts were not committed with the purpose of enrichment. They are not  logical responses to America’s actions, real or imagined, abroad. Rather, they were the result of a kind of deep hatred  towards our  freedom loving life style and our proud democratic traditions. This hatred  is almost  incomprehensible  to the modern mind. As my good friend author Elie Wiesel has  recently eloquently pointed out, the terrorism we have until now experienced is only the tip of the iceberg. If the terrorists could, they would take us all out. Their hatred is an all-encompassing drive to deprive mankind of freedom and safety. The terrorists do not intend to stop halfway. Elie Wiesel,  the holder of numerous academic  titles,  recipient of many distinguished honors and awards— among them the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1986— and author of several world renowned books, was only fifteen years old when he and his  family were deported by  the Nazis  to  the Aushwitz concentration camp. His mother and younger sister perished while only his  two older sisters survived. He wrote about his experiences in the death camps  in his  internationally acclaimed memoir, ‘ ‘Night,’  and in 1978, President Jimmy Carter appointed him as Chairman of  the President’s Commission on  the Holocaust. A dedicated supporter of Israel, Elie Wiesel has also seen  it as his duty  to defend  the causes of various persecuted minority groups. For this reason, in 1986 along with his wife, Marion Wiesel, he established the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. Through his indefatigable efforts Mr. Wiesel has continuously reminded us of our duty to hold life sacred, to honor liberty, fairness and peace and to resist fanaticism  in whatever shape we might encounter it.

397,House,107,-0.429,33,2001-11-14,Ms. BROWN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, Monday’s plane crash was another devastating blow to the residents of New York and the citizens of this great Nation. Although we do not know the cause yet, I have been hearing it called a routine plane crash. God help us all if we ever accept a plane crash as routine. I was in New York Monday and had to take the train back to D.C. I was talking to the train conductor who said that the U.S. lawmakers have failed the American people. This is what our citizens think of this Congress. How many planes must go down before we truly deal with the safety issue? Not just who screened the baggage, but the safety of the entire transportation infrastructure,  including  ports,  rails, bridges, tunnels, and maybe after yesterday, more safety inspectors for airplanes. Does this Congress have to wait until another disaster strikes again to act to protect our transportation infrastructure? Mr. Speaker, we do not want the American people to feel that we have failed them. I do not hold much hope, but I ask the conferees to support the Senate version of the airline security bill so we can move on to other areas of homeland security. There is something that the American public needs to know. At this very moment, American flight schools are training pilots  from countries  sponsoring terrorism. All those terrorists need to do is pay in cash, and those schools will teach them anything they need to know. Preventing those with ill intent  from  acquiring  flight  skills, which they can use in a hijacking, is just as important if not more important as other issues being addressed in this legislation. It saddens me to know that the terrorists accused of these hideous acts on September  11  received  their  flight training at Florida flight schools. Obviously, current law regulating who may receive  training  and what kind  of training they receive  is  insufficient.

Mr. Speaker, the difference between the two propositions that are advanced in the House, already passed the House and that which they are working in the Senate, in the other body they are saying, let us show you what we can do for our friends with your money. What the House said was, let us see what you can do  for yourselves  if you keep your money. I think we have addressed America in the appropriate way. And finally it is said, Mr. Speaker, that a recession is when your neighbor is out of a job. A depression is when you are out of a job. Well, everyone in this legislative body on both  sides of  the building have neighbors out of jobs. We are the only ones of their neighbors that they can say, if you do your job right, I am get my job back. They have a right to expect that of us. And we have an obligation to understand, if we do our job wrong and they do not get their job back, we will have a depression. f HATE CRIMES IN AMERICA The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr. FORBES).

408,Senate,107,-0.212,54,2001-11-14,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I understand that later in the day a point of order will be made against the bill under section 205 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2001. The essence of the point of order will be to challenge the emergency designation contained in section 908 of the bill. I am not sure whether that is the correct ruling. It is debatable. But my expectation is the Parliamentarian will rule that the bill  is subject to the Budget Act for that reason. My view, however, is that the point of order should be waived. Why? Because the bill clearly responds to an emergency.  Indeed, my  good  friend from Kentucky  just said: We are at war. He said: Let’s get moving now. Let’s pass a good stimulus bill. I don’t want to put words  in the mouth of my  friend  from Kentucky, but certainly he believes—and the rest of the Members of this body believe— that there is a very great need for us to act extremely quickly. We also know that many people are in very difficult straits, not to mention the huge tragedy of the thousands of people who were killed in the trade towers which were destroyed, the Pentagon destruction,  the anthrax  scares, other  terrorism scares in the country. We need to move quickly.  If that  is not an emergency, I am hard pressed to say what  is. There may be other emergencies that are even greater. I will not dispute that point. But this clearly is an emergency, too. These are not ordinary times. We are in a different era. It is very difficult. Let me provide a bit of information. When legislation is considered in the Senate, there are very strict rules to enforce budgetary discipline, as there should be. The embodiment of these rules is the annual budget resolution which is debated every spring. We have updates and so forth, but essentially we have a long debate on the budget resolution. The debate allows the Congress to look at all of its needs—taxes and spending—and construct a budget blueprint for the coming year. It is a guess, an anticipation, an estimate of what we will need for the coming year. The budget resolution sets a floor for revenues and ceilings for spending. And there are points of order that can be made against any legislation which reduces the revenues below the floor or increases spending above one of the ceilings. These points of order can only be waived with 60 votes. That is how the budget  resolution  is  enforced. But, wisely, there is a safety valve. We cannot with certainty predict the future. Thank goodness. If Congress and the President agree that there is an unforeseen emergency that requires legislation that cuts taxes or raises spending, then there is a safety valve for getting the legislation enacted. The safety valve is simple. Congress must include language in the legislation which designates that the legislation is being enacted to cope with an emergency. Then the points of order enforcing the revenue floor and spending ceilings become inoperative. That makes sense. In an emergency, for the good of the country, we may need to respond in a way that was not contemplated when we wrote the budget resolution. But there is one final hurdle to face. In the Senate, the language in the bill that designates the legislation as an emergency is itself subject to a point of order. If the point of order is raised and there are not 60 votes to waive it, then the language designating the legislation as an emergency is deleted from the bill. This is very serious because without the emergency designation in the bill, the entire bill would be subject to a point of order that can only be waived by 60 votes. In that case, the entire bill can be killed with the votes of only 41 Senators. So it is important to keep the emergency designation in the legislation. Having presented the background, let me explain how the budget process unfolded this year. The budget resolution for this year, fiscal year 2002, was considered  in the spring, many months ago. It was passed in early May. We voted on it in this body. At that time the economy was not too strong, but it did not appear to be facing an emergency. The economy had grown at a rate of 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of  the previous year, calendar year 2000. It grew at a slower rate, 1.2 percent, in the first quarter of 2001. These are somewhat weak growth rates, but they are not terrible ones. Manufacturing was hurting. May was the 10th consecutive month of job loss in manufacturing, but the national unemployment rate was still only 4.2 percent. American consumers were not in a downturn. Retail sales had grown at a 5.2-percent rate in the first quarter of this year and were continuing to grow at the same rate, 5.2 percent, in the second quarter this year. So the view at the time, at the time the budget resolution was passed, was that the economy needed a boost in fiscal year 2001, which ended on October 1, but the economy should be doing nicely as we progressed through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2002. It needed a short-term  boost. But most  of  us thought—the  economists  thought, most  people who  spend  their  lives thinking about these things thought— that in the first two quarters of next year, January through the end of June, we would be doing a little better. The budget resolution that we passed last May made room for an $85 billion tax cut during the remainder of fiscal year 2001. This meant there were no 60vote points of order  that could be raised against a bill containing an $85 billion tax cut in that fiscal year. In contrast,  the budget  resolution made room for a smaller stimulus in fiscal year 2002 because there was an expectation that we would not need as much. It allowed approximately $50 billion for tax cuts in fiscal year 2002 as part of the President’s 10-year tax cut plan. That was part of the deal, part of the understanding. That is what the expectations were. It allowed an additional stimulative tax cut of $15 billion in fiscal year 2002, but the $65 billion total was smaller than the $85 billion allowed for fiscal year 2001 because it was judged that more than that was not needed, and that was because no one expected the economy to be really weak in fiscal year 2002. That was then. This is now. Unfortunately, as we moved through the summer into September, there was a surprise.  The  economy  became much weaker  than  anyone had  predicted. Manufacturing continued to lose jobs. By the end of August, manufacturing had  lost  jobs  for  13  consecutive months. Real GDP growth was almost zero in the  second calendar quarter of  this year. Many taxpayers were saving part or all of their tax rebates that went out last summer rather than spending them. They are starting to tighten up, getting more  nervous,  fearful,  not spending, and  that clearly means a weaker economy. The Federal Reserve was still cutting interest rates, but that seemed like it might not be enough to turn the economy around. And then disaster struck. It is not necessary to recount the horrors of September 11, but it is important to talk about what the events of September 11 did to the economy. Here are some of the main results: Airline travel declined precipitously. Airlines laid off thousands of employees post-September 11. Industries that depend on air travel—such as hotels and car rentals—also declined precipitously. They dropped off. Business confidence was  shaken. Businesses  cut back on investments even more than they had been doing. Consumer confidence began  to drop precipitously, threatening consumer spending, which had been one bright spot in the economy. The results of all those blows to the economy became very clear when the unemployment figures for October were released early this month. Unemployment jumped from 4.9 percent to 5.4 percent. That is the largest jump in more than 20 years. Manufacturing fell to levels last seen in 1965. Now, non-manufacturing also took a hit. The  slowdown  in non-manufacturing  industries was the most dramatic since the inception of a key report by the National Association of Purchase Managers in 1997. Agriculture  producers  are hurting too. Net farm business income was at the year low in 1999 and 2000. Unless Government assistance  is continued, net farm income in 2001 is projected to ",2001

Mr. Kister is the current president of the Raisin Bargaining Association, making him and his father the only father and son to have both been elected as president of the RBA. In June of 1999, Kister became a member of the new California Raisin Marketing Board (CRMB),  focusing on  increasing  the market demand for raisins through such actions as increasing consumer awareness of  the nutritional value of raisins. Kister dedicates much of his time to dealing with issues of importance to growers, such as labor shortages, government regulations and the cost of production. In addition, Mr. Kister has worked to bring together members of the agricultural and urban communities in California ’s great Central Valley for their mutual benefit. Mr. Kister  is a  third generation  farmer  in Kerman, where he lives with his wife, Linda, and their two children, Claire and Eric. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I pay tribute to Mr. Steven Kister and his long-standing commitment and dedication  to  the San Joaquin Valley and California agriculture. I ask my colleagues  to  join me  in congratulating Steven and wishing him many more years of continued success. f NOTING THE CLOSING OF AN ERA; THE  RELOCATION  OF  JOLLY RANCHER CANDIES HON. MARK UDALL OFCOLORADO INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 14, 2001 ",2001
410,,107,-0.353,180,2001-11-14,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the contributions of the Jolly Rancher candy company and to express sadness that its factory in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, is closing next year after 53 years of production. Bill and Dorothy Harmsen opened the Jolly Rancher factory in Wheat Ridge in 1949. They named the factory Jolly Rancher for the welcoming and western sound of the name. The couple started  the business with chocolate and ice cream production. However, they soon found nation-wide success  in  its  line of  fruit flavored hard candy. Bill and Dorothy sold the factory to Beatrice foods in 1966, but still stayed personally involved with production. Bill was known  to come down to the factory in his bathrobe in the middle of the night if there was a problem. As a result of their hard work, the company grew, and has earned fame as a favorite all over the world. Currently,  the  factory produces about one million pounds of candy every week and employs three hundred and twenty people. The factory was eventually sold  to Hershey who has decided to shut down the original production facility in Wheat Ridge and relocate it to another location. The growth and success of the Jolly Rancher factory is a real life example of the American Dream; with hard work and ingenuity anything is possible. Perhaps more  impressive  than  the company’s success, is the impact that the factory has made on  the  surrounding  community. While  the  factory produces  the  flavor of  the day, the aroma encompasses the surrounding community. The fruit fragrance makes mouths water and tests the culinary aptitude of children as they try to guess the flavor that the factory is making that day. Adults in the area remember touring the factory as children and being permitted to taste warm Jolly Ranchers right off  the assembly  line. Trick or  treaters would go  to  the  factory every Halloween  to have  loads of candy dumped  into  their Halloween sacks. This Colorado confectionery has delighted the sweet tooth of the community for decades. It is a landmark and member of the community. I join with others in the community to express my disappointment  that  this  fixture of the community and example of small business success is being relocated. f HONORING DANIEL S.

411,,107,-0.658,187,2001-11-14,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce today the ‘ ‘Fairness in Antitrust in National Sports Act’ better known as  the ‘FANS Act’ . After one of the greatest World Series of all time that gave a much needed boost to the entire Country,  I was  shocked  by Major League Baseball’s decision just two days later to eliminate two teams as early as December 15th of this year. This is why it is imperative that Congress move quickly on the FANS Act to insure that anti-competitive decisions by Major League Baseball concerning the elimination or relocation of teams are subject to the antitrust laws like all other professional sports and businesses.  I want  to make clear  that  the particular modifications to the antitrust laws made by the FANS Act is not intended to imply that baseball’s antitrust exemption currently exists beyond the scope of the court’s decision in Piazza v. Major League Baseball. Any time 30 of the wealthiest and most influential individuals get together behind closed doors and agree to reduce output, that cannot be a good thing for anyone but the monopolists. If GM and Ford got together and jointly agreed to cut production, people would be outraged. That is exactly what baseball has done. In 1922 the Supreme court erroneously held that baseball was a ‘ ‘game’  that did not involve  interstate commerce’  and was  therefore beyond  the reach of  the antitrust  laws. The Supreme Court upheld the exemption in a case brought in 1972 by Curt Flood, one of the greatest players of his time. But now that professional baseball  is a $3 Billion annual business and the time has long since passed when it can be contended that baseball does not constitute ‘ interstate commerce.’  This is why in 1998, I led the way in repealing the exemption as it applies to labor disputes, in the well named ‘ ‘Curt Flood Act’ now it is time to finish the job. The elimination of baseball  teams  from a particular city, be  it Minnesota, Montreal or Florida, will result in the loss of millions of dollars in revenue to the local economy and the loss of thousands of jobs. Not just the jobs of baseball players, but the jobs of ticket takers, food vendors, security personnel, and numerous others. A little competition is good for everyone. If the antitrust laws can apply to major league football, basketball, and hockey, there is not a reason in the world they cannot apply to major league baseball. Let’s  level  the playing  field once and for all. f TRIBUTE TO MACKAY, IDAHO HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON OFIDAHO INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 14, 2001 ",2001
412,,107,0.293,187,2001-11-14,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to proudly pay  tribute  to  the city of Mackay, Idaho. Mackay is celebrating 100 years as the top of Idaho.’ With an elevation of 5,897 feet, Mackay is nestled near Mt. Borah, Idaho’s highest mountain. Gold, silver, lead and copper were discovered in the White Knob Mountains above Mackay  in  the 1880s. Over 100 years,  the area yielded nearly one million tons of ore resulting in 41,996 ounces of gold, 1.7 million ounces of silver, 15.1 million pounds of lead, 5.49 pounds of zinc, and 62.2 pounds of copper. What started Mackay was mining millionaire John Mackay’s vision of a 12-mile electric mountain railway system to transport ore down the mountain. Because of the massive project of building the railway system, John Mackay planned  the  town around  the  railroads  final stop. Named after himself, the town Mackay was officially  incorporated on October 14, 1901. In its 100 years, Mackay has seen the best of the mining boom. During World War I, the mines around Mackay supplied ore  for  red metal. By 1917, Mackay was a thriving town of 400 with a post office, movie house, many businesses, saloons and pool halls. At one point, the town grew to be home to roughly 5,000  residents. The mining boom, coupled with range livestock, dairy, and crops created a positive economic environment  in which the town flourished and its residents enjoyed their prosperity. Unfortunately, however,  the history of  the West is checkered with cycles of boom and bust, many of which center around the West’s most  precious  commodity— water.  When Mackay and the surrounding region were hit by a severe drought, tempers rose and times grew more desperate— including a farmer revolt in 1933 that led to the dynamiting of a headgate in a last ditch effort to release water held behind a dam. In 1983, the Mt. Borah earthquake leveled the Mackay City Hall and damaged several businesses. Despite  its  trials, Mackay continues to be a destination spot for many. With its breathtaking views and proximity to Idaho’s scenic rivers and pristine backcountry, Mackay showcases the best Idaho has to offer. Mackay is a town that epitomizes the rugged West and my home  state of  Idaho. Mackay’s  residents are hard working  Idahoans, who love their town, state and country. I want to add my heart-felt congratulations to the citizens of this beautiful place that literally is the top of Idaho. f A TRIBUTE TO THE MAYOR OF RICHMOND,  CALIFORNIA—THE HONORABLE ROSEMARY CORBIN HON.

413,House,107,-0.308,22,2001-11-27,Mrs. TAUSCHER.," Madam Speaker, I would like to lend my strong support for the PriceAnderson Reauthorization Act of 2001. I commend my colleague HEATHERWILSON for introducing this timely bill and her work on the Energy and Commerce Committee to ensure bipartisan participation. As a member of the Armed Services Committee’s Special Panel on Department of Energy Reorganization and with two national defense laboratories in my district, I believe that the timely renewal of the Price-Anderson Act is absolutely essential for the continued operations and cleanup of Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear facilities. As several of my colleagues who have National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) sites in their districts know, the defense production sites and former sites are operated by experienced,  uniquely  qualified  contractors who ensure that viability of our nuclear deterrent and the safe disposition of excess nuclear materials and waste. Price-Anderson gives us critical protection while fostering progress on environmental  and  quality management  of many of  the world’s most radioactively contaminated facilities. The legislation passed out the Energy and Commerce Committee ensures a  sufficient contractor base and places a strong emphasis on accountability. Current civil and criminal penalties contained  in Price-Anderson, combined with DOE’s inherent authority to adjust fees based on performance or terminate contracts, ensure  contractors are accountable. This mix will help DOE contractors continue their dedication  to safely maintaining America’s nuclear stockpile, while  they continue cleaning up  the environmental  legacy of  the cold war, and ensuring worker safety and health. On a broader level, a straightforward PriceAnderson reauthorization is necessary to ensure that the public has the financial resources available to cope with a nuclear accident, covering expenses  from evacuation  to medical care to property damage. The strict liability regime  imposed by Price-Anderson  in  the unlikely case of a major accident ensures money starts flowing where it’s needed without legal wrangling. This expedited process visibly benefits the public. In fact, during the Three Mile Island accident, Price-Anderson  financial assistance meant that the needs of people in the surrounding communities were met. Finally,  important,  timely measures have been added to the Price-Anderson Reauthorization Act, that address the threat of terrorism to our nuclear facilities. These provisions include measures  to safeguard  the  transportation of nuclear materials and several steps that address potential threats to nuclear facilities. Mrs. WILSON ’Sbill is timely. It matches bipartisan proposals  for  reauthorization  in  the Senate  and  tracks  both  recommendations made to Congress under the previous administration and the National Energy Policy developed by the Bush administration. I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote for this legislation. ",2001

416,House,107,-0.306,43,2001-11-27,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of the pending resolution  to  recognize  the accomplishments and contributions of American Indians and Alaskan Natives during this month  designated  as National American Indian Heritage Month. Native Americans continue to honorably contribute and serve our Nation in virtually every  field  imaginable,  including medicine, education, the arts, the justice system, and scientific research. Tribal members have valiantly fought in every American military action from the Revolutionary War and continue today in the war against terrorism and elsewhere around the world. It is right that we honor their work and contributions. If this Congress truly wants to honor Native Americans, however, we need to do it by honoring our treaties and past commitments made to them. The Federal Government took control as legal trustee of Indian trust lands, promising to protect the lands, produce and collect revenue derived from them, and invest and manage all revenue. We have failed miserably in this task, and we continue to pile bad policy upon bad policy, leaving proper management of some 1,500 tribal and over 300,000 individual  Indian  trust  fund  accounts hanging in limbo. The mismanagement of Indian trust funds dates back almost 100 years and only gets worse with each passing day. The Reagan administration listed this as one of the top five Federal liabilities. Yet today, the Department of the Interior cannot tell us if the accounts have the correct money in them, if the money is invested correctly, or even if the names of the accounts are correct. Just last week, the Secretary of the Interior announced she was going to create a brand new agency to deal with trust funds. Unfortunately, this decision was made without consulting with the account holders or the Congress. In fact, details of this brand new agency are almost nonexistent, so we do not know if this is a good answer or just another hastily thrown together concept. I want to impress upon my colleagues that this is not just some messed up pile of Federal funds. These are funds, billions of dollars, belonging to Indian tribes and American Indians who depend on these revenues to pay rent and buy medicine and foods. Imagine if our banks sometimes correctly deposited our income into our accounts and sometimes did not, but then could not tell us what they did with the money or denied ever receiving it. Imagine if the IRS lost billions of dollars slated to be refunded to taxpayers. Imagine if the Department of Transportation sent billions of highway trust fund dollars to the wrong States. Imagine if billions of dollars of Social Security checks owed to senior citizens in each of our districts were unaccounted for. These events would make the  front page of every newspaper in the Nation and would quickly be reconciled. I say that if we truly want to honor Native Americans,  it  is  incumbent upon the Federal Government to restore the word ‘‘trust’’ when it comes to the management of tribal trust assets once and for all. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the pending resolution, but I would be much more  proud  if  this Congress would put some muscle behind the idea of honoring Native Americans, not just this month but every month, by ensuring  that  the Federal Government’s trust responsibilities to these people is being honored.

418,House,107,0.204,50,2001-11-27,Mr. GILCHREST.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present H.R. 1230, an important bill introduced by the distinguished dean of the House, the honorable gentleman from Michigan (Mr. DINGELL). The measure has 28 bipartisan cosponsors. Also, the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. HANSEN), lends his support enthusiastically to this piece of legislation. The goal of this innovative measure is to establish an international wildlife refuge along the lower 18 miles of the Detroit River that flows between the United States and Canada. The river provides a central habitat for 29 species of waterfowl and 65 different kinds of fish. It has been designated as a heritage river in both countries, and it is an important waterfowl corridor for over 3 million ducks, geese, and swans who annually migrate through this region. Sadly, up to 95 percent of the original wetlands of  the Detroit River have been lost to development. H.R. 1230 offers a rare opportunity to protect the remaining high-quality fish and wildlife habitats, to restore degraded wetland areas, and  to encourage  international efforts to promote awareness of the ecosystem resources of the Detroit River. Under the terms of the original bill, if a corporation donated property to the Secretary of the Interior for inclusion in the refuge, then they were protected from future financial responsibility for any environmental cleanup and its cost. As Members might expect, the Justice Department and the Office of Management and Budget raised some concerns about future potential liability for the Federal Government. In an effort to accommodate those concerns, the author of the bill has agreed to modify this proposal by deleting the  indemnification provisions in section 7. With this change, any remaining questions about the impact of this legislation have been alleviated. We on this side of the aisle greatly appreciate the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. DINGELL) for that effort. H.R. 1230 has been endorsed by the Governor of Michigan, a member of the Canadian Parliament, numerous State and local officials, and dozens of conservation groups, including Ducks, Unlimited, the National Audubon Society, the National Rifle Association, the Nature Conservancy, and the Trust  for Public Lands. In his endorsement letter, Governor John Engler noted that the creation of a new Federal wildlife refuge will certainly enhance the conservation of the Detroit River and its unique natural, historical, and cultural resources. During our hearings, a witness for Ducks, Unlimited, testified that the new refuge would provide a unique opportunity for international cooperation between the United States and Canada VerDate 11-MAY-2000 04:30 Nov 28, 2001 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A27NO7.052 pfrm04 PsN: H27PT1 ",2001

Julie is only the seventh woman to serve on the Hermosa Beach City Council in its 90-year history. As a female elected official myself, I respect and admire the challenges that Julie has had to face in running for and maintaining her seat all these years, and she has done a terrific  job.  In my observation, she balances her roles as professional architect, politician, mother, and spouse extremely well. Julie has been  instrumental  in  reshaping and refocusing the Hermosa Beach City Council, and has been a constructive and knowledgeable voice in the recent ‘ ‘Renaissance’  of HONORING  THE  DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC SERVICE OF ED ‘‘SONNY’’ ELAM HON.

420,,107,-0.182,134,2001-11-27,Mr. TANNER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the late Bill Manning, a decorated war hero, a faithful public servant and my friend. A California native who  settled  in Tennessee with  his wife  Jane, Mr. Manning served two tours of duty in Vietnam and was wounded both times. During his second tour in 1968, he lost both his left arm and right hand as a result of a rocket grenade attack. Mr. Manning had a prosthetic left arm and shoulder, and he designed and patented the Accra Hook  to replace his right hand so he could maintain its functionality. Those disabilities did not stop what would become a  long  list of great achievements. When he returned from Vietnam, Mr. Manning was elected Recorder in Gibson County, Tennessee,  and  later,  Governor  Ned McWherter appointed him state Commissioner of Veterans’ Affairs. During that time, Mr. manning played an important role in the construction of  three  retirement homes  for veterans and  three cemeteries  for veterans  in Tennessee. The West Tennessee Veterans Cemetery and  the state veterans home  in Humboldt are named in his honor. In 1999, Mr. Manning was  first elected mayor of Bradford, Tennessee, and has been credited with reinvigorating community spirit in that town. He was elected to his second term in that position in May 2001. I am honored to have worked alongside Bill Manning, who is truly an American hero. His spirit and determination allowed him to overcome his physical obstacles and become a leader whose good work still benefits the people of Bradford, Gibson County and the state of Tennessee. We have lost an amazing man, a courageous  leader and a dear  friend. Mr. Speaker,  I ask  that you and our colleagues join me today in recognizing my friend, Mr. Bill Manning. f PAYING TRIBUTE TO DON CHAPMAN HON.

421,Senate,107,-0.419,5,2001-12-07,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President, as the sun rises over Pearl Harbor this morning, solemn ceremonies at the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial and  the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific will commemorate the 60th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Prayers, reflections and tribute will be offered to honor the service and sacrifice of the men and women who fought and died in the defense of our country. For many of us in Hawaii, the events of December 7 are a graphic memory, a personal experience never to be forgotten. As a student, I watched in the attack on Pearl Harbor at 8 a.m., Sunday, December 7, 1941, from the roof of my dormitory at the Kamehameha School for Boys on Kapalama Heights in Honolulu. We had just returned from breakfast at the dining hall, and were slowly preparing  for  Sunday  services.  In stunned silence, we saw the flash of bombs and thick black smoke rising above Pearl Harbor. We saw the planes dive  from the south, drop their torpedoes, and the resulting explosion on the battleship Arizona, which later tilted and sank at her mooring. The airstrip at Hickam was marked with potholes, bomb craters, and damaged aircraft. Smoke, both white and black, moved to blanket the area. A spent anti-aircraft shell landed and exploded near our dormitory. A squad of zeros flew over us from Pearl Harbor to attack the Kaneohe Naval Air Station. By that time excited radio messages were reporting the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It was  a  calamity  that  forever changed  the course and  life of our country and Hawaii. As America prepared for war, men and boys in Hawaii, as elsewhere in our Nation, rushed to enlist.  Japanese American  soldiers, fighting with the 442nd Infantry and 100th Battalion, became the most decorated units in the war, while at the same time our government  interned and relocated their families and confiscated their homes. The sacrifices made by ordinary men and women who rallied in defense of freedom, liberty, and the great promise of our democracy represents the greatest heroism and patriotism in service of our country. It also reminds us and future generations of Americans that patriotism is not a matter of race and religion, but personal courage and conviction. As we realized on December 7, and as the events of September 11th painfully reminded us, the  freedom and prosperity we enjoy carries a dear price. Our sacred duty is to ensure its preservation for future generations. Throughout our Nation’s history, we Americans have relied on the power of our ideals, our faith in God, and prayer to guide us through the challenges we faced, and we rely on that same power today as we seek peace and justice. Today, I am honored to join my colleagues in prayer and remembrance for those courageous men and women who died in Pearl Harbor. I also join my colleagues in honoring my dear friend, the senior Senator from Hawaii [Mr. INOUYE]. His duties and responsibilities in the Senate have kept him from today’s observances in Hawaii. For over 50 years, Senator INOUYEhas served our Nation and our beloved State in the U.S. Army—awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Territorial Legislature, the House, and Senate. I am proud to serve alongside him and privileged to call him friend. I also want to thank the senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. STEVENS, who is also a decorated and distinguished veteran of the Second World War and a true American patriot, for his leadership  in remembering those killed at Pearl Harbor and honoring the service of those men and women who served our Nation in the Second World War and those men and women who are defending  freedom  around  the world today.

422,Senate,107,0.391,5,2001-12-07,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, 60 years ago I was serving as a Circuit Judge for the State of South Carolina. It was an early Sunday afternoon when news reports began to stream in about the attack against the United States that took place at Pearl Harbor, HI. As I listened to news reports about the attack on our Pacific Fleet, I knew instantly, that the world we lived in was irreversibly changed. All across this great Nation, Americans reacted to the unprovoked attack on the United States with anger, and I shared those sentiments. We became galvanized  as  a Nation. Americans from all corners of the country rose to the call of duty. Long lines extended from every military recruiting office as men and women prepared to take up the challenge to the security of the United States and the American way of ",2001
423,Senate,107,-0.291,26,2001-12-07,Ms. CANTWELL.," Madam President, I, too, rise with my colleague, the Senator from Washington, who has done an outstanding job on the Appropriations Committee to steer this issue through the process which is both sound policy and very important for the State of Washington. I also thank the chairman of the committee, Senator INOUYE, and the ranking member for understanding the complexity of this problem. What is at hand is a bipartisan effort where the committee has recognized the glaring Achilles’ heel in our Nation’s military preparedness. They developed a creative solution. We currently have an air fleet that is older than most of the pilots who fly them. With 546 air tankers in the fleet, the average age is 36 years, and the oldest plane is over 45. These planes were initially designed to have a 25-year lifespan. They are showing extreme wear and tear. My colleague  from Kansas entered into the RECORDa letter that shows the military, while being open and flexible, thought this idea was a sound way to provide  tankers.  Obviously,  the amount of wear and tear on the aging tanker fleet is causing a lot of problems and increased maintenance costs. Indeed, the Air Force is projecting a 42percent  increase—over  $3 billion—in the next 30 years for maintenance in this area. Compounding the problem is the decreased availability in a time of increased demand. We are also not just facing issues overseas, as mentioned by my colleague  from Washington, but also a new mission on the homeland front in our Nation’s security—defending our Nation’s airspace. That  requires the use of these crucial tankers. Without effective tanker force, our air superiority is wrecked. This is a creative solution at a time when the need is great. I urge my colleagues to support this great bipartisan and common effort. ",2001
424,Senate,107,-0.351,89,2001-12-07,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. President, it is my understanding that the fiscal year 2002 Defense appropriations bill contains funding for Hybrid Electric Vehicle, HEV, technologies. I am seeking the chairman’s assistance  to ensure that the funding in this bill for HEVs will also be dedicated to the work of applying currently developed and demonstrated HEV technology to a weapons system. The U.S. Army High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, HIMARS, program has an HEV initiative that will put hybrid propulsion on the Family of Medium  Tactical  Vehicles,  FMTV, platform. As the chairman well knows, the Army has identified Hybrid Electric Drive as the key technology for transformation. Hybrid electric propulsion provides greater fuel and logistics cost  savings,  increased  survivability thorough silent mode operations, provides improved mobility, and supplies a new capability to the vehicle systems power management that currently does not exist within any Army weapons system. This initiative that I am referring to will jump-start the Army’s effort to weaponize an HEV platform with the HIMARS program. The timing of these funds for this conversion effort of HIMARS to HEV is critical. Providing the  funds now,  in  fiscal year 2002, would allow the hybrid drive initiative to dovetail with the current production planned for HIMARS. Missing the opportunity this year would require untimely changes to the HIMARS production line, and would be excessively more  expensive  for  the U.S. Army conversion to the HEV platform. This  significant HEV  series  technology has already been accomplished under the Dual Use Science and Technology initiative by the National Automotive Command under TACOM contract.  The  contract  converted  the FMTV platform into series HEV technology. The contract should be continued for a timely series HIMARS HEV conversion.  It  is my understanding that the FY 2002 MRLS Product Improvement Program line contains $20 million of which $10 million should be programmed to begin the timely conversion of  the hybrid  series FMTV truck to a HIMARS series hybrid electric vehicle platform. I urge the Chairman to support this important transformation project. ",2001

Ambassador Reed’s  remarks were made at the Centennial Celebration of the Yale-China Association on October 6, 2001. REMARKS BYAMBASSADOR JOSEPHVERNER REED, UNDER-SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITEDNATIONS CENTENNIALCELEBRATIONOFTHEYALE-CHINA ASSOCIATION, YALEUNIVERSITY Dean Brodhead of Yale College, Counsellor Xu of the Consulate of the People’s Republic of China in New York City, Mr. Jones, Chair, Board of Trustees, Yale-China Association, Ms. Chapman, Executive Director, YaleChina Association, Members of the YaleChina Family, Ladies and Gentlemen, What an honor, privilege, and pleasure to be at Yale to celebrate the centenary of the Yale-China Association! This is a major milestone for me as I have been a life-long son of Sino-American relations. I grew up surrounded by ‘‘things Chinese’’,  sculpture, porcelain,  furniture and paintings. Some in my family say I am ‘‘in love’’ with all things Chinese. As a banker I had the pleasure of a close working  relationship  with  Ambassador Huang Hua at the Mission of the People’s Republic of China in the 70’s. We have maintained a lasting friendship. I accompanied David Rockefeller on the first visit of American business  following President Nixon’s historic trip to Beijing. Many moons ago I became associated with Yale University Press in the historic publishing endeavor known as Chinese Civilization and Culture. We at the Yale Press work side by side with the Chinese authorities, publishers and scholars in an historic undertaking to publish 75 volumes—painting, architecture, calligraphy, furniture—our first volume on the history of painting won the highest prize  in publishing—the Hawkins Prize. It is a grand endeavor with Yale’s most senior graduate as Honorary Chair of the Project, President George H.W. Bush. Henry Kissinger is Chairman of the Advisory Council. Professor Jonathan Spencer is on the Editorial Advisory Board. The Rockefeller Family is supportive with Mrs. Nelson A. Rockefeller  serving  as Chair  of  the Friends of CCC. Mr. Anthony Fouracre is the Head of the United Nations Postal Administration, a great organization, which produces some 50 stamps a year. The ‘‘Terra Cotta Warrior’’ series was/is the United Nations Postal Administration’s most popular stamp. May I now say a few words as an American citizen, working for the United Nations. Our World has been profoundly altered by the unspeakable  acts  of  evil  committed against the United States of America and innocent civilians on 11 September 2001—A Day of Terror. 11 September 2001, the 20th anniversary of the United Nations International Day of Peace, was supposed to be a day on which we try to imagine a world quite different from the one we know. It was to be a day on which ‘‘we try to picture hatred turning  into respect, bigotry into  understanding  and  ignorance  into knowledge, a day on which we dare to imagine a world free of conflict and violence’’. I am quoting here from the Message of the Secretary-General of  the United Nations, Kofi Annan. That message was recorded on 10 September for the International Day of Peace. Instead, the horrible and previously unimaginable acts of  terror  committed by international terrorists have profoundly altered our world. America, indeed the entire civilized world, must now be at war against terrorism. Barely a mile from United Nations Headquarters, the Parliament of Mankind, the Parliament of Peace, more than 6000 innocent civilians from over 60 countries were killed and a symbol of New York City and the Free World was destroyed. The Capital of the United States of America was attacked. President George W. Bush, with the entire nation rallied behind him, said this will not stand. This single most horrible act of  international terrorism has united people across the globe. This was not only an attack on America, but also on everyone in the modern world. This will and shall provide the catalyst for an unprecedented international coalition to resist terrorism and  fanaticism, against hatred, bigotry and ignorance. On 12 September, the newly elected President of the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea, Dr. Han Seung-soo, stated before the assembled  representatives  of  the  international community at the opening of the 56th session of the General Assembly, which had to be postponed by one day: ‘‘Mere words cannot express the outrage and disgust we doubtless all feel for the vile actions perpetrated in our host country, the United States. I condemn in the strongest possible terms these heinous acts of terrorism. I pray for those who lost their lives and on behalf of the General Assembly offer our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the innocent victims. These terrorist crimes were, in effect, acts of war against all the world’s peace-loving peoples. Their primary target was, by a vicious twist of fate, located in the very city, which is home to the world’s foremost institution dedicated to promoting world peace. No terrorists can ever deflect this body from the task to which  it has dedicated  itself since  1945—ending  the  scourge of war  in whatever form it may take once and for all.’’ The United Nations Security Council has, in the meantime, acted decisively, at the initiative of the United States. The General Assembly, in a rare show of unity, is deliberating and adopting measures to eliminate international terrorism. Ladies and Gentlemen, these were some of the thoughts that are uppermost in my mind these turbulent days following the Day of Terror. Had  I been delivering these remarks a month ago, however, my belief in the importance of the work of the Yale-China Association would have been no less sincere. The tragic  events we have all  recently witnessed—and developments yet to unfold—inject a new sense of urgency into the continuation of the Yale-China traditions that we honor here tonight. In times such as these, it is more important than ever to strengthen those impulses and institutions that refute the power of violence, ignorance, and mutual hostility among peoples. On the global scale, these  institutions  include the United Nations, which I have the honor to serve, and the many multilateral  efforts  to  ensure peace and security under its auspices. But no less significantly, they include private associations of compassionate, committed individuals reaching out beyond their own borders and working to make the world a more tolerant, peaceful, and enlightened place. Among such associations, the Yale-China Association has been both a pioneer and an example for others for the past century. The Yale-China Association is a banner organization of quality and success. Close to one year ago, I had the pleasure of working with Nancy Chapman and members of her staff at the Yale-China Association to organize and to host the visit of Madame Chen Zhili, Minister of Education of the People’s Republic of China. Minister Chen was the highest ranking member of the Chinese VerDate 11<MAY>2000 01:25 Dec 08, 2001 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A06DE8.026 pfrm07 PsN: E07PT1 ",2001

Sharronie  Perry  was  bom  in  Bedford Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, New York. She is the mother of two sons, Da-Shawn and Jah-Son and the proud grandmother of Jayla and JahSon. Serving her church and her community for over thirty years, Sharonnie has distinguished herself as a hard worker committed to service. She is part of numerous community organizations, including Our Lady of Charity Church, The Knights of Peter Claver Auxiliary Court 229 and Solid Ground Ministries where she works closely with Father James E. Goode and Grandlady Carmela Rodriguez. Involving herself in the politics of the community. She has served as a campaign manager for some of Brooklyn’s most powerful elected officials from all  levels of government. Sharonnie  is currently  the District Director  in my Fulton Street Office as well as  the Chairperson of Community Board 5. Following her motto: ‘ I have come to serve and not be served’ , Sharonnie has received numerous awards and acknowledgements for her tireless efforts. By extending her hands to those in need and dedicating her life to her brothers and sister. Sharonnie has brought hope to those on the verge of giving up. As Co-Chair of the Ladies HIV/AIDS and Homeless Ministry, she helps  to provide meals, shelter and the comfort of visitation to those many choose to forget. As the founder of the First Women’s Day to be held in the Catholic Church, Sharonnie  raised over $75,000  in funds  to buy a church van  for Our Lady of Charity Church and to make renovations in the Malcolm-Bethune Hall. Sharonnie has evangelized on both the local and national  levels. Performing  the opening prayer service at the National Convention for the Knights of Peter Claver Ladies Auxiliary for  the past six years has been one of her greatest pleasures. She has had the honor of being invited to be the keynote speaker at the Young Black Achievers program and the HIV/ AIDS prayer service  in  the Archdiocese of New York. Using a very personal and ‘ ‘hands on’  approach, Sharonnie has been  invited over and over again  to conduct workshops across the City. Most recently, she facilitated the HIV/AIDS workshop for the Office of Black Catholics in the Bronx. Sharonnie, also conducted a workshop in July 2001 for the National Gathering of Black Catholic Women sponsored by the National Black Sister Conference in Charlotte, North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Sharonnie Perry’s contributions to Brooklyn have definitely improved the quality of life for her neighbors and her community. As such, she is more than worthy of receiving our recognition today and I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring this truly remarkable woman. f TRIBUTE TO DEBORAH ERVIN HON.

427,,107,0.371,187,2001-12-07,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Deborah Ervin of Edinburg, Illinois, and her effort  to honor all  those who gave their lives for the United States of America. Ms. Ervin is a woman with a cause. Like so many brave young Americans, her brother in law was killed while serving his country in the Vietnam war. Sometime after this tragic event, Deborah decided to fly a flag in his honor— only to find that no flag specifically honoring those who died in combat existed. Not to be deterred, Ms. Ervin decided that if such a flag did not exist, that she would just have to create it. It was a  long process, but  I was  lucky enough  to be presented with  the  results: a beautiful  flag meant  to honor all  those men and women who have died for their country. The flag portrays an American eagle in flight to  represent  the  strength and  freedom of America; above the eagle is a blue cross that is meant  to represent  the sacrifice of  those who have died. Both the eagle and cross are within the outline of a solemn tombstone, with a background of red and white stripes. Ms. Ervin wished me to fly the flag in honor of her brother, and  I have honored her request— it now stands proudly outside of my office. In addition, she also wished us to forward a second  flag on  to Mayor Giuliani  in New York. This we have done in honor of the brave policemen, firefighters, men, women and children who lost their lives to terrorism on September 11th. Mr, Speaker, in creating this flag Ms. Ervin has done us all a great service. Recent events have served to remind us that we can remain free only because our people are willing to defend that freedom, and this flag is a fitting tribute to them. Ms. Ervin deserves our thanks, not only  for creating such a heartwarming symbol, but also for her patriotism and devotion to her country. May God bless her, and may God bless the United States of America. f THE OVER-THE-ROAD BUS SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT OF 2001 HON. THOMAS E. PETRI OFWISCONSIN INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 6, 2001 ",2001
428,,107,0.379,187,2001-12-07,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, today, the leadership of  the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee has introduced the Over-the-Road Bus Security and Safety Act of 2001. This bipartisan legislation puts in place a bus security program to better protect the bus riding public. The  latest  figures  from  the American Bus Association demonstrate  that  the over-theroad bus  industry, comprised of private bus and tour and travel operators, transports 774 million passengers annually. The  industry’s 800 bus operators and almost 200 tour operators, using 40,000 motor coaches,  transport more passengers than the airlines and Amtrak combined (650 million passengers).  In addition, Greyhound Bus Lines and  its  interline partners take passengers to some 4,000 destinations, more  than  7  times  the  number served by air or Amtrak. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Committee has reemphasized its examination of all modes of transportation security. As an important element of multi-modal transportation, the over-the-road bus industry must increase  its security measures. Unfortunately, recent terrorist acts on foreign buses and bus stations demonstrate the necessity for bus security.  In  fact, an analysis of worldwide  terrorist activities  from 1920–2000 shows  that 49% of terrorist attacks involve a bus or a bus facility. While bus operators have made some security improvements, Congress must provide assistance to their ongoing efforts. Our legislation establishes a grant program that will be administered by  the Secretary of Transportation. Eligible uses  include expanding  the passenger and baggage screening process, establishing electronic ticketing, hiring security officers and making physical security improvements to bus stations. This program is authorized at $200 million  in  the  first  fiscal year. After an appropriation is made, a twenty-five cent per ticket fee will be taken on tickets over five dollars. This fee will be used to fund the bus  safety program  in  the  following  fiscal years. This  is an affordable bill  that brings  the priceless bargain of security to the bus riding public. I hope that my colleagues support this bipartisan effort to better protect the bus riding public.

In the wake of September 11th, the American people have been donating at a record rate. We donate our money, our possessions, and our precious time to help fellow citizens throughout  the nation. These donations are helping people rebuild  their  lives every day, but there is another type of donation that is desperately needed by Americans all over the country. Today, another seventeen people will be added to the growing list of those who wait for the donation of an organ. As of November 2, 2001, the United Network  for Organ Sharing counted 78,802 patients on its national waiting list for organ donation. Even though 22,953 people successfully received an organ last year giving them new life, another 5,597 people on the list died before an organ became available. They died because of the critical shortage of organ donors. Transplants are now used in the treatment of over 225 diseases; this dramatically increased the number of patients added to the list in the last ten years. However, the number of donors has not increased to keep up with this demand. Due to advances in technology and medicine, people with transplants are able to lead full and healthy lives. On December 20th of  this year, Margaret Van der Heide of Wisconsin will give her daughter, Rebecca Galuska of Minnesota, a new kidney and a chance to live a full and active  life. Organ donation  is possible  for  the majority of Americans. I want to encourage all of you  to  talk with your  loved ones about organ donation and get tested to be a donor. You may be able to give the greatest gift of all this holiday season— a new chance at life. f PAYING TRIBUTE TO MELODYE FELDMAN HON.

431,,107,-0.494,80,2001-12-14,Mr. COYNE.," Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation, the ‘ ‘Retirement Opportunity Expansion Act of 2001,’  that would increase pension participation for workers without pensions, low-wage workers, and women. Joining me in this effort are Congressman CHARLESB. the  ranking member of  the Committee on Ways and Means, and Congressman ROBERTT. MATSUI, the ranking member of the Social Security Subcommittee. Earlier this year the House passed H.R. 10, ‘The Comprehensive Retirement Security and Pension Reform Act.’  I saw that bill as a beginning, a first step, to improve retirement opportunities for workers in this country. But, at that time, I emphasized the need to do more to address  the many gaps and shortfalls  in pension coverage. In March 1999, the Oversight Committee of the Committee on Ways and Means held hearings on pension  issues. At  those hearings, Teresa Heinz, in her capacity as Chairman of the Heinz Foundation Philanthropies, testified that nearly 40 percent of women are dependent on Social Security for almost all of their  retirement  income because  they have fewer opportunities to participate in the retirement plans provided by employers. This is but one aspect of the problems facing our country as the baby-boom generation begins to retire and younger workers lack adequate pension coverage. I believe that steps must be taken to help employees to fund their retirement accounts, to assist small business owners to start and maintain pension plans  for  themselves and their employees, and to provide women with improved  retirement  income protections. To that end, I have included in this bill a refundable tax credit that is substantially the same as  that provided  for  in  the Democratic substitute which was introduced by Mr. NEAL in the 106th Congress. Recently I ask the General Accounting Office (GAO)  to  look at  the extent of pension coverage among American workers and  the likely effects of increasing contribution limits in defined contribution plans, the type of pension plan  that covers most pension participants. GAO identified what I believe to be disturbing trends in the degree of pension participation among lower-income and women workers. For instance, while 47 percent of all workers participate in some type of a pension plan, only 38  percent  of workers  earning  less  than $40,000 per year participate in a pension plan. Fully 70 percent of workers earning between $40,000 and $74,999 participate  in a plan. GAO also revealed that 56 percent of female workers do not participate in a pension plan. The disparities in coverage are even greater when looking at defined contribution plans. In a defined contribution plan, the employee may provide all or a portion of the funds and decide how  to  invest  the money. There  is no guaranteed benefit amount or formula as there are in traditional defined benefit plans. Of all workers who earned  less  than $40,000 per year, 28 percent participated in defined contribution plans. Only 32 percent of all female workers participated  in defined contribution plans. Further, GAO found that only 8% of all defined contribution plan participants would likely benefit directly from increases in statutory contribution  limits. Thus,  it  is clear  that changes in contribution limits will do little directly to promote or extend coverage to workers lacking pension coverage. Clearly greater effort is needed to encourage and facilitate pension participation, especially  among  lower-income  workers  and women. After considering GAO’s findings and revisiting the issues raised during our consideration of H.R. 10,  I am  introducing a pension bill which addresses the following issues: The expansion of pension coverage for workers without pensions; the expansion of coverage for low-wage workers;  the  improvement of pension coverage for women; and the creation of additional  incentives  for small businesses  to provide pension coverage for employees. These are the very issues I emphasized in May during our deliberation of H.R. 10. Because the findings of the GAO and the research of other groups such as the Pension Rights Center and the Women’s Institute for a Secure Retirement (WISER) demonstrate that lower-income and  female workers are much less likely to be participants in pension plans, I believe we must direct our  focus  to  these workers who often toil at the margins of pension coverage. Specific efforts are needed to help women  secure  the  pension  benefits which all manner of  their contributions have earned for them. The Pension Rights Center, a nonprofit consumer  rights organization dedicated  to promoting  retirement  income security, has expressed its ‘ ‘strong support’  for the Retirement Opportunity Expansion Act of 2001, noting that this legislation would ‘ ‘encourage the creation of new private retirement plans for those lacking such coverage, particularly low and moderate wage earners.’  WISER, a nonprofit organization that seeks to ensure that poverty among older women will be reduced by  improving the opportunities for women to secure retirement benefits, stated that they are ‘ ‘extremely gratified’  about the introduction of this bill. They have urged support  for  the bill  in order to ‘ improve the alarming retirement situation for older women . . . where millions of women are retiring into poverty, despite a lifetime of work and caregiving for their families.’ Earlier initiatives provided a starting point to improve  the pension system we have.  It  is now time to develop the pension system that we need. I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and ensuring its passage during the 107th Congress. Mr. Speaker, I am attaching a summary of the provisions of the ‘ ‘Retirement Opportunity Expansion Act of 2001.’ THERETIREMENTOPPORTUNITYEXPANSION ACTOF2001 SUMMARY TITLEI: EXPANSIONOFPENSIONCOVERAGETO WORKERSWITHOUTPENSIONS The purpose of this section is to provide an incentive for low- and middle-income individuals to save for retirement.

432,,107,-0.402,94,2001-12-14,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Indiana’s First Congressional District, Michael Clifft. On November 30, 2001, Michael, along with his family and friends, celebrated his  retirement  from  the  International Brotherhood of Boilermakers Local Union 374 after more than 35 years of dedicated service. We in Northwest Indiana applaud Mr. Clifft’s achievements  thus  far. At  the young age of 23, he was  initiated  into  the  International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, an event  that marked his entry into a productive career in this field. A native Oklahoman, he joined our community in 1968 when he was transferred to Local 374 in Hammond, Indiana. His sense of dedication and professionalism  that was formed  in  the Heartland came  to  fruition  in Northwest Indiana with his many positive contributions in our community. We often seek in traditions a reflection of American ideals: reliability, loyalty, and an unwavering commitment to a strong work ethic. The Clifft family yields to us all an example of uncompromising dedication to this ethic— his father before him and his daughter after him are both distinguished Boilermakers. Mr. Clifft has provided the constituents of  the First Congressional District with a positive standard after which they can model themselves. As a testament to his dedication to the International Brotherhood  of Boilermakers, Mr. Clifft was appointed to the position of Assistant Business Manager of Local 374 in 1995. For the six years he served in this position, he represented Local 374 with the same integrity that he has devoted to his career, his family, and his friends. With  his  induction  into  the  International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Mr. Clifft became a member of a family of professionals that spans the globe. His efforts to serve his international brothers and sisters to the best of his abilities are  the  reasons we honor him today. Yet these obligations do not curtail his involvement with  those who have supported him  in  these endeavors. The Clifft  family should also receive some of the praise offered today. His wife, his five children, and his ten grandchildren have selflessly shared this man with our community and they are also deserving of our gratitude. On this special day, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Michael Clifft. His large circle of family and friends can be proud of the contributions this prominent individual has made. His work  in  the  labor movement provided union workers in Northwest Indiana opportunities that might have remained undiscovered. Mr. Clifft’s contributions kept  the  labor  force strong and his loyalty and sincerity embody all that is admirable in America’s workforce. I sincerely wish Michael Clifft a long, happy, and productive retirement. f TRIBUTE TO MR. MARTIN MURPHY HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR.
