2,Senate,106,0.331,188,1999-01-14,Mr. BENNETT.," Your Honor, excuse me, Mr. President, I need some guidance from the Court at this point. I’m going to object to the innuendo. I’m afraid, as I say, that this will  leak. I don’t question the predicates here. I question the good faith of counsel, the  innuendo  in the question. Counsel  is fully aware that Ms. Jane Doe 6 [Monica Lewinsky] has filed, has an affidavit which they are in possession of saying that there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form, with President Clinton, and yet  listening  to  the  innuendo  in  the questions—— Judge WRIGHT. No, just a minute, let me make my ruling. I do not know whether ",1999
3,Senate,106,0.39,2,1999-01-22,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. Chief Justice, I do send the first question to the desk. The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators ALLARD, BUNNING, COVERDELLand CRAIG ask the House managers: Is it the opinion of the House Managers that the President’s defense team,  in the presentation, mischaracterized any  factual or legal issue in this case? If so, please explain. Mr. Manager BRYANT. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished colleagues, and Members of the Senate, there are—first of all, let me thank you for the opportunity  to  respond  to questions. We hope we can do that in a succinct manner today. There  are  a  number  of mischaracterizations  in  statements that we disagree with that the President’s defense team made. I will not attempt to cover all of these. And  I would like to highlight just a few of these, and perhaps might, in a short manner, exceed the rebuttal presumption of 5 minutes. Mr. Craig made the argument on behalf of the President that this is a lot about an oath versus oath perjury case. Article I is the perjury allegation—one word against another person’s word, ‘‘he said, she said.’’ However, we would submit that there was not discussed in their presentation the fact that there is ample corroboration which is provided for under the law as it being necessary. But we believe factually there was much corroboration; that is, another person or other evidence to support the fact that the President did commit the perjury, and particularly those aspects of the perjury charge that deal with the  personal  relationship  that Ms. Lewinsky and the President had. Very clearly, White House records and  phone  logs,  along  with Ms. Lewinsky’s  incredible recollection of particular names and events, and the circumstances surrounding these particular occasions, that have already been highlighted in the past—and we all know about those types of telephone conversations. And she was very clear in the facts. The people have all corroborated her on her presence in the White House at certain times. No. 2, the Secret Service testimony that placed her inside the Oval Office, on occasion alone; the fact that there have  been  contemporaneous  statements made by Ms. Lewinsky describing the details of this relationship. And as we all know, the law permits this contemporaneous statement to, in this case, at least eight friends and two professional counselors detailing the particular relationship while it was ongoing. The blue dress is very clearly corroboration, and the DNA testing that resulted from that. Also, the transfer of Ms. Lewinsky from the White House, and the later surreptitious efforts with Ms. Currie to sneak her back into the White House, again, indication that efforts had been made to move her, to relocate her, away from the President to protect him from those circumstances. Also, the President’s prepared statement in the grand jury is another example that was not mentioned. And in particular, I highlight the statement that he made that would lead you to believe that this relationship evolved over a period of time, and that being that he was sorry that what had started out as a friendship turned into this type of relationship, where, in fact, Ms. Lewinsky’s  testimony  is very  clear that  that  relationship began  immediately, the very first day that he actually spoke to her. Mr. Ruff’s statement that the managers’ case was misleading is also incorrect, I believe. He used words like ‘‘fudging the facts,’’ ‘‘a witches’ brew,’’ and ‘‘be wary of a prosecutor who feels like he must deceive the court.’’ And this comes to somewhat of a surprise to many of us at this table who know that Mr. Ruff is familiar with the facts of this case. And just last month, when he testified before the Judiciary Committee, he said: I have no doubt that the President walked up to that line that he thought  he  understood. Reasonable people—reasonable  people—and  you may have reached that conclusion that he could have crossed over that line and that what for him was truthful but misleading or nonresponsive or misleading and evasive was in fact false. Now, he didn’t tell you in his presentation that just a month ago he took the position that reasonable people can disagree, and yet before this Senate, and the audience that we have watching, he asserts that anyone who would accuse his client of perjury is guilty of ‘‘fudging the facts,’’ ‘‘brewing a witches’ brew,’’ and ‘‘deception.’’ And even Mr.  Craig,  unfortunately,  borrowed many of those same words in that characterization. It may be good theater, but it is simply not the case that these managers are engaged in that type of practice before  the Senate and  the American people. White House Counsel Cheryl Mills spoke in a similar manner and tone to this House  about  inconvenient  and stubborn  facts—oh,  those  stubborn facts. In her meticulous presentation, she  passed  over—she  completely missed—the second occasion wherein President Clinton attempted to coach Ms. Currie. Did anyone hear about the second event? As carefully as she tried to make innocent the wrongful effort of the President to tamper with the potential witness, she just as carefully skirted the entire similar episode 2 or 3 days after the first one where he again tampered with her testimony. According—according to Ms. Currie—he spoke with her, just recapitulating. Remember that in our presentation? Likewise,  in her review of witness tampering,  she mischaracterized  the law—the law—stating that a threat— an actual threat was required. 18 U.S.C. 1503 states that obstruction of justice occurs when a person corruptly endeavors to influence the testimony of another person. And ‘‘corruptly’’ has been interpreted by the District Court here in D.C. to mean acting for an improper purpose. And, clearly, this was an improper purpose when the President was trying to get her to testify  falsely, but a threat is not a part of the law and not needed. And I will just quickly, if I might, just mention two more quick ones. Mr. Ruff stated the President gave the same denial to his aides that he gave to his country and family. You recall him specifically saying that he just has said nothing different to the American public and his family that he told the aides that we talked about— John Podesta, Sidney Blumenthal. Well, that’s not right. ‘‘He told’’—the President told Mr. Podesta—and this is Mr. Podesta talking—‘‘He told me that he never had sex with her and that he never asked—you know, he repeated the denial. But he was extremely explicit in saying he never had sex with her in any way whatsoever, that they had not had oral sex.’’ And Blumenthal—Mr. Blumenthal— he told Mr. Blumenthal an entirely different story, that  ‘‘Monica Lewinsky came at me and made a sexual demand on me. [And I, the President,] rebuffed her.’’ He said that ‘‘I’ve gone down that road before [and] . . .caused pain for a lot of people and I’m not going to do that again.’’ ‘‘She threatened him.’’ Ms. Lewinsky threatened the President. And  ‘‘[s]he said that she would tell [other] people [that she] had an affair, that she was known as a stalker among her peers, and that she hated [that], and if she had an affair . . . [with the President] she wouldn’t be . . .anymore.’’ That is not the story that he told the American people and that he told his family. These are embellishments that are very important, because he anticipated  that  they would go  into  the grand  jury  and  repeat  those misstatements. And finally, the affidavit of Monica Lewinsky. White House defense  lawyers spoke so eloquently about the procurement of this affidavit—as he glided ",1999
4,Senate,106,-0.326,30,1999-01-22,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President, I would like to join Senator FRISTand other distinguished colleagues in introducing the Federal Research  Investment Act. This legislation will set a long-term vision for federal funding of research and development programs so that the United States can continue to be the world leader in high-tech industries. One only needs to look as far as the front page of the newspaper to see the effect of high-technology on our country. New drugs are becoming available for fighting cancer; new communication hardware is allowing more people to connect to the  internet; and advances in fuel-cell technology are leading to low-emission, high-efficiency alternative fuel vehicles. In fact, seventy percent of all patent applications cite non-profit or federally-funded research as a core component to the innovation being  patented.  People  are  living longer, with a higher quality of life, in a better economy due to processes, procedures,  and  equipment which  are based on federally-funded research. What I am afraid of is that many people are not aware that these products do not simply appear out of nowhere. They are the result of a basis of knowledge which has been built up by researchers supported by federal funding. American  companies pull  from  this knowledge base in order to develop the latest high-tech products which you and I read about in the paper and see on our store shelves every day. I view this knowledge base as a bank. The U.S. government puts in modest amounts of funding in the form of support for scientific research. The payback comes from the economic growth which is produced as this knowledge is turned into actual products by American companies. In fact, a large part of the current rosy economic situation is due to our dominant high-tech  industries. Hightech companies are currently responsible for one-third of our economic output and half of our economic growth. However, if we are to continue at this pace, we need to support the fundamental, pre-competitive research critical to these industries, at the necessary levels, and in a stable manner from year to year, and we need to do so now. In the last session of the 105th Congress  Senators  FRIST,  BINGAMAN, DOMENICI, GRAMM, BREAUX, BURNS, and I introduced S. 2217, the Federal Research Investment Act, and previous to that Senators DOMENICIand BINGAMAN, introduced S. 1305, the National Research Investment Act. Both S. 1305 and S. 2217 have been extremely successful in galvanizing members of the scientific and engineering community to pull together and work constructively towards a common ideal. In addition, it has brought together the cosponsors of these bills and moved them forward as a group with their original idea. S. 2217 passed without dissent in the Senate at the end of last session, and gained 36 co-sponsors—18 Democrats and 18 Republicans. Our aim, in re-introducing  the Federal Research Investment Act,  is to now take the next step in this process, bringing to fruition the goals of our bill. The Federal Research  Investment Act is a long-term vision for federal R&D funding. It creates legislative language which stresses the importance of R&D funding to the strength of our nation’s  innovation  infrastructure.  It also sets out guidelines for Congress to use in prioritizing funding decisions. Just three years ago, federal science funding was in a serious decline and fewer than half a dozen members of Congress gave  it any attention, but now as a significant consequence of both S. 1305 and S. 2217 the trend, at least in the last two years, seems to have reversed and a universal spirit of cooperation for strong R&D funding is developing on all fronts. In the last two years the science budget has increased above inflation. In particular, for Fiscal Year 1999, an unprecedented 10% increase in civilian R&D funding was appropriated. Yet, we appear to be in a crisis situation once again due to unexpected budgetary constraints resulting from last year’s appropriations. Thus, we need to continue our fight to implement the R&D budgetary guidelines in our bill. This uncertainty in the level of R&D funding from year to year can be as detrimental to the health of the scientific enterprise as a lack of adequate funding levels. It will be a sad day for our nation, and its future economic prosperity, if we manage to lose what progress we have made to date. Based on a careful review and analysis of our past history, our bill authorizes an annual funding increase of 5.5%, starting  in the year 2000 and going through 2010, for federally-funded, civilian, R&D programs. This would increase federal R&D spending to 2.6% of total, overall budget by 2010, a near doubling in R&D funding from 1998 levels. In order to make sure that these increases are  fully  incorporated  into budgetary process we request that the President include these increases in his annual budget request to Congress. We are currently in an economic upturn. This continues to be a perfect ",1999
5,Senate,106,0.109,51,1999-01-22,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my colleagues in introducing  this  Patients’  Bill  of Rights, which is the product of more than a year’s worth of intensive work and negotiations by the Senate Republican Health Care Task Force on which I serve. This comprehensive  legislation has three major purposes. First, it will protect patients’ rights and hold HMOs accountable for providing the care they have promised. Second, it will expand consumer choice and access to affordable care. And third, it will improve health care quality and outcomes. Mr. President,  there  is a growing unease  across  our  country  about changes in how we receive our health care. People worry that if they or their loved ones become seriously ill, their HMO will deny  them  coverage and force them to accept either inadequate care or financial ruin—or perhaps both. They feel that vital decisions affecting their lives will be made, not by a supportive family doctor, but by an unfeeling  bureaucracy.  The American people, known  for  taking charge of their destiny, feel increasingly powerless about their health care. Our bill will ensure that medical decisions remain in the hands of patients and physicians, not HMO accountants and trial lawyers. All of us agree that medically-necessary patient care should not be sacrificed to the bottom line. However, according to a 1997 study by Lewin, every one percent increase in health care premiums results in as many as 400,000 uninsured Americans.  I have  therefore been alarmed by reports that American businesses  everywhere—from  large multinational corporations to the corner  store—are  facing huge hikes  in health  insurance  premiums  in  1999, ranging from about 8 percent on average, to 20 percent or more. This is a remarkable  contrast  to  the  last  few years, when premiums rose less than 2 or 3 percent, if at all. We are engaged in an extremely delicate balancing act as we attempt to respond to concerns about quality, without resorting to unduly burdensome federal controls and mandates that will further drive up costs, causing thousands of Americans to lose their coverage and pushing health  insurance further out of reach for many uninsured Americans. Our Patients’ Bill of Rights does not pre-empt, but rather builds upon the good work that states have done in the area of patients’  rights and protections.  Congress  agreed  that  states should have primary responsibility for the  regulation  of  health  insurance when it passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945. And, as someone who has overseen a Bureau of Insurance in state government, I think state regulators have done a good job of responding to the needs and concerns of their citizens. For instance, at my last count, 44 states had passed laws prohibiting ‘‘gag clauses’’ that restrict communications between patients and their doctors, and the remaining six had bills pending in their legislatures. States acted without any mandate or prod from Washington to protect consumers. Moreover, one size does not fit all, and what may be appropriate for one state may not be necessary in another. Florida, for instance, provides for direct access to a dermatologist, which is understandable, given the high rate of skin cancer  in that state. But  in a state like Maine this may not be so important. So why does Congress need to act? The answer  is that  federal  law prohibits states from regulating the selffunded,  employer-sponsored  health plans that cover 48 million Americans. Our bill extends many of the same rights and protections to these individuals and their families that Americans ",1999

7,Senate,106,-0.342,58,1999-01-22,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, on January 13th, a Fairchild based KC–135 crashed near Geilenkirchen Air Base in Germany. Today, Team Fairchild and its many supporters gathered at the Spokane Opera House to grieve and to honor the memories of four members of the Washington Air National Guard who perished aboard the KC–135 in the service to our country. I have had the pleasure of traveling to Fairchild Air Force Base on numerous occasions and meeting with the fine men and women there. They provide an indispensable part of our nation’s defense and serve with pride and professionalism. I know that this tragedy hits especially hard on that closeknit community, and so it is with a heavy heart that I join them in their grief. The four who died in the crash were members of the Washington Air National Guard 141st Air Refueling Wing, based at Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, Washington. Members of the 141st Air Refueling Wing were in Germany for training purposes and were participating in a routine NATO flight to refuel surveillance planes. The fallen men were  all  from Washington state, all family men, and all heroes. Major David W. Fite, the pilot of the KC–135, was a  resident of Bellevue, Washington. He began his service in the Washington Air National Guard in 1991. He  is  survived by his wife, a brother and his parents. Captain Kenneth F. Thiele, co-pilot, was a resident of Spokane, Washington and served in the Washington Air National Guard since September 1998. He is survived by his wife. Major Matthew F. Laiho, navigator, was a resident of Spokane, Washington and served in the Washington Air National Guard since 1989. He is survived by his wife, two children and his parents. Technical  Sergeant  Richard  D. Visintainer, boom operator, was also a resident of Spokane, Washington. His service in the Washington Air National Guard began in 1972. He is survived by his former wife and children. Colonel  James Wynne,  the Wing Commander, was quoted, ‘‘The guard is such a close-knit extended family that this will certainly send a wave of grief throughout the unit. This is a tragic loss.’’ Colonel Wynne  is right. Fairchild grieves  today,  its  spirit challenged by tragedy. I know Team Fairchild will serve as a comfort to grieving families and fellow Air Force personnel. My thoughts and prayers are with the  families of Major Fite, Captain Thiele, Major Laiho  and  Sergeant Visintainer. Each will be missed. Each will be remembered.∑ f EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES AND EXCELLENCE ACT OF 1999 ∑",1999
8,Senate,106,0.407,58,1999-01-22,Mr. COVERDELL.," Mr.  President, yesterday,  I  introduced  the  Educational Opportunities and Excellence Act of 1999. This legislation represents the Republican vision how we can improve  educational  opportunities  for every American child. Last year, Congressional Republicans passed an educational agenda to provide every child in America with firstclass learning opportunities in safe, secure  schools,  to  give  parents  new choices  and more  decision-making power over their children’s education, and to bring common-sense reforms to a myriad of redundant and antiquated federal education programs. Unfortunately, the special interests in Washington were resistant to change and fought desperately against our reform efforts. This is what happened: WHATWEPROPOSEDANDWHATHAPPENED (1) A+ Accounts—President vetoed. (2) Block Grants—Passed Senate, dropped in conference. (3) Charter Schools—Signed into law.

9,,106,0.484,1,1999-02-11,Mr. GIBBONS.," Madam Speaker, the  issue of nuclear waste is simply one of  the safety. H.G. Wells once said that  human history becomes more and more  a race between education and catastrophe. Let me say that nothing in the  history of mankind has withstood the  test of time and the construction of  10,000 years.  What was state-of-the-art technology  and engineered safe as late as 1970 has  often been shown and proven to be an  unsafe  solution  today.  Americans  should never allow short-term safety  issues that are as serious as nuclear  waste to become long-term problems  hundreds of years from now.  I believe  that  standards based on  sound science, along with the protection, the safety and the welfare of this  Nation’s citizens, should be the fundamental threshold when we address nuclear waste storage. H.R. 45, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999, will  mandate upon the State of Nevada and  this Nation the most environmentally  egregious and deadly decree, a death  sentence that preempts the National  Environmental Policy Act,  the Safe  Drinking Water Act, and any other  Federal, State, or local laws that may  be inconsistent with this bill.

10,,106,-0.582,1,1999-02-11,Mr. KUCINICH.," Madam  Speaker,  today we will be considering H.R. 391,  the Small Business Paperwork Reduction Act Amendments. This bill  is  strongly opposed by the administration, and four department heads will  recommend a veto if the bill is passed  in its current form.  The concern stems from a provision  that bars agencies from assessing civil  penalties  for most  first-time paperwork violations. This provision allows  businesses  one  free  violation,  even  when the violation is intentional. This  sets up a bizarre circumstance where  bad-faith actors would have little or no  incentive to comply with paperwork requirements. They would know  that  once caught, they could not be fined.  When bad-faith actors do not file paperwork, it is extremely difficult for  the government to detect illegal activity. The government would not be able  to identify businesses that are putting  workers,  consumers,  and  seniors  in  jeopardy.  I will be offering an amendment that  will provide penalty relief  for  first-  time  violators  without  giving  an  across-the-board waiver to those who  intentionally violate the  law. If my  amendment is adopted, the veto threat  will likely be dropped and the bill can  become law. I urge Members’ support  for my amendment to H.R. 391.  f  TRIBUTE TO SUSAN B. ANTHONY  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, this Monday will mark the 179th anniversary of the birth of Susan B.

12,House,106,-0.582,8,1999-02-11,Mr. KUCINICH.," Madam Speaker,  I  want to acknowledge the fact that my  good friend the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MCINTOSH) and I have tried to  work together to craft a bill which we  could have agreement on. H.R. 391 is  not that bill, but it would be nice if it  was.  I am glad that the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. MCINTOSH) has just  indicated in this discussion, where we  both favor an open rule, that he will  come forward with an amendment to  try to make the bill a little bit better.  I would humbly and respectfully suggest to my good friend the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. MCINTOSH), that I  have had the chance to look at that  amendment, and, while we will be talking about it later, I thought I would  mention at this moment, while we have  the opportunity, to say that the gentleman is coming along in the right direction, but it is not far enough to protect some of the health and safety and  environmental concerns which we are  very concerned about.  I would just like the gentleman to  think about this, because in the next  two hours, maybe this Congress can  come to the whole direction and get  support  for the amendment which  I  will be offering under the open rule.  As I have understood the amendment  which the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  MCINTOSH) will be bringing  forward  under this open rule, agencies would  still be prevented from assessing fines  for  intentional and malicious violations. As I understand the amendment  which will be offered under this open  rule, which I support, the amendment  of the gentleman  from Indiana  (Mr.  MCINTOSH) would not provide any protections for the environment, and that  the amendment, as I read  it, would  make  it  still almost  impossible  to  prove that a violation, not an intervening action, would pose a serious  harm.  So while I support the open rule, I  thought I would comment that while  the amendment  that  the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. MCINTOSH) will be offering is starting to come in the right  direction, we still have some major  problems here, so we just do not leap  over and defeat the purpose of the open  rule, which is to give us the opportunity to bring out our amendments  and debate our possibilities, because I  am sure Madam Speaker and many in  the Congress  have  read  the  novel  Catch-22 by Joseph Heller, and what is  being offered  to  the Congress  is a  Catch-22, in which you can fine someone  if there  is a potential to cause  harm, but, Madam Speaker, and this is  what this is all going to be about in the  next few hours, we do not know if there  is a potential harm if there is no paperwork being filed.  So I would say to my friend, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MCINTOSH), I  am sure the next few hours will be interesting as we are able to explore  some of these contradictions under this  open rule.

15,House,106,0.516,15,1999-02-11,Mr. HOEKSTRA.," Mr. Chairman,  thank my colleague for yielding.  As part of my work on the Committee on Education and the Workforce,  I chair the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations, and  in  1998 we went to the GAO and we asked  them to take a look at paperwork as it  affected America’s  businesses. They  came back with a proposal, and they  were going to take a look at companies  in the State of California, to take a  look at the Federal laws and the overlay of State laws that would affect a  business within that company. They  would take a look at the compliance  requirements flowing from the Federal  and State laws. They would take a look  at the types of assistance that was  available to different firms. And then  they would take a look at the impact  of workplace and tax laws, the impact  that they would have on human resource operations.  What did  they  find? Well,  in  the  State of California they  found that  there were 26 key Federal statutes that  would impact a small- or medium-sized  business.  Interestingly  enough,  they  also found that there is no single public  agency, State  or Federal,  that  would coordinate or provide a single  point of contact for these small businesses, no single place to go to to get  an understanding of, as a small business person, what do I have to do and  how do I comply with the law?  What did these managers tell the  GAO? Here are some of the things they  said: Rules and regulations from the  Federal Government  are  ambiguous  under the  law. They are constantly  dealing with shifting sands. It means  the regulations or the impact or how  they are interpreted evolve over time.  What H.R. 391 does is it starts to deal  with these kinds of issues. It would put  all of the rules or a comprehensive list  of all the Federal paperwork requirements on the Internet, a single place to  go to to get the information. It would  offer small businesses compliance assistance. They go to a small business  and say, we are going to help you comply with the regulations. Establish a  paperwork czar. A single point of contact for small business so that there  would be a place to go to to get an understanding. And finally the most important might be that we would get a  process that would outline streamlined  requirements for small business.  ",1999
16,House,106,-0.473,22,1999-02-11,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  Kucinich amendment. I want to clarify  what the disagreements are on this legislation. No one disagrees with  the  idea, as far as I know, that we ought to  reduce the amount of paperwork which  burdens small and large businesses. Unnecessary  paperwork  is  inexcusable,  and I think a great deal of credit goes  to Vice President GOREin his efforts to  reinvent government, to try to avoid  the requirements that so much paperwork be required from different businesses.  The second thing we do not disagree  about is that if a small businessman or  woman inadvertently does not do what  is required by way of paperwork regulations, we do not want them to be  fined or penalized  in any way when  they do it inadvertently. The Kucinich  amendment would make sure that if it  is  an  inadvertent  violation,  there  would be amnesty for the person violating the law.  The difference that we have is that  the Kucinich amendment makes clear  that if there is a danger to the public  safety, if there is danger to the environment or health, and the violation is  intentional, that we do not preclude  the agency from giving the sanction to  fit the offense.  The bill before us assumes that any  time a violation occurs, it is innocent,  but that is just not true. There are people who do wrong things on purpose,  and if we tell them, if they do something wrong on purpose, they do not  have to worry about being sanctioned,  we are suggesting that they ought to  go ahead and violate the requirements  of  the paperwork  regulations. Now,  that means  that  the businessperson  who is trying to comply with the regulations is going to be put at a disadvantage with somebody who is not doing  what they ought to do to meet the requirements of the law.  Now, this is not some insignificant  matter, because there are far-reaching  consequences for our Nation’s health,  environmental,  consumer  protection  laws,  that  the Kucinich amendment  would preserve the integrity of these  laws while at the same time providing  relief to first-time violators in appropriate  circumstances. Not  all  circumstances, but appropriate ones. And  the bill before us would give them a  pass for all circumstances.  We have received a number of letters  from our colleagues who are experts in  certain areas. The gentleman from New  York (Mr. TOWNS) is one of Congress’s  leading fighters against lead poisoning  of children, and he described how H.R.  391 would undermine lead hazard disclosure, putting thousands of children  at risk. We ought not to give that kind  of encouragement for people who violate the law and put children at risk.  Our  colleague  from  the State  of  Maryland (Mr. HOYER) is one of the cochairs of the Congressional Fire Fighters Caucus, and he has pointed out that  H.R. 391 would endanger the lives of  fire fighters because this bill gives a  first-time free pass to businesses that  fail to report the storage of hazardous  chemicals on  site. This  is different  than somebody who does not change a  light bulb. No one wants to penalize  that person. But not to report hazardous chemicals that are stored on  site which could hurt fire fighters is  just not reasonable.  The gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. MARKEY) is one of the leading congressional experts on  the Securities  and Exchange Commission, and he tells  us that the bill undermines the SEC’s  ability to protect investors from fraud.  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  PALLONE) is a champion of the right-to-  know laws which require polluters to  report the level of their toxic emissions, and he says these laws would be  unenforceable under this legislation.  The amendment that the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. MCINTOSH) offers, he  claims would solve the problem, but it  does not. We still have the goal of  many reporting requirements, which is  to prevent the public from being placed  in danger, undermined. It defeats the  purpose  of  these  reporting  requirements, to prevent enforcement until  after the public is already in danger.  That is locking the barn door after the  horse has already gone.  We do not have adequate exceptions  to protect the public health. Expert  after expert has considered this argument and rejected it. Let me say who  some of these experts are.  The CHAIRMAN.

18,House,106,0.361,36,1999-02-11,Mr. EWING.," Mr. Speaker, I am a cosponsor on H.R. 3, and I ask unanimous  consent to have my name removed as a  cosponsor of that legislation.  ",1999
19,House,106,-0.652,36,1999-02-11,Mr. FILNER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  call  the attention of  the  House to five bills I have introduced to  address some major concerns of our Nation’s service members, military retirees and veterans.  The  first  is H.R. 363, the Military  Survivor’s Equity Act. It is hard to believe that we continue to condone a  system that penalizes the aging widows  of our Nation’s veterans, but that is exactly what the Military Survivors Benefits Plan does. When a member of the  military retires, he or she may join the  Survivors Benefits Plan, known as the  SBP. After  paying  a  premium  for  many, many years, the retiree expects  that his or her spouse will receive 55  percent of the retired military pay.  Most of the survivors who receive  SBP benefits are military widows. You  may not realize that when these widows who are receiving SBP benefits  turn 62, a Social Security offset causes  their benefits to be reduced from 55  percent to 35 percent of their husband’s  military retiree pay. This occurs even  when the Social Security comes from  the wife’s employment.  What does this reduction mean to our  Nation’s military widows? I have received many  letters on this subject.  Let me  just  read  from one.  I am  quoting:  ‘‘My husband, who  served  in  the  Army for 20 years, was on Social Security disability because of heart problems and could no longer work. He died  in July, 1995. I was then 61 years old. I  received Social Security income plus  my SBP. With both of these incomes, I  was doing fine paying my monthly bills  and having enough left for groceries.  When I turned 62, I was notified that  my SBP was reduced from $476 to $302.  What a shock. This was my grocery  money that they took away from me.’’  It is time to change this misleading,  unfair law. We must provide some equity to the surviving spouses of our  military retirees. My bill would fix this  problem by eliminating the callous and  absurd reduction in benefits and give  what is expected and what is deserved:  55 percent of the military retired pay.  To put it simply, no offset. A simple  solution to a difficult problem, an equitable solution to a mean-spirited practice.  The second bill is H.R. 364, the Veterans’ Training and Employment Bill  of Rights Act. This would ensure that  service-disabled veterans and veterans  who serve in combat areas will be first  in line for federally funded training-related  services and programs. Under  current law, veterans are often underserved by national programs such as  the Job Training Partnership Act because  it  sometimes mistakenly  assumes that the veterans receive the  same  services  from  the VA Department. My bill would reinforce our commitment to provide special training assistance for veterans and make it clear  that eligible veterans have earned a  place at the front of the line.  The bill would also establish the first  effective appeals process for veterans  who believe their rights have been violated under veterans’ employment-related programs. The Secretary of Labor  would be required to help veterans who  believe that Federal contractors have  not met their obligation to hire veterans and to help veterans who believe  they were not given preference for enrollment in Federal training programs.  This bill would provide the teeth that  have been missing from some veterans’  training programs and would go a long  way  toward ensuring  that veterans’  rights are respected.  A third bill is H.R. 366, the Veterans’  Entrepreneurship Promotion Act.  b1530  Many veterans have told me that  they would like to own a small business, and our national economy would  certainly be strengthened if more veterans were able to establish their own  companies. This bill is designed to do  just that, by establishing a program to  help disabled and other eligible veteran-owned small businesses compete  for Federal contracts. Also included is  a program of training, counseling and  management assistance  for veterans  interested in starting a small business.  Veterans who want to pursue self-employment should be supported and encouraged.  H.R. 365 is the Let Our Military Buy  a Home Act. Under this plan, the Department of Defense,  in cooperation  with Veterans Affairs, would be permitted to test a program designed to  relieve  the military housing  crisis.  Military personnel stationed in areas  where the supply of suitable military  housing is adequate, as in my hometown of San Diego, could purchase  homes for themselves and their families at  reduced  interest  rates. This  practice would reduce the cost of building on-base housing and would expand  opportunities for service members to  own their own homes.  Initially introduced in the 104th Congress by our good friend and former  colleague, the honorable and legendary  G.V. Sonny Montgomery, and included  in Public Law 104–106, this program was  inexplicably not implemented by the  Department of Defense. Sonny’s idea is  a good one and I encourage you to join  in pursuing this creative approach to  dealing with the military housing program.  Finally, a bill to Extend Commissary  and Exchange Store Privileges, H.R.  362. This legislation would allow veterans with service-connected disability  to use commissary and exchange stores  on the same basis as the members of  the Armed Forces entitled to retired  pay. I believe that these veterans have  earned the right to commissary privileges.  f  REJECT THE PRESIDENT’S  BUDGET  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  GREENof Wisconsin). Under a previous  order of the House, the gentleman from  California (Mr. HERGER) is recognized  for 5 minutes.  ",1999
20,House,106,0.551,36,1999-02-11,Mr. HERGER.," Mr. Speaker,  if one  were to believe the White House and all  they are saying regarding the debt of  our Nation, one would be convinced  that the President’s recently released  FY 2000 budget is good fiscal policy for  future generations. Unfortunately, the  exact opposite is true.  The White House would  like  the  American people and this Congress to  believe that the national debt is going  down under their budget, but page 389  of the President’s own budget from his  Office  of Management  and Budget  shows a very different picture.  Looking at the chart, we see that the  total national debt goes up from $5.394  trillion in 1998 to $5.576 trillion in 1999,  and to almost $5.8 trillion in the Year  2000, and the red ink continues to rise  every year under Clinton’s budget.  The truth is, the total Federal debt  under the Clinton plan does not go  down, as the President would like the  American people to believe. In fact, the  total Federal debt goes up to the tune  of over $1.3 trillion over the next five  years.  I asked the President’s Budget Director, Jacob Lew, during a recent Committee on the Budget hearing about  this discrepancy, and he was evasive  about the fact that the President’s own  budget called for a $1.3 trillion more in  debt on our children and grandchildren.  I then asked Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin the next day during a Ways  and Means hearing the same question,  and Secretary Rubin refused to answer  a  simple yes or no question about  whether the total debt is going up.  Regardless  of where  the  debt  is  placed, it will still need to be paid, and  guess who will pay it?

21,House,106,-0.389,43,1999-02-11,Mr. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank the gentleman  from Arkansas  (Mr. BERRY) for organizing this important time for us to speak today, and I  am so honored to join my colleagues  and the others really who are speaking  around the country who are trying to  give voice to our seniors as we bring to  the attention of the House of Representatives a veritable scandal, I believe, which is occurring in our country  today.  I know that seniors on the central  coast of California, where I live, and I  believe that we are seeing evidence  that seniors throughout the country,  are paying outrageously high prices for  their prescription drugs. Even worse,  these inflated costs subsidize the discounts that high-profit HMOs get for  these very same drugs. These inflated  costs are rising every day, so they are  rising at a faster rate even than the  cost of living. Seniors are paying more  this month  than  they  paid  a  few  months ago for their prescription medications. And this unfair practice has  caused many of our older Americans to  cut back on their medications, leading  some to choose between buying food or  filling their prescriptions.  Last September I conducted the first  comprehensive  study of  the  impact  that these big drug companies’ high  prices are having on the central coast  of California’s senior citizens. My office then released a report on the cost  of prescription drugs for seniors and,  more importantly, a major reason why  these costs are so high, and the findings are startling.  Seniors in my district pay, on average, 113 percent more for the 10 most  widely prescribed drugs than do the  HMOs buying the same drugs. These  are critical medications, like Zocor, for  reducing cholesterol; Norvase, for reducing  high  blood  pressure;  and  Relafen, for relief from arthritis. Prescription drug companies give huge discounts to managed care companies for  these and other drugs. Other buyers,  such as pharmacists, pay substantially  more for the same drugs and must pass  those higher costs on to their customers, many of whom are seniors.  The average senior  fills between 9  and 12 prescriptions a year. This is a  far greater number than any other segment of our population. It is estimated  that the elderly, who make up approximately 12 percent of the population,  use one-third of all the prescription  drugs.  Today,  in Santa Barbara,  in  the  News-Press, our local newspaper, it was  reported that Ticlid, one of the most  widely prescribed medications for persons who have had strokes, sells to  HMOs for around $34 for 60 tablets. In  my district, the average price seniors,  who have to pay out-of-pocket for this  drug,  are  being  charged  an  overwhelming $131, nearly a 300 percent  markup over the price the HMOs are  paying.  This huge difference in prices is not  going  to  the  retail pharmacists  in  Santa Barbara or Santa Maria or Arroyo Grande. According to my study,  the local pharmacists on the central  coast are paying an average of $100 to  $110 for Ticlid.  The final price seniors pay includes  only a reasonable markup to the outrageous  price  that  pharmacists  are  being forced to pay to the drug companies. No, the extra money the seniors  are paying goes to the drug company so  it can continue giving big discounts to  HMOs and managed care companies.  It is a very sad story that seniors are  paying more in money for drugs than  they should while HMOs are reaping a  huge profit based partly on the huge  discounts they get from drug companies. But there is an even sadder element. Many seniors simply cannot afford these high prices. They live on  fixed incomes, especially as they keep  on rising. So, instead, they take half  the prescribed dose or they do not buy  these  lifesaving drugs because  they  cost too much.  For example, Harriet MacGregor, in  Santa Barbara, told my staff that because of the high cost of her five prescriptions she must sometimes skip or  reduce her dosage. As a nurse, I am  particularly appalled when I hear these  stories. This  is an  intolerable situation. Seniors should not have to be subsidizing the profits of the HMOs, and  they should not have to choose between  filling  their  prescriptions  or  buying food or paying rent.  I want to give credit to the pharmaceutical  houses  for  developing  the  medications  that  save  seniors’  lives  and enable them to live quality lives  longer. These drugs are keeping our  older Americans out of hospitals and  out of nursing homes. We want them to  take the medications. We have to find  a way for them to be able to do this.  Yesterday, I was a proud cosponsor of  legislation to address this issue. This  Prescription Drug Fairness Act  for  Seniors, introduced by my good friends  and colleagues,  the gentleman  from  Texas (Mr. JIMTURNER), the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. TOMALLEN), and the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. MARION  BERRY), will allow pharmacists an opportunity to receive the same big discounts that HMOs get for the drugs  that they dispense to seniors. This cost  saving will be passed on to the seniors.  This  legislation  is  long overdue and  will ensure that seniors pay reasonable  prices for the lifesaving drugs they so  desperately need. I urge my colleagues  to support this legislation.  This important bill brings to mind  another related problem: 35 percent of  American seniors have no prescription  drug coverage. Medicare, this health  safety net for millions of elderly and  disabled Americans, does not  cover  outpatient prescription drugs. So many  seniors are forced to pay for these spiraling costs with absolutely no assistance.  Mr. Speaker, we must examine ways  to improve Medicare. As we do that, I  believe we must seriously consider extending prescription drug benefits to  the elderly and to the disabled. We  should also ensure that seniors are not  subject to pharmaceutical price discrimination.  In closing, we can and should do everything we can to safeguard access to  these life-extending and life-enhancing  prescription medications for our seniors. I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak.  ",1999
22,House,106,-0.592,50,1999-02-11,Mr. PAYNE.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to add my  support  to  the  continuation of  the  peace process in the north of Ireland.  As we all know, the Good Friday Accords were promulgated nearly a year  ago this April, with the best intent in  mind, to end the authoritarian rule and  domination of  the Protestant party  over the minority Catholics. It gave  Catholics a real voice for once by ending 3 decades of conflict in the north of  Ireland.  Last marching season, last July 4th  weekend I had the opportunity to travel again on my several trips to the  north of Ireland, and I was there during  that march when  the Orange Order  came into Drumcree, and the standoff  was there. That was a tragic week. Following the standoff in Drumcree, 3 little boys were  fire-bombed to death.  Very sad and brutal.  People started to think that perhaps  enough is enough, to continue to celebrate the victory of William of Orange,  in which Irish land was seized and confiscated, is really an insult to the people of  Ireland and Catholics everywhere. Sadly, this parade glorifies a  part of history and is really provocative in nature. So we felt that with the  Good Friday Accords that this would  be behind us. So one can imagine the  excitement when President Clinton,  along with those of us here, went to  celebrate the Good Friday Accords.  I believed that the political prisoner  release of paramilitary groups on both  sides was certainly an issue that was a  tough issue. I know that perhaps Tony  Blair is receiving pressure to overturn  this rule. I think this would set a bad  precedent for all involved if this was  overturned.  In the same light, I know that the decommissioning  issue was one of the  last issues discussed before all parties  made the last push towards peace. I  think we know  that disarming  the  paramilitaries was going to be very difficult, and we know  it  is a tough,  sticky issue in most negotiations, even  with the Palestine and Israel negotiations. The tough issues are put last,  what should happen to the Holy City.  So we are at the tough times.  But let me say that the peace agreement does not explicitly require a start  on disarmament, but it seems like politics is dictating this. I would hope that  we could work out a solution. We have  gone too far, we have suffered too long.  We really believe that peace  in the  north of Ireland is irreversible, but we  do need cooperation from all parties.  I would also like to conclude by adding an article  that was  in  today’s  Washington Post by a Mary McGrory  who had an article called the Art of  Understanding, and it talked about a  dinner that was held Sunday evening  at the Irish Embassy, but it was a little bit different. She said the number  of blacks and whites were equally divided, and the new mayor of the city  was there, and the chairman of the Republican National Committee was also  there. They talked about issues of commonality, and the thing that was interesting about this is that the Anacostia  area of Washington is an area where  Frederick Douglas lived.  b1745  He moved  into the area, although  blacks were restricted, and he even had  an  integrated marriage. He moved  there, anyway.  But  there was an  Irish patriarch  named Daniel O’Connell who Frederick  Douglass admired. Frederick Douglass  heard him speak in 1845, when Frederick Douglass went to Dublin. The  two men often spoke in public. Douglass and O’Connell often complimented  each other. This article is extremely  interesting.  Please allow me to  include  in the  RECORDthis article from today’s Washington Post, which talked about two  great fighters for freedom in the 1800’s,  Frederick Douglass, the great African  American  spokesperson of  the  time,  and Daniel O’Connell, an Irish patriot.  The article referred to is as follows:  (From the Washington Post, Feb. 11, 1999)  THEARTOFUNDERSTANDING  (By Mary McGrory)  It wasn’t your usual diplomatic do last  Sunday night at the  Irish Embassy. The  guests, for one thing, were about equally divided between blacks and whites, which  doesn’t happen much unless African dignitaries are visiting. For another, the city’s  new mayor, Tony Williams, was there, and so  was the chairman of the Republican National  Committee, Jim Nicholson.  The company had been invited by the Irish  ambassador, Sean O’Huiginn, and his artist  wife, Bernadette, to stop by for supper on  their way to Union Station, where an exhibit  of art in Anacostia, the capital’s stepchild  ward, was opening. The mayor was there to  encourage the ‘‘Hope in Our City’’ initiative  as just the kind of rational enterprise he  hopes will occur in his administration. And  Nicholson was on hand as ‘‘spouse of’’ his  artist wife, Suzanne. Her warm, evocative  painting of three abandoned buildings on  Martin Luther King Avenue so charmed the  mayor that he put it on his Christmas card.  Suzanne Nicholson’s husband’s party may  have trouble with African American voters,  but she is a heroine in Anacostia. Although  it is most known for its high unemployment  and low rate of trash collection, she finds it  a place of beauty and inspiration. She visits  often, and patronizes the Imani Cafe, across  the street from the scene of her painting.  The Irish ambassador told the gathering  about an old tie between Anacostia’s most  famous inhabitant Frederick Douglass and  the great  Irish patriot, Daniel O’Connell.  The two mighty champions of the oppressed  were friends.  Douglass admired O’Connell’s fiery speeches on liberty. He realized his dream of a  meeting in 1845, when he went to Dublin. The  two spoke often in public, Douglass of a race  in chains, O’Connell about a nation deprived  of all rights and liberties.  Bernadette O’Huiginn created a sculpture  to commemorate the tie between green and  black. She found a Celtic cross in the gift  shop of the National Cathedral, chains to  drape over it at Hechinger’s; hunted down a  slave’s iron collar and bought a shotput ball  that she ‘‘aged’’ for the exhibit.  At one side of the drawing room, which  throbbed with the good cheer of people of the  same town  in search of the same thing,  Chairman Nicholson talked more about politics than the arts. Guests sought his views  on censure—he’s against—and the  luck of  Clinton. ‘‘Can you believe,’’ he asked with  hands spread wide,  ‘‘that the pope would  come and the king would die all  in the  month he needed them the most?’’ He meant,  of course, that the pope’s visit to St. Louis  gave him a chance to place a filial hand  under the pope’s elbow and King Hussein’s  death gave him a chance to comfort a queen  and be pictured with three ex-presidents.  Impeachment has only widened the gulf between Republicans and African Americans,  who see Clinton as a fellow victim of persecution by the authorities.  Across the room, guests crowded around  the mayor to wish him well or to give him  advice. Williams has just weathered his first  big flap—brought on by a career umbrage-  taker  in the city’s employ who does not  know the meaning of the word ‘‘niggardly.’’  After they had supped on curried lamb and  Irish potatoes, the guests went to their cars  and headed for Union Station to see a high  display of photographs and paintings that  were all by or about the people of Anacostia.  They were pictured as prophets and angels or  just infinitely appealing human beings. It is  a vivid, intimate view of a neighborhood that  never had much going for it, but that now  has the attention of its fellow citizens. The  Washington Arts Group, which arranged the  show, says it seeks ‘‘reconciliation through  art.’’ It seemed quite a plausible goal Sunday  night.

23,Senate,106,0.342,64,1999-02-11,Mr. GRASSLEY.,"  I agree with my colleagues from Montana and Mississippi about this very important issue. The development and use of alternative fuels are important to this nation, and we must encourage their use and development. Wind energy has long been recognized as an abundant potential  source of electric power. A detailed analysis by the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest Laboratory in 1991 estimated the energy potential of the U.S. wind resource at 10.8 trillion kilowatt hours annually, or more than three times  total current U.S. electricity consumption. Wind energy is a clean resource that produces electricity with virtually no carbon dioxide emissions. There is nothing limited or controversial about this source of energy. Americans need only to make the necessary investments in order to capture it for power. The Production Tax Credit, section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. This tax credit is a sound low-cost investment in an emerging sector of the energy industry. I introduced the first bill that contained this tax credit, so you can be sure that I am sincere in my belief in the need to develop this resource. This tax credit currently provides a 1.5 cent per kilowatt hour credit for energy produced from a new facility brought on-line after December 31, 1993 and before July 1, 1999 for the first ten years of the facility’s existence. Last Fall, I introduced a bill to extend this tax credit for five years. My legislation, S. 1459, currently has 22 cosponsors, including half of the Finance Committee. The House companion legislation, introduced by Congressman Thomas, currently has 90 cosponsors, including over half of the Ways and Means Committee. These numbers are a strong testament to the importance of the section 45, and renewable fuels in general. In addition, I plan to work to expand this tax credit to allow use of the closed-loop biomass portion of this tax credit. Switchgrass from my state and other Midwestern states, eucalyptus from the South, and other biomass, can be grown for the exclusive purpose of producting energy. This is a productive use of our land, and will be an important step in our use and development of alternative and renewable fuels. I was very pleased to see that Congress expressed its understanding of the importance of alternative and renewable fuels by extending the ethanol tax credit in this year’s T–2 legislation. These tax credits are a successful way of promoting alternative sources of energy. These tax credits are a cheap investment with high returns for ourselves, our children, our grandchildren and even their grandchildren. Congress needs to again pass this  important  legislation to ensure that these energy tax credits are extended into the century. ",1999
24,Senate,106,0.346,64,1999-02-11,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," I concur with my colleagues. Implementation of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments is creating a real need to develop clean alternative fuels. For example, of the 64 remaining U.S. coke batteries, 58 are subject to closure as a result of the Clean Air Act. The steel industry can either use limited capital to build new clean coking facilities or they can choose to import coke from China, which uses 50 year old highly pollutant technologies. Restoring the section 29 credit to encourage cleaner coker technologies will greatly reduce emissions and will slow our increasing dependence on foreign coke, at the same time creating jobs in the United States in both the steel and coal mining industries. In addition, the United States has rich deposits of lignite and sub-bituminous coals. There are new technologies that can upgrade these coals to make them burn efficiently and economically, while at the same time significantly reducing air pollution. This is proven technology, but to make the development of this technology throughout the nation feasible, the Congress needs to provide tax incentives. ",1999
25,Senate,106,0.538,64,1999-02-11,Mr. ENZI.," The people of Wyoming have always had very strong ties to our land. That is why the words ‘‘Livestock, Oil, Grain and Mines’’ appear on our state seal. Those words clearly reflect the importance of our natural resources to the people of my state, and our commitment to using our abundant natural resources wisely and for the benefit of current and future generations of Wyomingites and the people of this country. Congress has determined the need to find newer and cleaner technologies. Wyoming is blessed with an abundance of clean burning coal reserves. It would seem to be a perfect match. We are eager to provide what is needed for our country’s present and future fuel needs. But those reserves aren’t likely to be developed unless we provide the incentives necessary to make it possible for the coal to be harvested in a safe and environmentally friendly manner. ",1999
26,Senate,106,0.311,64,1999-02-11,Mr. ABRAHAM.,"  I concur with my colleagues. The development and production of alternative fuels provides a real opportunity for the country to improve the environment while ensuring a constant, reasonably priced fuel supply. But recent efforts to provide such assurances have been hampered. For example, in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, Congress extended the placed-inservice date  for  facilities producing  synthetic fuels from coal, and gas from biomass for eighteen months. However, progress in bringing certain facilities up to full production has been hampered by the Administration’s 1997 proposal to shorten the placed-in-service date and because, in many cases, the technology used to produce the fuels is new. Such delays have created uncertainty regarding the facilities eligibility under  the placed-in-service  requirement of section 29. While it is important that the Congress consider again this issue in the 106th Congress, I would also urge the Secretary to consider  the  facilities  I mentioned qualified under Section 29 if they met the Service’s criteria for placed-in-service by June 30, 1998 whether or not such facilities were consistently producing commercial quantities of marketable products on a daily basis. ",1999
27,Senate,106,-0.296,64,1999-02-11,Mr. CONRAD.," I agree with my colleagues. Through the section 29 tax credit for nonconventional fuels, Congress has supported the development of environmentally friendly fuels  from domestic biomass and coal resources. There are lignite resources in my state that could compete in the energy marketplace if we can find a reasonable incentive  for the  investment  in the necessary technology. As soon as possible in the 106th Congress, I hope we will give this crucial subject the attention it deserves. ",1999
28,Senate,106,0.382,64,1999-02-11,Mr. HATCH.," I concur with my colleagues. This is a very important tax credit for alternative fuels. It is an issue of fairness, not one of corporate welfare. Earlier this year I, along with 18 of my colleagues, introduced a bill that would extend for eight months the placed-in-service date for coal and biomass facilities. The need still exists to extend this date and I am very disappointed that this was not included. ",1999
29,Senate,106,-0.212,64,1999-02-11,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in supporting tax incentives for alternative fuels. Our country has assumed a leadership role in the reduction of greenhouse gases because of the global importance of pollution reduction. As my colleagues have also pointed out, promotion of alternative  fuels  is not  just an environmental issue, but an issue important to our domestic economy and independence as well. We cannot afford to slip back toward policies which will leave us dependent upon foreign sources of oil for our economic growth. With the huge reserves of coal and lignite in the United States and around the world, as well as the tremendous potential for use of biomass, wind energy, and other alternatives, it is particularly important to our economy and the world’s environment that new, more environmentally friendly fuels are brought to market here and in developing nations. But bringing new technologies to market is financially risky. In particular, finding investors to take a new technology from the laboratory to the market is difficult because so many technical problems need full-scale testing and operations to resolve. Few investors are prepared to take on the risks associated with bringing a  first-of-a-kind,  full",1999
30,Senate,106,0.536,71,1999-02-11,Mr. ASHCROFT.,"  Mr.  President, today, I am introducing, with Senators BROWNBACK, BAUCUS, and KERREY, the Food and Medicine for the World Act of 1999. It’s a bill that will help America’s farmers, ranchers, and related industries, keep on selling their food and medicine to the world. For  over  200  years,  farmers  and ranchers have been vital to the growth and economic prosperity of the United States—always responding to the challenges of our competitive free-market system with efficient production methods. The agricultural industry is one of the nation’s  largest employers. Missouri  is the nation’s second  leading state in its number of farms. Clearly, the agricultural industry is a backbone to Missouri’s economy, accounting for more than $4 billion annually. The United States has the best farmers in the world—first class in their production,  storage,  transportation, processing,  and marketing. We  can produce more  food  than any other country, yet the United States only accounts for five percent of the world’s consuming population. That leaves 95 percent of the world’s consumers outside of our borders. And because of our farmers’ efficiency and ability to meet U.S. domestic demand, they rely increasingly on their ability to sell products in foreign markets. Exports now account for 30 percent of gross cash receipts for America’s farmers, and nearly 40 percent of all U.S. agricultural  production  is  exported. Therefore, it is imperative that we ensure that our farmers have ample export opportunities. Our farmers and ranchers need our help  in opening markets abroad and ",1999
31,,106,0.673,85,1999-02-11,Mr. SALMON.," Mr. Speaker, I am reintroducing  the K  through 12 Education Excellence Now (KEEN) Act, which would offer tax credits to families and businesses of up to $250 annually for qualified K through 12 education expenses or activities. Senator KYLhas reintroduced the companion in the Senate, where it has been included in the Coverdell-Lott education reform bill (S. 277). Over the last 30 years, the Federal Government has steadily increased its monetary commitment to education. Unfortunately, we have not seen a corresponding improvement in the quality of the education our children receive. The results of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), released last year,  revealed  that U.S. 12th graders scored next  to  last  in advanced math and dead last in physics. The Department of Education, which promised that the United States would lead the world in math and science by the year 2000,  can’t even  claim bragging rights over war-torn Slovenia. As to reading, which was not measured by TIMSS, 40 percent of fourth graders can’t read at the basic level. The legislation I am introducing addresses the problem of falling education scores by giving families and businesses a tax incentive to provide children with a higher quality education. Specifically,  it offers every  family or business a tax credit of up to $250 annually for any K through 12 education expense or activity. This tax credit could be applied to home schooling, public  schools  (including  charter schools), or parochial schools. Allowable expenses would include tuition, books, supplies, tutors, and computer equipment. Further, the tax credit could be given to a ‘‘school-tuition organization’’ for distribution. To qualify as a school-tuition organization, the organization would have to devote at least 90 percent of  its  income per year  to offering grants and scholarships for parents to use to send  their  children  to  the  school of  their choice. How would this work? A group of businesses in any community could join forces to send sums for which they received tax credits to  charitable  ‘‘school-tuition  organizations’’ which would make scholarships and grants available to low-income parents of children in non-functional schools. Unlike the big government proposals being peddled by President Clinton and Vice-President GORE, KEEN credits would offer families control over  the expenditure of  these education dollars, not  centralized bureaucrats. Moreover,  the bill would provide an  ‘‘emergency blood transfusion’’ to improve America’s schools immediately. In Arizona, where a limited version of this operates, inner-city schools are already profiting from an infusion of contributions from area businesses. I encourage my colleagues  to enact  the K–12  tax credit proposal as expeditiously as possible. f TRIBUTE TO MATT LANGLEY BELL III HON. JOE SCARBOROUGH OFFLORIDA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, February 11, 1999 ",1999
32,,106,0.672,85,1999-02-11,Mr. SCARBOROUGH.," Mr. Speaker, on October 15, 1998, the citizens of Pensacola and the State of Florida lost a man who dedicated his career to the pursuit of excellence in all aspects of life. This gentleman distinguished himself as a community  leader, a dedicated philanthropist, and the model of an honest and effective leader. The man that I speak about today is Matt Langley Bell III. It is natural to remember Matt Langley Bell III for his nearly 22 years of tax collecting, during which he served on the Board of Directors of the Florida Tax Collectors Inc. and the National Association of County Treasurers.  I could mention  the countless awards he has received for effective leadership, especially the Meritorious Service Award that was presented to him by the President’s Committee on Employment of the Handicapped. Or I could applaud his involvement with the March of Dimes and  the United Way where he helped raise funds and increase awareness concerning the plight of handicapped citizens. But I am sure that if Matt was with us today he would say that those accomplishments were simply part of his job. However, in my opinion Mr. Speaker, Matt went above and beyond  the call of duty by dedicating his life to helping others. At a time when our nation calls out for principled leadership from public officials, it is fitting that today we honor a professional who always went the extra mile to represent the under-represented and to promote awareness within the community, the State of Florida, and the nation. During his distinguished career, Matt Bell III came to know and respect our rights of justice and he never forgot how important that right is to the American way of life. Matt’s overall attitude and dedication to public service has been a model in the lives of the public servants  that he has  trained, supervised, and encouraged. His legacy will be a constant reminder that one person can make an extraordinary difference  in  the  lives of many. As we remember  the  life of Matt Langley Bell III, we can take pride in knowing that he has influenced so many people in a positive way. As a  fellow elected official and as a friend, I appreciate the importance of dedication and devotion to public office. I can’t think of a better way  to be reminded of  that  fact than in honoring of life of the late Matt Langley Bell Ill. INCOME EQUITY ACT OF 1999 HON. MARTIN OLAV SABO OFMINNESOTA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, February 11, 1999 ",1999
33,,106,-0.516,85,1999-02-11,Mr. SABO.," Mr. Speaker,  the American economy continues to grow at a remarkable rate and  to defy  the  troubles striking many other parts of  the world. Yet despite  the strength and prosperity of our economy, the income gap between  rich and poor  in  this country is still on the rise. The benefits of the past 20 years of growth are being shared very unevenly—the richest 20% of households now earn as much as everyone else in America put together. It was not always this way. In the years from the end of World War II through the 1970s, economic growth brought with  it greater equality. But in the past two decades this progress has been  reversed, and our country now has a more unequal economy than we did in the 1940s. As the income gap grows, working Americans are finding it harder to make ends meet. The dark secret of the 1990s expansion is that almost half of all American families have not seen  their  incomes return  to  the same purchasing power as they had before the 1990 recession. With so many people having stagnant incomes and only a few reaping most of the gains from the economy, we risk splitting our society in two. Although many forces lie behind the growing inequality of income and wealth in America, it is clear that both government and corporate America have roles to play in narrowing the gap. For this reason, I am introducing the Income Equity Act of 1999. This legislation addresses the problem by encouraging corporate responsibility. For too many years, the trend in corporate America has been to pay top executives lavishly, while thinking of other employees as an expense or not thinking of them at all. My legislation will encourage companies to take a closer  look at how  they compensate their employees at both ends of the income ladder. The Income Equity Act would place a new limit on our government’s practice of subsidizing excessive executive pay through the tax code. My  bill would  enhance  the  current $1,000,000 cap on the tax deduction for executive compensation with a cap set at 25 times the company’s lowest full-time salary. For example, if a filing clerk at a firm earns $18,000, then any amount of executive salary over $450,000 would no longer be tax deductible as a business expense. This bill will not restrict the freedom of companies to pay their workers and executives as they please. It will send a strong message, however, that in return for tax deductions, the American taxpayer expects companies to compensate their lowest-paid workers fairly. Economic inequality is a problem that will, if not addressed,  tear apart  the  fabric of our democratic society. Our government has every reason, and every right, to encourage responsible corporate citizenship. The Income Equity Act is not the ultimate answer to the widening gap between the rich and the poor, but it is an important step toward ensuring that all Americans can share in our nation’s prosperity. ",1999
34,,106,-0.082,92,1999-02-11,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing  legislation  to establish a  toll-free phone number consumers can call to get information on products made in America. Similar legislation  I authored was approved unanimously by the House in the 103d, 104th and 105th Congresses. Unfortunately,  in each of the last three Congresses, the other body did not act on the bill. My bill,  the  ‘‘Made  in America  Information Act,’’ directs  the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to contract out the program to a private company. The  toll-free number will provide consumers with information on products made in this country. The bill uses the same definition  for an American-made product  that  the FTC uses in determining uses of ‘‘Made in the USA’’ labels. Only those products with a sale price of $250 or more would be included in the program. The bill would subject any companies providing false information to federal penalties. One of the key components of my bill is  that  the program would be self-financed through  the  imposition of a modest annual registration fee on participating companies. The bill will not require the FTC to hire more people or create a new unit. The only expense to the commission would be to prepare language for the Federal Register and to prepare bid documents. Let me reemphasize that the program will be contracted out and run by a private company. Companies would participate in the program on a voluntary basis. The program would not promote or  favor one product over another. It would simply provide American consumers with information on what products are made in America. When making a big purchase, most Americans want to ‘‘Buy American.’’ This program will help them make an informed and patriotic decision. Best of all, it won’t cost taxpayers a dime. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the ‘‘Made in America Information Act.’’ f JOHN DILLON WAS THE FACE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN CENTRAL NEW YORK a man whose passing has left my community, and our nation, with one  less hero. Former Onondaga County Sheriff John Dillon died January 14, 1999 and Central New Yorkers will grieve the loss for a long time to come. The quintessential  ‘‘Irish cop’’, John Dillon was known far and wide as a man of great humor, deep compassion and innate fairness. It should also be said  that he was  tough. Throughout his  four-decade career, he was the epitome of the public safety provider. In fact, to many he was the face of law enforcement in Central New York. John Dillon was a personal friend, so I know his attributes well, among them natural leadership. He was greatly respected by  the men and women in uniform. A devout Catholic and  loving  family man, John Dillon was fiercely proud of his Irish ancestry. When  the  Irish Ambassador at  the time, Dermot Gallagher, visited Syracuse  in 1997, it was John Dillon who regaled the Ambassador with the history of the West End of Syracuse, the home to many immigrant families. With great pride and his characteristic dry wit, John Dillon  recalled  the  layout of  the neighborhood and, using nicknames  for  the colorful characters of his youth, told a touching story of an entire generation of Irish immigrant families. He  told of  the Stonethrowers,  the young men who defied city officials by  repeatedly breaking the red light over the green on the traffic  light  at  the main  intersection  of Tipperary Hill on the West End. Never would  the English red sit atop  the Irish green, he  told Ambassador Gallagher with  fervor. And  today, he pointed out,  the green sits atop the red in one traffic light in America, Tipperary Hill in Syracuse, the birthplace of John Dillon. The man we came to respect and so deeply admire served 25 years with the Syracuse Police Department before  retiring as  the First Deputy Police Chief. He was elected Onondaga County Sheriff later that year and held that post until retirement in 1994. I want  to add my sincere condolences  to John’s wonderful wife Ginny and their children. And I ask my colleagues to join me in this moment of recognition  for a public official who served his community well. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. ROBERT A.

37,,106,0.232,92,1999-02-11,Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a man whose accomplishments in the field of public education are limitless. Dr. Michael Pladus, principal of Interboro High School since only 1994,  recently received the 1999 National Principal of the Year Award in the shortest time ever recognized by its sponsors, MetLife and the National Association of Secondary School Principals. Richard Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education, presented Dr. Pladus with the award on  January 28, 1999 at  the Renaissance Mayflower Hotel  in Washington, DC. Dr. Pladus received  this honor  in recognition of his exceptional role in improving the school’s student activities, standardized testing scores, and overall climate of academia. Before going to Interboro High School four years ago, Dr. Pladus, holding a Masters Degree from both Temple University and the University of Scranton and a doctorate from Columbia University, served as a Middle School Principal in the Upper Merion School District. Since assuming his position at Interboro, he has worked vigorously to install innovative programs which will help our students. Besides establishing closer relations between parents, teachers,  students,  and  administration  at Interboro, Dr. Pladus  re-designed  the academic curriculum and up-graded the math advanced placement program. Moreover, he has implemented a co-teaching pilot program  for special education students and developed a proactive strategy to deal with the needs of ‘‘at risk’’ teens. Through his commitment and success, Dr. Pladus helped the school earn ‘‘blue ribbon’’  status  from  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In a nation  toiling  to upgrade educational standards, people like Dr. Pladus yield hope. As a former school teacher, I know well the difficult challenges  facing  today’s educators, and commend  those who overcome  them. With the innovating ideas and continual resolution of people like Dr. Pladus, our nation and its children will become much closer  to  the educational system they deserve. f FAMILY FRIENDLY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 1999 HON.

38,,106,0.284,92,1999-02-11,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Family Friendly Tax Relief Act of 1999. This  legislation will  increase  the child tax credit for children under age 5 to $1,000. I believe this is an important step toward easing the tax burden for American families with young children. Child development experts agree  that a child’s interest in learning, sense of security, behavior, and curiosity about  the world are deeply rooted in the child care that he or she receives between the ages of 0–5. When children get off to a good start in life and have high-quality child care (either at home or in a child care program), they have the best opportunity  to  flourish and  they have all  the necessary tools to start school. Children who are cared for well from birth have a distinct advantage over those who are in low-quality, overcrowded, or under-staffed child care programs or those who come from homes where money is scarce and parents are forced to chose between spending time with their children or putting food on the table.

The book already has prompted memorable  favorable  reviews and laudatory comments by leading bereavement counselors and  therapists.  In addition, numerous  newspaper  articles  and  broadcasters have commented on the book’s importance and power. Moreover, on reading these articles, parents who have also  lost a child, have contacted the author to express their camaraderie and gratitude. Mr. Speaker, losing a loved one is certainly one of the most traumatic experiences many of us will face in our lives. The void left behind is often too large to fill and it is usually quite difficult to soothe the pain that we had been afflicted with. Saul Bennett  has  not  only worked diligently to heal his own wounds, he has  reached out  to help others who have faced such tragedy. I would like to commend Mr. Bennett for his personal strength and compassion and I applaud his efforts to help others deal with a loss of their loved ones. f 54TH ANNIVERSARY OF FLAG RAISING ON IWO JIMA HON.

40,,106,0.043,99,1999-02-11,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of our distinguished  colleagues  that February 23rd will be the 54th anniversary of the raising of our American flag on Iwo Jima. It has often been said that the photograph of the flag raising on Mt. Suribachi is the most widely duplicated and famous photograph ever taken. This may or may not be true, but I do not think anyone can deny it is to this day one of the most inspirational. It was 54 years ago this month that 70,000 American soldiers stormed the tiny Pacific island of Iwo Jima in an effort to secure a safe place for the emergency landing of American bombers  en  route  to  strategic  targets  in Japan. A small  island  in  the Pacific Ocean, Iwo Jima was a vital strategic point for both the Americans and Japanese due to its location for these bombings. I am among the Americans who participated in our war effort in the Pacific theater. I fully recall how those of us who flew bombing missions over Japan were grateful, thanks to our courageous Armed Forces, that Iwo Jima had come into our control, although with great sorrow for the tremendous sacrifice that is conquest entailed. Iwo Jima allowed us a reasonable emergency landing base to refuel and to repair our aircraft damages incurred during our missions over Japan. It is appropriate that all Americans should join in honoring the 6,000 American lives that were  sacrificed  in  that  famous battle  that helped our nation to achieve victory in the Pacific theater. The photo of the 5 Marines and 1 sailor struggling to raise the stars and strips over Iwo Jima while battling against the brutal Pacific winds has become an enduring image to all Americans of those who gave their lives so that others may live free during that long and horrible war. Perched high atop Mount Suribachi, our nation’s  flag served as an  instant memorial  to the dead and wounded of our great nation reminding us of the expensive price we paid for that victory. Mr. Speaker,  in closing,  I  invite all of our colleagues to join in remembrance of that historic day and in extending our deepest condolences and gratitude to the families of the fallen soldiers of the battle of Iwo Jima. f ARIZONA  STATEHOOD AND ENABLING ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1999 HON.

41,,106,0.703,99,1999-02-11,Mr. STUMP.," Mr. Speaker, Sunday, February 14, 1999, marks  the eighty-seventh anniversary of statehood for my home state of Arizona. On behalf of my colleagues in the Arizona House delegation, I am pleased to introduce the following piece of legislation to mark this historic event. Mr. Speaker, the proposed bill amends the 1910 act of Congress that granted the State of Arizona’s entry into the Union. The bill makes two minor changes  to  the Arizona Enabling Act relating to the administration of state trust funds. This bill is supported by the Governor of Arizona, our State Treasurer, the Arizona State Legislature and most importantly the citizens of Arizona through their approval of this change through the ballot process. Mr. Speaker, on November 3, 1998, Arizona voters passed Proposition 102 to amend the Arizona Enabling Act.

42,House,106,0.54,6,1999-02-24,Mr. KINGSTON.," Mr. Speaker, what is it that the President wants to do with 38 percent of the Social Security funds? There is a surplus in Social Security. The President is supporting taking 38 percent of that money and spending it on non-Social Security programs. One of those programs is to expand AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps is a program that pays a lot of little yuppie college kids to do volunteer work and get paid for  the volunteer work. They were doing it for free. The President, if an upper middle class family, the President is going to pay them. Might be a good program if they are a Democrat. I do not know. It does not make much sense to me in the real world. But I do not want my grandmother’s retirement money going into that, and the President is going to say, ‘‘I want 38 percent of your Social Security money, grandmother, and we’re going to spend it on other programs.’’ That is wrong, Mr. President, and I hope the Democrats will  join me  in saying let us preserve and protect Social Security and only use the money for Social Security. f SOUTH ASIAN LEADERS BRING RENEWED HOPE OF PEACE (Mr.  BEREUTER  asked  and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Last week,  Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif traveled on the first commercial bus service between the two countries in 51 years, arriving in Lahore, Pakistan, to discuss the future of those nations. This seemingly modest but symbolically important change brings renewed hope that the decades of hostility and  conflict may  soon come to an end. In an historic meeting, the two leaders agreed to work together to reduce the risk between their newly nuclear states. They have agreed to continue their declared moratoriums on future nuclear testing, exchange information on warhead numbers and deployment, and provide advanced notification of future missile tests. India and Pakistan also have committed to signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty within the next few months; and, importantly, they have agreed to intensify efforts to resolve the difficult issue of Kashmir. Mr. Speaker, they should be encouraged by all Members of this body. This can be a breakthrough in relations between India and Pakistan. f SPECIAL EDUCATION (Mr. SESSIONS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) ",1999

The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. Points of order against consideration of the bill for failure to comply with clause 4(a) of rule XIII are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Commerce. After general debate  the  bill  shall  be  considered  for amendment under the five-minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Commerce now printed in the bill. Each section of the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. During consideration of the bill for amendment, the chairman of the Committee of the Whole may accord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member offering an amendment has caused it to be printed in the portion of the Congressional Record designated for that purpose in clause 8 of rule XVIII.

The Clerk will designate section 2. The text of section 2 is as follows: SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— (1) the establishment and maintenance of an end-to-end  emergency  communications  infrastructure among members of the public, local public safety, fire service, and law enforcement officials,  emergency dispatch providers, and hospital emergency and trauma care facilities will reduce response times for the delivery of emergency care, assist in delivering appropriate care, and thereby prevent fatalities, substantially reduce the severity and extent of injuries, reduce time lost from work, and save thousands of lives and billions of dollars in health care costs; (2) the rapid, efficient deployment of emergency telecommunications service requires statewide coordination of the efforts of local public safety, fire service, and law enforcement officials, and emergency dispatch providers, and the designation of 911 as the number to call in emergencies throughout the Nation; (3) improved public safety remains an important public health objective of Federal, State, and local governments and substantially facilitates interstate and foreign commerce; (4) the benefits of wireless communications in emergencies will be enhanced by the development of state-wide plans to coordinate the efforts of local public safety, fire service, and law enforcement officials, emergency dispatch providers, emergency medical service providers on end-to-end  emergency  communications  infrastructures; and (5) the construction and operation of seamless, ubiquitous, and reliable wireless telecommunications systems promote public safety and provide  immediate and  critical  communications links among members of the public, emergency medical service providers and emergency dispatch providers, public safety, fire service and law enforcement officials, and hospital emergency and trauma care facilities. (b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to encourage and facilitate the prompt deployment throughout  the United States of a seamless, ubiquitous, and reliable end-to-end infrastructure  for  communications,  including wireless communications,  to meet  the Nation’s public safety and other communications needs.

48,House,106,-0.379,34,1999-02-24,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I, too, rise in support of the amendment and agree that if you are looking at the amendment and you  listen to the application of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. TURNER), as applied to the amendment and its integration into the bill, I think it is clear. I want to join the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. PORTMAN) in making it clear that one of the problems that we are trying to deal with is that every agency historically has had its own form with its special requirements, and it has been very difficult to get them to come to agreement on having a common form for common purposes. The staff correctly, and OMB, was concerned  that we would have,  as pointed out by the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. PORTMAN), an interpretation of the language in the bill that said there had to be a common form for every application, whether or not there were similar purposes in that application. That was not the intent of the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. PORTMAN), nor mine. However, it is, and I want to reiterate what the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. PORTMAN) said, and I know what the gentleman from Texas (Mr. TURNER) and the committee agrees, it is our intent to have agencies come with a common form, come to agreement so that States and local governments can be facilitated in accomplishing the objectives that these programs are established for. The irony has been that, on the one hand, we establish a program to help kids or families or farmers or whoever, and we then set up procedures which impede that objective. So I, too, will support the amendment.  I  think  the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. TURNER) is absolutely correct. This is an amendment which will clarify it, but what it clarifies is that we are talking about similar purposes having a common form, and that will be required, not optional, and it will not be an agency option in the sense that they can decide, yes, we will do this. It is something they need to come to agreement on with other like agencies and like programs in establishing a common form. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. TURNER) for his leadership and for yielding. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. TURNER). The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN. Are there further amendments to section 6? If not, The Clerk will designate section 7. The text of section 7 is as follows: SEC. 7. EVALUATION.

51,House,106,0.638,41,1999-02-24,Mr. SCHAFFER.," Mr. Speaker, the media entertained then summarily dismissed fantastic ‘‘Wag the Dog’’ analogies  to  December’s missile  strike against Iraq. Even now, few have ventured post mortem analyses of the momentous episode sidetracked by historic impeachment coverage. Billions spent, lives lost and risked, measured against the efficacy of modern warfare have gone virtually unchallenged  in America’s press, much less the President’s ulterior political benefits accumulated throughout the exchange. His Holiness Pope John Paul II was right to seize the occasion of a St. Louis visit to chastise Bill Clinton’s handling of Iraq. More than 2 months having passed since Operation Desert Fox, it remains unclear who stands the victor. The coincident timing of  impeachment-eve air strikes  fueled rampant speculation about President Bill Clinton’s motives, drawing  indignant  insistence by the White House U.S. national security was the singular interest. Today,  the Pope  finds himself among an ever-growing crowd of Americans unconvinced the missile attack was an absolute necessity, and with the settling dust comes clarification of the uneasy truth, Saddam Hussein remains in power. This fact controverts the December 17, 1998, call by Congress to finish the job. On a near unanimous vote, 221 Republicans, 195 Democrats and one Independent adopted a resolution in support of our troops in Desert Fox. Congress also included in the measure a bold policy statement ‘‘to remove the regime  headed  by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a Democratic government to replace that regime.’’ However, one day into Desert Fox, Defense Secretary Cohen confessed before a closed assembly of this House our plans did not include undermining Saddam’s dictatorship. ‘‘The objective of the attack,’’ he admitted, ‘‘is to go after  those  chemical,  biological  or weapons of mass destruction sites to the extent that we can.’’ b1515 A Congressman  followed up,  ‘‘Why not go after him if that’s what the problem is?’’ Cohen replied, ‘‘We have set forth our specific targets, and that’s what we intend to carry out.’’ Across the Atlantic, British Defense Minister Robertson delivered the consonant line to members of parliament, ‘‘It’s not our objective to remove Saddam Hussein from power.’’ Coupled with the historic record of Clinton’s Iraq policy, his eagerness to launch missiles while neglecting chief U.S. objectives adds plausibility to the pontiff’s  skepticism. The President’s stubborn devotion to the failing policy of containment has yielded little more than prolonged hardship for Iraq’s 22 million civilians and unneeded strain on precarious  international relationships. Clearly  the President’s precipitous policy in Iraq obviates the need for it to be replaced by a serious one designed to legitimately achieve genuine U.S. objectives. Meanwhile,  the absence of such a policy should compel even tepid curiosity among the media as  to what Clinton  had  hoped  to achieve, if not well-established U.S. objectives. Pundits and editorial writers of virtually every country except the United States have proffered cogent opinions fairly  impugning the motives of our Commander in Chief. A day into Desert Fox, one member of Britain’s parliament, aligned with Clinton’s parallel political party, I might add, even admonished his colleagues in formal session,  ‘‘After all, we’re not being led into battle by Richard the Lion-Hearted but by William the liar.’’ Here at home, however, it was just too troubling to contemplate another scandal, especially when TV production trucks had already secured their coveted parking spaces outside the Capitol.

52,House,106,0.336,41,1999-02-24,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker, this evening we are taking a special order to talk about the number-one unfunded mandate from the Federal Government to the States and to local school districts. Twenty-three years ago, the Congress made the historic decision to support children and families with special education needs. In passing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Congress not only brought Federal aid to children with disabilities but it also brought a 100 percent mandate as to how you will spend that money. Just 2 years ago, Congress and the administration worked together in true bipartisan fashion to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or better known as special ed, so children with special needs can have more options and services. I might add at this point that we are still waiting, 2 years later, for the regulations that are supposed to go with this legislation which certainly would help local school districts to know exactly what is expected of them. Unfortunately, the administration has again backed away from the Federal commitment to adequately fund special education. This is the second year in a row that the administration has cut special education funding in the budget that they have sent up to Capitol Hill. They have a tiny increase, they indicate, but if you talk about the increase in inflation and the 123,000 extra students that come into the program each year, you discover that, as a matter of fact, 2 years in a row, the administration has cut special education. Now, what was  promised  by  the former majority 23 years ago was that ",1999
53,House,106,0.225,48,1999-02-24,Mr. GREENWOOD.," Madam Speaker, let me begin by saying that it is the wisdom of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Chairman GOODLING) that has brought us to this point. I remember 2 years ago on the floor of the House I came up to the gentleman and said, if we could do one thing for education that would really make a difference, what would that be? He said, ‘‘Fully fund special education,’’ and  I have been a soldier in that army ever since. Madam Speaker, the times that I feel best about being a Member of Congress are the times when, first off, we take serious actions  that actually affect real people in very real ways. And secondly, it is a time when we kind of transcend the usual partisanship that prevails so often in the House. We transcend the notion that for one of us to win our agenda, somebody else has to lose and we have to do battle here for competing interests. Fully  funding  special  education meets both of those tests. It meets the test of really helping Americans who need it and also we can do it in a win/ win fashion. Let me elaborate on that. We Republicans have a tendency to talk about dollars and cents too much and in trying to figure out how to balance the budget and we forget sometimes to talk about the human  impacts. We are talking here about 5.8 million children. Children with mental retardation. Children with learning disabilities who have the heartbreak of going to school and being excited and finding out that no matter how smart they are, they cannot quite read up to speed right away. Children with physical disabilities and children who have difficulty hearing. Children who have difficulties with speech. Madam Speaker, we have the opportunity and we have the program under IDEA to help change the lives of these precious  children. By  fully  funding IDEA, we get to make sure that the Federal Government and the Congress lives up to its obligation. But secondly, this is an issue that enables us to transcend the win/lose scenario that often prevails. This is an opportunity for us to share a broad agenda on education so that my colleagues in the City of Philadelphia, who are particularly worried about school construction and think that should be our priority, well, we say to them,  just imagine if the Philadelphia School District or the New York School District or the Chicago or the L.A. School District has fully funded from the Federal Government  their  special  education mandate. They would be rolling in millions of dollars to build schools. My colleagues who want to focus on technology  and  computers  for  the classroom, the same thing occurs. All of those extra unbudgeted dollars could go to that. And for those school districts that want to reduce class size, here  is  the golden opportunity. We take the special ed. burden off of their backs and let them use the surplus for reducing class size. And if communities want to reduce taxes in their district, the opportunity is here to do that. This  is what my kids call a  ‘‘nobrainer.’’ This is an obvious thing to do. And the question occurs, well, then why would we not all  immediately agree and why would the President not agree? When Secretary Riley, the Secretary of Education, was before our committee,  I  asked  the Secretary, ‘‘Would you like to see us fully fund special education?’’ He said,  ‘‘Yes, I wish we could do that.’’ And I said, ‘‘Well, do you advocate that?’’ He said ‘‘No,  I do not advocate that we do that.’’ He just wishes that we do it? Why is that? Madam Speaker, I think the answer is that with a bureaucracy as big as the Federal  Department  of  Education, every  little division  in there has to have its pet program. And I think the President is at fault to some extent in trying to be all things to all people in the education arena, so that he creates nine new programs, expands the plethora of programs that we have, and now we do too many things with too little effort. We are forcing the school districts to beg for little pots of money, targeted money  specialized with all kinds of strings attached, instead of trusting the school districts to take the special education funding and free their budgets up to do what is important in their school district. I think we can do that. I think we should do that. It is the right thing to do for these children. It is the right thing to do to engender a spirit of bipartisanship across the aisle and to work cooperatively with the President. I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the House and the Senate and the President will understand the wisdom of  the gentleman  from Pennsylvania  (Mr. GOODLING)  in this regard. ",1999
54,House,106,0.231,48,1999-02-24,Mrs. KELLY.," Madam Speaker, I want to  compliment  the gentleman  from Pennsylvania  (Mr. GOODLING) on his leadership, not only on the committee but on this particular issue. When I first decided to run for Congress,  I want to echo my colleague from Pennsylvania who said he asked what we could do for the schools. I called a friend of mine, having been the local president of  the  local PTA,  I called a friend of mine who was active with school boards and I said, ‘‘Judy, what do we need to do for the schools?’’ She said, ‘‘Fully fund IDEA. That is the kind of help we truly need.’’ So, Madam Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues  in the House to make the 106th Congress the Congress that finally lives up to the commitment to the American people and the students and the taxpayers to  fully fund IDEA. Over 20 years ago, Congress passed a law that pledged that the Federal Government would provide 40 percent of the funding to assist school districts, and we can see it there on the chart, as we can see the big funding gap. We promised we would deliver 40 percent of that funding. For the  last 24 years, the Federal Government has failed to live up to this commitment. It is long past time that we correct this problem, because it represents a major unfunded mandate on our local taxpayers. Prior to 1995, Congress’ commitment to IDEA was only 7 percent, far short of the 40 percent commitment we needed. Since 1995, we have boosted IDEA funding by 85 percent, which is a major step in the right direction, but we still have a lot to do to meet our obligation to the schools. Unfortunately, the administration’s budget tries to derail our progress. According to the budget that was submitted at the beginning of this month, the administration  reduces  funding  for IDEA from the current level of 12 percent to 11 percent, nowhere near the 40 percent that Congress years ago promised our local schools. As a former teacher, I am well aware of how hard it is for school districts to make the tough choices in their budget. It is estimated that school districts spend approximately 20 percent of their budget to cover the unpaid Federal share of education costs. If we were able  to  fulfill  our  obligation,  that would leave 20 percent of every school’s budget in this Nation to be used for other purposes like staff training, curriculum  enhancement,  hire  more teachers, do the things that we know we need to do to give our children high quality education. As the gentleman pointed out, there is a possibility that schools can also return that because they have to make that money up in property taxes. The overwhelming amount of their budget comes from local property taxes. By the Federal Government  leaving unfunded the three-quarters of the cost of the mandated program, that is a terrible burden on all of us in every school district. With  full Federal  funding, those local governments can choose. In my congressional district in New York in one school district, the Peekskill School District, they receive only $148,394. If IDEA were fully funded in Peekskill, the district would receive $760,371. That is a difference of $612,000, a burden that local taxpayers in the City of Peekskill have to bear. The Congressional Research Service has estimated that $14 billion is needed to fully fund Part B of IDEA. In fiscal year 1999, the appropriation for Part B was $4.3 billion, leaving the State and local governments to make up $10 billion. Madam Speaker, one of the most important issues for Americans today is education. We all know the importance of a quality education and it is time we do everything in our power to ensure ",1999
55,House,106,0.019,55,1999-02-24,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr.  Speaker,  I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for yielding and I thank him for taking the time today to allow the Blue Dog Democrats to discuss in quite some detail where we are coming from and will be coming from regarding this year’s budget debate. Our position  is pretty simple. We think  the  primary  goal  this  year should be reducing our debt. In that, we  agree with  the President  very strongly. And strengthening Social Security. To do that, it is awfully important,  extremely  important  for  the American people to understand that this year,  1999,  there  is no  surplus other than Social Security surpluses. And next year there is no surplus to be divided other than Social Security surplus. So any dollars that we spend over and above the budget caps, whether it be for defense, and I am one of those that do believe that we do have a need of taking a good, hard look at our defense capabilities, but I also do it in the same spirit in which I speak today, of saying that in the short term, you will find that the surpluses are in fact Social Security trust funds which we believe very sincerely that we have now a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to honestly take Social Security offbudget. We have done it many times over the last umpteen years, but we have never meant it. As one of my colleagues spoke a moment ago, we are elected to make difficult decisions, and this one should not be too difficult today if we can just withstand the temptation of spending the surplus. Let me remind my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, that it was not very many years ago that the biggest debate that we had here was whether or not we could have 3-year projections. And then we went to 5-year projections. And then we went to 6 and 7. During the 1980s we had a habit of backend loading, that we would do the easy  stuff  up-front  and we would backend load. As we did that, we saw our debt grow from about $1 trillion in the late 1970s to now $5.5 trillion. That is a significant amount of money. It is one of the reasons why the Blue Dogs say now one of the best things we can do is pay down the debt, and the overwhelming majority of the American people are agreeing with us, so, therefore, that should be the policy that comes out of this Congress. Mr. Speaker, projections. Today we are now projecting, not 6 years, not 7 years, we are projecting 10- and 15-year surpluses like they are going to happen. No one can predict tomorrow. But for us to do, as some suggest, that now because we have these projected surpluses for the next 15 years, that we should spend them, whether it be for a tax cut, 10 percent straight across the board, or whether it be for any other spending. I do not think that is a very conservative approach. In fact, it can be a very alarming approach. Our debt today is $5.5 trillion. Let us not for a moment forget, which is being conveniently forgotten and this is an area where I have criticism  for our President’s budget. He  is not doing anything about the $9 trillion unfunded liability of the current Social Security program. I hope that we can in a bipartisan way, and certainly the Blue Dogs will be willing to work, as I have been working with the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. KOLBE) on the other side of the aisle for the last 3 years coming up with a proposal and we hope more of our colleagues will  look at that, of something that we can do, that we can deal with the real problems of Social Security, the $9 trillion unfunded liability, the bills that will come due beginning 2010 to 2013 unless we do something additional other than what anybody is talking about today. The Republicans’ agenda focuses on massive tax cuts out of the budget surplus. I hope we can avoid that, and I am glad to hear those voices on the other  side beginning  to  talk about that. Because right now we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to deal with the very serious long-term problem of Social Security. We should avoid frightening those on Social Security today or those soon to be on it. What we are talking about is our children and grandchildren. I will conclude today by saying this. The reason that I have been as involved in Social Security for the last 3 years, in trying to come up with a plan or plans, of trying to be a part in a constructive, bipartisan way of making some difficult decisions, I have two reasons. It is mine and my wife’s 31⁄2- year-old and 11⁄2-year-old grandson. I do not want them to look back 65 years from today and say  if only my granddad would have done what in his heart he knew he should have done when he was in the Congress, we would not be in the mess we are in today. Every one of our colleagues know that unless we can make some difficult decisions now when we have got a chance, we are postponing and we are saying  to  our  children  and  grandchildren,  ‘‘We don’t give a rip about you, we want ours today.’’ That is not the Blue Dog position. You are going to see that our input into the budget debate is going to be one of saying, let us pay down the debt, let us truly preserve Social Security. We will be willing to roll up our sleeves and bite some of the tough bullets. We hope that we will see from both sides of the aisle this effort put forward in a very meaningful way. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for conducting this special order today. I would love to see, and I will be more than willing to participate  in some honest discussion where we have differences of opinion on either side of the aisle as we talk about these specifics, of having some of these special orders where we have an honest discussion when we have got plenty of time to talk about it, and I hope we will see that in the days ahead and you will see us back here. b1715 ",1999

57,House,106,-0.244,62,1999-02-24,Mr. MALONEY of Connecticut.," Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999, known as Ed-Flex, which was  filed  today by  the gentleman  from Delaware  (Mr. CASTLE), the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. ROEMER), myself, and a number of other cosponsors. This  is critical  legislation that helps States and local school districts effectively prepare our children for the 21st Century. We are, in this Congress, engaged in a number of educational efforts. We are trying, for example, to provide additional teachers so that our class sizes can be reduced. We are fighting to provide  school modernization  funds  so that our facilities can be brought up to standard and can be made ready for the new educational efforts that the new economy and the new technology require. Now, however, is also the time to take a look at doing better with the funds that we already have. Now is the time to give our schools the flexibility they  need  to  adopt  rigorous  educational standards, to raise academic achievement levels and empower our children for the challenges of the future. In exchange  for  increased accountability  for  results,  the Ed-Flex bill gives States  and  localities  greater flexibility in using Federal education funds to support locally designed comprehensive school improvement efforts. Our Ed-Flex bill expands current law by making all 50 States, including my home State of Connecticut, eligible to apply for Ed-Flex. ",1999
58,House,106,-0.402,69,1999-02-24,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Madam Speaker, it is with a great sense of honor that I rise to celebrate Black History Month. As we honor the great cultural and historic legacy that African-Americans have left to us and to future generations, we recognize that they led one of the greatest social  transformation  in  the history of  the United States: the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The civil rights movement was a period of enormous growth for our country and society. Great African-American  leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr., Malcolm X, Rosa Parks and others forced us, as a nation, to search our souls and confront  the  forces of hate and ignorance that were splitting our society. Today, we continue to confront the forces of hate and  ignorance. The  fact  remains  that much still needs to be done before true equality and racial harmony become a fact of life in this country. Now, more than ever, we need strong African-American leadership. We must have leaders who, like the leaders of the civil rights movement, are able to take action and inspire others to confront bigotry. In the First Congressional District of Indiana, we are blessed with a number of outstanding African-American  leaders. But  there are 10 specific leaders that I want to recognize today for their devotion to public service and their ability to inspire future generations to achieve all that they can. Suzette Raggs is the current Deputy Mayor of Gary. She  is  the  first black woman appointed Deputy Mayor in the state of Indiana. She was appointed by Mayor Scott King  in 1996. She is President of the Gary City Board of Public Works and Safety,  the body  that oversees all of the contractual agreements for the city.

I  see no  reason why we should not be able to do that. I hope, in fact, that we can.

Mr. President, before  the Senator from Georgia proceeds to give his remarks, perhaps we could call on another member of the committee, the chairman  of  the  Manpower  Subcommittee, Senator ALLARD, in hopes that he can talk a little bit about the hearing  that  the  subcommittee will have today on the very issues that are in this bill.

Members of the Guard and Reserve have been participating at record levels.  Nearly  270,000  Reservists  and Guardsmen were mobilized during Operations Desert  Shield  and Desert Storm. Over 17,000 have answered the Nation’s call to bring peace to Bosina. Members of  the Guard and Reserve have delivered millions of pounds of humanitarian aid all over the world. And, closer to home, they have responded to numerous state and federal emergencies. Thousands of Reservists and Guardsmen are serving in communities across the country and around the world every day. I firmly believe we should recognize the contributions the Guard and Reserve have made to our defense efforts over the years. We should recognize those contributions by extending to members of the Guard and Reserve the same savings opportunity we are offering their active duty counterparts under S. 4. The Guard and Reserve are an integral part of our national defense strategy. We can’t afford to overlook them. ",1999
63,Senate,106,-0.435,76,1999-02-24,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President, the amendment that I and Senator WARNER and Senator ROBBand Senator MIKULSKIhave offered is before the Senate. This is a very straightforward amendment expressing the sense of the Congress that parity between Federal civilian pay and military pay should be maintained. We should continue that parity. A comparison by CRS of military and civilian pay increases finds that 80 percent of the military and civilian pay increases in the last 25 years have been identical. Disparate treatment goes against established congressional policy that has ensured parity with all those who work to serve our Nation, whether in the Armed Forces or in the civilian workforce. One of the rationales for the increase for military personnel, which is in this legislation which I support, has been to address the concerns about retention and  recruitment problems. We have comparable problems with respect to the civilian service, and I think it is important to note that more and more of graduating classes indicate less interest in the Federal service. A GAO report in 1990 found that low pay was the most cited reason for employees leaving the civil service or refusing to take a Federal position  in the  first place. Over the years, particularly in recent years, Federal employees have made significant sacrifices in the name of deficit reduction. The  law governing Federal civilian pay has never been fully implemented since 1994. In fact, Federal civilian workers received a reduced annual adjustment. The gap continues to grow, which we are very concerned about. We have been through a downsizing period during which  the Federal employees have continued to provide  high-quality  service.  So  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this provision. It is an effort to achieve a first-rate public service. Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair. ",1999

66,Senate,106,-0.583,111,1999-02-24,Mr. WELLSTONE.," Mr. President, I see the confusion.  I have the other amendment based upon what I think is in negotiation that we have had. Let’s listen to that amendment. ",1999
67,Senate,106,-0.309,118,1999-02-24,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, there is no question that America’s armed forces are the best in the world. The men and women who serve in our military demonstrate their courage and dedication every day, from the fighter pilots who are making life-threatening raids into Iraq to contain the deadly forces of Saddam Hussein, to the soldiers who are maintaining peace  in  the warweary towns of Bosnia, to the countless sailors, soldiers, and airmen on lonely patrol throughout the world, enduring hardship and homesickness to protect their fellow Americans. It is vital to our national security that we maintain the level of excellence that these troops represent. Of the many factors that contribute to the robustness of our military, none is more basic than the ability to recruit and retain qualified, talented individuals. Without enough people to operate them, our mightiest weapons are worthless. Without enough people to  execute  them, our best planned strategies are useless. Without enough people in uniform to defend it, our nation is at risk. We ask much of the men and women who serve in our military, and of their families  as well. Yet,  as we have learned from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pay and benefit levels for members of the armed services have been slipping behind those of their civilian counterparts. Today, we are facing a personnel shortfall of alarming proportions. The need  for the  legislation before us  is acute. According to recent published reports, the Army fell 2,300 short of its recruiting  goal—approximately  a  20 percent deficit—in the first quarter of fiscal year 1999. The Navy missed its recruitment target by almost 7,000 last year. The Air Force, which has suffered a hemorrhage of pilots over the past several years, fell 400 short of its first quarter goal. Many factors are contributing to the current  recruitment  and  retention problems of the services, but military leaders across the services and up and down the chain of command have identified pay and benefits as major culprits. We need to come to grips with this problem. In my state of West VirLEVIN,  ginia,  approximately  9,000 men and women serve around the world in the active and reserve armed forces. They are subject to being called away at a moment’s notice to some of the most dangerous trouble spots on earth. The least we can do for them in return is to make sure that their families will be able to make ends meet while they are deployed away from home. The least we can do is strive to ensure that the monthly paychecks we  issue to our men and women in uniform are comparable to that of their civilian counterparts. Improving the pay and benefits of the men and women who serve in our military is an obvious first step to help reverse the downward spiral in recruitment and retention, and I applaud the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, for moving quickly to address this situation.  Likewise,  I  applaud  Senator the Ranking Member of  the Committee,  for  insisting  that  the benchmarks of prudence and careful consideration be met in the bill before us. This legislation is not the place for grandstanding  or  political  oneupmanship. I am hopeful that as we debate this bill over the coming days, we will work for the common good of our military and our nation, and come up with a balanced, commonsense bill. I hope, also, that we will be mindful, as we consider this bill, that monetary compensation is only one factor affecting recruiting and retention levels in the military. Plainly put, we cannot buy the finest military in the world. To rise to the level of excellence that the United States military has achieved requires an uncommon degree of dedication,  self-sacrifice,  and  patriotism— qualities that can be inspired and nurtured but not bought. By all means, let us work together to improve the compensation of our men and women in uniform. But let us also work together to preserve and enhance the intangible compensations of military service—the honor, respect, and sense of accomplishment—that form the true foundation of military service. ",1999
68,Senate,106,-0.303,118,1999-02-24,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, I believe we must significantly boost compensation for the men and women of our armed forces who serve this nation so tirelessly and effectively. The end of the Cold War has meant that the numbers and types of overseas missions we ask these people to perform has grown. The rising number of military operations  abroad  coupled with  an  extremely  vibrant U.S.  economy  has meant the military services are having a harder time attracting and keeping highly skilled personnel. The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs recognized this troubling development last year in testimony before the Congress and began making the case for addressing the military’s recruitment and  retention problems. The examples they cited were troubling. The Air Force is experiencing serious shortfalls in retaining its pilots. The Navy is having difficulty manning its ships. The Army finds itself coming up short in filling out its units. Only the Marine Corps appears to be faring well at the moment. The President listened to our senior military officials, and he responded. The President proposed a $23 billion personnel initiative in his FY2000 budget to improve the military’s pay and retirement benefits. The President’s budget would provide  the men and women of our armed services with the largest pay raise since 1982. In addition, it would reform military pay tables to reward performance, increase specialty pay and bonuses to address retention  issues, and  restore  retirement benefits. Just as  important as this list of benefits is the fact that the President made these proposals while remaining  faithful  to his pledge  to Save Social Security First. The President was able to accommodate these proposed  increases without  spending any of the surplus in FY2000. In short, the President’s proposal is fully paid for. Like numerous members of Congress from both political parties, I have gone on record in the last several months in support of the Defense Department’s argument that military pay and retirement benefits need to be enhanced if we are to continue to  field a welltrained, highly capable military. That is why, along with Senator LEVIN, Senator CLELAND, and many other Democratic Senators, I introduced the Military Recruiting  and Retention  Improvement Act of 1999—a bill to  increase pay and retirement benefits for members of the Armed Services. I am pleased that many provisions of this legislation were included in S. 4. Although the initial Democratic and Republican proposals were slightly different, I think we can all agree that people are the military’s most important asset. To see why, you need look no further than my home state of South Dakota and the more than 3,000 active-duty personnel stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base. Like their counterparts at military installations around the county and throughout the world, the men and women at Ellsworth Air Force Base serve their country with pride and distinction every day. Most recently, crews  flying  and maintaining B–1B bombers from Ellsworth participated in Operation Desert Fox. This was the first time that B–1Bs were used in combat, and the fact that B–1B crews from Ellsworth were so successful in hitting their targets is a credit to their enormous commitment and dedication. With dedicated people like those we see at Ellsworth and other military installations around the world, it is easy to see why all of us—President Clinton, Defense Secretary Cohen, Joint Chiefs Chairman Shelton, Democrats, and Republicans—agree that something must be done. Therefore, a key issue before the Senate today is how best to accomplish this end, how best to ensure that some  of  this  nation’s  best  and ",1999
69,Senate,106,-0.351,125,1999-02-24,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I heard some people say I am harming the WIC Program. I disagree. You tell me how fair it is for young soldiers here under the current rules. Military families living in the United States are eligible for WIC, and  their wives are pregnant, they have kids, and they are getting the WIC Program, and all of a sudden they are sent overseas. Once they get overseas, they are no longer eligible for the WIC Program. Is that fair? They still have  the  same needs. All my amendment says is if they are eligible for the WIC Program here in America, they are eligible if they are shipped overseas. The DOD estimates maybe $10 or $20 million more per year  in costs. So that is all my amendment does, these modest but important improvement to the underlying bill. It says that if you are a member of the armed forces eligible for a $180 special allowance while stationed in America, you are eligible overseas. That  is all  it says. If you are eligible for WIC here, you are eligible overseas. It also makes the process streamlined so you do not have to go down to the food stamp office, back to the military, and back to the food stamp office just to qualify for the special allowance. And  it treats military housing allowances, as far as eligibility,  in a more  fair manner. Under the current bill, if you are living on the base you would be eligible for the special subsistence allowance, but if you live off base you may not be eligible because you have the housing allowance. But you use that all up for rent, anyway. This is simply not fair. I think this amendment, again, is one that tries to help people in the military in a fair way. I think it is embarrassing that we have people in the military who have  to get  food  stamps. What this amendment does is end that once and for all, for all military personnel, who should be eligible for some special benefits. ",1999

",1999
72,Senate,106,-0.231,125,1999-02-24,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, we are about to take our first legislative action of the 106th Congress. Many of us who ran for election or reelection last November said that one of our greatest sources of pride was that after 30 years of deficits and a Federal debt which had reached close to $6 trillion, that we had  finally exercised  the  fiscal discipline to achieve a balanced Federal budget. What are we about to do with the first vote of this 106th Congress? We are about to pass a bill which will have an unfunded liability of $16.5 billion. That is $16.5 billion not subject to appropriations. That is $16.5 billion of direct authorized spending in this legislation plus revenue reductions that are incident to this legislation. Mr. President, that is not the message that we want to send to the American people—that we are going to add a further  indebtedness  to  the Federal Government, that we are going to start down the slippery slope to more deficits and more additions to our national debt. We do not want to tell our service men and women that we have given them these benefits, which we need to do, but that we were unwilling to pay for them, so that for every dollar we give them, 34 cents is unfunded. That is not fair either to the taxpayers or to the service men and women who we are trying to convince that we are going to substantially  improve  their  service conditions so that they will join up and stay and serve the Nation. Mr. President, what I have proposed is a simple proposition. If we are going to make this offer to our service personnel, let’s pay for it. I have proposed a payment of four items. Three are tax measures which have been passed by this Congress and which have lapsed. This would renew those measures. Two of them relate to the Superfund Program, one of them to the oilspill liability, the fourth is a measure which was ",1999
73,Senate,106,-0.328,195,1999-02-24,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President:  I  am pleased to join with my distinguished colleague, the Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration, Senator MCCONNELL,  in  introducing this resolution to provide for funding for  the  standing committees of  the Senate.  This  resolution  authorizes committee  expenditures  for  the  remaining seven months of Fiscal Year 1999. This resolution is being enacted pursuant to S. Res. 38, adopted on February 12, 1999. Since 1989, the Committee has provided funding for the committees on a biennial basis. This has proved to be an effective management tool for assuring continuity of  funding  throughout a Congress. The Committee does not intend that this short-term funding resolution signal a departure from that tradition. Instead, this seven-month continuing resolution will allow the Rules Committee to consider the impact of changes in the Senate’s financial management  and  accounting  systems, which have been necessitated by Year 2000 (Y2K) concerns, on the committee funding cycle. Under normal procedures, each committee would have reported its biennial funding resolution to the Senate by January 31, and the Rules Committee would have then acted to report an omnibus committee biennial funding resolution providing funding for the period March 1, 1999 through February 28, 2001. The Rules Committee will initiate that process  in  late spring, so that each committee will have the opportunity to present its budget to the Rules Committee for action prior to enactment of a funding resolution for the remainder of the biennial period. During this period,  the Committee will also  seek input from the chairmen and ranking members of the standing committees with regard to changes in committee funding which may be required to conform to the Senate’s new Y2K compliant financial system. This resolution funds committees at the current baseline level, increased by a 3.1% salary cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). This resolution also authorizes the use of Special Reserves, which are the reprogrammed funds remaining in the appropriations account at the end of the committee funding cycle on February 28. These funds are made available to committees to meet unforeseen, non-recurring  expenses. These  funds are accessed by the joint request of the chairman and ranking member of the committee, and the joint approval of the chairman and ranking member of the Rules Committee. I commend my colleague, the Chairman, for his efforts to bring this resolution to the Senate floor today. By adopting this resolution, we are ensuring continued funding for committees while at the same time allowing the Rules Committee to fully review the impact on committees of changes in the Senate financial management and accounting system. I urge my colleagues to adopt this resolution. ",1999

The following young men of the 3rd Congressional District of Illinois have earned the high rank of Eagle Scout in the past months: Christopher  Jesionowski, Gerald Reid,  Jr., Charles R. Dattilo, David W. Kurzawski, Kenneth R. Cechura, Matthew  J.  Tiffy, Carl Marcanti,  Adam  Ramm,  Daniel  David Grabacki, Brian T. Meyer,  James  Joseph Pesavento, Andrew Paul Marhoul, Corey G.

It is important to note that less than two percent of all young men in America attain the rank of Eagle Scout. This high honor can only be earned by those scouts demonstrating extraordinary leadership abilities. In light of the commendable leadership and courageous activities performed by these fine young men, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring  the above scouts  for attaining  the highest honor in Scouting—the Rank of Eagle. Let us wish them the very best in all of their future endeavors. again with a gun, shot several students, and returned home where he killed his parents. Three years ago, a Moses Lake, Washington middle school student brought a gun to school and killed two students and a teacher. Weeks ago, a student showed up at Stanwood High School in Washington with a loaded weapon, where fortunately there were no injuries to fellow students. These tragic stories demonstrate the need for our schools and communities  to have  in place a policy to protect our children from gun violence in our schools. Expelling youths once they have brought a gun onto school grounds is not enough, as the tragic story of Kip Kinkel illustrates. Who knows how the outcome might have been different had Kip been detained in protective custody or given a psychological evaluation  to determine whether he was  indeed a threat to the community? Our laws are very clear with respect to possession of firearms. It is a crime under both State and Federal laws to have firearms on school grounds. However we have failed to address the underlying issue—many of our youths have serious problems and are a danger to themselves and others. When an adolescent disobeys the law or threatens the safety of other students, it is our responsibility to help that child before he or she commits any further crimes and to minimize  risks  to  the community. These youths must be detained and  their crime must be taken seriously. For  this  reason,  Representative  DEFAZIOand I are reintroducing the Schoolyard Safety Act, our legislation from last year encouraging states to pass measures holding juveniles  for at  least 24 hours  if  they bring guns onto school grounds. Rather than create further burdensome regulations or mandates, we  leave  the authority and accountability  in the hands of  those closest  to  the situation, while  providing  the  funding  necessary  for states  to  implement  these  protective  programs. This funding could help pay for holding centers, psychological evaluations, or other preventative measures decided on by  those closest to the danger—teachers and school officials whose primary responsibility is educating our children, and who have been forced to take on the role of providing for their physical safety instead. The people of Springfield, Oregon know all too well how easily crime can break the heart of a community. Every man, woman, and child in that town had the right to expect to live on a safe street and send their children to safe schools. Children who learn in fear are learning the wrong lessons. It is our responsibility to do whatever we can to prevent a horrible tragedy like this from happening again. PETER f f INTRODUCTION OF THE SCHOOLYARD SAFETY ACT WELLTON-MOWHAWK PROJECT TRANSFER HON.

79,Senate,106,0.239,8,1999-03-08,Mr. VOINOVICH.," Mr. President,  I  have devoted more than 30 years of my  life to public service. I have held elected office as mayor of the city of Cleveland, and I served as Governor of the  State of Ohio. Now I am privileged to  serve the citizens of Ohio as one of  their U.S. Senators. I am deeply honored by the confidence they have bestowed upon me.  They have placed their faith in my  ability and my judgment to consider  and vote upon and bring to the forefront issues of national significance. It  is for this reason that I have come to  the Senate floor to discuss what I consider to be the most serious financial  and economic threat facing our Nation  today.  Through the tough choices made by  Congress in passing the 1997 Balanced  Budget Act, and through our continued  strong economy, the days of escalating,  crushing budget deficits appear to be  coming to an end. In Washington, politicians are saying we have turned the  corner, and  for the  first time  in 30  years, we have a budget that shows a  surplus.  If it is true, it would be brand new  territory for many Americans. Tens of  millions were not even born yet when  we had our last surplus. However, it is  my contention that we do not yet have  honest budget surpluses, and unless we  take bold steps, our actions will continue to leave our younger citizens and  future generations liable for three decades of massive deficits and a national  debt that has made us the greatest  debtor nation in the world.  Prior to 1968, surpluses were not uncommon. But through President Lyndon Johnson’s expansion of the Vietnam war and the implementation of  the Great Society, we started to lose  fiscal restraint.  A budget trick was implemented by  the Johnson administration.  It took  the off-budget Social Security  trust  funds, which were in true surplus, and  commingled  them with  the  regular  budget which at that time was showing  a deficit. In this manner, Congress and  subsequent Presidents were  able  to  mask annual budget deficits that contributed to a rising national debt.  I would just like to point out, however,  the years Social Security has  masked the true budget deficit that we  have had and how it has improved our  budget situation.  If you go back to 1995, we reported  that we had a budget deficit of $164 billion. The fact of the matter is we had  a budget deficit of $226 billion. And  what we did was we reduced it by using  the Social Security surplus of $62 billion.  In 1996, we reported that we had a  deficit of $107 billion. The fact is our  budget deficit was  $174 billion, and  again we used Social Security to reduce that deficit.  Then, in 1997, we reported, oh, it is  wonderful news, we had just a minus  $22 billion deficit. The fact of the matter is we had a $103 billion deficit, and  we plastered it over with $81 billion of  Social Security money.  Then, in 1998, we had the great celebration,  the great  surplus  that we  talked about. The fact of the matter is  that even in 1998, when we reported the  first unified budget surplus, we still  had a real deficit of $30 billion. Again,  we used the $99 billion Social Security  budget surplus to hide the fact that we  had a $30 billion deficit.  Again, this year, we are reporting we  will have a $111 billion surplus. The  fact of the matter is, even this year, we  will have a $16 billion deficit; and again  that has been covered over by the using  of Social Security.  And for the year 2000—the budget we  are working on right now—we are reporting we will have a $133 billion surplus. The fact of the matter is, even  this year, we are going to have a $5 billion deficit on budget. We have covered  that $5 billion up with $138 billion of  surplus  in the Social Security trust  fund.  And next year we are celebrating the  idea that maybe we are going to have  our first real honest to goodness on-  budget surplus of $11 billion. The fact  of the matter is—and we will report a  unified budget surplus of $156 billion—  but the truth is that we only have a  real—real—surplus of $11 billion.  Rather  than  attempting  to  enact  policies that would bring us back to  surpluses, 30 years of  financial gimmicks have ensued, so much that we  ran up a debt of $5.6 trillion in those  intervening years  from  the  time of  Lyndon Johnson. Since the time my  wife and I got married in 1962, interest  payments on the debt have gone from 6  cents on the dollar to 14 cents on the  dollar this past year. If we had had the  same 6-percent interest payment when  we got married  in  1962, Americans  would have saved $140 billion this year.  As the debt grew during the 1970s and  1980s, attempts were made to bring it  under control. In 1985, Congress passed  the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings  Act  which required the unified budget to be  split and  the Social Security  trust  funds kept  separate. When Gramm-  Rudman passed, I was encouraged that  finally we were going to get some truth  in budgeting.  At that time, I was mayor of Cleveland and I was serving as president of  the National League of Cities. In 1985,  the debt was $1.8 trillion. We mayors  felt the need to do our part to help reduce the debt. We did our share when  we  lost the CETA program, revenue  sharing, one half of our community development block grant, and a complete  loss of the Urban Development Action  Grant Program. When I left office after  10 years as mayor of the City of Cleveland, we had $79 million less a year  from the Federal Government than we  had when I came into office in 1979.  In order to make up that difference,  first of all we did everything we could  to reduce costs. In many instances, cities across this country had to increase  their local income taxes or local taxes  by over 50 percent to compensate for  the loss of these Federal dollars. Much  to our chagrin, our sacrifice did little  to help reduce our annual deficits or  shrink our national debt. Indeed, the  debt was $1.8 trillion in 1985; today it is  $5.6 trillion. If you go back to when I  became mayor  in 1979, the national  debt was $780 billion; today, 20 years  later, it is $5.6 trillion. Listen to this:  A 700-percent increase in the country’s  national debt in a 20-year period.  We have a law that says Social Security trust funds are supposed to be off  budget, and we have the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 that removes Social Security from deficit targets and  other enforcement calculations. But it  was another law, the Balanced Budget  Act of 1997, that forced tough spending  choices on Congress and on the administration, making  them  live within  their means for the first time in decades.  I congratulate the Members of Congress, those who supported the balanced budget agreement of 1997. It is  this law more than any other that has  given us the tools to help us now put  our financial house in order. As a result, we are seeing a decrease in the on-  budget deficit, we are cutting down on  spending, people are projecting  surpluses, and the Social Security trust  funds are growing. There is a light at  the end of the tunnel. But to get there,  we must maintain our discipline and  continue doing those things that will  bring down our debt and honor our  commitments to our citizens.  As this chart shows, if we stick to  our guns, if we honor the caps in the  1997 budget agreement, we might have  an on-budget surplus starting in the  year 2001 and a growing surplus thereafter. Here is what it looks like: In  1999, if we stick to the balanced budget  agreement, if we don’t invade the budget caps we have for the first time in 30  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:50 Nov 01, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:(cid:1)999SENATE\S08MR9.REC S08MR9 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",1999

Tell the special ed child,  whose funds you are raiding. You are  raiding those funds to start these new  initiatives. That is where the funds are  coming from. Every time the President  goes to the podium to propose a new  program, where does that money come  from in education? It comes from the  children. It comes from the special ed  child.  Why? Because  this  administration  year in and year out has refused to  fund special education. In fact, ironically, if you take all of the President’s  new  initiatives,  which  have  been  thrown at us on poll number after poll  number—every time he takes a poll, he  puts out a new initiative. If you take  all of his new initiatives on education,  they, ironically, happen to add up to  almost exactly the amount of money it  would take for the Federal Government  to fulfill its obligation to the special  needs children of this country, an obligation which was made—a  commitment, the term used by the other side,  a commitment which was not made  last fall in order to entertain the concerns of the teachers unions in this  country;  it was a commitment that  was made in 1975—1975—when we passed  94–142, a law which said that the Federal Government would pay  40 percent—40 percent—of the cost of the special needs child.  What happened? The Federal Government reneged on that obligation, to the  point where it was down to only 6 percent that was being paid by the time  the Republicans took over this Congress.  We have been able to reverse that  trend as a Republican Congress. We  have increased that funding by almost  100 percent in the last 31⁄2years. We  have gone from 6 percent up to 11 percent but without any help from this  White House. Not once did they send up  a budget that has said, let’s look at the  needs of the special ed child. Not once  did they send up a budget that said, we  have a 40-percent obligation here; we  are only fulfilling 6 percent of it, so  let’s start to fill up the rest of the obligation.  No, every time they send up a budget, it is take the money that should  have gone to special education, put it  into some brand new program which  moves  responsibility  back  here  to  Washington so we can have more control here in Washington purchased with  the money that is supposed to be going  to the special needs child.  We have another example of it right  here on this floor today that is going  to be proposed by the Senator from  Washington. Let’s add 100,000 teachers.  How much does that cost? Billions.

82,Senate,106,-0.266,29,1999-03-08,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Madam President, I  appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts yielding me some time to speak.  I strongly support the Ed-Flex legislation. In fact, New Mexico has seen  the benefit of being one of the Ed-Flex  States for the last 3-plus years. So we  have seen there is some value in that.  We certainly favor expanding that authority to other States as well. But I  don’t understand why we are in the  condition or situation we are in here  on the Senate floor today. I am not opposed to Ed-Flex. I am just in favor of  going ahead and doing a  few other  things at the same time.  I proposed an amendment which incorporates the provisions of the Dropout Prevention Act, which passed this  Senate by 74 votes in the last Congress.  All we are saying is that is a bill which  had 30 Republican Senators supporting  it. It had, I believe, virtually all Democratic Senators, or nearly all Democratic Senators, supporting it. That is  something we can agree upon. Let’s go  ahead with that. That is a priority.  We do not need to say, ‘‘Look, it has  to be Ed-Flex alone, or it can be nothing.’’ That is the part of this debate  that I don’t really understand. The notion is sort of being left out there that  somehow or other we are trying to  stall a resolution of this issue or stall  the final vote on Ed-Flex.  Nothing could be further from the  truth. I would be happy to have a vote  on this Dropout Prevention Act amendment which I proposed last week after  15 minutes of debate on our side and 15  minutes of debate on the other side.  So there is no effort by me or my cosponsors to slow down the consideration of this Ed-Flex bill. I believe that  the other Senators who are interested  in having amendments brought to the  floor for consideration would also be  glad to have short time limits so that  those amendments could be considered  and voted upon by the Senate.  Clearly, if the Senate believes that  some of these proposals are too expensive, then we can vote against them. If  the Senate believes that some of these  proposals are not yet refined enough  and need to be postponed until the Elementary and Secondary Education Act  comes to the floor, that is fine; you can  vote against the amendment at this  time and explain that is the reason.  But I do not understand why we can’t  at least have votes on the other important education proposals that people  feel strongly about going ahead with.  My own State, as I said, has this Ed-  Flex provision in law already. We have  had it for over 3 years now. During that  time, 1 of the school districts—we have  89 school districts in New Mexico—1 of  our 89 school districts applied  for a  waiver 1 time during those 3 years. As  you can see, we have not used the Ed-  Flex authority to great advantage in  our State, and I think that may be  partly our fault.  But Ed-Flex is not a cure-all. I support expanding the authority to all  States. I support putting it in permanent law. But I do not think we should  be out here on the Senate floor leaving  the impression that, once we pass this,  all the problems of education are going  to be resolved and the States are going  to have this tremendous capability to  resolve everything and the problems  will go away.  During the 3 years we have had Ed-  Flex authority in New Mexico, we have  had 1 application by 1 of the 89 school  districts for 1 waiver, and at the same  time—and  that waiver was  granted  —we have had 20,000 of our New Mexico  students drop out of school before they  graduate.  So I come to this from the point of  view that it is at least as important  with my State that we go ahead and  consider the problem of students dropping out of school in the early part of  this Congress. Some say we can deal  with that later. Well, if later means a  year and a half or 18 months from now,  at the end of the 106th Congress, if that  is as soon as we can do it, fine. But if  it is important for the Senate to move  ahead at this point on Ed-Flex, it is  also important that the Senate move  ahead at this point on this dropout prevention initiative.  A preliminary analysis of last week’s  fourth grade  reading  scores  showed  where the problem begins—or early indications of the problem. Between 1992  and 1998, the gap in reading skills between Hispanic students and non-Hispanic students in nine of our States  widened, and only in four States did  that gap decrease. So we are going in  the wrong direction as far as heading  off this dropout problem. I do not think  Ed-Flex is going to solve that. I favor  giving that authority to the States. I  favor using it more effectively in my  own State of New Mexico.  I certainly intend to vote for this  bill, but I also think it is appropriate  that Senators  be  allowed  to  offer  amendments and get votes on them. As  I say, if people want to vote against  the amendments, that is fine. But I  don’t see why we cannot have a vote on  an amendment unless that amendment  somehow passes some kind of litmus  test.

During his 30-year legal career, he has also served as president of the Los Angeles City Civil Service Commission, Deputy General Counsel  to  the Christopher Commission, and chair of the Los Angeles Police Commission. Mr. Fisher’s dedication  to practicing law in the public’s interest is especially reflected in his service as a special assistant to the Governor of California, and as past president of  the Constitutional Rights Foundation. His lifetime of public service was recognized in a ceremony on February 20th, yet his work continues. Ray Fisher  is now serving as an Associate Attorney General, and his office oversees a broad range of divisions, including antitrust, civil rights,  legal counsel, and  taxation. The Justice Department is well served by both his character and his concern for the public interest. Mr. Speaker, distinguished colleagues, I ask you to join me and the University of California at Santa Barbara  in  celebrating Raymond Fisher’s distinguished legal and public service career. We look forward to his continued leadership role at Justice for many years to come. f A TRIBUTE TO THE LATE JOHN MEYER, DEVOTED TO GOD, FAMILY, AND COUNTRY HON. CARRIE P.

Mr. Meyer shared an interest that I hold close, that of the welfare of America’s aging veterans. As an employee of many years’ standing at the Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen’s Home on Harewood Road  in Washington, D.C., Mr. Meyer’s  compassion and quiet, hard work earned him the friendship and respect of the veterans. Their bereavement at Mr. Meyer’s tragic death on March 24 at age 26 after an automobile  accident was  expressed  in  a touching manner. The veterans arranged to attend Mr. Meyer’s funeral by the busloads. The Easter Monday funeral service overflowed with family, friends, and flowers. John Meyer also worked at  the United States Department of Agriculture’s Research Farm in Beltsville, Maryland, where he was a valued employee. Mr. Meyer was the proud father of his daughter, Angela Grace; an attentive husband to his wife, Jayne; a beloved son of his parents, Angela and Jacob Meyer; and a devoted brother to James and Donald. He also was survived by his loving grandmothers, Rose Zerega and Eloise Kramer; and by his aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends, who treasure his happy memory. John Meyer lived the ethos of devotion to God, family, and country. His example of solid American citizenship has left an indelible impression on those who knew him. f A TRIBUTE TO WAWONA FROZEN FOODS HON.

87,,106,0.484,64,1999-03-08,Mr. RADANOVICH.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to pay tribute to Wawona Frozen Foods, recipient of the 1998 Baker, Peterson & Franklin Ag Business Award. Wawona Frozen Foods  is an organization whose achievements and impacts have significantly contributed to the Ag industry and the Central Valley. The Baker, Peterson & Franklin Ag Business Award honors a service or product-related agribusiness or farming entity, with headquarters in the central San Joaquin Valley. The Award recipient is selected by a committee representing the AgFRESNO Advisory Board, National Ag Marketing Association and the Agriculture department at Baker, Peterson & Franklin. Wawona Frozen Foods grows and processes California freestone peaches and strawberries  into  fresh  frozen  fruit products and baked fruit pastries. From a modest beginning 35 years ago, with 60 part-time employees the company has grown to 150 full-time and 1,200 seasonal processing facility to three state-ofthe-art facilities. Annual revenue has grown 40 fold, now exceeding $40 million annually. Beginning as a supplier to solely food manufacturers, Wawona has grown their sales in other markets  including  food  service distributors, restaurant  chains,  retail  and  warehouse stores, school  food service and  the USDA school lunch program. Wawona Frozen Foods is America’s largest processor of California  freestone peaches, shipping over 65 million pounds of  the 110 million pound industry-wide crop of 80% of the entire national frozen production. The growth in sales of  frozen peaches has a vital and positive impact on the entire freestone peach industry and makes the total peach marketing program more stable while contributing to the potential of higher prices  for  fresh market peaches. Wawona Frozen Foods  is an exceptional corporate citizen.  Its officers and employees participate  in and  financially support many community activities. Wawona is involved with the Clovis Unified School Foundation, Valley Children’s Hospital, St. Agnes Hospital, Valley Teen Ranch  and  the National Hispanics Scholarship Fund, just to name a few. All of the Wawona principals are graduates of California State University, Fresno, and major grants have been given to the CSUF Ag and Food Science Departments as a commitment of their support. The company has also been a  leader  in state and national organizations such as the California Tree Fruit Association, National  Restaurant  Association  and  the American Frozen Foods  Institute, of which Wawona’s CEO is president emeritus on the board of directors. Mr. Speaker,  I am honored  to  recognize Wawona Frozen Foods as the recipient of the Baker, Peterson &  Franklin Ag Business Award. The Central Valley can be proud of the fine work done by this outstanding local company.

88,,106,-0.207,64,1999-03-08,Mr. PHELPS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. and Mrs. Joe E. Palmer of Herrin, IL, on the occasion of their fiftieth wedding anniversary. The Palmer’s were married on Feb. 26, 1949 in Herrin, where they lived, worked and raised a large family with 10 children, 23 grandchildren, and 2 great-grand-children. Joe and Dora were exceptional  role models and they worked hard to provide their children with a Christian home. All ten of their children received college degrees, and some went on to graduate school. Joe worked for and retired from the Maytag Corporation and Dora was a homemaker. Since retirement both have enjoyed gardening and spending  time with their family. Once again, I am pleased to have this opportunity to congratulate the Palmers, and I would like to wish them and their family many more happy years. f TRIBUTE TO AMY PAGE OF GIRL SCOUT TROOP 395 HON.

90,House,106,-0.418,4,1999-03-18,Mr. MOAKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague the gentleman  from New York  (Mr. for yielding me the customary half-hour. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this closed rule. The Committee on Rules has reported a series of bills to the floor under open rules in the last couple of months. But if the truth be told, Mr. Speaker, those bills could have been considered under the suspension of the rules and did not really have to come to the floor at all. Now, when the House is about to consider legislation that is of paramount importance to every man, woman, and child in the country, the Republican party has reported out a closed rule. What we heard earlier today during our closed session reinforces the significance of this issue. Yet we are being asked to consider  it under a closed rule. For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I cannot support this rule. Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority refuses to allow even one amendment on this bill. We asked for an additional hour of debate on the bill but that was not allowed. What is at stake here, Mr. Speaker, is the future and well-being of this Nation. Yet my Republican colleagues do not want  to take the time to fully debate and air this issue. I cannot support this closed process, and I strongly urge every Member of this body who supports the democratic ideals of free and open debate to oppose this closed and unfair rule. The ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services yesterday indicated that, while he is opposed to the amendment that was proposed by  the gentleman  from Maine  (Mr. ALLEN), he felt that the amendment should be considered by the House. The Allen amendment seeks to clarify that any national missile defense system must be proven to work before it is deployed and that any deployment decision must be weighed against other military as well as civilian priorities. Allowing the House to consider an amendment like the Allen proposal is really not too much to ask, Mr. Speaker. Yet my Republican colleagues seem to think that allowing an alternative to their proposal to be heard on the floor is indeed too much to ask. Mr. Speaker, if the Republican Party is really interested in changing the atmosphere in this House, we do not have to go up to a mountainside and smoke a peace pipe. All we have to do is be fair about  the  rules and allow  the Democrats to participate on the floor. Mr. Speaker, I see little evidence of that on this rule, and I urge my members to defeat this unfair, closed rule so that we can have an open debate on the entire issue. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. ",1999
91,House,106,0.421,4,1999-03-18,Mr. GOSS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York, a new member of our committee and a valued member of our committee, for yielding me this time. Today we embark on a crucial debate directly relevant to the  lives of all American men, women, and especially our children. I would argue that the Congress of the United States has no more significant duty than to ensure the greatest level of protection for our national security. With the dawn of the next century just a few short months away, we face a  future that  is bright with opportunity and promise, some of which we are realizing today, but a future that is also vulnerable  to attack,  including specifically missile attack, by those who would do us harm. And let us be clear. Those who would do us harm inhabit many quarters of this ever-shrinking world. Many are actively seeking to develop and deploy the technology to provide themselves a ballistic missile  capability  to  use against the United States of America. We do not pursue this debate today to scare people, but rather to engage them in an open-eyed assessment of the world as it is. We all might wish to believe President Clinton’s pronouncement that no American child is currently being targeted by a missile, but that  is unfortunately not exactly a true statement. Sadly, the 1964 election year Johnson campaign ad of a little girl playing in a field of flowers backdropped by an atomic cloud is still vivid and still a sickening possibility in today’s world. Beyond the state of affairs today, there is also the reality that the world’s bad guys are moving quickly and with the sense of purpose toward a tomorrow when they can wreak havoc and cause damage with weapons of mass destruction or mass casualty targeted against Americans and our interests. I have always advocated investment in the eyes and ears capabilities of U.S. intelligence so we can have as full a picture as possible about the threats we face as we develop policies to protect ourselves. We need not only to know about the missiles but also about the plans and the  intentions of the Saddam  Husseins  and  Khadafis, Khomenis and Kim Jong  Ils of the world today. Some might say that since the Cuban missile  crisis we have not  focused enough  on  these  threats  in  recent years,  perhaps  because  the  policymakers did not want to see the dangers. But, Mr. Speaker, our intelligence says unequivocally that the threat is real, growing, and much more immediate than some had thought. So  I strongly believe we must commit ourselves to putting in place a missile defense program as soon as practical. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4 is a deceptively simple bill. Its entirety is only one sentence. But the 15 words that comprise the operative text of H.R. 4 speak volumes to the entire planet that we will not shy away from the tough challenge of making America and her people safe from a missile attack. Support this rule and vote for H.R. 4 and do America a favor. ",1999

95,House,106,-0.556,18,1999-03-18,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, maybe I am just too simple, but today’s debate, today’s argument for an extended missile defense system, takes me back to the 1950s when I was in school. At least weekly while I was  in grade school every student and our teachers went under our desks to practice protection against the atom bomb. Mr. Speaker, I can assure my colleagues we have a false sense of security, and it all came from these exercises. Now I question just how safe we could be with this missile  defense  technology  against rogue States. Mr. Speaker, what are we really investing in? I fear what we will be investing in is a false sense of security. I would suggest that instead we invest in true security. We can spend our scarce Federal dollars on technologies to protect us from the unknown, or we can use these scarce resources to keep our country secure by investing in humanitarian  relations with other nations around the world. For example, if we want to get serious about our nation’s defense, we should be investing in programs that will prepare us to confront the international challenges we actually  face and keep nuclear materials out of the hands of terrorists and rogue nations. This is a more effective tool for nonproliferation than Star Wars will ever be. This is where we should be investing our scarce dollars. There is an even greater way that we can invest and that we can ensure national security. We can invest in our children. Education is truly the cheap defense of our Nation and all nations. By investing in education of our children, we will ensure that they are prepared for a high-tech global economy, they will be prepared  to work  for peace, and they will know that weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles  can  destroy  every  human being on this Earth.

97,House,106,0.529,18,1999-03-18,Mr. THORNBERRY.," Mr.  Speaker, thanks to the work of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. WELDON), the chairman of the committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. HUNTER), others and the Rumsfeld Commission, no one seriously questions whether we are threatened today by the spread of missiles,  nor  does  anyone  question whether that threat is going to grow in the future. No one seriously questions whether the American people want and in fact demand a defense against those missiles, which even the administration now seems to acknowledge. Mr. Speaker, if the national security is the first responsibility of the Federal Government  and  if  protecting  the homeland of the United States and the people of the United States is the first job of national security, then I do not know of any program that ought to be higher on the priority list than this one. The question is do we in Congress and  does  the  administration  really mean what we say in this resolution? Are these words merely a way to try to deal with a political problem and the polls, or do they mean something, and are they going to be backed up with action? Since 1983, we have heard a million excuses about how we could not do this or we should not do this. Even today we hear excuses. But we cannot give Russia or anyone else a veto over our right to defend ourselves, we cannot be afraid of test failures, and we certainly cannot be fooled by those few people who say that by weakening ourselves we are really making ourselves stronger. Mr. Speaker, the time for excuses has ended. The time for action is now. The time to back up these words with real actions that protect the American people is today. ",1999
98,House,106,-0.517,18,1999-03-18,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. Mr. Speaker, this debate  is about whether, after spending $140 billion on missile defense programs over the last 40 years, we continue to spend billions more. But this debate is about much more than that. Given the fact that there  is a  limited amount of  funds available for our needs, let me tell my colleagues what  this debate  is also about. This debate is whether millions of senior citizens today who cannot afford the prescription drugs they need to ease their pain or stay alive are going to get those prescription drugs or whether we continue  to  spend even more on the military. That is what this debate is about. This morning, Mr. Speaker,  I attended a committee meeting with representatives of all of the veterans organizations, and they said what is absolutely true, that this Congress has been disgraceful in ignoring the needs of our veterans and our Veterans Administration hospitals, and they are begging us for a few billion dollars more to protect our veterans so that we do not turn them away from our VA hospitals. But over and over again we hear there is no money available for our veterans; but, yes, there is $150 billion more available 5 years  for military over  the next  spending. And we have young families all over America who look forward to sending their kids to college; no money available for Pell grants, yet more money available for Star Wars, for B–2 bombers, for every defense system that the military industrial complex wants. Now I have heard that we are spending very little so far on defense, on understanding, on research for the missile defense program. If we have $300 billion in the defense budget now and we do not even have a Soviet Union out there to oppose us, why do we not take some of that money rather than asking us for more? The United States  today spends $300 billion, NATO spends $200 billion, North Korea spends less than $3 billion. Take what we have and spend it wisely. ",1999
99,House,106,0.547,18,1999-03-18,Mr. RYUN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker, most Americans believe  the United States military has the ability to defend our country against a ballistic missile  attack. However  today  the United States does not have the capability  to  shoot  down  one  single ballistic missile. Mr. Speaker,  I ask why have we failed to develop this capability? Is it because the threat of a ballistic missile attack disappeared with the fall of the Soviet Union? Absolutely not. Since the end of the Cold War, the threat of a ballistic missile attack against the United States has become more serious and more  difficult  to  anticipate. Through the continued proliferation of key missile technologies by China and Russia, rogue nations around the globe have acquired long-range ballistic missile  technology  that now  puts  the United States in jeopardy. Mr. Speaker, in 1995 the current administration did not  foresee a  long range ballistic missile threat  for at least a decade. The administration’s opinion has now changed. General Lester Lyles, the Pentagon’s Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization,  confirmed  the  threat  to  the American people by saying this, and I quote: We are affirming the threat,  today and it is growing. it  is real Mr. Speaker, these are not reassuring words, and they are disturbing words that relay a disheartening message to the American people. Detractors of a missile defense system spread the rumors and the myths that a national missile defense system would cost too much to deploy. It has cost this administration an estimated $19 billion over 6 years to support its peacekeeping missions. Compare that to the estimated $10 billion that it will cost the United States over the next 6 years to protect American  lives  from  a  long-range ballistic missile attack. Mr. Speaker, China, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya have all acquired the ",1999
100,House,106,0.232,32,1999-03-18,Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania.," Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to applaud the level of debate today on this issue and thank Members from both sides for their  diligence  in  focusing  on  this issue. I want to applaud the integrity of the opponents of this issue. And I want to point out the difference between the opponents in this body who stood up and focused on their opposition and the opponents in the other body who twice stopped a similar bill from getting up to a vote and then had the audacity to change and vote for it on the Senate floor yesterday. So I applaud the opponents who have a logical and philosophical difference with what we have done here and I applaud them for taking the steps to oppose it, even though I disagree with them. I do take issue with those who say that we do not care about human concerns. Mr. Speaker, I am a teacher. I spent 7 years teaching in the public schools of Pennsylvania and for 3 of those years I ran a chapter 1 program serving those children with educational and economic deprivations. I support education.  I support human services and needs. But what do we tell, Mr. Speaker, the families of those 28 young Americans who came home  in body bags? They were hit by a missile. Do we tell them that we are not going to pursue a defense? Do we tell them that there  is some other more  important priority after they volunteered to serve our Nation? We have no choice but to pursue missile defense, Mr. Speaker, because that is the weapon of choice by rogue nations. I do take issue with those who say that we are trying to harm our strategic relationship with Russia. For the last 20 years since graduating from college with a degree in Russian studies, I have focused on Russia. I have been there 18 years and I have been focusing on ways to provide more economic stability with that nation. That is not a reason for us to deny protection for our people. We need to provide this system to protect Americans. It is time  for us to vote. Not to provide cover for Members. If Members support the President’s policy of waiting a year and then deciding whether or not he should deploy, ",1999

102,House,106,-0.459,46,1999-03-18,Mrs. CLAYTON.," Mr. Speaker, at the Farm Resource Center, a national crisis line for farmers, those seeking help cannot get through. The line is busy. Small  farmers  and  ranchers  are struggling to survive in America. In fact, small farmers and ranchers are a dying breed. And because they are a dying breed, quality and affordable food and fiber for all of us is at risk. Passage of the 1996 farm bill sounded the death knell for many of our Nation’s farmers and ranchers. Farmers and ranchers, able to eke out a living from the land in past years, now find it almost impossible to break even. Most are losing money and fighting to stay in the farming business. And the crisis line is busy. We are all aware of the problems tobacco  is having, particularly  in my State, North Carolina. But, in North Carolina, according to a recent news report, the State top farm commodity, hogs, have experienced a 50 percent drop in prices since 1996. Wheat is down 42 percent. Soybeans are down 36 percent. Corn, 31 percent; peanuts, 28 percent. Turkey and cotton prices are down 23 percent since 1996. In fact, Mr. Speaker,  there  is no commodity  in North Carolina that makes money for farmers. And the crisis line is busy. In 1862, the year that the Department of Agriculture was created, 90 percent of the population farmed for a living. Today, American producers represent less than 3 percent of the population. By 1992, there were only 1.1 million farms left in the United States, a 45 percent decline from 1959. North Carolina only had 39,000 farms left in 1992, a 23 percent decline. In 1920, there were over 6 million  farms  in the United States, and close to a sixth, 926,000, were operated by African Americans. In 1992, the landscape was very, very different. Only 1 percent of the farms in the United States were operated by African Americans, 1 percent, 18,816, a paltry sum when African Americans comprise more than 13 percent of the population. In my home State of North Carolina, there has been a 64 percent decline in minority farmers just over the last 15 years, from 6,996 farms in 1978 to 2,498 farms in 1992. All farmers are suffering under this severe economic downturn. Very recently while in my district I spoke with a farmer who was working off the farm, not to earn extra money but to earn enough money to save his family farm. He makes no money from his farm for himself. He loses money from his farm. Taking a job off the ",1999

While some enjoy an economic boom and take advantage of new economic opportunities, I was meeting earlier today with a group of high  school  students who came  to  see me  from  the Close-up Foundation,  from the Navajo Nation and understand, Mr. Speaker, that unemployment on the sovereign Navajo nation, an area in geographic size almost the size of the State of West Virginia, transcending the boundaries of four of our sovereign states, unemployment on the reservations can top and exceed 50 percent  in some cases. So jobs, be they temporary, are welcome and indeed there would be a lot of people. This is one of the topics we addressed today, what happens for economic empowerment because as we all know and as I remarked to the Navajo Tribal Council when I was honored to address that assembly in Window Rock, Arizona, the Navajo Nation capital, the greatest social program in the world is a job.

Mrs. Leach was profiled in the November 1998 national magazine Cable  in  the Classroom  for her innovative methods to use technologies in the classroom. Mrs. Leach is a regular user of video in her science  class.  She  has  found  that  by supplementing  the  traditional  text method of teaching she is able to reach different kinds of learners. Some students  favor auditory and visual information processing. Mrs. Leach has found that to reach more students more effectively she must present  the material  in as many different ways as she can. In  addition  to  her  responsibilities  as  a science teacher, Onorina Leach is the coach of Highland High School’s United States Academic Decathlon  team. Also, Mrs. Leach  is using video to help prepare the Highland High School Decathlon  team  for competition. The students participating  in  the United States Academic Decathlon  learn study skills,  timemanagement skills and social skills. A compliment given to Mrs. Leach by a student she had years ago summarizes Ms. Leach’s dedication  to  her  students.  ‘‘You  know, Mrs. Leach, Academic Decathlon  did  not  necessarily prepare me for graduate school, but it did prepare me for life.’’ Please  join me  in honoring and  thanking Onorina Leach for the difference she is making  in  the  lives of her students and  to our great community of Albuquerque, New Mexico. f MY COMMITMENT TO FREE AND FAIR TRADE FOR AGRICULTURE HON.

116,,106,0.638,165,1999-03-18,Mr. SCHAFFER.," Mr. Speaker, Colorado agriculture increasingly depends upon the export market  to expand sales and  increase  revenues. The expanding world trade in agriculture has a significant impact on both the U.S. trade balance and on specific commodities and individual farmers. No sector of the U.S. economy is subject to more  international  trade barriers  than agriculture. The  import quotas, high  tariffs, government buying monopolies and import bans imposed by other nations, coupled with  the overwhelming number of trade sanctions and embargoes imposed on other countries by our own government,  cost  the American agriculture industry billions of dollars each year in lost export opportunities. These barriers continue to grow in spite of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA). Without question,  they are devastating the ability for American agriculture to effectively compete, particularly at a time when exports now account  for 30% of U.S. farm cash receipts and nearly 40% of all agricultural production. It is abundantly clear, that  in addition  to  free  trade, America must guarantee fair trade. The 1996 Freedom  to Farm Act  returned control of farming operations to producers in exchange for sharp restrictions on the level of government support. The goal was to provide U.S. farmers with the flexibility to run their operations according to the marketplace. But in exchange,  the U.S. government has a clear responsibility to ensure that our farmers and ranchers have  the ability  to compete  fairly ",1999
117,,106,-0.495,179,1999-03-18,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Mr. Speaker, standing  in front of our nation’s Capitol today was Mary Ann Waygan, a woman from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, who joined with Senators CHAFEE, MIKULSKI, and SMITH in introducing the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act. As an original cosponsor of the House version of this legislation, I would like to share with you her eloquent  testimony of  those affected by  this tragic disease. STATEMENTOFMARYANNWAYGAN Hello, my name is Mary Ann Waygan and I am the coordinator for the CDC Breast and Cervical Cancer Initiative for Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Before I begin, I would like to thank Senators Chafee, Mikulski, Snowe and Moynihan for sponsoring this legislation. I would also like to thank Senator Smith for his support of this bill. Clearly, the single largest problem facing the Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening Program today is finding resources and caregivers to provide treatment to the women who are diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer. The lack of treatment dollars is one of the biggest policy gaps in the program— and the problem is only getting worse. The barriers to recruiting providers  for charity care are growing, and funding for the treatment is an ad-hoc system that relies on volunteers, state workers and others to find treatment services. In the community, we go to tremendous ends to find treatment—and raise money to help pay for it. I’ve organized luncheons, bake sales, raffles—you name it. Anything to raise money  for women who could not afford to pay out of pocket for treatment. Despite  these  efforts, all  too often, we come up short. Funding for treatment through the CDC program is the biggest problem I face as a coordinator and frankly a barrier to screening and detection. Funding for treatment is tenuous at best. Without passage of  the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, future  funding  for  treatment  for  these women will remain uncertain. I want to tell you one story in particular that clearly illustrates the problem some of these women face. A woman who lives in Buzzard’s Bay, Massachusetts who was diagnosed with breast cancer through the CDC program. Arlene McMann is a married woman in her early forties with two teenage sons and no health insurance. When Arlene was diagnosed with breast cancer through the CDC screening program, she was devastated—not just with the diagnosis, but with the fact that she had no way to pay for the treatment she needed. Faced with that situation, she and her husband were forced to use the $20,000 they had been saving for years to pay for their children’s college tuition. In less than a year, that money was gone. After that, she and her husband were forced to go into debt to pay for  her  ongoing  chemotherapy/radiation treatment and other procedures including a craniotomy and gall bladder surgery. They are now more than $40,000  in debt, were forced to move into a much smaller house and lost their dream of sending their sons to college without going into further debt. The additional stress and pressure placed on Arlene and her husband by this situation has turned a difficult situation into an almost unbearable one. To make it even worse, Arlene recently found out that the cancer has spread to her hip, pelvis, lungs and liver. Through all of this, Arlene has showed tremendous resolve. Despite being in pain and discomfort and forced to use a wheelchair, Arlene desperately wanted to be here today to share her story with you directly. She thought it was important for everyone to understand not just what the cancer had done to her, but what the effect of having to take on this incredible financial burden had done to her physical health, mental strength and family resources. Due to her condition, Arlene’s treatment finally is being paid because she qualified for disability. But to this day, Arlene is convinced that her cancer would not have spread had she been able to afford regular visits to an oncologist. Arlene’s energy and determination to fight this disease and remain positive are amazing. I feel lucky to know her and to have worked with her. I only wish that as the program coordinator, I could have done more— that I could have assured her that any treatment she needed would be paid for and that she wouldn’t have to spend time dealing with bank  statements, mortgages  or  packing boxes on top of everything else. In summary, we hear over and over again that early detection saves lives. In actuality, early detection alone does nothing but find the disease; detection must be coupled with guaranteed, quality treatment to actually save lives. We must pass the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act to make sure that screening and treatment always go together. I would like to thank the National Breast Cancer Coalition for its leadership role in working to get this legislation passed and thank the members of Congress here today for sponsoring and supporting this legislation. f JERSEY  CENTRAL  NEW  CONGRATULATES  BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN ON HIS INDUCTION INTO THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME HON.

Disabled people have much to offer. It  is  time  that we recognize and encourage them to participate as contributing members of society. I am especially pleased to support the Medicare and Medicaid provisions of this bill. Without these programs, many people living with disabilities would not have access to the care that is so vital to their health and well-being.

That is a concern, but there are also concerns this morning in North Korea. The Washington Times reports this morning, and I quote, ‘‘Vital parts of a 50-megawatt North Korean nuclear reactor have been missing since international  inspectors  first visited  the site under the terms of a 1994 nuclearfreeze pact with the United States. ‘‘The absence of the reactor parts, which could be used to construct another  reactor, was known by  some State Department officials but was never disclosed to Congress.’’ Mr. Speaker, on a morning when people may go into harm’s way, the State Department did not notify us of this Korean breach. The Energy Department did not notify us of an espionage breach.

121,House,106,-0.226,8,1999-03-24,Mr. EDWARDS.," Mr. Speaker,  last week I heard a lot of speeches in this House about the crucial need to protect American families with the National Missile Defense System. Frankly, it is a concept I support. I heard a lot of speeches about the threat of nuclear missiles launched against the United States. Mr. Speaker, that is exactly why I am so amazed and disappointed that this bill, less than 1 week after those very speeches, eliminates crucial funds designed to stop the nonproliferation of nuclear bomb grade materials in Russia. Specifically, this measure would cut $150 million that, as we speak, is being used to develop an agreement between Russia and the United States that would take 50 tons of plutonium, 50 tons of plutonium, and make it unusable for nuclear weapons. Mr. Speaker, 50 tons of plutonium is enough nuclear material to build as many as 20,000 nuclear bombs. That is 20,000 nuclear bombs that could be put on missiles  and  aimed  toward  the United States, or 20,000 nuclear bombs that could be hidden in a truck and detonated in any American city, 20,000 nuclear  bombs  that  terrorists  and thugs across the world would pay any price to get their hands on. According to the chief American negotiator in these ongoing negotiations with Russia, according to that negotiator, this bill could cause Russia to walk away from these crucial anti-proliferation negotiations. Mr. Speaker, we all know there is serious economic instability in Russia. We all know that there is a serious presence of organized crime in Russia. We all know that there are terrorists throughout the world that would do anything to get their hands on even 1 percent of this 50 tons of plutonium and use that to build weapons that could be used against American servicemen and women abroad or against American families in their own homes, in their own hometowns. There is no logic, absolutely no logic, to spending billions of dollars for a National Missile Defense System and then at the very same time stopping a process that could prevent the potential development of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. This action would give new meaning to the term ‘‘penny-wise and pound-foolish.’’ Now, proponents of this proposed $150 million cut allege it will not undermine our nonproliferation negotiations with Russia. That is what they allege. Well, that is not what the American negotiator says. That is not what the Russian negotiator said, and said as late as yesterday to a number of Members of the House. That is not what the Republican author of this crucial funding says, and that is not what the Secretary of Energy said, the former U.N. Ambassador, who has ultimate responsibility for these ongoing nonproliferation debates. Let me quote Secretary Richardson, the Secretary of Energy, when he said in a letter dated today, ‘‘Such a reduction would have severe consequences,’’ severe consequences, ‘‘for the ongoing negotiations of pursuit of a bilateral agreement with Russia on disposing of enough plutonium  to make  tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. To now withdraw this earnest money would be to call into question U.S. reliability. Russia may well perceive such a withdrawal as a breach of good faith. Withdrawing this money would severely set back and might even bring a halt to our constructive discussions on this important  nonproliferation  and  national security issue.’’ He goes on to say that, ‘‘The U.S. has also been working closely with  the international community to gain commitments for additional support for the Russian plutonium dispossession effort. These potential donors would perceive a reduction in available U.S. funds as a dilution of our leadership and resolve and our leverage would be drastically undercut.’’ b1100 Mr. Speaker, we should do the prudent thing today. We should send this bill back to committee and have  it withdrawn, have the provisions withdrawn that would basically put a greater risk on American servicemen and women abroad and American families right at home. No Member would have the intent to harm any serviceman or woman or not a single person in this country. But I would suggest that, despite the best of intentions, if we listen to the negotiators, we  listen to the experts  involved  in  these nonproliferation debates, this measure today and this unwise, difficult, terrible cut could put at risk our negotiations and, most importantly, millions  of  Americans  all across this land of ours. Let us do the right thing. Let us send this bill back to committee. And  if that  fails,  let us vote  for the Obey amendment that takes out this unwise and dangerous and I hope and pray not catastrophic proposal. ",1999

125,House,106,-0.516,22,1999-03-24,Mr. SABO.," Mr. Chairman, this is a strange bill, particularly all of these speeches we hear about offsets. In my judgment,  this bill  is a  legitimate emergency, under the budget rules can be handled as an emergency without being offset and that is how it should be handled, but we are going through this pretense that we are making offsets when in reality we are not. Let me suggest to all the Members they look at this bill. Page 3, they will find this language: Provided that the entire amount  is designated by  the Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant to section so and so of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985, as amended. What does that mean? It means that the outlays in this bill are exempt from the budgetary caps, and the law we are passing, we are saying it is an emergency, the outlays are exempt from the caps, but then we get into a discussion of a whole series of offsets, which really are not offsets to the outlays. We are actually spending this money outside of the caps but then we do a whole series of offsets that do damage but does not solve the budgetary problem; primarily reducing the callable capital for the international banks. What is the reality of this type of cut? It is as if I signed as a second signatory on a loan for $100,000, but then I decided I wanted to buy a new car for $30,000 and pay cash  for  it. What  I would do is I would send a letter to the bank saying I am sorry, this guarantee I made  is  reduced  from  $100,000  to $70,000 and somehow think that gives me $30,000 of cash to go out and pay cash for a car. It clearly does not work, but that is the mentality we are using in these offsets. The bank would probably call the loan back on the mortgage I had signed for because my guarantee was only now good for 70 percent of it and I would not get $30,000 to go and buy a new car. That is what we are doing in this bill. We are still pretending or saying it is an emergency. That is real. The outlays are exempt  from the caps, but then we do these series of cuts which do damage but do not change the nature of the fact that our outlays are still considered emergencies. ",1999

127,House,106,-0.455,29,1999-03-24,Mr. FARR of California.," Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and I rise in support of the emergency aid and in opposition to these offsets. Mr. Speaker, an emergency  is an emergency. Hurricane Mitch hit a half a year ago in Central America and we are here today arguing emergency relief because of the offsets. We still have in Central America 2.4 million, almost 2.5 million people that are displaced or homeless. That is bigger than the population of a lot of States that are represented here on the floor. Why are we being so cruel in this process of saying, in order to help people that are disabled and homeless, in an area where we need to get the infrastructure and the economy going, that we have to penalize our domestic programs? The epicenter for the 1989 earthquake in California, the Loma Prieta earthquake, was in my district. Do my colleagues know that we received aid from Japan, aid from Mexico, aid from European countries? They came to California, probably the richest State in the United States, because we were in a disaster and they knew we needed help. We have 23 other nations that have responded to Central America. Some of these have debt with those nations, bilateral debt, far greater than what we have. And yet Brazil is able to give $179 million  in debt  forgiveness; France, $127 million; Sweden, small Sweden, $45 million; and the United States, the richest country of all, debt forgiveness is $41 million. My colleagues have constituents who wrote checks to the International Red Cross; millions of dollars were received by the Salvation Army  for relief  in Latin America, and these donors did not talk about offsets. The men and women from our districts who are now in Central America working with the nongovernmental  organizations, who have taken time off, are not asking for offsets. The 23,000 American troops and National Guardsmen who are building roads and bridges, who are building medical  clinics,  who  are  building schools, who are working at a 2-and-3week period of time, are not asking for offsets. It is really a sad day that we are here debating an emergency bill because of offsets, and  it  leads us  to wonder whether the only time we are ever going to be able to respond to an emergency without offsets is if we declare war. I oppose the offsets. ",1999
128,House,106,0.449,29,1999-03-24,Mr. TIAHRT.," Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and I rise in opposition to the amendment. ",1999
129,House,106,0.419,43,1999-03-24,Mr. PACKARD.," Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? ",1999
130,House,106,-0.656,43,1999-03-24,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike  the  requisite  number  of words. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the Obey amendment to H.R. 1141, the Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999. This supplemental bill was supposed to have been a bipartisan effort to provide desperately needed funds to assist American  farmers, respond to hurricane damage in Central America and the Caribbean, support the new government of Jordan and correct the amount of money appropriated to the Office of Minority Health. Unfortunately, this bill  now  contains  provisions masquerading as offsets that are both unnecessary and harmful. So much for bipartisanism. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee  on Domestic  and  International Monetary Policy of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, I am particularly concerned about a provision that would rescind $648 million in funds that were previously appropriated to guarantee the solvency of multilateral development banks. Neither the Committee on Banking and Financial  Services  nor  my  subcommittee were ever given an opportunity to consider this controversial rescission. There are three multilateral development  banks—the World Bank,  the Asian Development Bank,  and  the Inter-American Development Bank— that provide loans to developing countries to promote economic growth and development. These banks have collected  guarantees  from  the United States  to  sell bonds  to commercial banks. The development banks use the proceeds from these bond sales to make their  loans  to developing countries. These guarantees, known as callable capital, ensure that the bank’s lenders will be repaid even if a substantial portion of the loans made by the banks are not repaid. Prior to 1981, the United States appropriated  funds  to provide  for our share of the callable capital of the multilateral development banks. The development banks have always been able to repay their bonds on time without calling upon the United States. The United States Government’s guarantees to these banks have never cost the American taxpayers one dime. The supplemental appropriations bill includes a provision to rescind a portion of the banks’ callable capital. The Republican supporters of this provision claim that it is an offset for the emergency spending in the bill. However, this is smoke and mirrors. This provision does not actually save any money and cannot be considered an offset. Since the United States has never had to provide any money to the multilateral development banks  to  cover their bonds, there were never any outlays. Furthermore, it is unlikely that there ever will be any outlays. In other words, the supplemental appropriations act  is rescinding money that would never have been spent, anyway. The proposed rescission of callable capital contained in the supplemental bill will have no effect whatsoever on the size of the budget surplus. Shame on them for making people think that this is a legitimate offset that is going to save some money. Although the rescission of callable capital will not  increase the budget surplus, it will, however, jeopardize the effective operation of the multilateral development  banks.  If  the  United States rescinds any of its callable capital, it will be a signal to worldwide financial markets that the United States may no longer be willing to meet its international financial obligations. Over the past 50 years, loans to developing countries from the multilateral development banks have promoted economic growth and created new businesses and job opportunities as well as markets for American exports. These banks are especially important to the world economy today. Many nations in Asia and Latin America are facing a serious economic and  financial crisis. They are dependent on loans from the banks to stabilize their currencies and allow their economies to recover. Asia and Latin American markets are desperately in need of this capital. b1500 Let me just close my remarks by saying this was supposed to be a bipartisan effort, and the American farmers, the agricultural community that both sides of the aisle claim they care so much about, stand to benefit. That is Republicans and Democrats alike. If they mess up this supplemental appropriation by insisting on these offsets, they are going to hurt the very people that  they are always mouthing off about that they care so much about. Let us stop playing games. Let us stop with the smoke and mirrors about offsets that do not realize one single dime, one single cent. Let us get on with the business of a supplemental appropriation bill. We will do what we started out to do. ",1999
131,House,106,0.339,50,1999-03-24,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Tiahrt amendment. I have to say, and I mentioned this earlier today on the House floor, when a number of us met with the Speaker and the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. YOUNG),  the new chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, earlier this year, we talked about this bill and how we would like to support it but, for a number of reasons we were not able to. Much  to  the  credit  of  Speaker Hastert, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOUNG), the chairman of the committee, and now the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. TIAHRT), we are really offsetting all of the costs of this supplemental appropriation bill. Because of that, we are not adding to the debt. We are not adding to the deficit. We are looking to make this bill work in the right way. I think all of our colleagues should  support  this  bill  and  this amendment to make it even stronger than the committee reported out. I rise in strong support. ",1999
132,House,106,0.348,50,1999-03-24,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words and, hopefully, in the process of doing so, have a dialogue with my friend, the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. TODDTIAHRT). I would hope in the process of this discussion I might urge my colleague to consider, at  least consider, withdrawing his amendment. Let me explain why I would even begin to suggest that this might be appropriate when I know very well how serious the gentleman  is about this amendment and how hard he has worked to develop it. The circumstances in Central America are critical circumstances involving humanitarian  efforts  that  very much relate to our efforts to build relations south of our border. At the peak following that disaster we had some 5,000 troops  in the region. We have flown nearly  1,000 humanitarian air sorties there. We have rescued over a thousand people from floods. The military was  involved  in building  temporary bridges that allowed lifelines, food and medicine, to be delivered. Indeed, there are hundreds of temporary ",1999
133,House,106,0.411,64,1999-03-24,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, I was sitting there writing my note and not ready to speak, but I will do it off the cuff. I am vehemently opposed to us going into Kosovo, and I will explain why. But making that statement, now that we are engaged in Kosovo, I will do everything in my power to support the President.  I will also  tell my  colleagues why. The President did not give us that courtesy when I was fighting in Vietnam. He continued protesting in countries that killed many of my friends. I myself was shot down by a Russian SAM. Now, that may not bother my colleagues, but it did bother me that the President was protesting in Russia. We need to get behind every one of our men and women. I do not care about my colleagues here, and I do not care about them over here, and I do not care about my Senate colleagues.  I care about those kids we are asking to send in harm’s way. And let me tell my colleagues why I am opposed to this. First of all, a majority of the Russian military feel that they need to overthrow the Russian Government. These are  the  hard-liners  that  support Milosevic. Milosevic is terrible, but so is Tudjman and so is Izetbegovic. All three of them need to go. And I predict that within this year we are going to see a major coup in Russia because of what we are doing. If I was the head of North Korea, I would come tomorrow if we get tied in Kosovo. If I was Saddam Hussein, I would come tomorrow. We are in 52 wars, Mr. Speaker, in this world. Some of them  far more damaging than Kosovo. I am very, very concerned of what is going to happen over there as far as past foreign policy. I look at Somalia, to where the President changed the policy of humanitarian to going after Hadeed and then he drew down our forces, and after our military said we cannot do that because this makes us vulnerable. He did it anyway. And then they asked for armor because they could not get in. Seventeen hours,  I watched  it  last night on television, that it took us to get to our troops; and we lost 22 rangers. People ask me, ‘‘What is it like to work  with  somebody  you  cannot trust?’’ That is an important question. I do not trust this President to get us out of Kosovo. I do not trust him to get us out of Yugoslavia, no more than I expect him to get us out of Haiti, because we are still there spending $20 million  a  year  building  roads  and bridges, which is coming out of defense. So, yes, Mr. Speaker, I am dead set against this. But you also have my pledge to do everything I can to help the President to get our kids back. ",1999

136,House,106,0.627,64,1999-03-24,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution and I support our troops. And that is what this resolution is about. But a greater support for us would be to insist that before we send our troops into action, as they are today, that there be a reasonable and understood  long-term game plan  in place prior to sending these young people, our young defenders, off to fight so far from home and in a cause that has little to do with our national security. b1815 Yes, we support our troops, but let us all together also send this message to the people of the world. We are not going to send our troops all over the world and garrison the rest of this planet for the stability of the rest of the world. Let Europeans, for example, provide the troops necessary for the stability that they need in their own backyard. Yes, there  is a case that there is Serbian genocide that is taking place. The Serbs are committing genocide  against  these Kosovars  as they did against the Bosnians in their attacks against the Slovenians and the Croatians under  the dictatorship of Milosevic and it is intolerable. We recognize the Kosovars and their right for self-determination and  independence. Yet we do not have the courage to lay the diplomatic foundation for a longterm  solution  before we  order  our troops into harm’s way. Something is terribly wrong here. We should not be the policeman of the world. Our troops, they deserve to be applauded which we are doing, but we should not accede and tell the world that they have a blank check on the use of our troops to create their stability for them. Four years ago and $10 billion ago, we were told that sending our troops to Bosnia would be a 1-year operation and $2 billion in cost. They are still there. This vote tonight is done to applaud our troops, but it is not a blank check. It is a message of support for our troops. ",1999

Their spirit, commitment and dedication is unrivaled. In December,  I visited our  troops keeping the peace in Bosnia and Macedonia. I was impressed by the work that they have done to help the people of Bosnia and Macedonia transition to a peaceful society and by the pride that they take in their work. Our men and women in the military are  now  confronting  another  great challenge. They have again answered their country’s call to service. At this time of great courage and sacrifice, our best  thoughts and prayers are with them. The President made the right decision to initiate air strikes against Yugoslavia. Slobodan Milosevic  has continually refused efforts to reach a peaceful settlement  in Kosovo. It  is now time to display the resolve of the international community.

142,House,106,0.6,71,1999-03-24,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. On March 31, 1999, funding for the FAA Airport Improvement Program will be cut off. Last year, we attempted to pass a comprehensive long-term bill  that would have extended AIP and FAA funding. However, due to a breakdown in conference negotiations, only a short-term 6-month extension for the AIP was passed as part of the Omnibus appropriations bill. In February of this year, the House passed H.R. 99, a six-month bill to extend AIP and fund FAA’s operations and facilities and equipment programs through the end of FY 99. H.R. 99 was passed so  that AIP  funding would not run out while we attempted to pass our  long-term  aviation  reauthorization  bill, AIR–21. H.R. 99 was passed out of the House and sent to the Senate on February 3, two months prior to the expiration of AIP funding on March 31st. In  the shadow of  this  imminent deadline, last week the Senate passed a two-month extension bill that would fund AIP only through May 31st of this year. The Senate  bill  also  includes  technical changes for the Military Airport Program and the small airport fund within AIP to allow them to work under the limited extension. In addition, the Senate bill extends the War risk  Insurance  program  for  two  additional months.  Its  funding  is also set  to expire on March 31st. This is an important issue, especially in light of current events. The House passed H.R. 98  in February, which extended the War Risk Insurance Program through 2004. If the Senate should pass H.R. 98, it is our intention that that bill extension for 5 years should take precedence over this two-month provision. Finally,  the Senate bill allows  the FAA  to consider a PFC application from Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority up to a limit of $30 million. Under current law, FAA is not allowed  to consider a PFC application  from MWAA. Although this bill only extends the programs for two months instead of the House-passed six month bill, it is important that this bill pass so that funding for AIP does not lapse.

Consistently, the way the rhetoric works around Washington, we would think that Republicans are trying to slash and burn and basically eliminate the city and eliminate all Federal functions. That is what I think is very interesting about this chart. If we look at this line, would the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COBURN) tell me whether the line goes up or down? It is a one-way line, and that is going  up. All Federal  spending  in Washington, D.C. has not been cut in real dollars or in nominal dollars. On the whole it has been going up. In 1994 it was $1.4 trillion. In fiscal year 1999, it is $1.7 trillion. The Republicans have not been cutting, eliminating. In fact, things have been going up in Washington. ",1999

185,Senate,106,-0.45,113,1999-03-24,Mrs. BOXER.," Thank you so much, Mr. President. I thank the chairman and the ranking member, Senator LAUTENBERG. I was so pleased to be a member of the Senate Budget Committee in the House. I was on the House Budget Committee for 6 years. To me, the Budget Committee is very important, because what we  in essence do  is present a roadmap for the priorities of this country. I think it is key to the people, the decisions we make here. How much are we going to spend on education? How much are we going to spend on Social Security, Medicare? How much are we going to spend on the military? And on and on—Border Patrol. Every single item  comes  under  scrutiny  in  the Budget Committee. Although we may not make detailed recommendations, LAUTENBERG we essentially say to the American people—and we have to feel good about what we do—this is how we are going to spend the taxpayers’ money and we hope you will be pleased with it. Mr. President, I am not pleased with what we do about Medicare  in this budget. That is what brings me to my feet today. The President took the leadership on this budget when he challenged Congress—Members on both sides of the aisle—to  save  Social  Security  and Medicare and to do something about the  low rate of savings  in America today. So he came forward with a very good suggestion. He said set side 62 percent of the surplus for Social Security, set aside 15 percent of the surplus for Medicare, and set aside 12 percent of the surplus for targeted tax cuts, which will help our people increase their savings for the future. The good news is that both sides of the aisle have agreed on Social Security. Both sides  in the Senate have agreed to set aside every penny of the Social Security surplus every year for Social Security. The bad news is that nothing—I  say  ‘‘nothing’’—was done for Medicare by the Republicans in this committee. We  tried  to work with them.  Senators  and CONRAD spoke eloquently on the point and offered a number of amendments. They will do  so again. Yet, on a straight party line vote, we were unable to budge our Republican friends. I have to say this: Having seen a parent wind up in a very difficult position in a nursing home and having seen her be able to hold her head up high because  she has Social Security  and Medicare, they are twin pillars of the social safety net. Why do I say this? Because if you ask our elderly what they fear, what they fear is getting sick and they cannot rely on their Medicare. If their Medicare becomes out of reach for them, if it no longer protects them, then they will have to use their Social Security to pay for their health care costs, and they will wind up in very bad shape. So, to me, you can’t stand up with a straight face and say you are helping seniors in this country, you are helping our people get through their golden years, if you do not help Medicare, as well as Social Security. There are those on the other side who we will hear say,  ‘‘Oh, these Democrats. All they want to do is throw money at Medicare. They don’t want to reform it.’’ That isn’t so. But we do know we need to do both. We need to set aside funds from the surplus to get us  through  these years  coming  for Medicare; also,  let’s  look at the reforms of the program. As Senator KENNEDY said, the proposal we will put before the Senate will save Medicare through the year 2020. That is nothing to scoff at. Then we have the time to work on the reforms. We need to make sure that those reforms, in fact, are good reforms and that ‘‘reform’’ does not become another word for ‘‘repeal.’’ We don’t want to repeal Medicare. We  don’t want  to change Medicare in such a way that it no longer is that peace of mind for our seniors. We want to fix it so that it continues to work. I hope it will be different on the Senate floor than it was in the committee. Shockingly, almost every vote, almost every vote—I will not say every amendment, but certainly every vote—to save Medicare was a straight party line. We see more and more of it. I see Senator MURRAYon the floor, a member of this committee, who was  talking  to me about how shocked she was that in the markup of the Patients’ Bill of Rights it was party line all the way. What has become of us? These are issues we should work together on. I am sad that we are not able to do it. On the other hand, I recognize that there are legitimate differences between the parties. It is for the people to judge as to who they feel is going to keep Medicare going. I want to share a couple of charts with you. It seems to me that what we ought to be doing in this budget is securing America’s future. In the budget we envision, and the kind of amendments we will be offering, we want to do a few things. We want to save Social Security. I again credit my Republican friends. We have worked together. This is done. We also want to strengthen Medicare. Mr. President, it is not done in this budget. There  isn’t a slim dime set aside  for Medicare, despite the  fact that we were talking about last year what we would do with the tobacco tax, should it be enacted. Members on the other side of the aisle said: If you have extra  funds,  save Medicare.  I don’t know what happened. We will hear more about that in the debate as it unfolds. Also, we should cut taxes to help ordinary Americans save. Those kinds of targeted tax cuts, more modest than the ones in the budget before us, are the ones we ought to be supporting. So, yes, we support tax cuts, but we want them to go to ordinary Americans who need those tax cuts. Yes, we want to strengthen Medicare by setting aside 15 percent of the surplus for Medicare. I think it is stunning to look at this budget. This is what this budget does with the surplus vis-a-vis Medicare and tax cuts. My Republican friends will say,  ‘‘Well, we do  spend money on Medicare.’’ Yes, they spend the money. But nothing out of the surplus—nothing to address the problem in the future once we have a problem. The good news story is that we are living  longer. This  is good. All the work we do around here to increase spending on health research is paying off. All the investment we make in the private sector and make in high technology is paying off. People are living longer. This is good; this isn’t something to be sad about. But yet it has to be addressed. If we don’t address it, we not only hurt the aging population, but ",1999

189,Senate,106,-0.308,162,1999-03-24,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment (Amendment # 152) being introduced today by the Senators from Oregon [Mr. SMITH] and Maryland [Mr. SARBANES]. This amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that the resources identified in the underlying budget resolution for Function 150 (International Affairs) be sufficient to enable successful U.S. international leadership. Mr. President, this is an enormously important amendment that comes at a critical  time. Function  150  encompasses  the majority  of  our  international programs including the operating budget of  the Department of State. Representing barely one percent of our entire federal budget, our investment in Function 150 is the American investment in our national security. The post-Cold War era has brought with it new challenges and new responsibilities for the world’s only remaining superpower. Yet real spending for International Affairs has declined more than 50 percent since the mid-1980s. Mr. President, national security can not be viewed solely through a defense lens, but also must comprise all the critical preventative measures offered through an active foreign affairs program. This means continuing to be active in fighting the spread of disease and drugs, providing adequate nutrition for children and families, and pursuing U.S. goals in arms reduction. I also believe we  should  continue  to make appropriate contributions to the multilateral institutions, in particular the United Nations,  on which  the United States relies. In short, Mr. President, only through committed support to both diplomacy and defense can we utilize all the tools available to us to protect our national security and advance our overseas interests. ",1999
190,Senate,106,-0.25,162,1999-03-24,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. ",1999
191,Senate,106,0.548,169,1999-03-24,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, today, the Senate begins consideration of a budget for the fiscal year that begins on October 1. When it passes, it will be only the second budget in the last 30 years that will be balanced. That will be a tremendous achievement considering that  it was as recently as 1995 that President Clinton sent Congress a budget that would have produced annual deficits in the range of $200 billion for the foreseeable future. The budget recommended to us by the Budget Committee will effectively balance the budget, and it will do so even without relying on the surplus from the Social Security trust fund. The small deficit that is projected now is likely to be eliminated once the Congressional Budget Office updates  its revenue estimates this summer. Mr. President, the budget we have before us will ensure that the Social Security surplus is set aside so that it cannot be spent on other government programs—$1.8 trillion over the next 10 years. Many of us may have heard President Clinton promise to do the same, but when he sent his budget to Capitol Hill we found that he is actually proposing to raid the Social Security trust fund for $158 billion over the next  five years alone. Moreover, we found that the President’s plan to deposit 62 percent of the unified budget surplus into the trust fund was nothing more than an accounting gimmick. According to the Comptroller General, David Walker, ‘‘the changes to the Social Security program  [recommended by the President] will thus be more perceived than real: although the Trust Funds will appear to have more resources as a result of the proposal, in reality nothing about the program has changed.’’ In other words, the Clinton plan fails to delay the cash-flow problem expected in the year 2013 by a single year. Federal  Reserve  Board  Chairman Alan Greenspan also voiced opposition to the President’s risky plan to invest a portion of the Social Security Trust Funds in the stock market, noting that ‘‘even with Herculean  efforts,’’  he doubted  that  investment  decisions could be insulated from political pressures. The Clinton plan would allow federal bureaucrats  to play politics with people’s retirement savings. That is wrong. By contrast, our budget will not put Social Security at risk. It will protect the Social Security surpluses so that they cannot be raided for the President’s other spending initiatives. Our budget will help preserve Medicare, as well. It will increase spending on the nation’s health care program for seniors by an average of $20 billion a year for the next 10 years. That is in lieu of the $9 billion reduction in Medicare  spending  that  the President’s budget recommends. Mr. President, we will cut the public debt in half over the next decade by abiding by the spending  limits Congress and the President agreed to two years ago. The Clinton budget, by contrast, would bust the spending limits by more than $20 billion this year alone and result in only half as much debt reduction over the next decade. Most importantly, the Senate budget proposes  to  return  the  rest of  the emerging surpluses to taxpayers. Congress would still have to pass a separate bill later in the year that sets out precisely what  form  the  tax  relief would take, but there are many ideas. They range from a 10 percent acrossthe-board  reduction  in  income-tax rates to more targeted relief, like repeal of the marriage penalty, elimination of death taxes, and reductions in capital-gains taxes. There are other ideas, too. Any of them is preferable to President Clinton’s plan to raise $100 billion  in new  taxes and  fees even though budget surpluses are mounting. Although  we  have  succeeded  in balancing the unified budget, we still have  two  very  different  visions  of where we should be headed. The President has proposed myriad new spending programs—77  new  programs  in  his State of the Union address—paid for out of  the Social Security  surplus, Medicare, and new taxes and fees. The Senate budget protects Social Security and Medicare,  and  abiding  by  the spending  limits  approved  just  two years ago, we begin to pay down the debt and provide long overdue tax relief to the American people. I believe the Senate’s approach is a better one. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting aye. Several  Senators  Chair. ",1999

195,Senate,106,0.287,183,1999-03-24,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President, I regret that because of my father’s funeral in Mississippi yesterday, I was not present in the Senate to vote on S. Con. Res. 21, authorizing the President of the United States to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘aye’’ on the resolution. The authorization is carefully limited and is designed to permit the participation of military  forces of  the United States, in concert with NATO allies,  in an action to respond to a clear threat to the security and stability of Europe and indirectly to our own security interests. It is my hope that this action will serve to signal the willingness of the United States government to keep its commitments under the NATO treaty and to be a force for peace and freedom in the region sought to be protected by the alliance. f FRANCESCO (GHEIB) GHEBRESILLASSIE RETIRES ",1999
196,Senate,106,0.091,204,1999-03-24,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, in honor of Women’s History Month, today I am introducing  legislation  to create an Advisory Committee for the National Museum of Women’s History.  I am pleased to be joined by 17 of my colleagues: Senators HUTCHISON, MURRAY, MIKULSKI,  BOXER,  COLLINS,  ROCKEFELLER, REID, BIDEN, AKAKA, KERRY ASHCROFT,  DURBIN, TORRICELLI,  INOUYE, LEIBERMAN, and SARBANES. DODD,  (MA),  For far too long, women have contributed to history, but have largely been forgotten in our history books, in our monuments, and in our museums. It  is  long past time that the roles women have played be removed from the shadows of indifference and given a place where they can shine. The bill we are  introducing today will create a 26 member Advisory Committee to look at the following three issues and report back to Congress concerning (1) identification of a site for the museum in the District of Columbia; (2) development of a business plan to allow the creation and maintenance of the museum to be done solely with private contributions and 3) assistance with the collection and program of the museum. It is important to note that this bill does not commit Congress to spending any money for this museum. The Committee’s report will tell us the feasibility of funding the museum privately. And I believe that the Museum’s Board has shown that they have the ability to do just that. The concept  for the National Museum of Women’s History (NMWH) was created back in 1996. Since that time, the Board of Directors, lead by President Karen Staser, has worked tirelessly to build support and interest for this project. And judging by the fact that they have raised more than $10.5 million for the project, lent their support to the moving of the Suffragette statute from the crypt to the Rotunda, and raised $85,000 for that effort, I’d say they are well on their way to success. They have also spent a lot of time answering the question  ‘‘why do we need a women’s museum when we have the SMITHsonian.’’ The first answer to that comes from Edith Mayo, Curator Emeritus of the Smithsonian National Museum  of American History, who notes that since 1963 only two exhibits—two—were dedicated to the role of women in history. The fact is, in the story of America’s success, the chapter on women’s contributions has largely been left on the editing room floor. Here’s what I mean: Many of us know that women fought and got the vote in 1920, with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. But how many know that Wyoming gave women the right to vote in 1869, 51 years earlier, and that by 1900 Utah, Colorado and  Idaho had granted women the right to vote? Or that the suffragette movement took 72 years to meet its goal? And few know that the women of Utah sewed dresses made from silk for the Suffragettes on their cross country tour. History  is  filled with other  little known but significant milestones: like the first woman elected to the United States Senate was Hattie Wyatt Caraway from Louisiana in 1932. That Margaret Chase Smith,  from my home state of Maine, was the first woman elected to the US Senate in her own right in 1948, and in 1962 became the first women to run for the US Presidency in the primaries of a major political party. Or that the first female cabinet member was Frances Perkins, Secretary of Labor for FDR. How many people know that Margaret Reha Seddon was the first US woman to achieve the full rank of astronaut, and flew her first space mission aboard the Space Shuttle  ‘‘Discovery’’  in 1985, twenty three years after the distinguished former Senator from the State of Ohio, John Glenn completed his historic first flight in space? And I can guarantee you more people know the last person to hit over .400 in baseball—Ted  Williams—than  can name the first woman elected to Congress—Jeannette Rankin of Montana, who was elected in 1916, four years before ratification of the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote. Hardly household names. But they should be. And with a place to showcase  their accomplishments, perhaps one day they will take their rightful place beside America’s greatest minds, visionary leaders, and groundbreaking figures. But until then, we have a long way to go. Whatever  period  of  history  you chose—women  played  a  role. Sybil Ludington, a 16-year-old, rode through parts of New York and Connecticut in April of 1777 to warn that the Redcoats were coming. Sacajawea, the Shoshone Indian guide, helped escort Lewis and Clark on their 8000 mile expedition. Rosa Parks, Jo Ann Robinson and Myrlie Evers played important roles in the civil rights movement in the 50’s and 60’s. And as we move into the 21st century, the role of women—who now make up 52 percent of the population— will continue to be integral to the future success of this country. In fact the real question about the building of a women’s museum is not so much where  it will be built—although that remains to be explored. And it’s not even who will pay for it— as I’ve said, it will be done entirely with private funds. The real question when it comes to a museum dedicated to women’s history is, where will they put it all! I would argue that we have a solemn responsibility to teach our children, and ourselves, about our rich past—and that includes the myriad contributions of women, in all fields and every endeavor. These women can serve as role models and inspire our youth. They can teach us about our past and guide us into our future. They can even prompt young women to consider a career in public  service—as Senator Smith of Maine did for me. Instead,  today  in America, more young  women  probably  know  the names of the latest super models then the names of the female members of this Administration’s Cabinet. That is why we need a National Museum of Women’s History, that  is why I am proud to sponsor this legislation, and that is why I hope that my colleagues will join us in supporting the creation of this Advisory Committee as a first step toward writing the forgotten chapters of the history of our nation.∑ By Mr. DEWINE (for himself, Mr. Mr. ROCKEFELLER, Mr. CHAFEE, Ms. LANDRIEU,  LEVIN,  Mr.  KERRY, and Mr. KERREY): S. 708.

198,Senate,106,0.192,239,1999-03-24,Mr. SMITH of Oregon.," Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of an extraordinary group of people in my state who are working each day to protect our children and teenagers from the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse. The Oregon Partnership, led by Executive Director, Judy Cushing, is the only nonprofit statewide network of drug prevention services available to every community—rural and urban— throughout Oregon. While we may talk about the importance of drug abuse prevention programs on the floor of the Senate, the staff at the Oregon Partnership are turning words  into action with very limited federal resources. Their accomplishments and allegiance to the thousands whom they serve, deserves respect and additional federal support. Formed in 1993, the Partnership is governed by a volunteer, 12-member Board of Directors and has a statewide volunteer base of 500 educators, parents, youth, health professionals, business and faith leaders. Together, they share a  common goal—to help  the young people of Oregon help  themselves and their peers—to lead productive and drug-free lives. Through these combined efforts, this group of dedicated volunteers is truly a partnership. With  73 coalitions  that reach across the state of Oregon, the Partnership empowers communities at a grassroots  level through a strong support network of resources including media relations assistance, event planning and training that targets the local needs of each community. In addition, the Partnership’s resource center provides communities and families with materials that provide answers to questions about alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. The Partnership also maintains a website that provides details about other  available  resources, materials and programs. Recognizing that information is only effective when it is available, the Oregon  Partnership  houses  the  only statewide 24-hour helpline with personto-person  contact  every  day.  The HelpLine/YouthLine  currently  responds to 2,000 calls per month from substance abusers, family members and friends who are searching for referral assistance  and  information  about treatment programs and services within their local area. What is truly exemplary about the Oregon Partnership, is that it provides these services through its network of volunteers. More  than  fifty  professionally  trained  volunteers  provide confidential  counseling,  information and local treatment referral for chemical dependence and other addictions. Sixty percent of the volunteers are college and graduate students pursuing counseling careers. Mr. President, I believe that the Oregon Partnership is an example of what Congress intended for the use of federal drug prevention dollars. Unlike any other program in our state, the Oregon Partnership is the resource that serves as the link that keeps the chain from prevention  programs  to  treatment strong. The Oregon Partnership is our first line of defense and the kind voice at the end of the phone that says, ‘‘Yes, we can help.’’ For these reasons and many more, I would like to take this opportunity to formally thank the directors, members and volunteers of the Oregon Partnership for their dedication and gracious, generous service to the people of Oregon as they work to eliminate drug abuse throughout our state: Judy Cushing, Joyce Adams-Malin, Lloyd Duncan,  Jennifer  Fogelman,  Jill Showalter, Kaleen Deatherage, Penny Labberton, Elizabeth Buskirk, Mary Ellen Apostol, Michelle Kromm, Ericka Ziettlow, Jennie Donnelly, Karla Bateman.∑ f DEMINING IN NICARAGUA AND HONDURAS ∑",1999
199,Senate,106,-0.374,239,1999-03-24,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  last night, the Senate passed the Supplemental  Appropriations  bill,  which, among other things, contains funding for hurricane relief for Central America. I am very pleased that the Supplemental  also  specifies  that  up  to $2,000,000 should be made available for humanitarian demining activities  in Nicaragua  and Honduras. Hurricane Mitch  has  greatly  exacerbated  the problem of anti-personnel landmines in both countries. An estimated 100,000 mines were placed in the NicaraguanHonduran border area in the 1980’s by Sandanista  and  Contra  soldiers. Demining activities to date have been diligent, but painstakingly  slow, as over 70,000 mines continue to threaten the population. While the problem has certainly been very serious, at least the areas which contained these mines in both countries were  reasonably well  known. Until  Hurricane  Mitch,  that  is. Mudslides and the tremendous volume of water that accompanied the hurricane have carried mines into areas not previously  contaminated. Two Nicaraguan civilians were killed last fall by a mine in an area never thought to hold them previously. A U.S. Army study  confirmed  the new  threat  in many areas of Nicaragua. Imagine, Mr. President, the impact on reconstruction efforts in these devastated countries  if an American or other foreign national working to rebuild the infrastructure should be injured or killed by a mine. Other Senators may be surprised to hear that one of the most effective ways to demine these areas is the use of man-dog teams. The explosive material in mines emit a gas, which dogs can be trained to detect. Once a mine is detected, the dog is trained to immediately stop and sit, and conventional ",1999

Greece is a country rich in history and culture which has not only dramatically influenced its own people but people throughout the world. March 25th is a date that will forever live in the hearts and minds of Greeks and GreekAmericans. After  suffering more  than 400 years of oppression under the Ottoman Empire, the people of Greece commenced a revolt on this day in 1821. Many dedicated, patriotic Greeks  lost  their  lives  in  the struggle which lasted over 7 years. Ultimately, the freedom Greeks aspired  to was  courageously achieved, and  the modern day Greece was born. Greece has influenced our society in many ways. Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and our Founding Fathers found inspiration in the writings and ideals of Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle. The Founding Fathers searched antiquity  for an appropriate model for democracy, and found it in ancient Athens. No doubt, without Greece’s  influence,  the United States would be a completely different country today. Historically, Greece has been a dedicated United States ally. A  fierce supporter during World War  II, Greek soldiers  fought beside Americans to preserve democracy and independence. For almost half a century, Greece has stood beside the United States as an active and important member to NATO. Greece has consistently proved to be a valuable player in preserving security in the Mediterranean. Just recently, Greece held a significant role in negotiations between the Republic of Cyprus and Turkey  to deter deploying Russian missiles on the Cypriot island, thereby thwarting an international incident. One could not live in the United States for too  long without experiencing  first hand  the impact Greece has had on American society. Greek-Americans  have  significantly  contributed to American culture and economy. Nearly 7,000 people in the Eighth Congressional District of Massachusetts are of Greek descent. Throughout the neighborhoods in Boston, Watertown, Cambridge, Chelsea, Belmont and my hometown of Somerville, Greek-Americans are one of the most active groups in politics and community service. The Hellenic Cultural Center,  the Greek Orthodox Church and other Greek-American organizations  in  the district are working to improve education, healthcare, and the environment. The Greek people also take pride in their heritage.  In my district alone several events will take place to commemorate Greek Independence Day. From the grand parade in Boston to the small town festivities, Greek-Americans will be celebrating their freedom. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I hope the United States will continue  to cultivate relationships both  culturally  and  economically with  our Greek neighbors, and  I again offer my congratulations  to all Greeks as  they celebrate Greek Independence Day.

Thanks  to  their unending efforts,  the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation  (FDIC)  recently  retracted their proposed  ‘‘Know Your Customer’’  rule. This proposal would have required banks to monitor their customers and snoop out information for federal government files. According  to  the FDIC,  the  intent of  the ‘‘Know Your Customer;’’ rule was  to ensure that banks and savings institutions have policies and procedures for screening transactions tied to criminal activities, such as money laundering or drug trafficking. In reality, this legislation would have created an Orwellian system of government. Our constituents  recognized this and voiced their strong opposition to it. We should not forget that Americans have the  right  to expect privacy protections. The fact is, under the ‘‘Know Your Customer’’ rule, banks would have been  required  to  track money  sources and  report all  ‘‘out-of-theoridinary’’ transactions to the federal government. In other words, this would have allowed the banks and our government  the  right  to snoop  in our personal  information. That  is wrong! Good business practices should already allow banks to know their customers. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank American citizens for strengthening our democratic system of government by loudly voicing their opposition  to  this rule.  ‘‘Know Your Customer’’ would have been a clear invasion of privacy of all citizens and I am pleased it has been retracted. f JOHN LEE SULLIVAN MAKES HIS MARK ON THE WORLD HON.

LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD OFCALIFORNIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, March 24, 1999 Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join eleven of my colleagues in introducing the Consumer Credit Report Accuracy and Privacy Act of 1999. My bill gives every American the right to examine and correct their credit reports free of charge. The credit reporting industry affects the lives of virtually every working American. Information used in a credit report can affect the ability to obtain a job, credit card, insurance policy, or even a place to live. For this reason, it is imperative that the credit industry maintain accurate records on American consumers. In spite of the fact that the reporting of false delinquencies, errors in personal demographic information, and missing credit accounts all have  the potential  to result  in  the denial of credit, only  six  states  (Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey and Vermont) offer consumers free credit reports on request. For the rest of the nation, most consumers cannot obtain a free credit report until after they have already been denied credit or suspect they are a victim of fraud. The  fact  that  the  three  largest credit bureaus have 450 million files on individual consumers and process over 2 billion pieces of data every month presents a daunting challenge to maintain the most accurate records possible. Given these figures, the chance of acquiring inaccurate information is highly likely. In fact, some studies have shown that up to one third of credit reports could contain serious mistakes. It is important to note that the credit reporting industry gathers its information without the direct consent of American consumers, and in turn, uses  this  information  for  its own profit through the sales of reports to credit grantors, employers,  insurance companies, and  landlords. Consumers should have  the  right  to know what  is being said about  them, especially if the information will affect their overall credit standing. My bill will also help to address the growing problem of  identify  theft.  Increasingly, criminals are able to obtain personal credit reports and assume a consumer’s credit  identity.  In the process,  they are able  to  run up huge debts while ruining the unsuspecting victim’s credit records. We could minimize this problem if consumers more regularly audited their own credit reports  to  find out who else has been looking at them. This bill has the endorsement of the nation’s key consumer advocacy organizations, including U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Consumer Action, Community Reinvestment Committee, Consumer Federation of America, Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, and the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. In closing, the Consumer Credit Report Accuracy  and Privacy Act  encourages  consumers to be pro-active in reviewing and protecting their personal credit history from possible mistakes and fraud. My bill simply gives consumers the right to know what credit bureaus are saying about them without having to pay a fee for the privilege. f SIKHS WILL CELEBRATE 300TH ANNIVERSARY—AMERICA  SHOULD SUPPORT SIKH FREEDOM HON.

204,,106,-0.519,260,1999-03-24,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker, this April marks a very significant occasion, the 300th anniversary of the Sikh Nation. The occasion will be celebrated with a big march  in Washington, with prayers, and in many other ways. Let us join with the Sikhs on this auspicious occasion and pray that they will soon enjoy the same freedom in their homeland, Punjab, Khalistan, that we enjoy here in America. I would like to congratulate the Sikh Nation on this major milestone, which was brought to my attention by Dr. Gurmit Singh Aulakh, President of the Council of Khalistan. Many of us have been made aware of the brutal oppression of  the Sikhs by  the  Indian government due to Dr. Aulakh’s tireless efforts. I am pleased to note that Dr. Aulakh’s office is organizing the march. There are half of a million Sikhs  in  the United States. They have added to the richness of American life in many aspects of life and work. They have been productive, proud, law-abiding Americans. The Sikhs came  to this country  to enjoy  the  freedom  that has made America the great country that it is. On this very special occasion for he Sikh Nation, let us honor those fine Americans by taking steps to help their Sikh brothers and sisters in Punjab, Khalistan enjoy  the same  freedom. That is the best way to prevent another Bosnia or Kosovo in South Asia. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, there is no freedom for Sikhs, Christians, Muslims, Dalits, or other minorities in India today. The Indian government continues to practice a brutal oppression that has taken tens of thousands of Sikh, Christian, Muslim, and other human lives. Yet this brutal country continues to be among the top five recipients of U.S. aid. Why are we using tax dollars to support this repressive government? Even with our budget surplus, this is a bad use of taxpayers’ money. We should cut off  this aid and declare our support  for self-determination  in  the  Indian subcontinent. The Sikhs of Khalistan, the Muslims of Kashmir, the Christians of Nagaland, and others seek only to decide their futures in the democratic way, by voting. As the beacon of freedom in the world, it is our moral duty to support this struggle for freedom. Let us take the occasion of the Sikh Nation’s 300th anniversary to commit ourselves to full support for freedom for all people, starting with these few simple measures. f TRIBUTE TO BESSIE BAUGHN HON.

If you follow Cuban policy at all, I know you will agree with me that it is disappointing to see this Administration yield to this hemisphere’s last remaining dictator, Fidel Castro. Not long ago, President Clinton announced a new proposal to loosen the trade embargo on the Government of Cuba. The embargo was codified because of  the murder of unarmed American citizens.  I believe  that Castro has done nothing  to warrant any reevaluation of the sanctions imposed on his regime. Now, almost  three  years  later,  the President has taken steps that not only breathe new life into the brutal Castro dictatorship, but he is trying to circumvent U.S. law. Now, we learn that the Clinton Administration has decided to hold our American pastime hostage.  If  the President gets his way,  the Baltimore Orioles will face a Cuban National team in Havana on March 28th of this year. It is appalling to me that the President is using baseball  to push  friendly  relations with  the Cuban dictatorship. This will be the first Major League Baseball visit to Havana since 1959, and it couldn’t come at a worse time. A Cuban court has just convicted the island’s four top opposition leaders for sedition.

Let me just briefly reiterate the common sense behind this proposal. It provides low-interest  loans up  front so small business owners can prepare for disasters before they happen. They can prepare for earthquakes or floods or fires or hurricanes. By spending money up front, through low-interest loans, they will save the taxpayers dollars down the road. That is why this bill makes so much sense; it will save taxpayers money. It will help small businesses out and it will reduce the overall net cost of disaster response. That is the kind of bill we should be putting forward, and I thank my colleague from South Dakota (Mr. THUNE) for doing so. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ",1999
209,House,106,0.409,12,1999-04-12,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for closing. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr. BAIRD) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ) for their work on this and again would just simply say that in Washington we are always looking for win/win solutions. I think this really is a win/win. It is a win not only for disaster victims. It is also a win for the taxpayers. My State of South Dakota has been no stranger to disasters in the last few years, and consistently we find that FEMA is called on to the spot, SBA and other agencies that deal with disaster assistance, but it is always after the fact. We have an opportunity here to provide a mechanism whereby businesses and others can prepare in advance for disasters and take those steps that are necessary to try and see that the taxpayers are not called upon after an event to deal with it. I would again urge my colleagues in the House to support this measure. It is a  common-sense  approach  to  legislating solutions on disaster assistance, and hopefully, we will be able to take this and work collectively as partners with FEMA and the SBA and others to see that we do the best job we can on the front end to protect disaster victims, as well as to protect the taxpayers  from unnecessary needed expense. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of S. 388. This bill will establish a pilot program for the implementation of disaster mitigation measures by small businesses to help them to better prepare for natural disasters. Small businesses from Texas to New York play a vital role in the health of our economy. They account  for 99.7 percent of America’s employers. In fact, Small businesses employ 53 percent of the private work force, contribute 47 percent of all sales in the country, and are also responsible for 50 percent of the private gross domestic product. Unfortunately, it is a fact that Small Businesses are ill equipped to deal with natural disasters. Under this bill, the Small Business Administration, in conjunction with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, would begin a 5year program to provide loans to small businesses  to  implement mitigation  techniques. These loans would provide funds for proactive measures designed to limit damages from natural disasters. These projects include for example elevating a  foundation  in case of a flood or strengthening walls  in case of an earthquake. Last year natural disasters cost Americans more than $10 billion. This is the third worst year this decade. I am told that the last three years have been the most active period in history for Atlantic hurricanes. Unfortunately the 1999 hurricane season will be active again this year and other natural disasters are going to occur. Small Businesses will and do suffer economically from these natural disasters. Under this bill, the loans would be made either directly or in cooperation with banks or other lending institutions through agreements to participate on an  immediate or deferred basis. This program  is designed  to provide these  loans  to small businesses  in disasterprone areas that would otherwise be unable to obtain credit for such preventative measures. This bill will help businesses across  this country to better prepare for disasters. I support this bill because it aggressively prepares small businesses  located  in disaster-prone areas to prepare for disasters. I urge my colleagues to support small businesses by supporting this bill. ",1999

And when he did, my colleagues on other side of the aisle said the President had a great budget. They liked his new tax increases. They liked his new spending. They did not seem to complain then about the $11 billion worth of cuts that the President had in his budget. Now they do not like the President’s budget. But what I know is that in 1994 when Republicans got elected, we set out  to  get  our  country’s  financial house in order and balance this financial budget and save Medicare and Social Security, and that is what we are doing. And to move from this welfare state  into a society of opportunity. That is what we are doing. Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is we have set aside $1.8 trillion for Social Security and Medicare. It is $1 billion more than the President set aside. We do not spend it and we do not provide tax cuts. We reserve  it, and  in our budget resolution we do not allow the national debt to go up; and the President said he would veto it because he wanted to raise the debt ceiling. We are not going to raise the debt ceiling. It is the best way to make sure that we do keep our country’s financial house in order and do not make this government larger. When this President got elected, 17.5 percent of all revenues funded the Federal Government. Now it is 20.5. It has gone up and we are not looking to have it go up any higher.

Let me start by just  thanking  the  gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS), our leader, our primary  leader,  and  the  gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. UPTON), our coleader on this trip. It was a wonderful, wonderful experience. My colleagues will probably recall that at the end of the trip when we were at the airport about to board the plane from Alabama, we had a little debriefing, a discussion, and everybody was going around talking about what this trip had meant. And I sat quietly and never said anything because I was still sorting through the emotions I was feeling and the significance of this trip. And it took me several weeks really to kind of put in perspective some feelings. And this is kind of where I got to at the end of that vexing period. I was reminded that in 1963, I got a scholarship offer to Talladega University in Alabama. And I came to that fork in the road. I had never been to Alabama. And when I looked at the scholarship offer that I had gotten, I decided that probably the last place in the world I wanted to go was Alabama in 1963. And I have been true to that up to this trip. I never set foot in Alabama. It was not a place that I ever aspired to go to to visit. I had these images of people being beaten and fire-hosed and dogs sicced on folks. All these years since 1963, those images have lingered in my mind, and I never have wanted to go to Alabama. And I finally got talked into it by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS) and the wonderful people  from Faith and Politics, my good friend over here. Now, another part of me kept saying, well, why did I not want to go to Alabama? I mean, North Carolina, which is where I am from, is in the south also. And I think I came to grips with some fears that I had about going to Mississippi and Alabama and Arkansas, the  far southern States, where this movement was taking place. I think I decided that part of the reason that I never wanted to go there was that I was afraid to go there. I knew that there were battles to be fought in North Carolina, but I felt like VerDate 06-MAY-99 13:35 May 13, 1999 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\TEMP\H12AP9.REC h12ap9 PsN: h12ap9 ",1999
213,House,106,-0.342,54,1999-04-12,Mr. SHERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, like the gentleman before me who stood before this House,  the  distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania, I rise to address this House regarding the crisis in Kosovo, and my speech will echo some of the themes that he addressed, particularly at the end of his presentation. Mr. Speaker, our actions in Kosovo are motivated by the highest level of idealism. We are willing to spend our treasure and, much more importantly, risk the lives of our men and women, to prevent atrocities and to assure that the Albanian Kosovars will be able to live in peace and with autonomy. In some foreign capitals, they simply cannot believe this level of idealism. They are scurrying to find some ulterior motive. But those who understand America know that we are in Kosovo motivated by that idealism and certainly not motivated out of a desire to have some interest in some mineral resources less valuable than a single B–2 bomber. We who understand America and  understand American  idealism, know that that idealism will be expressed through our government. Yet even in such a great idealistic undertaking, we must establish a realistic strategy. We must make sure that our idealistic motivations do not cloud our judgment. And here, Mr. Speaker, I would  like to contrast realism with blinding idealism. In a more ideal world, Kosovo would be the only place of tragedy and atrocity. But realistically we should note that  the government of Sudan has killed 2 million of its African citizens, and  that killing  continues  tonight; that 800,000 Tutsis were killed in Rwanda; and there are continuing mass murders  on  an  enormous  scale  in  the Congo, Myanmar and elsewhere. In an ideal world, we could hope to easily restore Kosovo as a multiethnic, semiautonomous region. Realistically it is unlikely that Albanians and Serbs will live in harmony in the absence of an outside force. And it is just as unlikely that the Kosovars will renounce their goal of independence. A blind idealist might see the world as pure good versus pure evil. Yet the Serbs, who we vilify today, were just a few years ago themselves victims of ethnic cleansing. Some 180,000 Serbs who had lived for centuries in Croatia were expelled from that country—while America said nothing, and did nothing. And the Kosovar Albanians, who are pictured today as the embodiment of all  ideal virtue—we must  remember that they are tragic victims of present circumstance—but  they  are  represented in large part by the KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army, an organization that the United States Government has described as terrorist, an organization  that may have alliances with Iran, with Osama Bin Laden, and even with drug dealers. Blind idealism would cause us to demand the maximum possible objective and believe that we could achieve that objective with the minimum force. Yet realism requires us to adopt perhaps more  limited  objectives  consistent with the future safety of the Albanian Kosovars. And realism demands that we marshal the substantial force which may be necessary to achieve any realistic objective. Mr. Speaker, I believe that we should take three steps. The first echoes the comments of the gentleman  from Pennsylvania.  I believe that we should involve Russia in the diplomatic efforts to the maximum possible degree. Russia may be able to pull the Serbs to a negotiating position that is more realistic, and more just, than the position that Milosevic insists upon taking at the present time. Russian involvement in both diplomacy and in peacekeeping offers a facesaving method for Milosevic to make major concessions. Now, I know that there are those who will stand before this House and who will say we should not be negotiating with Milosevic, we should be seeking to dispose of him. But I would point out that we are still waiting for someone to dispose of Saddam Hussein. And in a realistic world, we must try to bring an end to the mass murder as quickly as possible. Involving Russia is important beyond the events at hand. Ten years  from now, Kosovo may be nearly forgotten if we are  successful  in bringing peace today, but Russia will continue to be a critical nuclear-armed state, and treating Russia with respect now will be important in our relationship with Russia in the future. And we should remember that 85 years ago, Russia mobilized its army in support of Serbia in events that led immediately to World War I. Tomorrow, Secretary Albright will meet with  Igor  Ivanov, the Foreign Minister of Russia. That meeting will take place in Oslo. Hopefully this is the first step toward the maximum possible involvement of Russia in bringing peace to Kosovo. Second, we should signal now that we are willing to reach peace on the basis that the Rambouillet agreement would apply to roughly 80 percent of Kosovo territory rather than all of Kosovo. No one denies that the Serbs have rights  in Kosovo. They  represented over 10 percent of the Kosovo population even today. When I say ‘‘today,’’ I mean before the tragic recent events. Kosovo has been part of Serbia for centuries, and Kosovo is the religious and VerDate 06-MAY-99 13:35 May 13, 1999 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\TEMP\H12AP9.REC h12ap9 PsN: h12ap9 ",1999
214,,106,0.29,96,1999-04-12,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Kiwanis Club of Caldwell/West Essex. On April 8, 1999,  the Kiwanis Club of Caldwell/West Essex will celebrate 75 years of service to the West Essex Community. Since its start in 1923, the Kiwanis Club members of this chapter have been providing service  to the local community. This Club represents a larger, international organization that dedicates itself to allowing men and women the opportunity  to become  involved  in  improving  the conditions in which we live. Currently,  the Club participates  in various service projects such as aiding families during Thanksgiving, contributing to the Kiwanis Oval playground, and working toward the beautification of West Essex communities. In addition to service, and volunteering time, the Caldwell/West Essex Kiwanis Club contributes financially to many organizations including the Children’s Miracle Network, the March of Dimes, Walk-a-thon, the Battered Women’s Shelter, and many other deserving organizations. The Kiwanis has continued to pledge its support to the prevention of Iodine Deficiency Disorder—the leading cause of preventable retardation. This organization has displayed its commitments to the youth of West Essex by supporting  two  little  league  teams,  the Caldwell/West Caldwell  Soccer Club,  and serves as a sponsor of  local youngsters  for federal and state leadership development programs. Mr. Speaker,  for  the past 75 years,  the Kiwanis Club of Caldwell/West Essex has faithfully carried out  the objectives of  their global service organization. They have continued  to provide service and support  to  the community  in which  they work and  live. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me  in congratulating all past and present members of  the Kiwanis Club of Caldwell/ West Essex on this special anniversary. f IN HONOR OF THE PANCYPRIAN ASSOCIATION  OF  AMERICAN WOMEN’S  ISSUES  NETWORK (WIN)  ON  THE  OCCASION  OF THEIR ANNUAL DINNER DANCE HONORING MS.

215,,106,-0.386,96,1999-04-12,Mrs. MALONEY of New York.," Mr. Speaker, rise  today  to pay  tribute  to  the Women’s I  of  the Issues  Network  (WIN)  division  Pancyprian Association of America. WIN was established in the spring of 1996 out of an  identified need  to bring  together women of Hellenic Heritage living in America to provide them with information, services and awareness of social, health, economic and other issues. WIN members assist each other and others  in developing opportunities  for prosperity and progress in the community and perpetuating and integrating the Hellenic heritage and spirit with the best of American culture and values. In the past two years WIN has focused on providing support from women to women and their families. Since its inception, it has successfully organized a series of events, lectures and presentations on health, social and economic issues as they relate to women’s roles as mothers, daughters, wives, breadwinners and homemakers. This year’s special event will be a women’s cancer screening for those who do not have insurance. This year WIN will honor Titina Loizides who grew up in Kyrenia, Cyprus, now occupied by the illegal army of Turkey. Ms. Loizides is a leader in the tourism industry, having been executive secretary of the Cyprus Tourist Guides Association, associate of Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation presenting children’s programs on Cyprus history and archaeology, president of Cyprus Tourist Guides,  founding member of the ‘‘Equal rights—Equal responsibility’’ movement, coordinator of the action group for the protection of Ayios Andreas neighborhood in Nicosia,  first woman Rotarian of  the Rotary Club of Kyrenia, member of Women Walk Home, among others. She is married and has two children. Ms. Loizides came into international prominence when she successfully sued the Turkish Government  for  rent  on  her  property  in Kyrenia. The Cyprus Government referred this case to the European Court of Human Rights. The court  ruling states as of December 1996: The Republic of Cyprus the sole legitimate Government of Cyprus. Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus has no legal validity. The applicant has not lost title of her property and is the legal owner of her land. The northern part of Cyprus is under the control of Turkish troops. The rights of the applicant to peaceful enjoyment of her possessions under article 1 of protocol 1 have continuously been violated. Within 6 months the applicant and the Turkish government will submit written observations with respect to compensation and costs. Turkey  is  to pay  to  the applicant within  three months of CYP 300,000  for pecuniary damages, non-pecuniary damages of CYP 20,000, and costs and expenses. Ms. Loizides is being honored for her determination to fight for her rights and for bringing the Cyprus  tragedy  to  the attention of  the world. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues rise with me in this tribute to the Pancyprian Association of American Women’s Issues Network, a group of dedicated Hellenic women who have successfully integrated the Hellenic spirit with American ideals and values. I also ask my  colleagues  to  rise  in  tribute  to  the Pancyprian Association’s Woman of the Year Honoree, Ms. Titina Loizides. f A TRIBUTE TO MARGRIT BERAN KREWSON HON. RICHARD A.

216,,106,-0.416,96,1999-04-12,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Mr.  Speaker, Margrit Beran Krewson has recently retired from the Library of Congress where she has served with great dedication  for 30 years. For  the past 18 years she was the Library’s German/ Dutch area specialist in the European Division, and thus the Library’s principal liaison with the countries of Austria, Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, and Switzerland. The author of 18 bibliographic publications, calling to public attention the depth and scope of the Library’s Dutch and German-language collections, Mrs. Krewson made one of her responsibilities informing American descendants of European immigrants of their national heritages collected in the Library of Congress. Her bibliographies range from 300 Years of German Immigration to the United States (1983) through The Dutch Collections of  the Library of Congress: A Chronology (1990) to German-American Relations: A Selective Bibliography (1995). In addition, she has sponsored over 60 events—lectures, exhibitions, and readings related to the countries for which she is responsible—including in 1996 raising the necessary funds and editing the catalog for the Library’s successful exhibition Dresden: Treasures from the Saxon State Library. Her dedicated attention to publications within their countries and her care in maintaining cultural relations has led the governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, and Belgium  to acknowledge her achievements with  the award of special decorations—most recently The Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit from Germany in 1996 and the Cross of Honor for Science and Art from Austria in 1997. f A TRIBUTE TO O.

218,,106,-0.324,103,1999-04-12,Mr. DEUTSCH.," Mr. Speaker, South Florida lost a true ‘‘citizen’’ recently, someone who totally immersed herself in our community. Reva Dauer passed away on March 27, 1999, and she will be greatly missed. A  resident of Bal Harbour, Florida, Reva was active  in many philanthropic organizations. Her most impressive achievement was the hospital that she and her husband, Maxwell, developed more than 25 years ago. Reva was involved in many aspects of the birth of the Florida Medical Center; she was even involved in the process of selecting the 47-acre site of the Center, which originally opened in 1973 as Lauderdale Lakes General Hospital. Throughout her life, Reva participated in various administrative and day-to-day functions of the hospital. A former owner of the hospital, she was also instrumental in the opening of Lauderdale Lakes General Hospital’s openheart surgery unit, where the first open-heart surgery in Broward County was performed in 1974. Reva Dauer will also be  remembered as someone who worked very hard on behalf of many charitable and civic organizations. She and her family were well known contributors to the University of Miami’s Schools of Medicine, Music, and the Ryder Center for Athletics. Exemplary of her extraordinary commitment  to the school, in 1993 she gave the University of Miami $1.5 million for a library addition to be named  the Maxwell and Reva Dauer Clock Tower. However, the University of Miami was not the only organization which was the beneficiary of Reva Dauer’s generosity.  In 1995, Reva and her family were instrumental in constructing the University School of Nova Southeastern University Middle School  in Coral Springs. Reva also donated much of her time to  the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center  in Aventura, as well as Temple Emanu-El  in Miami Beach. Life is very rarely complete without the benefit of having family. Reva Dauer was a loving wife, mother, sister, aunt, and grandmother. Mr. Speaker, I cannot imagine anything more important  than  that. Reva’s  family will undoubtedly miss her, and the entire South Florida community will miss her kindness and generosity as well. She was an extraordinary human being, but we are  lucky  to have so many wonderful memories of her  life and work. TRIBUTE TO JOAN K. ELAM HON. HOWARD L.

All across  the Lehigh Valley  there are so many good people doing good things to make our  communities better places  to  live. So many good people are working day and night to help others. In my book,  these outstanding  individuals are Lehigh Valley heroes. Their hard work and dedication have made a difference in lives of thousands of individuals in the Lehigh Valley. Today, I would like to recognize the dedicated volunteers at the Parkland Community Library in Allentown, Pennsylvania as Lehigh Valley Heroes. I would like to share their efforts with my colleagues and  the American people. In 1973, Parkland Community Library  first opened its doors as a grassroots or solely volunteer  library. Through  twenty-five years of service to the community, the library has truly relied on the efforts of dedicated volunteers. These hard-working volunteers help everyone  in  the community who visit  the  library. Volunteers are at  the  front desk when you walk though the front door. They are there to help when you need to find a book. They help with the children’s programs, assist with bookkeeping, help with data entry, make copies and help with computer work. All  the volunteers at Parkland Community Library have done so much  to make a difference. These volunteers are Lehigh Valley Heroes. Mr. Speaker I would like to single out and commend the following volunteers who have dedicated more than one thousand hours of service at the Parkland Community Library. Georgia Baldrige, Priscilla Baxter, Alice Bergstein, Gloria Boyer, Cathy Brockington, Carol  Caliguiri,  Patricia  Crawford,  Viola Crouthamel,  Fredia  Csencitz, Mary  Jean Doelp, Audrey Elison, Arthur Farrell, Nancy Farrell,  Inger Fisher, Brook Fulford, Sherry Geiger,  Faith Gensler, Richard Gobrecht, Carrie  Gorman,  Betty  Hallman,  Isabel Heffernan,  Margaret  Krause,  Elizabeth Marsden, Elaine Miller, Clifford Moyer, Elaine Moyer, Marie Platner, Ruth Rees, Miriam Romig, Betty Scharfenberg, Barbara Schmidt, Reba Seidel, Eleanor Sheldon, Sally Shelly, Fan Shoemaker, and Doris Vogelsong. f RECOGNITION OF THE LUVERNE, AL, ROTARY CLUB ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY HON.

Over the years since the establishment of the Luverne chapter of Rotary International, its Crenshaw County members have served their community and fellow man in the best tradition of Rotary: To Encourage and Foster the Ideal of Service as a Basis of Worth Enterprise. Luverne Rotarians continue to embody this noble tradition of community service through many local outreach projects including annual contributions to Operation Santa Claus to benefit local needy children; and, their annual fishing rodeo for young area honor students. In their golden anniversary year, I wish to congratulate club president William Bell, vice president Chris Johnson, treasurer Ann Tate, secretary Pat Folmar, and all the members of the Luverne Rotary Club. Their many positive contributions to our community and its youth are making a difference in south central Alabama. ",1999
221,,106,-0.428,1,1999-04-20,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, this week, we celebrate Earth Day, Thursday, April 22. Many will use this occasion  to  highlight major  policy issues, as well they should, issues dealing with greenhouse gases, the effects of global warming, and the pollution of our world’s oceans. However, I feel that the real power to be demonstrated is at the other end of the spectrum, dealing with individual actions. Many of us here on Capitol Hill will celebrate Earth Day with a bike  ride. People  from  the Capitol, commuters, business people  from all over the region, will converge on Freedom Plaza on Pennsylvania Avenue, illustrating the impact that people can have dealing with this very simple and efficient mode of transportation. Yet, we do not need to have everybody trade their car in for a bicycle. If people in our community will choose to take just one less trip a week, whether that is by foot, by transit, by bicycle, or simply consolidating their other journeys to produce that one trip reduction, it can have a phenomenal impact in terms of reducing air pollution, congestion, and the requirement for more investment in infrastructure. The most important thing is for people to think about their behavior and think about the little things we can do to make things better: Shopping  locally, or treating their own yard like they would like farmers and industry to conserve their property. Whether it is conserving water, dealing with native vegetations, using less toxic herbicides or fertilizer, we can all make a big difference. Mr. Speaker, I think there is plenty of room for us in Congress to have an impact on the environment. To be sure, I hope this session will deal with things like water policy, spending our money in more environmentally responsible ways, in Superfund reform, but I would hope that this Congress will also continue the effort to try and focus on the little things that we can do to make a difference. I am pleased that this year we have finally caught up with  the  rest of America, as the Federal Government has for years told the private sector to reduce employee commute trips by single-occupant vehicles. Congress has finally started to do what we have asked the private sector to do by providing bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

It was in my congressional district that she lived and it was in my congressional district that she refused to move to the back of the bus. Rosa Parks’ courage ignited a movement. Her courage provided the spark for a movement that was smoldering. I am  a  personal  benefactor  of Mrs. Parks’ act and I am very grateful to her. Rosa Parks was an ordinary citizen who performed an extraordinary act which changed America in a positive way forever. Rosa Parks is an American hero. As my Spelman College sisters would say, she is an American shero. To Mrs. Parks, I say thank you for not moving to the back of the bus. Thank you for a lifetime of service to civil rights. I am humbled and deeply grateful for this opportunity to personally say to you I appreciate your courage. Mr. Speaker, America  is a better place because Rosa Parks came  its way. ",1999

224,House,106,0.387,15,1999-04-20,Mr. BACHUS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to  the  gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN). Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, over 40 years ago, Rosa Parks, a Montgomery, Alabama seamstress, showed how one woman, no matter what her background, can light a spark which changes the world. By refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man on a dark December day in 1955, Rosa Parks defied the oppressive legal system of segregation and set off a bus boycott that became one of the first victories in the civil rights revolution of the ’50s and the ’60s. For this brave stand for liberty and her many other contributions to our Nation and her community, she definitely deserves the Congressional Gold Medal which we are voting to award her today. Her heroic action resulted in her arrest and the loss of her job, but the ensuing struggle resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling just a year later which declared that the Montgomery segregation law was unconstitutional and that Montgomery officials must desegregate their bus system. This courageous act changed her life and our Nation forever, but it did not change the character and the humility of Rosa Parks, who still shuns the spotlight and has never sought the recognition which she so richly deserves. After moving to Detroit in 1957, in which she continued to work hard for the many causes which benefited both our Nation and her community, she worked for the gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr. CONYERS), running his Detroit office until her retirement in 1988. Rosa Parks also founded the Detroitbased Raymond and Rosa Parks Institute for Self-Development, which helps young people gain self-esteem through a variety of programs, as well as assists them with their education. By honoring Rosa Parks today, we are also endorsing her message which she so eloquently addressed in her book ‘‘Quiet Strength: The Faith, the Hope and  the Heart  of  a Woman Who Changed a Nation.’’ It ends with a plea for people of all races to work together for a world free of violence and racism, where all races and religions unite to improve the quality of life for everyone. Amen. Passage of this bill will be our contribution to her legacy today. ",1999
225,House,106,-0.538,22,1999-04-20,Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 573, a bill to award a Congressional gold medal  to Ms. Rosa Parks. As  the 91st African-American Member of Congress,  I stand on  the shoulders of Ms. Rosa Parks and the other mothers, martyrs, and soldiers of the struggle to create a more perfect Union. On December 1, 1955, a weary seamstress in Montgomery refused to give up her seat on the public bus to a white man for the long ride home. She was  just  too plain  tired. By her simple yet significant act of defiance, Ms. Parks struck a mighty blow against the states’ rights philosophy that justified Jim Crow American Apartheid, and helped set the nation back on the course of Reconstruction. Ninety years after the end of the Civil War, her actions were the catalyst for the sweeping and revolutionary changes that culminated in some of the most significant legislation to ever pass the House of Representatives: The Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. In  fact, my election  to Congress, and  the elections of every African-American serving in Congress, can all be directly attributed to her courage on that fateful day. But if we are to honor Ms. Rosa Parks for her courageous actions on that bus in Montgomery, surely we must also honor her for the life of activism that led up to that event. Ms. Parks was as a familiar participant in the civil rights struggle long before that bus ride. Through the forties and fifties, she served as  an  active  and  vocal member  of  the NAACP. She  joined  the Montgomery Voters League, and was active in registering others to vote well before her 44 years of  fame began. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, as we add our names to the litany of those who have paid tribute to the legacy Ms. Parks has created, let us also recognize the larger significance of her acts. The true legacy for all Americans in the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott is the years of hard work, perseverance, preparation, and faith that preceded that moment. Mr. Speaker, Honorable Members of  the House, Rosa Parks did not make history by refusing to give up her seat on a bus in downtown Montgomery in 1955; she made history by preparing herself to stand and be counted long before  the spotlight was cast on her weary feet. She is a model citizen of this nation. And it is  the entirety of her actions and  the singularity of her purpose—a freer and more just nation—that we ought honor here today. Even more, we ought to continue to work in her legacy by striving to deliver on the constitutional promise of a more perfect Union, a Union in which no American is left behind. Ms. Parks, on behalf of myself, my staff and the constituents of the Second District of Illinois, I thank you for all of the sacrifices you made for the United States of America. ",1999
226,House,106,-0.478,22,1999-04-20,Mr. RUSH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  legislation  to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks. Occasionally in our nation’s history there are pivotal moments and indispensable individuals that move America away from its divisive past and closer to its imagined promise. December 1, 1955, produced such a moment and such a person. Rosa Parks grew up in segregation. Every day she was forced to deal with the violation of America’s constitutional guarantees. On December 1, 1955,  this American woman, exacted of this country the freedom and equality the Constitution promises. Tired, like most citizens after a hard day’s work, Rosa Parks refused to obey a shameful law that required her to sit at the back of a Montgomery, AL, bus. Her actions set  the stage for the civil rights movement of a people who were unfairly and unjustly  living under racist law. Because of  this brave American woman, segregation laws around the nation began to crumble and our nation began to respond to the call for African-American equality. Because of her  invaluable contribution  to our nation, every American  lives better  lives  today. For that reason,  it  is quite appropriate  that Mrs. ",1999

228,Senate,106,0.344,120,1999-04-20,Mr. HAGEL.," Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished Senator  from Connecticut.  Mr. President, I join with my colleagues this morning  in  introducing  this joint resolution because it is the  right thing to do, it is the responsible  thing to do.  Our military efforts and our political  will must be consistent with and commensurate with our military and political objectives. That is the essence of  what this debate is about.  I happen to believe that the Balkans  are in the national security interests of  this country for many reasons: Our relationship with NATO, the stability of  Central and Eastern Europe; the next  ring out is the stability of the Baltics,  central Asia, Turkey. So in my mind it  is rather clear that we do have a national security interest here.  What this resolution is about is cutting  through  the  fog of who  is  to  blame,  the miscalculation, mistakes  up/down. That must be set aside. What  we need to remember is that we are engaged in a war. We must stay focused  on this commitment and have the resolution and the will to achieve the purpose which we began a month ago.  Wars—political,  military  calculations are imperfect. If we believe—and  I do; I believe our 18 NATO allies do believe —that this is the right thing to  do, then we must commit ourselves to  achieving this most important objective. That means the American people  must  first understand what our national security interests are, the Congress must lead with the President, and  we must be unified to accomplish this  goal.  Surely, one of the lessons of Vietnam  was that not only are long, confusing  wars not sustainable in democracies,  but we also learned, as Colin Powell  laid out very clearly the last time that  we dispatched our military might, that  the doctrine of military force is very  simple: Maximum amount of power,  minimum amount of time.  Time is not on our side here, Mr.  President. Time is not on our side. The  longer this goes without a resolution,  the more difficult it will become and  the more likely it will be that the resolution, the outcome, will be some kind  of a half-baked deal that will resolve  nothing; so as we began this noble effort, we will end with no nobility and  no achievement as to making the world  better and more stable and more secure.  This  is not a Republican/Democrat  issue. It is far beyond that. I think that  is well represented by the bipartisanship of this resolution. There is another  consequence  that  flows  from  what we are now engaged in, and that  is how we will respond to future security challenges. And just as important  as that link is how others around the  world will measure our response, measure our will, measure our commitment  to doing the right thing.  History has taught us very clearly  that when you defer the tough decisions, things do not get better; they get  worse. And the more you try and appease  the Milosevics  of  the world,  things get worse, more people die, more  commitment must be made later. That  is surely a lesson of history.  The time is now past whether we are  committed to do this or not. That debate was a month ago. What we must  do now is come together in a unified effort to win this, to achieve our political  and military  goals,  stop  the  slaughter, stop the butchery, allow the  people of Kosovo to go back into their  homes, maintain the stability of that  part of the world, and allow for a political  resolution  to  develop—not  one  that we dictate, not one that NATO  dictates, but the people of the Balkans.  My colleagues this morning have referred  to  the  outer  rings  of  consequences here, the outer rings of instability. I believe that if this effort is  not successful, not only are you destabilizing Central and Eastern Europe,  you are taking away the opportunities  those nations of Central and Eastern  Europe have now, and the former republics of the Socialist Soviet Republic, for a chance to develop a democracy and individual liberties and a free  market system, because you have destabilized the area for no other reason  than you have brought a million refugees, displaced persons, into that part  of the world where those nations and  the  infrastructures of  those nations  cannot possibly deal with that and,  hence,  destabilizing  the  very  infrastructure we are trying to help.  There  are  so many, many  consequences that are attached to this one  effort. I hope this resolution makes  very clear, on a bipartisan basis, what  we, as a Nation, as a member of NATO,  as a member of the civilized world have  at stake here and why it is important  that we win this war. And I call it a  war because it is a war.  I hope  that  the President of  the  United States will provide the kind of  leadership that this Nation is going to  need to connect the national security  interests not  just at the  immediate  time in that part of the world, but for  our long-term national security interests not just in that part of the world,  but all parts of the world. The President must lead. If the President wishes  to come to the Congress and ask for a  declaration of war, that should be entertained and debated and carefully  considered.  The  time  for nibbling around  the  edges here is gone. And we not only do  a great disservice  to  the men and  women that we asked to fight this war,  but to our democracy and all of the  civilized world if we do not do the right  thing. History will judge us harshly, as  it should, if we allow this to continue,  what is going on in the Balkans today,  and do not stop it.  f  ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS  S. 39  At the request of Mr. STEVENS, the  names of the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. GREGG), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. DURBIN), the Senator from  Delaware (Mr. BIDEN), and the Senator  from Vermont (Mr. LEAHY) were added  as cosponsors of S. 39, a bill to provide  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:06 Nov 01, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:(cid:1)999SENATE\S20AP9.REC S20AP9 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",1999

She is the recipient of the 1998–1999 VFW Voice of Democracy Scholarship Competition. Eleanor wrote a very moving and patriotic account of American democracy. I ask that the text of her script be inserted into the RECORD in its entirety at the completion of my remarks. Once again, I am proud to recognize Ms. Eleanor Forbes. ‘‘MYSERVICE VOICE OFDEMOCRACY PETITION TOAMERICA’’—1998–1999 VFW COMSCHOLARSHIP (Pennsylvania Winner—Eleanor Forbes) The voice you hear now is the voice of an American, a proud American. This  same voice pledges allegiance to our flag every morning, and sings proudly along with our national anthem when it is played. I am fifteen years old. I do not have the resources to go out and change the world. I do not have the money to give to all my fellow Americans who need it, nor am I old enough to run for president or serve my country in a war. But these are not the only ways I can serve my country. My service to America is expressed in many other ways. America has provided me with numerous opportunities for which I am grateful. I have the opportunities of education, participation in athletics, work, art and music, among other things. It is my duty as an American to grasp these opportunities firmly now, in my teenage years, so that I can give back to my country later in life. I owe it to America to be the best student I can be, to learn how to write and speak properly, to spell correctly, and to read the intricate works of the great American writers. I must learn to appreciate the artistic and musical works of the great American artists, and learn mathematics, science and history. It is my duty to visit the numerous places that make up American history books; to climb the steep ",1999
231,House,106,0.635,6,1999-04-27,Mr. ARMEY.," Mr. Speaker, I move to  suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1554) to amend the provisions of  title 17, United States Code, and the  This title may be cited as the ‘‘Satellite  Competition and Consumer Protection Act’’.

233,House,106,0.495,13,1999-04-27,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in support of the legislation introduced by my good friend, the gentleman  from  North  Carolina  (Mr.  COBLE). This important legislation represents  a much-needed  compromise  that will enable thousands of  folks,  many of whom live in my district, to  continue to receive their network signals through satellite service.  For those who can receive their network signal over the air, this compromise will ensure that they get the  antenna they need to receive a quality  over-the-air signal. Finally, this bill  will speed the roll-out of  local-into-  local satellite service by requiring a  joint study by the Copyright Office and  the Commerce Department on how to  best deliver local-into-local into rural  areas.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides  a badly needed solution to a problem  that cannot be delayed any longer. I  urge my colleagues to support this important compromise and keep this legislation moving to provide relief to the  hardworking Americans who deserve it.  ",1999
234,House,106,-0.404,13,1999-04-27,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  much time do I have remaining?  ",1999
235,House,106,-0.265,13,1999-04-27,Mr. BOUCHER.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to express appreciation  to  the gentleman from California for yielding me  this time. I am pleased to rise in support of the legislation and I also want  to commend the bipartisan leadership  of both the Committee on the Judiciary and Committee on Commerce and  their staffs that have worked effectively in order to achieve this reform.  Thousands of my constituents and  millions of rural residents throughout  the Nation cannot receive an adequate  signal  from  their  local TV  station.  They typically live in mountainous regions where their receipt of a good  local TV signal is effectively blocked  by  the  obstructions  between  their  homes and the local TV stations.  In 1988, we enacted the section 119  compulsory license that enables these  how  residents to receive via satellite the  network signals that they cannot receive from local stations. The legislation that we are approving today extends that license and creates a better  means of predicting which homes can  receive adequate local television signals.  It is my hope that this new standard  and this new predictive model will put  to rest the controversy that has long  simmered between  local broadcasters  on the one hand and the satellite carriers and their customers on the other  over which homes are eligible to receive satellite-delivered network signals.  The bill achieves another very important objective. It authorizes the uplink  of local stations and the satellite delivery of those stations back  into the  market of their origination. This local-  into-local service will enable the satellite industry to become a more viable  competitor to the cable television industry, with Americans receiving the  consequent benefits of market-established  rates  for multi-channel video  programming. This new  service will  also increase the ability of local broadcasters to reach all of the homes within their service territories.  I am concerned, however, that the  business plans of the carriers that have  announced an interest in offering the  local-to-local services extend only to  the largest 67 out of 211 local television  markets around  the country. Under  this plan, most of rural America simply will not receive the benefit of this  local-into-local service.  To address this concern, the bill directs the Copyright Office and the Department of Commerce to conduct an  in-depth study of the availability of  local television signals in rural America. A report to the Congress with findings and recommendations is directed  for the year 2000, and it is my hope that  this examination will lead to constructive steps that, in turn, will assure the  ability of more rural residents to receive high-quality local television signals.  I commend those who have authored  this measure. I was pleased to participate with them both in the Committee  on Commerce and the Committee on  the Judiciary as we considered it, and  I  strongly urge  its passage by  the  House.  ",1999
236,House,106,0.382,13,1999-04-27,Mr. BLILEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  for yielding me  this  time, and I rise in strong support of  H.R.  1554,  the  Satellite  Copyright,  Competition and Consumer Protection  Act, as amended.  This bill, as others have said, represents the hard work and collaboration of the two committees, the Committee on Commerce and  the Committee on the Judiciary, and I would  like to express my personal appreciation to many Members who helped in  bringing this legislation to the floor,  including  the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. TAUZIN), the chairman of  the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection;  the gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr. DINGELL) the ranking member of  the full Committee on Commerce; the  gentleman  from Massachusetts  (Mr.  MARKEY), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee  on  Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection; the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  HYDE), the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee; and my good friend, the  gentleman  from North Carolina  (Mr.  COBLE),  the  chairman  of  the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual  Property.  Mr. Speaker, this is a significant bill  because it will promote genuine competition  in  the  video  programming  marketplace. For too  long now consumers  have  sought  competitive  choices to their incumbent cable operators. Consumers today view satellite  television as an effective substitute for  incumbent  cable  system  offerings.  While satellite television currently delivers hundreds of channels of high resolution  digital  programming,  consumers clearly see the lack of local  broadcast programming as a reason not  to subscribe. This bill will facilitate  satellite-delivered local broadcast programming and, as such, shift satellite  television into higher gear in its quest  to compete with cable.  The timing of this legislation is particularly important because of the fact  that the cable rate regulation expired  on March 31 this year. I have often said  that rate regulation has a sad history,  given that rates continue to go up in  spite of rate regulation. This is a better approach. It is a procompetitive solution to the cable’s dominant market  share.  Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank  all of my colleagues for their steadfast  support and commitment for enacting  this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to suggest to my good friend, the chairman of  the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, that in the future,  when we have a difference of opinion  between  his  subcommittee  and  the  Subcommittee  on  Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, that he and I just settle it on the  tennis court.  b1445  ",1999

239,House,106,-0.451,20,1999-04-27,Mr. SCOTT.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding me this time,  and I rise in support of the bill, H.R.  1034, which I have cosponsored with the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BLILEY).  The legislation, H.R. 1034, declares a  portion  of  the  James  River  and  Kanawha Canal in Richmond, Virginia,  between the Great Ship Lock on the  east and the city limits on the west as  nonnavigable waters. The bill gives jurisdiction and authority of the canal to  the city of Richmond for the purpose of  operating boats along the canal adjacent to downtown Richmond.  b1515  In the late 19th century the canal  was used to transport commerce from  other parts of Virginia on the James  River and into the canal. The canal  was eventually closed, and, as has been  said, filled with dirt for many years. In  1973, a federal judge declared parts of  the waterway nonnavigable. Nevertheless, due to its former use, to move  commerce along the river, the Coast  Guard has maintained that the canal  has retained its technical classification  as a navigable waterway.  Now the City of Richmond has redeveloped the area with Canal Walk, a  project that will revitalize the area  along the James River and Kanawha  Canal. The canal, as has been stated,  averages 3  feet  in depth and has a  width of approximately 23 feet when it  opens, the city will use canal boats as  a major attraction to draw tourists to  the restored area of the river. The  Canal Walk  is expected to generate  thousands of visitors who will enjoy  numerous attractions and seasonal activities along  the James River and  Kanawha Canal, and it will play a valuable role in the revitalization of the  river front.  This legislation makes clear that the  City of Richmond may operate  the  boats on the canal with a number of accepted  requirements  and  standards  that will satisfy public safety concerns  of Federal, State and local regulators.  I would like to thank the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. SHUSTER), the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. OBERSTAR), the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  DEFAZIO), the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. GILCHREST) and  the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. TAYLOR)  for working  in cooperation with the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BLILEY)  and myself in such an expeditious and  bipartisan manner.  H.R.  1034  has  gained the unanimous support of the  House Committee on Transportation,  and I urge its acceptance by the House.  ",1999
240,House,106,0.75,27,1999-04-27,Mr. TANCREDO.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank my colleague, the gentlewoman  from New York, for yielding time to  me.  Mr. Speaker, I should say that having now lived through this horrible experience and participated in all of the  events, as many as I could in Colorado,  it has certainly touched my soul in a  way that few other things that I have  experienced in this Congress have.  Mr. Speaker, I assure my colleagues  who have spoken to this point that I  personally will be more than willing, I  would be happy to look at any proposal, any idea anyone has to address  this kind of  issue, any  solution.  I  yearn, I ache for a solution, just like  anyone else in this Congress.  I fear so deeply, however, that what  we can do here cannot even begin to  touch or make a dent in the problem  that  has  created Columbine High’s  tragedy. It is a problem that is close to  home, close to home for all of us.  We must look in the mirror, every  single one of us, for the real reason, for  the real answer here, because we have  created a culture in which a generation  at least has grown up without the ability to look at life through the same  sort of eyes that many other generations have, and without the ability to  actually have a  sense of worth, of  value.  When I was younger there was a popular movie,  ‘‘Easy Rider,’’ and  the  characters in the movie spent the entire thing living the high life, literally  and figuratively, on drugs. At the end,  however, they looked up and said, we  blew it. We blew it. That was the message that not too many people got.  But I must tell the Members, I look  at our generation and I look at all the  things that have happened, and I look  at the life we tried to live and provide  for our children, thinking it was the  right thing, it was a life that we decided was not worthy of restrictions,  that we would not impose them on our  children, that we would be pals instead  of parents, and we live the high life,  and we blew it. We blew it.  I think of my neighbor, whose son  cradled Mr. Sanders in his arms as the  last breath left his body, and he said to  my neighbor’s son,  ‘‘Please tell my  family I love them.’’  And I think of the scars that that  child now takes with him for the rest  of his life, and not just the physical  scars that we know are on there from  the people who are surviving in the  hospitals, but all the mental scars that  we will have no idea, we will never  know the depth of them. We will never  know the extent to which they exist.  We will never know how to treat or  who to treat, because we will never  know. We will not see with our eyes  how they affect these children.  And I think to myself, for some children there is still hope, but we have to  look at ourselves as families. We have  to look in the mirror. There is nowhere  else to go. As John Donne says, ask not  for whom the bells toll, they toll for  thee and for me.  I accept  the  responsibility, and  I  hope with all my heart and I pray to  the ever-living God that he gives me  the wisdom, and my colleagues, and my  community, and the culture, the wisdom to know what action we individually can take so as to avoid a tragedy  like this ever happening again. I pray  for that wisdom.  ",1999
241,House,106,-0.184,27,1999-04-27,Mr. BARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, in the aftermath  of the tragedy in Littleton, the nation has been  splintered by blame and torn apart by finger-  pointing. As we all try to decide who or what  is to be blamed for the terror wreaked by two  young men, the fabric of our national community is being shredded. While there is a need  to find some concrete thing to be culpable for  this horrible event  it  is  important  for us  to  stand united as one people, as one country, to  support those who need it the most.  As a Congressman, but first as a citizen of  this nation,  I would  like  to express my sincerest condolences to the people of Littleton,  Colorado. I would also like to express the condolences of my district,  the Fifth District of  Michigan. I have spoken with many constituents, and received many  letters,  from  those  who are deeply  saddened by  this horrific  event.  After the healing has begun, after we have  all decided that we are ready to proceed, we  need to become involved in our young people’s  lives. We need  to support and nurture  them  like  the  incredible resources  they are.  Whether at home or in school, adults as well  as peers need to take a vital interest in their  children, students and friends. The sadness,  frustration and anger  that  these  two young  men  felt should never again be dismissed.  What a disgrace it would be to the memory of  those children and their heroic teacher if we  should let the lessons fade from our collective  conscience. Littleton should not be the ‘‘worst  school massacre  in our nation’s history,’’  it  should be the last school massacre in our Nation’s history.  ",1999

That does highlight the point we are  trying to make here that this is an effort being made by American parliamentarians with counterparts  in the  Russian Duma on the basis that we  have a vehicle for discussion that is  formally established and institutionalized between the Congress and the Russian parliament, known as the Duma,  and that we want to take full advantage of that in the interest of peace.

245,Senate,106,-0.293,83,1999-04-27,Mr. HOLLINGS.," This  letter  is addressed to my staff, Mr. Moses Boyd. It says: Dear Mr. Boyd: Thank you for speaking with me earlier. Thirteen (13) of the 44 Y2K lawsuits that have been filed to date have been dismissed entirely or almost entirely. Twelve (12) cases have been settled for moderate sums or for no money. The legal system is weeding out frivolous claims, and Y2K legislation is therefore unnecessary. Thirty-five (35) cases have been filed on behalf of corporate entities, such as health care  providers,  retailers, manufacturers, service providers, and more. Nine (9) cases have been filed on behalf of individuals. This trend will continue. Thus, the same corporations that are lobbying for Y2K legislation may be limiting their own rights to recover remediation costs or damages. I have studied the Y2K problem carefully from the legal perspective, and have written a book entitled ‘‘Litigating Year 2000 Cases,’’ which will be published by West Group in June. I frequently write and speak about the subject. I do not represent any clients that have an interest in the passage or defeat of any proposed Y2K legislation. Feel free to call me, should you have any questions. Thank you very much. Very truly yours, Ronald N. Weikers, Attorney at Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Mr. President, there are things  in here to emphasize. One is: ‘‘I do not represent any clients that have an interest in the passage or defeat of any proposed Y2K legislation.’’ And I emphasize that his book will be published by the West Group in June. The month after next, in about 5 or 6 weeks, this book will be coming out. I can tell you as a practicing attorney that the West Group is not going to publish any partisan political book or edition. It would not sell to the lawyers on both sides. We like to look up and find the authorities, not political arguments. The West Group is in that particular field professionally of documenting in a research fashion the matter of Y2K cases in this particular interest. I can tell you right now they have pretty good evidence about what has been occurring. What has been occurring is best evidenced by the testimony of Dr. Robert Courtney  before  the Committee  on Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation on February 9 on S. 96, the Y2K Act. I ask unanimous consent that his testimony be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the RECORD, as follows: TESTIMONYOFDR. ROBERTCOURTNEYATTHE SENATECOMMITTEEONCOMMERCE, SCIENCE, ANDTRANSPORTATIONHEARINGONS. 96, THE Y2K ACT, FEBRUARY9, 1999 Good morning, my name is Bob Courtney, and I am a doctor from Atlantic County, New Jersey. It is an honor for me to be here this morning, and I thank you for inviting me to offer testimony on the Y2K issue. As a way of background, I am an ob/gyn and a solo practitioner. I do not have an office manager. It’s just my Registered Nurse, Diane Hurff, and me, taking care of my 2000 patients. These days,  it  is getting  tougher and tougher for those of us who provide traditional, personalized medical services. The paperwork required by the government on one hand, and by insurance companies on the other is forcing me to spend fewer hours doing what I do best—taking care of patients and delivering their babies. But it was a Y2K problem which recently posed a serious threat to my practice, and that is why I am here this morning. As a matter of clarification, although I am a doctor, I am not here to speak on behalf of the American Medical Association. Although I am also a small businessman, I am not here to speak on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce. I cannot tell you who these organizations feel about the legislation before the Committee. But I can tell you how it would have affected my practice and my business. I am one of the lucky ones. While a potential Y2K failure impacted my practice, the computer vendor that sold me the software system and I were able to reach an out-ofcourt settlement which was fair and expedient. From what my  attorney, Harris Pogust, who is here with me today tells me, I doubt I would have been so lucky had this legislation been in effect. In 1987, I purchased a computer system from Medical Manager, one of the leading medical systems providers in the country. I used the Medical Manager system for tracking surgery, scheduling due dates and billing. The system worked well for me for ten years, until the computer finally crashed from lack of sufficient memory. In 1996, I replaced my old system with a new, state of the art pentium system from Medical Manager for $13,000. This was a huge investment for a practice of my size. I  remember  joking with  the  computer salesman at the time that this was a big purchase for me, and that I was counting on this system to last as long as the last one did. I remember the salesman telling me that he was sure that I would get at least ten years out of it. He showed me a list of how many of his local customers had used the Medical Manager for longer than ten years. And, the salesman pointed me to this advertising brochure put out by Medical Manager. It states that their product would provide doctors with  ‘‘the ability to manage [their] future.’’ In truth, I never asked the salesman about whether the new system that I was buying was Y2K compliant. I honestly did not know even to ask the question. After all, I deliver babies. I don’t program computers. Based on the salesman’s statements and the brochure, I assumed the system would work long into the future. After all, he had promised me over ten years’ use, which would take me to 2006. But just one year later, I received a form letter from Medical Manager telling me that the system I had just purchased had a Y2K problem. It was a problem that would make it impossible for me to schedule due dates or handle my administrative tasks—as early as 1999. Medical Manager also offered to fix the problem  that  they had  created—but  for $25,000. I was outraged, as I suspect anyone sitting around this table would be. The original system had cost me $15,000 when I purchased it in 1986. The upgraded system cost me $13,000 in 1996. Now, a year later, they wanted another $25,000. They knew when they sold me the $13,000 system that it would need this upgrade—but of course, they didn’t tell me. I wrote back to the company that I fully expected them to fix the problem for free, since I had  just bought the system  from them and I had been promised that it would work long into the future. The company ignored my request, however, and several months later, sent me an estimate for fixing the problem—again, for over $25,000. At this point, I was faced with a truly difficult dilemma. My practice depends on the use of a computer system to track my patients’ due dates, surgeries and billings—but I did not have $25,000 to pay for an upgrade. Additionally, I was appalled at the thought of having to pay Medical Manager for a problem that they had created and should have anticipated. If I had to pay that $25,000, that would force me to drop many of my indigent patients that I now treat for free. Since Medical Manager  insisted  upon charging me for the new system, and because my one year-old system was no longer dependable, I retained an attorney and sued Medical Manager to fix or replace my computer system at their cost. Within two months of filing our action, Medical Manager offered to settle by providing all customers who bought a non-Y2K compliant system from them after 1990 with a free upgrade that makes their systems Y2K compliant by utilizing a software ‘‘patch.’’ This settlement gave me what I wanted from Medical Manager—the ability to use my computer system as it was meant to be used. To my great satisfaction, the legal system worked for me and the thousands of other doctors who bought Medical Manager’s products since 1990. In fact, since I brought ",1999
246,,106,-0.324,174,1999-04-27,Mr. GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, today I introduced a bill to amend the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act. The legislation would simply extend the filing fee exemption fee to all elementary and secondary schools. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act increased the number of H1–B visas available over a series of years. This legislation also called for a $500 fee to be paid by the employer to file their H1–B visa application. However, this act also contained a provision  that exempted  institutes of higher education, non-profit  research groups, and governmental research institutes from paying the filing fee. The exemption was afforded to these groups to help offset the cost of trying to employ talented workers from abroad. I  represent part of Houston, Texas. Back home my wife is an algebra teacher in Aldine High School. She  recently  told me of  their teacher  recruiting efforts. The Aldine  Independent School District is much like other district on or near the border. These school districts are constantly searching for talented, experienced  teachers  for our children. School districts on or near the border will even try to recruit teachers from abroad, who are experienced, bilingual, and who would be a great addition to any school’s staff. The legislation I just introduced would extend  the  filing  fee exemption  to all of our schools and will give them the opportunity to recruit the most educated, talented, and experienced teachers for our students. By offsetting the cost of the application, our elementary and secondary schools could look to find the best teachers or specialists, and they could use the $500 filing fee to provide other education services for our schools. f A TRIBUTE TO ELVA AND JOSEPH RIBAUDO HON.

Elva and Joseph’s  love  for each other, their community, and children exemplify the old-fashioned values this country was founded on. Recently they celebrated a milestone few couples reach. Elva and Joseph Ribaubo celebrated fifty years of marriage. To mark the milestone, a party was recently held in Fresno, California, where over 60 people turned out to honor this wonderful couple. Among  the quests were  their  two beautiful children and their four adorable grandchildren. In 1952, three years after getting married, the young couple moved into their first house. They still live in that house 47 years later. As this century come  to a close  they have no plans of moving out of  their beloved home. their devotion to this home, neighborhood, and community is unequaled.

Over  the past 25 years, Mr. Eloy Aguilar has served the constituents of the 20th district of Texas as district director for my predecessor and  father, Henry B. Gonzalez. Twenty-five years ago, Eloy began his career of service and over  the years he has shown great dedication and commitment  to the constituents of the 20th district and all the people of San Antonio. There have been countless changes since he began his career in 1974, but  the one  thing  that has not changed is Eloy’s dedication. He has devoted many hours, evenings and weekends  to  the work of the people. Though he had served the community of San Antonio for a quarter of a century and was  ready  for  retirement, Eloy continued his role as district director for me during the transition from my father’s lengthy term through the first months of my own. In just a few days, Eloy will enter retirement. I take this opportunity to thank him for his tireless service to the constituents of the 20th district and to the Gonzalez family. His presence will be greatly missed. Eloy, we wish you all the best. f GUILLIAN-BARRE SYNDROME AWARENESS DAY, MAY 1, 1999 HON. STENY H.

249,,106,-0.379,174,1999-04-27,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to share  information about Guillian-Barre Syndrome Day on Saturday, May 1, 1999. ‘‘GBS Awareness Day’’ is an effort to help educate the public and to focus attention on Guillian-Barre Syndrome. GBS  is an  inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nerves. It is characterized by the rapid onset of weakness and often, paralysis of the legs, arms, breathing muscles, and face. Although most people recover, this can take months, and some have long-term disabilities.  It  is  important  to note that GBS can develop in any person at any age,  regardless of gender or ethnic background. Although a great number of cases developed from the 1976 swine flu vaccine, almost 50 percent occur shortly after a viral infection such as a sore throat or diarrhea. This should bring home how susceptible we all are to this baffling disorder which is unpredictable and as of yet, it’s cause is unknown. In 1980, in response to the growing number of cases, Robert and Estelle Benson founded the Guillian-Barre Syndrome Foundation International. The  foundation has developed 130 chapters to help serve the needs of patients, families, and friends while at the same time raise money  to  fund medical  research. The foundation is proud to have on it’s medical advisory board some of the world’s leading experts on GBS, as well as physicians who themselves have the disorder. One of GBS Foundation cofounders, Mr. Ralph Neas, has played a vital role in bringing awareness to the community through his work at the local Montgomery County Chapter. It is the mission of those who have been affected by this sometimes devastating disease to assure that everyone is aware of the established support system and  to better educate  the community on  the  facts and symptoms of Guillian-Barre Syndrome. I congratulate the foundation on their efforts and wish them great success in their mission. f IN HONOR OF RICARDO DIAZ AND BOBBI MARSELLS HON. THOMAS M.

250,,106,-0.38,174,1999-04-27,Mr. BARRETT of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to share with my colleagues my appreciation and regard  for Mr. Ricardo Diaz and Ms. Bobbi Marsells, of the Housing Authority of  the City of Milwaukee. Today, Monday, April 26, 1999, the residents of Milwaukee’s Hillside Public Housing Development are honoring Ricardo and Bobbi for their work to revitalize Hillside. Ask anyone  familiar with HUD’s HOPE VI public  housing  revitalization  program,  and they‘ll  tell you  that Hillside‘s  transformation wasn’t just another ‘revitalization’; it was more like a resurrection. In 1993, most of the residents in Hillside lived below the poverty line and had no earned income at all, the facilities were ugly and outmoded,  the neighborhood was plagued with drugs and crime, and most public housing applicants preferred  to wait longer  for help  than  to move  there. Today, earned income is way up, poverty and crime are way down, the design and appearance of the buildings and neighborhood are contemporary, attractive, and functional, and Hillside has a waiting list of eager would-be residents. Hillside is special not just for Milwaukee, but as an example for the national of what public housing can be. Hillside shows us that revitalization means more than just, safe, structurally sound,  and  comfortable  buildings. Hillside demonstrates that co-locating supportive services offered  in partnership with committed, community-based organizations can help public housing residents to work their way out of poverty. Hillside also reminds us that removing design barriers like dead-end streets and treeline screens, and actually integrating a public housing  development  into  the  surrounding neighborhood, can reduce crime and raise the quality of life for the residents of the development. Many people contributed to Hillside’s transformation, but the indispensable element, the driving  force  that made  it happen, was  the team of Ricardo Diaz and Bobbi Marsells. Ricardo and Bobbi helped political leaders convince HUD that the revitalization strategy was sound and they built and energized a coalition ",1999

253,House,106,-0.547,17,1999-05-06,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman  for yielding me  this time. Mr. Chairman, it has been more than a month since Milosevic launched his campaign of genocide. His atrocities continue to fill us with horror and revulsion: more than a million people, driven from their homes at gunpoint; entire  towns burned  to  the ground; men and boys forced to kneel by the side of the road and shot dead before their  families;  grandparents  burned alive because they were too feeble to flee. In the face of such brutal and systematic slaughter, we need to send him a message, an unmistakable message of American resolve, that his campaign of genocide will not stand. We have  to  set  partisan  politics aside. We have to stand united behind our troops. Even as we speak today, our pilots are hurtling off the decks of our carriers, risking their lives to save the Kosovars and see justice done. We have to give them the support that they need in order to win. Milosevic cannot be allowed to prevail. The scale and the details of his inhumanity  ignite our moral  indignation. Accounts coming out of Kosovo are shocking: Serbian soldiers knock on the windows of a refugee’s car as he and his family wait to cross the border, and they were bearing AK–47s. They demanded $6,000 from the driver or his two daughters in the back seat. The father empties his wallet, but it is not enough. So the soldiers pull the young women from the car, drag them to a nearby garage, where several other soldiers, also wearing masks, were waiting. The gang rape lasted hours. Last  Friday,  in  the  village  of Pristina, Serbian troops murdered 44 Kosovars, shooting some and burning others alive. When relatives of the victims went to bury their loved ones, the soldiers told them that they would be shot, too, if they uttered a single prayer  for the dead. And as one of the Kosovars said later, perhaps our silence helps them to deal with their shame. Well, Mr. Chairman, America cannot and we will not be silent as long as Milosevic continues his campaign of terror. As a superpower at the peak of our prosperity and our strength, America cannot look the other way and we cannot be diverted by our partisan differences. I have been troubled by the procedures that the House adopted today, and we have seen people trying to play politics with the President’s  funding request for these troops. I would urge my colleagues to unite behind the Obey substitute. It is clean, it is straightforward, it is a strong response to the present emergency, and by all prognostications it will be what we end up with next week on this floor. In the end, we have to move this process forward; and we have to do it today. Now is the time to accept the responsibilities of  leadership. Now  is the time to support our troops in the field, who are risking their  lives so that  this century might end better than it began. Now is the time to send Milosevic an unmistakable message: At the end of the 20th century, the world will not stand for genocide. ",1999
254,House,106,0.435,17,1999-05-06,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Chairman, I think I probably just wasted 20 seconds of my time. I was not prepared for this. Let me be very brief now that my time has been stressed. Mr. Chairman, I would ask Members to permit the eyes of their minds to see a greater vision here and to not be so narrow to think of this as Kosovo and Kosovo only. What concerns me most is that this is about funding a national military strategy. Sure, there are discussions of politics. Frankly, I do not mind that, because it is policy that drives all of this. The President’s singular responsibility is to lay out the vital national security  interests, then we come up with a military strategy as the means to enforce those. The President has one that is different, and I would not go along with it, but it is for us to transition out of a posture of global engagement in over 135 countries around  the world and then fight and win nearly two simultaneous major  regional conflicts. The open secret is we do not have the force structure today to do that. Let me share some facts with my colleagues about the size of the military today. In the Gulf War, we had 18 Army divisions, we had 24 Air Force tactical wings, and in the Navy ships and submarines we had 546 in 1990. Today, we are down to 10 divisions in the Army, 13 tactical wings in the Air Force, and a 315 ship Navy. That is a reduction in the Army by 250,000, in the Air Force 150,000, and in the Navy 200,000. So what have we done by taking a foreign policy of global engagement? We have taken our military and we have stretched this great military of ours very thin all over the world. Now we find ourselves with depleted munitions. Depleted munitions. And not only in our ammo. When I hear individuals say, well, we are going to have to cut back or we are only going to have to replace bullet for bullet, do my colleagues realize the risks we are being placed in in other scenarios around the world? b1230 Do not take it from me. Take it from General Shelton. General Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, ‘‘Suffice it to say that what we have going on right now in Kosovo is a major theater of war with air assets. The fighting in Yugoslavia now means a much higher risk of a second regional conflict, protracted, with  significant casualties.’’ My colleagues, vote for this. ",1999
255,House,106,0.302,31,1999-05-06,Mr. LATHAM.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I am sure the gentleman is aware that the offsets in this are ones that he proposed. The ones he is referring to really are not germane to the amendment at hand. I would like to have everyone know that this is fully offset, it is fully paid for. It  is something that I think  is quite important today that we move this and move this quickly. Mr. Chairman, there are a lot of very important  issues  in agriculture. We will deal with a lot of those through the  normal  appropriations  process. This is the one area where there is consensus to move ahead. Everyone agrees that this needs to be done and needs to be done today. If we want to start more fights with the other body, if we want to stop or stand in the way of help for our farmers and the critical needs that they have today, all we need to do is load it up with a bunch of extraneous issues. But this is critical today, that we move this and move it quickly. Mr. Chairman, I just want to, in closing, urge  everyone  to  support  this amendment. It is paid for. I want to also thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR)  for her support on so many of these agricultural issues, and our chairman of the subcommittee, and also, certainly, the chairman of the full committee, who bent over backwards to be of assistance to agriculture. ",1999
256,House,106,0.379,31,1999-05-06,Mr. BARRETT of Nebraska.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support for the Latham amendment. Last year’s unexpected and uncontrollable market forces caused farm income to decline precipitously.  Farming,  a  notoriously  risky business, saw even tougher times due to the Asian  financial crisis, which caused export markets  to dry up, and bountiful production world wide, which drove prices down. On top of natural disasters here at home, Congress had to act. The $6 billion provided  last  fall allowed farmers  to get  through  the year.  It helped them harvest and market their crops and pay off their bills. However, as many geared up for planting  this spring, poor market  forecasts which projected inadequate cash flows, forced producers to seek direct and guaranteed loans from USDA. However,  due  to  extraordinary  demand, there’s a  large shortfall  in  these  loan programs. Already, more than 26,000 producers have received loans from USDA. By providing an additional $106 million, as this amendment does, 12,000 more  farmers will be able  to farm this year. This amendment and USDA’s credit program deserve your support. By supporting them, you not only signal to farmers that Congress recognizes their distress, but you also help  farmers keep  their dreams alive  for a bright future in agriculture. The CHAIRMAN. All time for debate on this amendment has expired. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. LATHAM). The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 submitted for printing in House Report 106–127. AMENDMENTNO. 2OFFEREDBYMR. COBURN ",1999
257,House,106,0.631,31,1999-05-06,Mr. TOOMEY.," Mr. Chairman,  the United States is engaged in a war. It is a war not of Congress’ making, but a war, nevertheless, and one that has revealed for the whole world to see the inadequacy of the resources available to our military services. We have a moral obligation to provide the necessary resources to the men and women whose lives are at risk fighting this war, but we have another obligation as well. That is an obligation to the American taxpayer and our senior citizens to maintain integrity in our budgeting, to pay  for the additional necessary emergency military spending without using social security ",1999
258,House,106,0.47,45,1999-05-06,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman  for yielding me  this time. I want to strongly support the base package and strongly oppose the Obey amendment for this reason. We did an analysis and asked the Department of Defense under the Clinton administration how short we were in basic ammunition compared not to some Republican standard, not to some think tank standard, but compared to the President’s own two-war requirement, how short we were  in  everything  from cruise missiles, right on down to M–16 ammo. The answer  is,  $13.8 billion short. Even passing this supplemental, even passing the fiscal year 2000 budget, we are going to be short. We asked the services how short they were in terms of near-term war-fighting capability. We did not ask contractors. We did not ask Members of Congress. b1430 They gave us a list of $28.7 billion. That includes ammunition and equipment. The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY)  says,  ‘‘Well, why didn’t you spend more money  on  readiness?’’ Well, the reason, Mr. Chairman, is because we  lost  55 aircraft  last year crashing because we have got old systems. We have got 40-year-old CH–46 helicopters instead of the new V–22. So, we have been forced to choose with this limited amount of money between bullets and having safe platforms for our people to fly. Now the gentleman said, ‘‘Well, what have you Republicans done with this $27 billion that you added?’’ Mr. Chairman, I think the Commandant of the Marine Corps gave  the best answer when  our  chairman,  the  gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. SPENCE), asked him, ‘‘Where would you be right now if we hadn’t added the 27 billion over the last several years?’’ The Commandant of  the Marine Corps  said, ‘‘You wouldn’t have had a 911 force, the U.S. Marine Corps. You would have had a 91 force.’’ So we have done good things with the money we added. This thing should have been a lot bigger. I would have liked to have seen a supplemental with $20–$25 billion  in  it. Every dollar of that  could  have  been  justified  by matching the two MRC requirements against what we actually have. I commend the committee. Let us pass this thing. ",1999
259,House,106,0.424,45,1999-05-06,Mr. HILL of Montana.," Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman so that I could speak on behalf of the bill and for the Coburn and against the Obey amendment. As my colleagues know, 2 years ago, Mr. Chairman, we debated the balanced budget agreement on this floor. In fact, it was supported 333 to 99. I happen to have been one of the 99 that voted against it, and what does that have to do with today’s debate? Mr. Chairman, I voted ‘‘no’’ on May 20, 1997, for the same reason I am going to  support  the Coburn  amendment today, an idea called fiscal discipline. In 1997 the House voted to increase the deficit by $24 billion, pushing the burden to balance the budget off into the future. It simply pushed the spending cuts and the discipline into it the future. All the surpluses that we read about assume that Congress will find a way to support those cuts and Congress will demonstrate that fiscal discipline. Sometime,  somewhere  Congress  is going to have to show this discipline and actually make some tough choices. I think now is a good time. Two years ago I voted to make those choices then, not later, and today I am calling on my colleagues to do the same today, make that choice today. Last fall President Clinton said he wanted to save Social Security first, and I agreed with him. I voted to put off tax relief. Last fall he said let us use 100 percent of Social Security for Social Security, and then in January in the State of the Union he said, well, no, let us just use 62 percent for Social Security. Then he submitted a budget that  said, well, no,  57 percent was enough. Now the President is coming here asking for billions of dollars for Kosovo, all of it coming from Social Security. We need to exercise fiscal discipline, and we need to support our men and women, too, who are risking their lives in the Balkans. I do not support the President’s decision to go to war. I think it is a terrible mistake. But I do support the men and women who are over there fighting. The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY) does not understand that it is not just the men and women who fighting in the Balkans that are at risk. Our whole national security is at risk. The President has overcommitted our military. We have  265,000  troops  in  135 countries. Since the Gulf War we have shrunk our military by  40 percent. Since 1990 we have had 33 troop deployments; there were 10 in the 49 years that preceded  that. Under  the War Powers Act, President Clinton has submitted 46 reports, more than twice as many as Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush submitted combined, and 90 percent of the President’s line item vetoes were for military needs. To conduct this war the President has diverted planes from Iraq. He has ",1999

266,House,106,0.284,87,1999-05-06,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, on March 10, 1999, the House Appropriations subcommittee on Transportation held a hearing on the topic of aviation safety. At that hearing, Jane Garvey, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) testified, as did Ken Mead, Department of Transportation  inspector general (IG), and Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Last year, domestic air carriers had an excellent safety record: no passengers died on U.S. commercial  flights. Many worked diligently  to make safety a priority, and  in  the transportation appropriations subcommittee we have focused our efforts on aviation safety as well as all transportation modes. In  listening  to  the  testimony prepared by each agency, it appeared that there was a difference of opinion in some areas with regard to the progress being made in aviation safety. Therefore, I requested that the IG and NTSB review the FAA’s testimony and the FAA review the testimony of the IG and NTSB. In addition, I asked each to respond to the comments made by  the others.  I have provided this information for the FEDERALREGISTER. In general,  the oversight agencies  (NTSB and IG) believe that the FAA could be moving more aggressively in the referenced areas of aviation safety. For example, the NTSB noted that the FAA should be moving more quickly to ensure that aircraft registered in the United States have new flight data recorders. Similarly, the IG points out that draft regulations seeking to reduce the number of runway incursions have not yet been published while the number of runway incursions continues to rise. Both oversight agencies suggest  that  the FAA should use more realistic measures of aviation safety. For example, the IG notes that a good measure of airport security is not the number of new explosive detection machines purchased and distributed, but the number of bags screened by the machines. After all, it’s one thing to purchase and place explosive detection machines and it is quite another to put them into service and screen bags. For  its part,  the FAA agrees  that more should be done in the areas of runway incursions, airport security and project oversight. Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that the FAA will continue to work with the IG, NTSB and the aviation industry to fund and implement additional safety  initiatives. The safety record of the industry last year was good, but we must remain vigilant  in our efforts  to  improve  the safety of the traveling public. As chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee, I am committed, as I know all members of the subcommittee are, to do what we can to make sure that transportation safety remains a priority. OIG COMMENTSONFAA’SSTATEMENT We have the following comments on FAA’s statement  before  the  Subcommittee  on Transportation, Committee on Appropriations. I. AIRTRAFFICCONTROLMODERNIZATION FAA’s statement gives the impression that final deployment of the HOST and Oceanic Computer System Replacement for Phase 1 hardware has been completed. However, final deployment has not yet occurred and is currently planned to be complete by October 1999. II. SECURITY FAA’s testimony on deploying explosives detection systems state that FAA has been very effective in getting advance explosives detection systems up and running. FAA’s statement cites the fact that security equipment for checked baggage has been installed at over 30 airports, and that trace explosive detection devices for carry-on bags are being used at more than 50 airports. The issue is not whether security equipment has been installed at more than 30 airports or whether the equipment has been ‘‘procured’’, ‘‘installed’’ or is ‘‘operational.’’ In our opinion, the true measure of effectiveness is the number of fully operational, FAAcertified bulk explosives detection machines in use at Category X and I airports that are screening at or near the demonstrated mean capacity of 125 bags per hour per machine. In our opinion, this usage rate is reasonable as it includes time to resolve alarms and is just more than half of the certified rate of 225 bags per hour. Accordingly, our message to Congress in the past 2 years has focused on the underutilization of explosives detection equipment at this country’s  largest airports. In our opinion, it is ultimately the number of bags screened that makes the difference in aviation security, not the number of explosives detection machines installed. FAA also stated that it continues to expand the use of realistic operational testing of the aviation security system. While FAA may be expanding the use of realistic operational testing, much of the testing to date has not been ‘‘realistic.’’ In our recneltly completed audit of Secretary of Checked Baggage, we found that checked baggage security testing by over 300 FAA security field agents assigned to FAA regions was limited to air carrier compliance with manual profiling and positive passenger bag marching  requirements. Also, at  the time of our audit, only a few ‘‘red team’’1security agents assigned to FAA Headquarters were testing the new automated passenger profiling  systems,  explosives  detection equipment, and equipment operators. Therefore, red team testing of the new checked baggage security requirements has been infrequent, limited to specific testing criteria, and applied to only a few air carriers. In prior audits, we found similar conditions. For example, in 1993 and 1996, we reported that FAA testing of airport access control was ineffective (not realistic or aggressive) and, in 1998, we reported that FAA testing of air carrier compliance with cargo security requirements was not comprehensive. We ntoed certain compliance requirements were omitted from the test plans. Current OIG efforts  indicate  little  improvement. For  example,  in our  current audit of airport Access Control, we found FAAs airport access  control assessments were limited in scope, included little testing of controls, and were conducted without using a standard testing protocol. Our test results confirm the importance of a standard test protocol that includes realistic and aggressive testing procedures. In a majority of our tests involving airport access control, we successfully penetrated secure areas and boarded a large number of passenger and cargo aircraft. The majority of individiuals we encountered failed to challenge us for unauthorized access. FAA recognizes that improvements are needed and, on 1Red team refers to a group of security agents assigned to FAA’s Civil Aviation Security Special Activities Office. ",1999

292,Senate,106,-0.2,178,1999-05-06,Mr. ROBB.," Mr. President, I rise this  afternoon to introduce legislation that  I have been working on  for several  months and had not planned to introduce until  later this year when the  Senate considers the reauthorization of  the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. However, the tragic event  in Littleton  has moved  everyone’s  timetable forward.  When  I was Governor of Virginia,  education was my top priority. I might  note that I know it was a top priority  for the Presiding Officer when he was  Governor of Ohio. Since I have been in  the Senate I have become increasingly  concerned about school safety. We simply cannot have good schools unless we  have safe schools.  In 1993 I was able to get legislation  enacted  to create a commission on  school violence. Regrettably, that commission was never funded, but it should  have been. Two years ago the Senate  approved an amendment I offered to  allow COPS  funding to be used  for  school  safety. Last year we  significantly expanded on that program, and  I am grateful for the Senate’s and the  President’s commitment to that important effort.  Over the past year, a year in which  we have had too many horrible tragedies in our schools, we have all noticed  that the most common questions asked  following an incident of school violence  are: Why didn’t we see it coming? What  could we have done to spot the warning  signs and intervene before it was too  late?  The legislation I offer today is designed to address one essential component of the school violence crisis: Prevention and intervention. In the coming weeks the Senate will consider a  variety of proposals  to address  the  issues of preventing school violence,  how to manage crises when they occur,  and how to punish those who engage in  violence in our schools. I look forward  to working with our colleagues to develop  a  comprehensive  approach  to  school violence which incorporates this  legislation and acknowledges the need  for prevention and intervention efforts.  Out of respect  for the  families  in  Littleton and deference to the majority  leader’s request that we not take up          ",1999
293,Senate,106,0.23,185,1999-05-06,Mr. CAMPBELL.,"  Mr.  President,  today I introduce amendments to the  Indian Self-Determination  and Education  Assistance  Act  of  1975  (‘‘ISDEA’’) to provide for greater tribal  self-governance for the programs and  services of the Department of Health  and Human Services (‘‘HHS’’).  Over  the  years  the  poor  circumstances and conditions of Native  Americans have been compounded by  vacillating federal policies and federal  domination of matters affecting Indian  people.  This situation began to change  in  1970, when President Nixon delivered  his now-famous ‘‘Message to Congress  on Indian Affairs’’, which laid the foundation for a more enlightened federal  Indian policy. This new policy allowed  tribes to forge their own destiny and  challenged the federal government to  find new, innovative ways to administer Indian programs.  Because of the tangible benefits it  has brought, this shift away from federal  domination  and  toward  Indian  self-determination has been supported  by every Administration since 1970.  Indian  self-determination  fosters  strong tribal governments and reservation economies. This policy has encouraged tribes to assume more responsibility for their own affairs, caused a reduction in the federal bureaucracy and,  most importantly, improved the quality of services to tribal members.  The most definitive expression of the  policy change brought about by President Nixon was the ISDEA which authorized tribes to negotiate and enter  into agreements with the U.S. to assume control over and operate federal  programs which had been previously  administered by federal employees.  In the years after enactment of the  ISDEA,  Congress  expanded  on  the  framework by enacting  tribal  ‘‘self-  governance’’ laws which created a demonstration  project  that  authorized  tribes to enter into ‘‘compacts’’ with  the U.S., so that they may administer  an array of services.  The principles of the ISDEA are similar to those of block granting to the  states. Instead of the federal government micro-managing  Indian  tribes,  the federal government is contracting  with tribes to perform those functions.  Like states, tribes know best which  governmental  programs  best  serve  their communities and how programs  should be delivered. In short, the concept of local administration of federal  dollars works.  By continuing to build tribal capacity and expertise in the administration  of programs and services previously administered by employees of the Department of the Interior and the HHS, the  Act has forged stronger tribal governments and economies and  led  to a  smaller federal presence in Indian affairs.  The current self governance  ‘‘demonstration project’’ in health care involves approximately  50  tribes. The  legislation I introduce today builds on  these successes, makes the self governance program permanent and expands  an array of eligible functions available  for tribal self governance to  include  the many programs, services and activities of the HHS, such as clinical  services, public health nursing, mental  health,  substance abuse, community  health  representatives,  and  dental  health.  The bill ensures continued participation by the tribes now participating in  the self governance project, and provides for participation by an additional  50 tribes or tribal organizations annually.  This  is  far  from a  ‘‘no-strings attached’’ approach to federal programs.  To participate,  tribes must  successfully complete legal and accounting requirements, as well as demonstrate financial stability and financial management capability.  This  legislation also addresses the  issue of which functions may be performed by tribes and which may not.  This bill differentiates between those  services and activities that are federal,  and therefore ineligible for tribal performance  through  a  self-governance  compact, and those that are not inherently federal, and therefore eligible for  tribal performance through a self-governance compact.  To track the progress made in raising  the health status of Indians, the bill requires participating tribes to report  health-related data to the Secretary so  that an accurate picture of  Indian  health can be drawn.

294,Senate,106,0.366,206,1999-05-06,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, it gives  me great pleasure to rise, as I have in  years past, in support of what has become an annual resolution to designate  the third week of October—this year—  the week of October 17th—as National  Character Counts Week.  The importance of character to the  future of our nation cannot be overemphasized. As  the noted  educator,  George  S.  Benson,  once  observed,  ‘‘Great ideals and principles do not live  from generation to generation because  they are right, nor even because they  have been carefully legislated. Ideals  and principles continue from generation to generation only when they are  built  into the hearts of children as  they grow up.’’  There was a time when great ideals  and principles were  ‘‘built  into  the  hearts of children’’ as a matter of  course—in  every  school  house,  and  classroom, all across our great land; a  time when we believed that to educate  a man in mind and not in morals, as  Teddy Roosevelt put it, was to educate  a menace of society.  Sadly, this is no longer the case.  Not only do many schools no longer  teach children the difference between  good and evil, right and wrong, they  convey the philosophy that there is no  difference; that it is all a matter of  choice, and that choice—not truth—or  justice—or responsibility, is the ultimate object of democracy.  That is the greatest threat to democracy any nation can  face—but especially ours. For America is a nation  founded on principle, forged by courage, and strengthened by every succeeding generation that has been unwilling to let those principles or that  courage be diminished.  Yet, in many ways, moral leadership  is more important now than it has ever  been before. The 21st century will hold  many challenges that will require the  most of us. And the greatest of those  challenges will be moral not economic:  cloning,  genetics,  bioengineering;  human rights vs. economic prosperity?  right to life or right to die?  They are challenges that will require  principle, demand character.  Who will be the leaders of tomorrow,  and will they be up to the task? In  many ways, the answer is up to us.  Which is why I have worked to promote character development  in elementary and secondary education, and  urged our Nation’s colleges and universities to affirm character development  as a primary goal of higher education.  It is also why I am also proud to support the Character Counts movement,  and why I have done so every year  since I’ve been in the United States  Senate.  In 1995, in the very first quarter of  my first term, I became a member of  the bipartisan Character Counts Working Group—a coalition of Senators organized to affirm and support the millions of Americans who still believe  that character counts, that it should  be not just touted but taught, in homes  and churches, certainly, but also  in  schools across America.  It is why I have annually co-sponsored this Senate resolution to designate the third week of October as National Character Counts Week. And it  is why I am proud to say that, in Tennessee, Character Counts!  is  flourishing.  Mr.  President,  Character  Counts!  teaches  children  respect,  responsibility, trust, caring and citizenship. It  teaches them the value of virtue, the  importance of character. It renews not  only the promises of our past, but our  faith in the future.  In Knoxville, Tennessee  alone,  38  schools so far have received Character  Counts! training. One of them, Norwood Elementary, asked students to  write essays about the importance of  character.  Another, Farragut Primary School,  held an assembly for parents and kids  that highlighted ways to be good citizens.  In Johnson City, a little boy and his  friends at Cherokee Elementary School  built a ramp at the home of a boy with  a disability so he could get in and out  safely in his wheelchair.  In Hamblin County, I met a fourth  grader—a  little  girl  named  Heidi  Shackleford—who was the first student  to make her school’s Character Counts!  ‘‘Wall of Fame.’’  What did she do to earn such an  honor? She  found a $100 bill  in her  school, but rather than stick it in her  pocket, she turned it in to her teacher  because  she  learned—through Character Counts education—why it is important to do the right thing.  In Sullivan County—where the Character Counts! program began in Tennessee—students at the Indian Springs  Elementary School make monthly visits to a grandmother they adopted at a  Kingsport nursing home.  They have also experienced 25 percent reduction in juvenile crime since  the Character Counts! program began—  an  improvement  they  attribute  directly to the impact the program has  had on the region.  These are just a few examples of how  Tennessee children are  learning  the  value of virtue, the importance of character, and how their communities have  benefitted as a result.  It has been my honor to support all  of  these  efforts—to  help Tennessee  communities kick-off new programs,  and to encourage and support those already in place.  But it is not enough to promote this  program in Tennessee, or New Mexico,  or in any one of the other states that  have taken up the challenge.  We must promote the development of  character  in  every  state,  in  every  school, in every city in America. For if  education is the most important gift  we can give to the future, then character education is doubly so.  The job of instilling character in the  hearts of America’s children has always been an important one. But as the  tragic violence in Littleton and other  cities recently have shown us, it has  never been more important than it is  today.  We are justifiably proud of the liberty we enjoy as Americans. But as the  wise  British  statesman,  Edmund  Burke, once observed, What is liberty  without virtue? It is the greatest of all  possible evils, for it is folly, vice and  madness without tuition or restraint.  We must take every opportunity to  teach our children the difference between right and wrong, to sort out with  them, what to value, and what to reject  from among  the vast array of  choices made possible by our freedom.  We must all, young and old, rich and  poor, Democrat and Republican, work  together to sow the seeds of character  into the hearts of every young American so that together we can give our  children and our country one of the  greatest gifts any democratic nation  can bestow—the assurance that character does count.  f  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED  FINANCIAL SERVICES  MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999  SANTORUM (AND BUNNING)  AMENDMENT NO. 307  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr.  BUNNING) proposed an amendment to  the bill (S. 900) to enhance competition  in the financial services industry by  providing a prudential framework for  the  affiliation  of  banks,  securities  firms, insurance companies, and other  financial  service  providers,  and  for  other purposes; as follows:  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:44 Nov 01, 2013 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00098 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:(cid:1)999SENATE\S06MY9.REC S06MY9 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",1999
295,Senate,106,-0.262,220,1999-05-06,Mr. TORRICELLI.," Mr. President, I  rise today to recognize Mayor Gerald  A. Calabrese of Cliffside Park, New Jersey as he is honored for a lifetime of  distinguished service to the citizens of  his community, county, and state by  the Temple Israel Community Center,  celebrating its 75th anniversary.  Gerry began his career in public service by enlisting in the Navy and serving his country during World War II.  After returning to the United States,  Gerry turned his  focus to education  and  entered  St.  John’s University  where he was chosen as an All-American for basketball. Upon graduation,  he continued playing basketball in the  National Basketball Association  for  the Syracuse Nationals.  Gerry retired from his sports career  and was quick to enter  into public  service as he was elected to the Cliffside Park Borough Council in 1955. In  1959, Gerry was elected to his first term  as the mayor of Cliffside Park, a post  he has  retained  for  the past  forty  years. During his tenure, Gerry has  been always ready and willing to meet  with his constituents and  listen  to  their concerns. He has raised the bar in  constituent services, as he has always  been ready and willing to help those in  need. Continuing in this vein, Gerry  served on the Bergen County Board of  Freeholders from 1975 to 1985, as Bergen County Democratic Chairman from  1991 to 1998, the New Jersey Delegation  to the National Democratic Convention  in 1988 and 1992, on the New Jersey  Board of Public Utilities from 1960 to  1987, and on the 1992 New Jersey Congressional Re-Districting Committee.  Gerry Calabrese is respected by all in  and around his community and his activities extend beyond his public service career. He is a life member of the  PBA Local 96, N.J. State Association of  Chiefs of Police, Cliffside Park Little  League, Polish American Democratic  Club. Hackensack Unico and Cliffside  Park B’nai B’rith named him ‘‘Man of  the Year.’’  Mayor Calabrese is a legendary public servant in New Jersey and is most  deserving of this distinguished honor. I  am proud to recognize Gerry and his  many years of distinguished service.∑  CHRIST THE KING CATHOLIC  SCHOOL  ∑",1999
296,Senate,106,0.439,220,1999-05-06,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, I  rise today to commend the fifth grade  class  at Christ  the King Catholic  School in Wichita, Kansas. On May 6,  1999, these students will attend the  Drug Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.)  Program’s graduation ceremony.  These students, under the guidance  of Officer John Crane and their teacher  Ms. Sylvia Eckberg,  completed  the  D.A.R.E. program’s 17 week course. At  a  time  when  our  students  are  bombarded daily with temptations and  harmful messages, it is refreshing to  know that there are many students  willing to serve as role models for others by leading drug free lives.  Unfortunately, there are many young  people in our country addicted to illegal drugs. Programs such as the Safe  and Drug Free School program and  D.A.R.E. help to encourage students to  stay off drugs. However, this  is not  enough. In order to win the battle over  illegal drug use,  it will take courageous students, such as this fifth grade  class, to make the commitment to live  drug free lives despite pressure from  other individuals.  Therefore, I am proud to recognize  the students of Ms. Eckberg’s class at  Christ the King Catholic School  for  their commitment to living drug free  and serving as role models for young  people in Kansas and throughout the  nation.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO PLAINFIELD, CT ON  ITS 300TH ANNIVERSARY  ∑",1999
297,,106,-0.491,227,1999-05-06,Mr. SERRANO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Walden Robert Cassotto for all the joy that he gave to the world through his talent, music, and generosity. He will be honored on his birthday, May 14. Known as Bobby Darin, Walden Robert Cassotto was born  in Harlem on May 14, 1936. For most of his young life he lived at 629 East 135th Street  in  the Bronx. He attended PS 43 and Elijah D. Clark Junior and graduated  from  the Bronx High School of Science in January 1953, at the tender age of 16. Darin’s first paying musical job was at a school dance at Bronx Science. For their performance, Bob and his band mates were reportedly paid ‘‘twenty cents and a stick of gum each,’’ a  rather  inauspicious start  to what would turn out to be a brilliant career. Just a few years out of high school, Bobby Darin would find fame and fortune. Mr. Speaker, between the ages of 8 and 12, Bobby suffered of rheumatic fever four times. In  those days,  there was no effective  treatment for the disease. During one of his bouts with the illness, Bobby overheard the doctor tell his mother that he wouldn’t live to see his 16th birthday. From then on, the young man became driven  to succeed. He wanted desperately to leave his mark on the world. Blessed  with  talent  and  determination, Bobby Darin would see his dream come to fruition. With his musical gifts, and his intuitive acting ability, and by  the sheer  force of his personality, Bobby Darin did indeed become a legend in his own time. On December 2, 1959, Darin was the subject of Ralph Edwards’  ‘‘This  is Your Life.’’ One of  the gifts bestowed upon Bobby  that night was  the establishment of The Bobby Darin Award at Bronx Science—a medal presented to outstanding music students at Bobby’s old high school until  it  lapsed  in 1965. Sadly, on December 20, 1973, at the age of 37, Bobby Darin passed away following heart surgery. He left a son, Dodd. Mr. Speaker, for me, Bobby Darin was more than a great singer. He added great musical joy to my world with his style and grace, the lyrics of his songs, and his music. His  first major hit came in 1958 with ‘‘Splish Splash’’ and ‘‘Mack the Knife’’ which exploded onto the charts,  rocketing  to number 1, and stayed there for months. Bobby  inspired me and  so many other young people from the Bronx. He had a remarkable passion for life, tenacity to accomplish what he was set  to do, great courage and sensitivity. I can remember how proud we were in the Bronx to know that he came from our own Borough. Mr. Speaker, May 14, 1999 has been proclaimed ‘‘Bobby Darin Day’’ in the Bronx by Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer and, at the Bronx Science Spring Concert, the school’s alumni association will  revive  the Bobby Darin award as a scholarship for talented music students. What a fitting tribute. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to a great American artist and in wishing the Bobby Darin Award Committee continued success. f HONORING AZTECA BOXING TEAM HON. DALE E.

298,,106,-0.39,234,1999-05-06,Mr. MEEHAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I ask unanimous consent  to  insert  the  following  in  the RECORD. Today, I have the privilege of reintroducing legislation that honors the legacy of Paul E. Tsongas, one of  the outstanding  leaders of our  time  from Massachusetts.  I must commend a good friend of mine and former colleague, Joe P. Kennedy II, for sponsoring this legislation in the 105th Congress. In the 106th Congress,  I commit myself  to ensuring  the passage of  the Paul E. Tsongas Fellowship Act to serve as a lasting memorial to this great man. Always a visionary, Paul Tsongas dedicated himself to strengthening our nation’s economy through  technological  innovation  and  protecting the environment for future generations. As the inheritor of Tsongas’ seat in the House of Representatives, I can think of no more fitting tribute to his legacy than to establish in his name doctoral fellowships for the study of the global energy and environmental challenges of the 21st century. Many in Congress remember Paul Tsongas as an often solitary voice of caution, warning about saddling our children and our children’s children with a mountain of debt. But his vision did not begin and end with budget deficits. In announcing his candidacy for the Presidency  in 1992, he outlined a much broader conception of  intergenerational responsibility, saying ‘‘Just as we reach back to our ancestors  for our  fundamental values, so we, as guardians of that legacy, must reach ahead to our children and their children * * * That sense of sacredness, must begin with a reverence for this earth. This land, this water, this air, this planet—this is our legacy to our young.’’ Paul spent much of his career  in public service making  this vision of  resource conservation a reality. He not only restored a rundown neighborhood park in our hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts, but he also established the first urban park in our city. He also led efforts to preserve the historic lands and water of Walden Woods and helped to create the Cape Cod Commission, which is dedicated to protecting our open space. Paul’s concern for the environment did not end in Massachusetts, however. He was a national leader in securing the enactment of the Alaska Lands Act of 1980, a law that essentially doubled  the size of our National Park and Wildlife Refuge Systems. Tsongas understood the value of investing in human resources, as well. He often articulated the need to foster scientific achievement and  innovation, which he saw as critical  to keeping our nation’s economy strong. Our nation needs a pool of scientists and engineers with the intellect of Einstein and the public spirit and vision of Paul Tsongas to surmount  the environmental and energy challenges posed by the 21st century. Towards that end, the Paul E. Tsongas Fellowship Act would allow aspiring physicists, chemists, mathematicians, and computer scientists to enhance their skills through graduate education so they may become the pioneers of tomorrow. Furthermore, I am convinced that the fellowships in Tsongas’ name will elicit a strong sense of intergenerational responsibility among the recipients. Mr. Speaker, Paul Tsongas serves as a great inspiration to individuals who will dedicate their lives to advancing technology and environmental protection. A wise investment in our country’s future, the Paul E. Tsongas Fellowship Act honors the memory of one of the finest persons ever to serve this institution. f RECOGNIZING THE FIRST WEEK IN MAY  AS  NATIONAL  ARSON AWARENESS WEEK HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE OFDELAWARE INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 6, 1999 ",1999
299,,106,0.229,234,1999-05-06,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Arson Awareness Week and to encourage all Americans to join in the crusade against arson. Each year hundreds of lives are lost and billions of dollars of property are damaged by arsonists.  In 1997 alone, arsonists killed an estimated 500 Americans and  inflicted direct property damage  totaling more than  two billion dollars. One of every  four fires—some 500,000 that occur in the United States each year—result from arson. Arson is the second leading cause of death by fire in the United States,  topped only by smoking. Unfortunately,  the pain and horror of most arson occurrences are felt in residential communities. Each year, more than 90 percent of all civilian deaths and suspicious structural fires  typically occur  in homes. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, an especially sobering  fact of arson-related incidents is that firefighters lost their lives fighting these intentionally-set fires. There are steps each of us can take to prevent arson. First, owners of  facant buildings should secure them to prevent vandals from setting fires for excitement. Second, parents of young children who exhibit a propensity  to play with fire can call their local fire departments for a referral to a trained juvenile fire starter intervention program that will assist the ",1999
300,,106,-0.509,241,1999-05-06,Mr. NADLER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  the  first annual Memorial Day for  the  Gay,  Lesbian,  Bisexual  and Transgender community. This special day has been established to remember the many who have lost their lives due to killings, beatings, and  suicides  that have  resulted  from  the homophobic attitude prevalent  in our society and throughout history. Every year, on the anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising, the world commemorates Yom Hashoah or the Day of Remembrance for the Holocaust. Although  several museums throughout the United States and Europe include exhibits recalling the homosexual experience during the Nazi era, most Yom Hashoah services  fail  to mention  that part of Hitler’s reign of terror was the systematic attempt to eliminate homosexuals from Germany. It is estimated that, under his plan, tens of thousands of homosexuals were arrested and thousands were confined to death camps along with others he deemed ‘‘undesirable.’’ Today’s solemn remembrance  is part of an effort  to remove the veil of silence about this tragic history of persecution and killing, underscore the seemingly endless chain of hate crimes, and provide education aimed at eradicating  intolerance and violence against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender persons. I salute Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, the Church of  the Holy Apostles,  the  International Association of Lesbian and Gay Children of Holocaust Survivors and  the many other  religious and community organizations that have joined in coalition to cosponsor today’s solemn commemoration of  the many lives lost as a result of a national reaction to homophobia. May their lives serve as reminders of  the horrors of prejudicial acts of  this kind. Let us honor their memory by committing ourselves to ending bigotry toward all people regardless of who they are or who they love. f TRIBUTE TO PETER MARONE HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.

301,,106,-0.402,241,1999-05-06,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, on Friday, May 7, 1999, the Ocean County, NJ, Democratic Party will pay tribute to Peter A. Marone on the occasion of his retirement as Assistant Supervisor and Investigations Coordinator of the Ocean County Board of Elections. Mr. Marone has served in this post since 1979. Peter Marone has been a leader in political, civic and community affairs in Ocean County for as  long as most area residents can remember. He was a member of  the Point Pleasant Borough Governing Body  for  three decades (the 1970’s, 1980’s and 1990’s), including a term as mayor from 1979–1982, and two periods of service as a Councilman, from 1974–78 and 1989–91. He also was a member of the Point Pleasant Planning Board from 1979–82, and he served as Acting Administrator of the Borough from 1979–82. In 1976, he was appointed by former New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne  to  the Open Access Public Beaches Study Commission. He has been a loyal and active member of the Ocean County Democratic Committee,  serving  as Treasurer and Sergeant-at-Arms  from 1985– 1999. He also currently serves as a New Jersey State Committeeman. Peter Marone’s service  to his community and our country goes back decades. A New Jersey native, Mr. Marone served in the Korean War from 1948–52, and is a Life Member of the Disabled American Veterans. He is a member of the Chosin Few (Korea–1950) Exclusive Fraternity, and has been decorated with  the Japan Occupation Ribbon and  the Korean Campaign Ribbon with  five bronze stars. A past Senior Vice Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, he is a member of VFW Post 4715, and American Legion Post 196. He is also a member of the Loyal Order of Moose. Peter and Doris Marone have been married 42 years, and  they have  three children. A communicant of St. Martha’s Roman Catholic Church in Point Pleasant, Peter enjoys a number of activities besides politics—but he enjoys nothing more than his seven grandchildren. As his friends and colleagues in the Ocean County  Democrats  pay  tribute  to  Peter Marone, I want to add my voice to all those wishing him well and  thanking him  for so many years of steadfast service, solid leadership and true dedication to his town, county, state and nation. f CONSTITUENT COMMENTS ON CHANNEL ONE HON.

302,,106,0.543,241,1999-05-06,Mr. HILLEARY.," Mr. Speaker, one of my primary concerns, as a member of  the House Education and  the Workforce Committee,  is the education of our children. In this regard, we are always looking for new creative ways to improve our educational system. More and more, the private sector is providing teachers and schools with these creative ways to help our children learn. I am pleased to commend the informative feedback given by one of my constituents as a result of his  first hand observation of  the Channel One experience in Manchester, TN. Gary Dyer is the Director of Accountability and Technology of  the Manchester City Schools. His letter to Mr. Jeff Ballabon, Executive V.P. for Public Affairs  for  the Channel One Network, is as follows: DEARMR. BALLABON: It is my pleasure to write to you concerning this school district’s experience with Channel One. We have been a  part  of  the  Channel One  family  at Westwood Junior High School since 1991. During this time, our experience with the Channel One Network has been very positive. As Director of Accountability/Technology, I have had the opportunity to be in the school on numerous occasions during the Channel One broadcast. I have personally observed that the students are very attentive during this broadcast and that the teachers have used the broadcast material to supplement and  enrich  their  instruction  over  these years. I have not heard of one negative comment about Channel One  from  students, teachers, or parents. In addition to providing televisions for most of our classrooms, Channel One has provided hours of current, relevant, and timely information. Channel One is an excellent program, and the Manchester City School District is pleased to be a member of the Channel One family. Sincerely, GARYW.

303,House,106,0.316,2,1999-05-14,Mr. EHLERS.," Mr. Speaker, I have been in the Congress just a bit over 5 years now, and what has impressed me is the breadth of issues we deal with and the number of troubles that we constantly  are  called  to  address, whether in this Nation or abroad. Some of them are heartbreaking. Right now of course we have the situation in Kosovo, with over half a million and perhaps as many as a million refugees within Kosovo and outside its borders. It is heartbreaking to watch these people, to meet them, to talk to them. We have had similar situations  in Bosnia, where  approximately  300,000 were killed  in  ethnic  cleansing;  in Haiti with the difficulties there; currently  in  the Sudan, with approximately 2 million people dead from either warfare or starvation and the situation getting worse. Even in our Nation we have problems, whether  it  is the shooting  in Littleton or a tornado in Oklahoma. Sometimes it is easy to get discouraged. But one thing that heartens me is this Nation and  its  faith  in this country and its faith in God. We see evidences of that over and over again as we unite together to face adversity. We do not engage in ethnic cleansing in this country. We try to learn about each other, to accommodate to each other, to help each other. We do not argue about our religions; we discuss them. We try to express our faith in the manner we best know how. I believe that we set an example for many others, and I do thank every day the founders of this Nation and the God who guided them in the founding and forming of this Nation. f ADJOURNMENT TO MONDAY, MAY 17, 1999 ",1999

KVEC is a  locally-owned and operated station  featuring  local news and  talk show hosts who provide a  forum of  lively discussion of  local issues as well as interesting and useful information on a wide range of topics. As such, KVEC provides an invaluable service to its listeners  from  throughout San  Luis Obispo County. As a frequent guest on the Dave Congalton Show, I have enjoyed the opportunity to hear from KVEC’s  listeners on a wide array of issues. I know that for many of the station’s regular  listeners,  on-air  hosts  like  Dave Congalton and Bill Benica are considered almost members of the family.

307,,106,-0.402,121,1999-05-14,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of bipartisan legislation that I am introducing  with  Representatives  SANDLIN, LAHOOD, and 17 of my colleagues. The Tax Fairness for the States Act of 1999 will restore millions of dollars of lost revenue for the states, and establish an incentive program for those Native Americans who play by the rules. The  Supreme  Court  has  continuously upheld the states’ power to levy taxes on nontribal members within Native American Tribal Trust Lands. The problem that remains, however, is the mechanism to collect these taxes. Our bipartisan measure would solve this problem. The Tax Fairness for the States Act would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate rules to remove those Native Americans lands from the Tribal Trust on which a retail establishment exists that is not collecting the proper state excise  taxes. This  is not a discriminatory piece of tax legislation aimed at harming Native Americans. Rather, it focuses on the collection of excise taxes that, according to the Supreme Court, should have been collected  in  the  first place. This  legislation does not affect  transactions between  tribal members; it would only impact those retail establishments that are not collecting and passing on these legal taxes on non-tribal members. The Tax Fairness Act would protect  the rights of Native Americans by  requiring  the Secretary of the Interior to promptly notify any tribe  that  is under  investigation  for not  forwarding applicable state taxes and gives them a chance to respond. This notification would set out the time and manner in which a tribe has to answer the allegations, including a 90day comment period in which interested parties could submit statements and request a formal hearing before the Department of the Interior. These important provisions will ensure due process for all tribal members. Furthermore, our legislation contains incentives for tribes who operate establishments in accordance with the law. The Tax Fairness bill awards Native Americans who play by  the rules by giving priority among Native American tribes competing  for  federal grants  to  those tribes  that can certify  their compliance with state law. This measure ensures equity in the process of state  taxation. This  is not about Native American sovereignty, nor is it about discrimination. This measure will give back the hundreds of millions of dollars that states lose annually because these taxes are not collected. Support this measure, support tax equity for the states. f IN SUPPORT OF NATIONAL POLICE WEEK HON. JACK QUINN OFNEWYORK INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 13, 1999 ",1999

As you know,  in 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed Public Law 87–726, designating May 15 as Peace Officers’ Memorial Day, and the week in which it falls as National Police Week. During this week, we not only pay tribute to the brave men and women who have given their lives in service to our community, but we show our unending gratitutde to the police officers who daily risk their lives for our protection. It is important that we all know and understand the problems, duties and responsibilities of our police department, and that members of our police department recognize their duty to safeguarding  life and property, by protecting them against violence or disorder, and by protecting the innocent against deception and the weak against oppression. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call upon all citizens of Western New York and  the Nation, and upon all patriotic, civic, and educational organizations to observe this week as National Police Week, and  join  in commemoration of ",1999
309,,106,0.357,128,1999-05-14,Mr. NETHERCUTT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today  in support of National Police Week. There have been ceremonies all around our country this week to recognize the service and dedication  the men and women of  law enforcement provide our community. In my own district, there will be a Law Enforcement Appreciation Breakfast this Friday. Unfortunately, National Police Week  is no joyous occasion. 158 peace officers killed in the line of duty this past year. It is important to note that the U.S. lost just a few more men and women during  the entire Persian Gulf War. To date, there have been over 15,000 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. Virtually every community has lost someone special to it. Mr. Speaker, each one of the heroes has stories to tell: of community service, dedication to job, and love for family. For the families and fellow officers, this week serves as a painful reminder  that  their  lives will never be  the same. We will put their loved one’s name on a memorial wall and that is a good thing, but we shall never fully appreciate their grief. Our pledge to them should be that we will continue the work toward a safe community that their loved one sought and died to give us. There are over 700,000 law enforcement officers at every  level of government who put their  life and mental well-being on  the  line every day  to protect our  community  from forces that wish to undermine our safety. They deserve recognition as well this week. Law enforcement officers encounter every day  the part of society that most of us are unwilling to confront. What is particularly tragic is many of them face violence or the threat of violence themselves and then face unfair criticism by individuals who either have no idea what it’s like on the streets or are unwilling to make the same sacrifice. They are our friends and not our adversaries. Mr. Speaker, National Police Week  is a good beginning  for showing support  for our law enforcement officers. We should show appreciation to them every day by our prayers and words of encouragement. For all Eastern Washington officers,  I personally say  thank you for your dedication and protection of our communities. f THE  POSITIVE  ECONOMIC  CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE CRUISE INDUSTRY HON. CARRIE P.

310,,106,-0.362,128,1999-05-14,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sgt. Heriberto Carattini, a highly decorated 16-year police veteran, who is this year’s American Police Hall of Fame Law Enforcement Officer of the Year. In the early morning hours of February 8, 1998, Sgt. Carattini heroically defused a dangerous situation in which a gunman had taken control of a precinct station, saving the lives of fellow officers. At about 2 a.m. Carattini arrived at Jersey City’s West District station after volunteering to work a second consecutive shift. As he parked his squad car, he heard gunshots. Upon entering the lobby, Carattini saw a desk officer taking cover behind the front desk and heard the shift lieutenant yelling in pain. First, Carattini motioned the uninjured desk officer  to safety,  then made his way  to  the lieutenant, who was bleeding profusely  from two bullet wounds, to the abdomen and thigh. Carattini ended the situation by shooting the gunman once  in  the chest. The  lieutenant, who had been shot with his own gun, eventually recovered, while the gunman was charged with multiple felony counts. The  recipient  of more  than  20  police awards, Carattini has distinguished himself as a top-flight detective. During the same month, his actions as a hostage negotiator were credited with saving seven lives. In addition, the Sergeant has been credited with over 5,000 narcotics arrests. Sergeant Heriberto Carattini is a hero every day, just by performing the duties of a police officer. But the valor he exhibited in saving the lives of his fellow police officers last February 8, deserves the national recognition he has received by being honored by the American Police Hall of Fame. I am sure the entire Congress joins me in thanking Sergeant Carattini for his exceptional service. f IN HONOR OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY HON. CAROLYN B.

On June 12, 1999, the Garza family will convene in Katy, TX, to recognize outstanding family members, including  those who have proudly served  in the United States Armed Forces. The Garza family has entitled their reunion, ‘‘A Century of Pride and Honor.’’ As  the Garza  family gathers  to recognize the service of its family members, it also will celebrate several qualities responsible for the family’s success.

RICHARD E. NEAL OFMASSACHUSETTS INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Friday, May 14, 1999 ",1999
312,,106,-0.416,135,1999-05-14,Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize an impressive milestone in the history of The Milford National Bank and Trust Company. On April 30, 1999, The Milford National Bank and Trust Company began the celebration of the 150th Anniversary of its founding. The theme for this year long celebration, ‘‘Building the Future on a History of Excellence,’’ reflects the long-standing dedication and clear vision of Milford National’s officers. The Milford National Bank and Trust Company is the oldest continually operating bank in Milford and holds one of the oldest national bank charters, still in force, in the country. The bank was founded on April 30, 1849, despite the lingering fear associated with recent financial panic. In 1865, as a response to the National Banking Act of 1864, the bank turned in its state charter and received National Charter 866. As the local economy began to flourish in the early to mid-1900s, The Milford National Bank helped create and sustain the growth of the area for generations of residents and businesses, both small and large. In  the early 1900s, The Milford National Bank  enjoyed  unprecedented  growth  and prosperity. After the closing of two local banks, President, Chairman, and CEO Shelley D. Vincent III made the decision to grow the bank into a full-service commercial bank. Mr. Vincent acquired new branch offices, reorganized his senior management  team, and began a total upgrade of  the bank’s  technology systems. Mr. Vincent passed away  in February 1997 and was succeeded by Mr. Robert J. Lewis, whom he had selected to carry on his vision for the bank. The bank was named ‘‘one of the top three small business lending banks in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’’  in 1997 and has continued to add more services, products, and technological access  to  its  repertoire. For 1999, there are plans to open a fifth banking office in Bellingham and add on-line internet banking for customers. The bank has created The Milford National Bank Charitable Foundation as a means to continue its long-standing support of local charities and civic activities, and awards four college scholarships to area students in memory of Shelley D. Vincent III. Mr. Speaker, The Milford National Bank and Trust Company has been building the future on a history of excellence for 150 years. Its service to the residents and businesses of the Greater Milford area and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has been unyielding and greatly beneficial. Please join me in recognition of the 150th Anniversary of The Milford National Bank and Trust Company, an institution that stands as a shining example of charitable, cultural, and community service. f COMMEMORATING THE INCLUSION OF  SHERIFF  JOSEPH  GIBSON AND SHERIFF EVERETT GIBSON OF WAYNE COUNTY, KENTUCKY, ON  THE  NATIONAL  LAW  ENFORCEMENT  OFFICERS  MEMORIAL HON. HAROLD ROGERS OFKENTUCKY INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Friday, May 14, 1999 ",1999
313,,106,0.332,135,1999-05-14,Mr. ROGERS.," Mr. Speaker, this week in the Nation’s Capital we all stand humbled by the sacrifice of 312 brave Americans. The names of  these Americans will be added  to  thousands of others engraved on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. The panels of the memorial wall contain the names of officers killed  in  the  line of duty, some dating back to the 1800’s. The new names will be added this week at ceremonies here in Washington—a commemoration which  traditionally attracts more than 10,000 police officers and survivors of  fallen officers  from across  the country. On the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial there are stories of gallantry, bravery, sacrifice, honor and duty. There is also the tragic story of Wayne County, Kentucky, whose citizens I represent here in the United States Congress.  The  families  of Wayne County have the sad distinction of losing their county sheriff to violence in late 1946, only to see his successor also shot down  in cold blood over two years later. It’s a tragedy made even more difficult with  the knowledge  that these  two  fine public  servants,  these  two brave law officers, were also brothers. Joseph Gibson was elected Wayne County Sheriff in 1945 by one of the largest majorities ever bestowed on a county official at that time. Elected while in his early 60’s, Sheriff Joseph Gibson was noted for his fairness and determination. It was this determination which led Sheriff Joseph Gibson to his death: a dogged search for a fugitive ultimately led him into the path of a waiting sniper. His death on December 22, 1946, marked the first time a sheriff had been killed in the line of duty in the 146 year history of Wayne County. Joseph Gibson’s younger brother, Everett, took up the responsibility of chief law officer for Wayne County. Right after being sworn into office, Sheriff Everett Gibson continued his brother’s work of seeking out bootleggers and destroying their stills. On July 25, 1949, Sheriff Everett Gibson and Deputy Bill Sexton were  investigating  reports of an  illegal still when  they were ambushed. Sheriff Everett Gibson was shot dead on the spot, but Deputy Sexton, although wounded, escaped. He recovered from his injuries and testified at the trial that convicted the killer and his accomplices. Reporter Mitchell Gregory told the story of Sheriff Joseph Gibson and Sheriff Everett Gibson  this past Wednesday, May 12th,  in  the Wayne County Outlook newspaper of Monticello, Kentucky. I have been encouraged by Outlook editor Melodie Phelps to include the full text of that article in the RECORDand ask for it to be printed at the conclusion of these remarks. I want to extend my congratulations to retired police officer Mark Byers, whose determination resulted in the names of Sheriff Joseph Gibson and Sheriff Everett Gibson being included among the names of the other brave men and women listed on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.

These events happened nearly half a century ago, and we did not write this article with the intention of dredging up hurtful memories  for  family members who may still reside  in Wayne County.

314,,106,0.443,1,1999-05-25,Mr. HASTERT.," On  behalf  of  the elected entire Republican leadership, I rise today to talk about the efforts of the House to respond to the national crisis  surrounding  violence  in  our schools. Last week’s  shooting  in Conyers, Georgia, only reinforced the fears of many parents about the safety of the schools which their children attend. Studies show that our Nation’s schools on average are safer than ever, but average means nothing to the mothers and fathers who send their children to school every day. They want more from us, and we will provide more. Last week the other body passed legislation that responded in part to the situation in our schools. Part of that legislative response included gun control legislation. We support commonsense legislation that keeps guns out of the hands of unsupervised children. We support tightening laws to bring uniformity between gun shows and gun shops. We support instant  background  checks  at  gun shows. We intend to bring these measures to the floor of the House, and I believe they will pass, but passing these measures is only part of the solution. As I said on this floor last week, our children need to learn the differences between right and wrong. They need moral instruction, and they need a culture  that  reinforces positive values that help create a safer and more secure society. What happened  in Littleton, Colorado, and Conyers, Georgia, are genuine national tragedies. It is natural that they should spur us to action, but it is wrong for anyone to simply try to score political points as a result of these tragedies. I take a back seat to no one in this Congress when it comes to a desire to make our schools safer. I specifically spoke about safer schools  from this well in my first speech as Speaker. I taught high school for 16 years before entering public life. My two boys graduated from public high school not that long ago. My wife goes to work every day in a public school, just as she has for the last 33 years. I want her and the children she teaches to be safe. Last week, in consultation with the minority  leadership, we developed a timetable for consideration of a juvenile justice bill that would help make our schools safer. It was a very constructive meeting. I thought we had mapped  out  a  very  responsible, straightforward approach to handling this issue by prompt action of the authorizing committee, not riders on unrelated appropriation bills. Unfortunately,  it appears that despite the best efforts at the leadership level, more partisan elements are continuing to press for quicker, ill-considered action this week. We continue to believe, just as we proposed last week, that we should consider this bill in a timely yet responsible way. In order to responsibly expedite matters, I asked the Committee on the Judiciary to move up its hearing on this issue by 3 weeks. They agreed, and will start hearings this Thursday. I asked the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HYDE) to be prepared to mark up legislation the first week we get back from the Memorial Day district work period so it could be ready for the floor the next week. Again, this was much faster than originally proposed. He has agreed to do so. Later today he and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MCCOLLUM) will announce an outline of our youth violence legislation. This legislation will focus on making our schools and our streets safer by prosecuting those who break the current gun laws. It will keep lawbreakers in jail longer. It will enact a zero tolerance policy for children who bring guns to school, and it will make sure that dangerous juveniles will not be able to buy guns lawfully when they become adults, and that we have open and complete juvenile records to help us keep guns out of their hands. When we consider this  legislation, the House will be able to work its will regarding certain provisions from the Senate package, just as I had assured the minority leader last week. The House will vote on trigger locks, background checks at gun shows, and closing the gun purchasing  loophole. We will expedite this legislation, but we will not force it through the system without the proper consideration of the Committee on the Judiciary. Some of my colleagues, sensing an advantage, may try to go outside of the rules of the House and attach ill-considered riders to  legislation not relevant  to  the  juvenile  justice  issue. That would be a mistake. I know emotions are running high, but let us be honest about this. Even if we did pass legislation this week, it would still be bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

317,House,106,0.282,22,1999-05-25,Mr. DAVIS of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleague from Illinois, Representative CRANE,  for his hard work  in bringing this important legislation forward early on in this Congress. H.R. 1833 will provide the U.S. Customs Service with additional tools to prevent illegal drugs from entering our nation. This is a vital bill that will go a long way in winning the war on drugs but the most valuable asset of any agency is its workforce. Unfortunately, H.R. 1833 also contains a provision which  I believe will seriously harm the morale of our Customs agents and impede our ability to recruit qualified individuals. H.R. 1833 contains a provision  that  restricts  the hours during which customs agents can earn night  shift differential pay  to between  the hours of 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Currently, Customs agents earn night shift differential pay between the hours of 3 p.m. and 8 a.m. The Customs Agency is the only federal agency where employees work a constantly changing shift. For example, employees work days for two weeks, then evenings, then nights. Night shift differential pay is a standard law enforcement benefit and one of the few federal law enforcement benefits extended to Customs agents. If this bill passes the House, we will reduce the amount of pay at Customs agent earns by an average of $96.00 a week or $5000.00 a year. A Customs agent making $40,000 a year will face a reduction in pay of nearly 12%. Do we really want to tell Customs agents that we are only willing to spend more money on desperately needed equipment to fight the war on drugs if they give up a portion of their yearly salary?  I  think not,  this provision sends entirely the wrong message to these brave men and women. Moreover, I have serious concerns that this provision says  to Customs agents  that  they can make up for the lost night shift differential pay due to enhancements in overtime benefits. But in order to earn back lost pay, an individual would be required to work more than forty hours a week. This is simply wrong. We would be  telling  these  federal workers  that they must spend greater and greater amounts of  time away  from  their  family  just  to meet their current needs. Again, this is backwards and contrary to the family values we should be promoting. This provision sends  the wrong message to the indvidiuals who play a significant role in protecting our border and our entire nation from shipments of illegal drugs. During the week of May 10th, a Customs Agent was shot on his way home from work by an individual who had targeted him as a law enforcement official. The Federal Government does not extend most law enforcement officer benefits  to Customs Agents. This bill would  limit one of  the  few  law enforcement benefits that Customs Agents receive. I am greatly disappointed that H.R. 1833 is on the Suspension Calendar today, and that we do not have the opportunity to even offer an amendment that would have removed section 123(b), the new night shift differential pay provisions. I think that Members of this House deserve the opportunity to support this important bill while also supporting our U.S. Customs Agents. Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to thank my colleague, Representative CRANE for all of his work  in bringing H.R. 1833  forward and express my profound disappointment in the currently included night shift differential pay provisions.  I believe we need  to strengthen  the Customs Agency if we are going to stop illegal drugs from entering our Country and we must do all  that we can  to protect our children. However, we must not say to Customs Agents that their tireless efforts are insufficient, and that equipment counts more  than  the personnel. I firmly hope that we can work our differences out when this bill goes to Conference with the Senate. ",1999
318,House,106,0.217,29,1999-05-25,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate a group of courageous individuals and their commitment to freedom and democracy—the thousands of Chinese students and activists who took part in the Tiananmen Square demonstration  in May and June of 1989. I want to thank the chairman of the Congressional Working Group on China, the gentleman  from Virginia  (Mr. WOLF) and  the gentle  lady  from California  (Ms. PELOSI)  for bringing  this  resolution  to  the  floor of  the House so quickly and in such a timely fashion. Days after the June 4th massacre, the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, held a briefing on this event. The pictures we saw, and the stories we heard are some of  the most disturbing pictures of brutality and barbarity I have ever been exposed to. And yet, ten years later the perpetrators of this massacre have not been brought to justice. Hundreds of people are still held in prison for  their  involvement. Thousands more have been jailed since for similar reasons. Far too much time has passed for these cries of democracy to go unheard. The  Chinese  leadership  remains unapologetic about  the events of June 4, 1989,  they continue  to vilify,  imprison and exile these and other brave democracy activists. As  recently as  the beginning of  this month,  Yang  Tao,  a  student  leader  of Tiananmen Square, was picked up  from his house and arrested for calling on the government  to  ‘‘re-evaluate’’  its  position  on  the events of June 1989. Other leaders have been put under house arrest for calling on the government  to apologize  for  the murders and compensate the victims’ families. Radio Free Asia reports in the days following the bombing of the Chinese Embassy, over half of the callers to their talk show were critical of the Chinese Government. The time has come for the Chinese government to take a close look at what happened ten years ago and to apologize to its people. The government cannot continue  its harassment and imprisonment of its citizens who exercise their rights of freedom of speech, expression and religion. The hope and desire for democracy  is still alive. We must do all we can to support it. I stand in strong support of H. Res. 178. ",1999
319,House,106,-0.416,29,1999-05-25,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  I honor the hundreds, if not thousands of Chinese students that were brutally slain on June 4, 1989, by the Communist Chinese authorities. On  that  fateful day  ten years ago,  the best and brighest of a generation perished needlessly and the lives of countless Chinese families were disrupted forever. I commend my colleague NANCYPELOSI for her continuing leadership on China issues and for introducing H. Res. 178, to commemorate the  Tenth Anniversary  of  the  Tiananmen Square massacre. Her efforts insure that the U.S. House of Representatives and the American people will never forget. To all the activists in China fighting today for the freedom of their country, I vow never to forget Tiananmen Square. I remind you that your allies across the globe continue to fight for your universal cause;  to attain  freedom, democracy and human rights for the Chinese people. The Chinese leaders say that they want to bring China into the modern world economy. I say  to  the Chinese  leaders, you can’t have capitalism without  democracy  and  human rights. Capitalism and democracy go hand in hand, you can’t have one without the other. The democratic rights advocated by  these slain students ten years ago are universal, not uniquely western values as the Chinese leadership would have us believe.  Indeed  the blooming of full democracy in Taiwan, Korea, South Africa, Eastern Europe, Russia and many other countries since 1989 proves the universality of democracy and human rights. Ultimately, the values of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will prevail. As that document states, ‘‘All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with  reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.’’ Until that day I will join NANCY PELOSI, many of my colleagues here  in  the House, and countless others around the world in fighting for this just cause.

I speak on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARMEY), the majority leader, as the assistant majority leader today; and I speak on behalf of a young lady from my district, 21-year-old Jennifer, who in 1993 moved from her parents’ suburban home in New York to California. She was in pursuit of her dream. Her mom was lonely for her and sent her a ticket to come home, but she never picked up that ticket. She was never seen again. And this is for Jennifer and for the many tens of thousands of families that need to bring closure and peace of mind. This  important bill, Jennifer’s Law, will help States and the Federal Government partner together to do just that. So I just wanted to announce to the House  that  that will be  introduced today, will be available, and will be brought to the floor of this House as soon as we return from the Memorial Day recess.

323,House,106,-0.353,43,1999-05-25,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise today in support of H.R. 1906, Agriculture Appropriations  for FY 2000.  In particular,  I wish to draw my colleague’s attention to the valuable work being done by the Ultraviolet-B (UV–B) Monitoring Program at Colorado State University. This program provides  information on  the geographical distribution and temporal trends of UVB radiation in the United States. This information is critical to the assessment of the potential impacts of increasing ultraviolet radiation levels on agricultural crops and forests. Specifically, it provides information to the agricultural community and others about the climatological and geographical distribution of UVB irradiance. In a broader sense, the monitoring program supports research  that  increases our understanding of the factors controlling surface UVB irradiance and provides the data necessary for assessing  the  impact of UVB  radiation on human health, ecosystems and materials. Beginning  in 1992, Congress appropriated two million dollars per year in support of this research effort. At  that  level of  funding,  the program was able  to get underway and  to carry  forward some money each year. Recently,  appropriations  have  been  at $1,000,000 annually, which, with  the carry over amounts have been adequate. As of FY 1999,  the carry-over  funds have been exhausted. The President’s  budget  calls  for $1,750,000 to simply continue this program at current funding levels. H.R. 1906 appropriates $1,000,000  for  this program, but  I  remain hopeful that the goal of $1,750,000 can be accommodated during the upcoming conference committee with the other body. Mr. Chairman, since  the discovery of  the Antarctic ozone hole in 1985, I have been personally very concerned about  the  impact of UVB radiation on all of earth’s living systems. This program is surely a step toward understanding and monitoring this significant threat to all of our ecosystems. ",1999
324,House,106,-0.281,43,1999-05-25,Mr. BISHOP.," Mr. Chairman, after experiencing one weather-related disaster after another, the future of production agriculture and family  farming  in middle and south Georgia faces a threat of almost unprecedented proportions. This is not a sudden, overnight crisis. Farmers, bankers, and communities dependent on production agriculture have been  in a crisis mode for some time. Our farmers have faced a threatening situation that has now become even more severe. I have visited farms to meet with farmers all across  the Second District and  to see  firsthand the destruction that has been wrought by the droughts and other disasters which have struck our area.  Indeed,  the University of Georgia has estimated  farmgate value  lost during the past crop year at over $767 million. The bill contains many of  the crucial programs which are needed to restore a vibrant farm economy. It provides $2.3 billion for direct and guaranteed farm operating loans, $647 million more than the current fiscal year. It contains $559 million for direct and guaranteed  farm  ownership  loans,  $49 million more than the current year. Research is the backbone of ag production, and it would be irresponsible for the federal government to abdicate its role in this area. This is why we need to leave all this partisan bickering behind and get on with the business of providing the $836 million for the Agricultural Research Service that is in this bill. For the extension service that is so important to our farmers, this bill has $916 million for Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service activities. There is $71 million for USDA’s Risk Management Agency, which manages the federal crop  insurance program. How else will  the Congress ensure that insurance products that can effectively protect against risk of loss are developed? How will we ever get to the point where  farmers can adequately  recover  their costs of production  following a disaster and pay premiums that are affordable? The bill will fund the $654 million needed for operation of USDA’s Natural Resource Conservation Service. This agency helps farmers conserve,  improve, and sustain  the soil and water on their land for future generations. This bill  includes a $300,000 allocation  to expand research into ways to protect the few consumers who are allergic to peanuts, and thereby to prevent misguided efforts to ban or reduce peanut consumption. Prices for southeast timber are at a record low, and it would be financially damaging to force growers facing thinning-out deadlines to sell their harvested timber on the current market. This  is why  this good bill  includes  language giving farmers an extension until January 1, 2003 for thinning out and selling their timber under the Conservation Reserve Program. I ask my colleagues to let this House do the work expected of us by our farmers. ",1999
325,House,106,0.208,57,1999-05-25,Mr. WALSH.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike  the  requisite  number  of words. Mr. Chairman, I will not take the full 5 minutes. I would just like to make two points. One is that for those who have mentioned in the debate that the farmers are waiting in the fields for us to resolve this issue, I would remind them that this bill does not become law for at least 4 months, regardless of how long this debate goes on. So no one is going to be harmed by this debate except perhaps the patience of the Members who are participating  in  it or whose constituents are listening to it back home. So this is not going to cause any breakdown in USDA or in the delivery of services or anything else. This is next year’s appropriations bill. The second thing is, the gentleman from Oklahoma has every right to offer these amendments, but that does not mean we have to debate every one of them. This could go on for a long, long time. Why do we not just agree that he has his right to bring the amendments and let us vote them down? The committee, the subcommittee, went through the process according to Hoyle. We did the right thing. Let us just vote these amendments down. If we debate every amendment, it could be 4 months before we complete. ",1999
326,,106,0.301,78,1999-05-25,Mr. SKEEN.," Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly,  the Committee  rose; and  the Speaker pro  tempore  (Mr. SHERWOOD) having assumed the chair, Mr. Pease, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1906) making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. f REPORT  ON  RESOLUTION  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R.  150,  EDUCATION  LAND GRANT ACT Mr. SESSIONS, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept.

",1999
327,House,106,-0.288,85,1999-05-25,Mr. ETHERIDGE.," Mr. Speaker,  I think the gentleman from Maryland is absolutely correct. I have often said that children come to public schools across this country, and certainly in my State,  from a number of backgrounds; and they do not all come. This is where I get frustrated. I used to get frustrated at the State level, and I get frustrated here with some of my colleagues when  they want  to  talk about and start criticizing the schools, because when they start doing that, they are criticizing our children. My colleagues have to be careful because schools are children and the professionals that are trying to help them. They come  from a variety of backgrounds, from a variety of experiences. But all of them do not come in top dollar for the same level of knowledge and experiences when they come to school. So they come, as the gentleman says, at different levels. That teacher understood it. What  the  educators  are  talking about, when they say ‘‘I want them to all have As,’’ they are talking about mastery, so they are mastering the subject. There is a difference in learning and mastering. Most of us can get a bit of knowledge on the computer. If we get training here, all of us have computers in our office, and we have staffs to have mastery. A lot of us just have cursory understanding so we can turn it on and retrieve a little bit of information. If we want to get a little bit further, we have to call and get help. What those teachers were saying to the principal and to the gentleman, I want all my children to be able to have mastery on this computer. I want them to be able to use it, not just turn it on and call for help. They want to be able to go and get all the data that it has in it. I have often said that not all of us learn at the same speed. We forget that sometimes. It takes longer for others, and they still get it. If one watches students, if one ever notices, there will be some who we say they are slow. The truth is they are not as interested in school as others. They may not bloom until they get to be sophomores or juniors in high school sometimes. Sometimes it happens even after they leave high school. There are stories, and I am sure there are Members right here on the floor of this House who would say that they went into the military or went somewhere else and came back. Many times, those who came out of the military, they had 2 or 3 years to adjust. All of a sudden, they came home and realized, ‘‘I did not apply myself when I was in school. I really need to settle down and get focused.’’ Today with a lot of young people who go into youth service corps or something else and leave school, and all of a sudden they say, gosh, ‘‘I did not apply myself. I wish somebody would give me a quick kick in the slacks to understand what I needed.’’ That is at that level. But at the early years, where those youngsters are such sponges, and they really do want to  learn. They come with bright eyes. If you watch those little ones, they all have bright eyes. They are  ready  to  learn. They are ready to go. There is something that we are learning more every day about the brain and how much children can learn and their capacities, and we are doing away with a lot of the myths we used to have, because all children can learn. Let me repeat that again. All children. It makes no  difference what  their  economic, their ethnic, where they come from, or where they are going, all children can learn. They can learn at very high levels. They may have different learning styles. Dr. Comer has a great program. We used him a number of times in North Carolina. We had a number of his projects in our State. I think he does just a wonderful job in showing that we need to bring the family nurturing the youngsters. Because  if  a youngster comes in in less than a nurturing background or comes to school hungry, and if someone tells us the child does not come, I can assure my colleagues they can go any place, most places in this country where they will see a child come in on Monday morning, and I am going to break the stereotype here because a lot of folks think when we are talking about youngsters, we are talking about children from economically deprived backgrounds. It may be children who just have not had a chance to eat, and it may be upper middle class neighborhoods many  times,  parents who have the resources. They do not take time to eat, and they grab something from school. Certainly there are those who, after Friday afternoon, who get a regular meal during the week, and Friday is the last really regular warm meal they get until they show back up on Monday morning. My wife works in the child nutrition program in my home county and has for a number of years. She said one can really tell it when school is out for the summer. A lot of the children are reluctant to  leave because they know something  is  going  to  be missing. School is a safe haven for them, but it also provides for them a real nurturing environment. We have had some problems recently in some of our schools. But, by and large,  they are  loving, caring, nurturing places  for people who  really make a difference. We had a program, and I will come back to the question the gentleman raised again in a minute, that we started really in 1992, called Character Education.  It was not unique with us. There is nothing really new under the sun. We borrowed a lot of things. We borrowed this from a professor at Vanderbilt and  from a number of other folks.  But  Character  Education  is about teaching those things that we can all agree on that children ought to know. Rather than add it on as an addon in the classroom, one really teaches it as an integrated part of the curriculum. So in 1995 we got a grant, wrote a project, got a grant from the U.S. Department of Education, and it started in Wake, Cumberland and Mecklenburg Counties, our three larger counties. A lot of other counties, Nash County, Johnston County, Harnett and others picked it up. But what we do in that process is the community goes  through a meeting with parents, and the community says here is some of the basic issues; in this case, this two, four, six, eight, nine issues that they agreed on  in Nash County.  I think Wake  is about the same. Trustworthiness. Most folks will not disagree with that. Respect, responsibility, caring,  fairness, citizenship, perseverance,  courage,  self-discipline. They teach this every single day in some part of the curriculum in every single school. My colleagues say, well, why is that important? When we get bogged down in arguments of whether ",1999

I am not entirely clear, after listening to the Senator, that his description of this amendment is the one that I have. Let us work it out, and if push comes to shove, although I think it is entirely reasonable for a Senator to be allowed to amend his own amendment, if this has caused some concern on the part of both Senators, we can always bring this up  as  a  separate  amendment, which may be the best case. If, in fact, you  say  ‘‘legal,’’ you put  the word ‘‘legal’’ in there, obviously I do not think the President is going to have any obligation to report on anything. In terms of obligation, if I might say so,  if  the Senator will continue  to yield, if Kosovo is not an obligation, I am not standing here on the floor of the Senate. That is my response.

I was in Connecticut yesterday. Because of serious thunderstorm and wind conditions my flight from Connecticut to Washington was delayed for several hours, causing me to miss the vote on the amendment.

334,House,106,-0.378,24,1999-06-07,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 435, the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1999. The bill was passed by the House on February 9 of this year by a vote of 414 to 0. On May 27, the Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent. b1415 The Senate made only two amendments to the bill, neither of which should create concern  for us  in the House. The first is that 8 dyes were deleted from the bill’s duty suspension provisions. These eight provisions were not sought by Members of the House. Accordingly, their deletion under a compromise agreement in the other body should not present any concerns for us. The second change is to make retroactive to May 15 provisions for ensuring the entry of the personal effects of athletes participating in the Women’s Road Cup Soccer Tournament, the Special Olympics, and the 2000 Olympics. As  the  gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. DUNN) mentioned, H.R. 435 is a bipartisan effort representing the collective input of many Members on both sides of the aisle, as well as the administration.  The  U.S.  Customs Service, the Department of Commerce, the U.S. Trade Representative, and the U.S. ITC all have reviewed and commented on this bill to ensure that no domestic producers or other private sector interests would be adversely affected. Public input also has been incorporated into this bill. The provisions of H.R. 435 fall into three categories. First, the bill makes certain clerical corrections to the trade laws, such as amending and updating outdated provisions; Second, the bill contains 112 various duty suspensions and tariff reductions. These suspensions and reductions relate  to duties on certain anti-HIV, AIDS and cancer drugs and duties on chemicals,  raw materials,  and miscellaneous equipment. Suspension of these duties reduces prices  for consumers and improves the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers by reducing their input costs. H.R. 435 also allows for the duty-free entry of equipment and personal effects of  participants  in  the  1999 Special Olympics, the Women’s World Cup, and the 2002 Winter Olympics. Let me just say a word about the efforts here. A number of Members on both sides of the aisle have worked hard to see this provision become law, including the ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means, the gentleman from New York (Mr. RANGEL), another member of  the  committee, the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. THURMAN), and others, such as the  gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. MOAKLEY) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI). Third,  the bill  includes additional tariff and trade provisions, such as authorization  of  custom user  fees  to maintain existing preclearance  services for air and sea passengers arriving from Canada, the Caribbean, and Mexico. These authorizations are essential to maintaining the preclearance services that expedite the processing of passengers at our airports and seaports. Miscellaneous trade provisions include extension of normal  trade  relations with Mongolia. The  small  revenue  loss  resulting from a few provisions in the bill require an offset to meet budgetary requirements. This cost  is offset by a provision in the bill that clarifies the tax treatment of certain corporate restructuring transactions where assets are transferred subject to a liability. The tax treatment under current law of these transactions  is uncertain, and some  taxpayers  are  restructuring transactions to take advantage of this uncertainty. In some cases, taxpayers are claiming tax bases in excess of the value of assets with resulting excessive depreciation deductions. The provision  in the bill would eliminate the uncertainty and tax these transactions by reference to their underlying economics. The provisions of this bill have been thoroughly  reviewed  to  ensure  that they are noncontroversial and do not adversely affect U.S. consumers and U.S. industry. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support its final passage, and I reserve the balance of my time. ",1999
335,Senate,106,-0.319,59,1999-06-07,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, before I  proceed, I thank my colleague  from  Alaska for his very generous remarks.  I will take a few moments to discuss  the DOD appropriations bill for fiscal  year 2000. Let me begin by congratulating our chairman, Senator TEDSTEVENSof Alaska.  To meet our Senate leaders’ desire,  the chairman and his staff expedited  the review and preparation time and  put this bill together. Then, after they  had crafted a very good package, as  you know, we were told to reduce this  package by $3 billion. We had to go  back to the drawing board again.  When one takes  into consideration  how this package was reshaped to meet  those very difficult goals, I believe the  committee has prepared the best bill  that could have been recommended.  First of all, if adopted, it will fulfill  the committee’s No. 1 priority. It will  provide adequate  funding  to  ensure  that our men and women in the armed  services are fairly compensated. It also  will provide sufficient funding so that  they can be well prepared, trained, and  ready to meet the Nation’s requirements.  This  bill  funds  a  4.8-percent  pay  raise, the largest percentage increase  since the early 1980s. This increase is  between 2 and 3 percent more than current forecasts of inflation. The bill also  funds changes in the military retirement system and reforms the pay table  sought by the administration.  The total  funding  in the bill represents an increase of $1.4 billion above  the President’s budget request. In addition to fully funding the needs of our  military personnel, the bill provides  $300 million for additional medical research: As the chairman indicated, $175  million for breast cancer research; $75  million  for prostate cancer research,  and $50 million to cover many of the  high-priority medical  research  programs of interest to the Members.  More than $2.8 billion is added for  procurement  for two more F–16 aircraft, 15 more Black Hawk helicopters,  and a half-billion-dollar downpayment  in the next Marine amphibious assault  ship, the LXD–8.  For research for new technology, the  bill is $2 billion over the President’s request. This  includes $400 million  for  missile defense and related programs.

336,Senate,106,-0.267,66,1999-06-07,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing the ‘‘Lewis and Clark  Expedition Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act.’’ This act authorizes the  U.S. Mint to produce a commemorative  coin honoring the Lewis and Clark Expedition. This is a bill I introduced in  the last Congress and which had the  support of 43 other Senators. The bill is  a companion to one that has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman BEREUTER.  I am introducing this legislation to  ensure that one of America’s finest moments will be  forever memorialized.  The Lewis and Clark Expedition, called  the Corps of Discovery, represents the  finest in American history. The Expedition began  in 1803 when President  Thomas Jefferson  commissioned  the  exploration of  the newly purchased  Louisiana Territory and ended in 1806  with the Expedition’s triumphant return.  When  considering why we  should  commemorate the Expedition, it’s important to recall Thomas Jefferson’s  vision  for America’s  future and his  dedication to expanding not only our  geographic frontiers, but the frontiers  of knowledge as well. Jefferson’s vision  is epitomized by his commissioning of  the Expedition. Further, the Expedition represents a hallmark for peaceful  diplomacy, as demonstrated by  the  friendly relations the Expedition established with the Native Americans it encountered on its journey. These are a  few of the many valuable lessons from  the Expedition that we should carry  forward into the future.  The minting of the Lewis and Clark  Commemorative Coin was endorsed in  the 1998 recommendations of the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory  Committee (CCCAC), which was established by the 102nd Congress. If, as expected,  the coin  sells out, approximately $5 million would be available to  help  fund  bicentennial  celebrations.  After the Treasury Department has recovered all costs of minting this coin,  two-thirds of the surcharge received  would be available  for the National  Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Council’s  commemorative activities.  The Council is an outgrowth of the  Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation, Inc., which was created in 1969  to continue the work of the Lewis and  Clark Trail Commission, established by  Congress in 1964. The remaining one-  third of the surcharge will be donated  to the National Park Service to help  offset  costs  associated  with  their  planned activities to commemorate the  bicentennial.  I feel confident that, with the support of my Senate colleagues and the  passage of  this bill, we can appropriately celebrate a vibrant and historically significant event.

337,Senate,106,0.623,66,1999-06-07,Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.," Mr.  President, I rise to introduce two resolutions concerning our trade relationships with  the People’s Republic of  China and the Socialist Republic of  Vietnam. Last Thursday, June 3, 1999,  the President of the United States formally recommended waivers of the application of the Trade Act of 1974 provisions with respect to China and Vietnam, thereby allowing U.S. taxdollars  to  subsidize  business  operations  in  these countries. In the case of China,  the waiver also allows for continuation  of most-favored-nation  trade  privileges, now known as normal trade relations. Mr. President, there’s very little  that is normal about our relationship  with  these communist countries.  In  short, I think the President’s policy is  seriously flawed and deeply troubling,  especially in view of recent events.  Mr. President, on November 26, 1974,  in its report on the Trade Act, the Senate  Committee  on Finance  stated:  ‘‘The Committee recognizes that segments of the private sector wish the  U.S. Government to provide credits and  investment guarantees, and other conditions before private capital  investments are ventured. The Committee  believes that it is equally reasonable to  establish conditions on all basic human  rights, including the right to emigrate,  before extending broad concessions to  communist countries.’’ The resolutions  I have introduced keep faith with the  original Congressional  intent of  the  Trade Act of 1974. One need only read  the annual State Department Human  Rights Reports on China and Vietnam  to recognize that they have failed to  meet any recognized standards with respect to human rights. Moreover, there  are a myriad of other national security  and  foreign policy  issues concerning  our current relationship with Beijing  and Hanoi—from wholesale espionage  of our nuclear secrets to POW/MIA accounting—which warrant support  for  my resolutions. We should not be putting profit over principle. These waivers from the President should be overturned by the Congress, using the procedures provided  for by  law. Thank  you, Mr. President.  f  ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS  S. 115  At the request of Ms. SNOWE, the  name of the Senator  from Delaware  (Mr. BIDEN) was added as a cosponsor of  S. 115, a bill to require that health  plans provide coverage for a minimum  hospital  stay  for mastectomies and  lymph node dissection for the treatment of breast cancer and coverage for  secondary consultations.

338,,106,0.154,255,1999-06-07,Mr. HOUGHTON.," Mr. Speaker, today I am joined by my colleagues, Messrs. LEVIN, SAM and introducing our bill,  ‘‘International Tax Simplification  for American Competitiveness Act of 1999’’. The world economy  is globalizing at a pace unforseen only a  few years ago. Our trade laws and practices have encouraged  the expansion of U.S. business interests abroad, but our tax policy lags decades behind—in fact, in many cases, our international  tax policy seems  to promote consequences that are contrary to the national interest. In the 1960s, the United States accounted for more than 50 percent of cross-border direct investment. By the mid-1990s, that share had dropped to about 25 percent. Similarly, of the world’s 20 largest corporations (ranked by sales), 18 were U.S.-headquartered in 1960. By the mid-1990s, that number had dropped to eight. The 21,000 foreign affiliates of U.S. multinationals  now  compete  with  about 260,000  foreign  affiliates  of multinationals headquartered in other nations. The declining dominance  of  U.S.-headquartered  multinationals is dramatically illustrated by the recent acquisitions of Amoco by British Petroleum, the acquisition of Chrysler by DaimlerBenz,  the acquisition of Bankers Trust by Deutsche Bank, and the acquisition of Case by New Holland. These mergers have the effect of converting U.S. multinationals  to  foreign-headquartered companies. Ironically, despite the decline of U.S. dominance of world markets, the U.S. economy is far more dependent on foreign direct investment than ever before. In the 1960s, foreign operations averaged just 7.5 percent of U.S. corporate net  income. By contrast, over  the 1990–97 period, foreign earnings represented 17.7 percent of all U.S. corporate net income. Over the last three decades, the U.S. share of the world’s export market has declined. In 1960, one of every six dollars of world exports originated  from  the United States. By 1996, the United States supplied only one of every nine dollars of world export sales. Despite a 30 percent loss in world export market share, the U.S. economy now depends on exports to a much greater degree. During  the 1960s, only 3.2 percent of national income was attributable  to exports, compared  to 7.5 percent over the 1990–97 period. Foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies play a critical  role  in boosting U.S. exports—by marketing,  distributing,  and  finishing U.S. products in foreign markets. U.S. Commerce Department data  show  that  in 1996 U.S. mulitnational companies were  involved  in 65 percent of all U.S. merchandise export sales. In the 1960s, the foreign operations of U.S. companies were sometimes viewed as disconnected from the U.S. economy or, worse, as competing with domestic production and jobs. In  today’s highly  integrated global economy, economic evidence points  to a positive correlation between U.S. investment abroad and U.S. exports. At the end of the 20th century, we confront an economy in which U.S. multinationals face far greater competition in global markets, yet rely on these markets for a much larger share of profits and sales, than was the case even a few years ago. In light of these changed circumstances, the effects of tax policy on the competitiveness of U.S. companies operating abroad  is  potentially  of  far  greater  consequence today than was formerly the case. As we begin the process of re-examining in fundamental ways our income tax system, we believe  it  imperative  to address  the area of international taxation. In an Internal Revenue Code  stuffed with  eye-glazing  complexity, there  is probably no area  that contains as many difficult and complicated rules as international  taxation. Further,  I  cannot  stress enough  the  importance of continued discussion between the Congress and Treasury of simplifying our  international  tax  laws; and  in making more substantial progress in regard to eliminating particular anomalies such as with the allocation of interest expense between domestic and  foreign source  income  for computation of the foreign tax credit or in regard to how our antiquated tax rules deal with new integrated trade areas such as the European Union.

339,,106,0.316,262,1999-06-07,Mr. RAMSTAD.," Mr. Speaker, new advances in medical technology are improving the lives of millions of Americans every day: New implantable devices are restoring and repairing ailing organs. New diagnostics are permitting rapid detection of life-threatening diseases and allowing physicians  to peer  inside  the human body without surgery. Miniature surgical devices are allowing patients to recover more quickly and new technologies are empowering patients to monitor and test their conditions from home and reduce or eliminate pain. Yet many of  these  life-saving and  life-enhancing  technologies  remain unavailable  to the people who need  them most, America’s nearly 40 million Medicare beneficiaries. This is because of  the complex,  interwoven systems that Medicare uses to evaluate, approve and pay for new medical technologies. That’s why I am introducing ‘‘The Medicare Patient Access  to Technology Act’’  to make targeted adjustments in the technical methods and systems that Medicare uses to adopt and pay for new medical products. By correcting and coordinating the payment levels and identification codes, the bill will improve access to needed therapies for millions of Medicare patients, both today and in the future. As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA)  reviews medical technologies to ensure that they are ‘‘safe and effective.’’ After passing  through FDA, such technologies must also be deemed  ‘‘reasonable and necessary’’ by HCFA for them to be integrated  into  the portfolio of services  that Medicare makes available to its beneficiaries. After being approved  for coverage,  technologies must receive a ‘‘procedure code,’’ a four or  five digit  identifying code  that health care providers use in submitting claims to payers. Finally, Medicare must set a payment level for each technology and treatment through another reimbursement system designed for reimbursing hospitals, physicians, skilled nursing facilities and other care providers. Unfortunately, a problem at any of  these stages can seriously delay a product  from reaching Medicare patients. For example, Mr. Speaker: Exogen, Inc., a small company that developed an ultrasound device  for healing bone fractures, has encountered 4 years of delays in getting Medicare coverage. Oddly enough, the product  is currently be  reimbursed by more  than 800 private  insurers and health plans, but not by Medicare. The Cordis Corporation, a division of Johnson & Johnson, encountered significant problems in obtaining appropriate Medicare coding and payment  for coronary stents, which are stainless steel tubes used to treat narrowing of the  coronary arteries. The  company  faced challenges in obtaining a unique code for the stent procedure  from HCFA, and once  the new code was assigned, Medicare took several more years to place the device in the apto  need  propriate payment category. Sadly, the reason for  the delay was Medicare’s database was only a partial data set and HCFA’s precedent did not allow it to use sample data in determining  the hospital costs of providing  the stent. A manufacturer of a cochlear ear  implant halted active marketing of one model and stopped research on another because of inadequate Medicare  reimbursements. According to an article that appeared in The New England Journal of Medicine at the time, payment for the device remained well below its average cost, causing hospitals  to  ‘‘ration  the availability of the device to Medicare patients because of the financial losses involved. Eventually, so few patients received the implant that the manufacturer discontinued its production.’’ (Nancy M.  Kane,  D.B.A.,  and  Paul  D. Manoukian, M.D., M.P.H., ‘‘The Effect of the Medicare Prospective Payment System on the Adoption of New Technology,’’ The New England Journal of Medicine, November 16, 1989, pp. 13781382.) The most distressing problem in all of these cases, as in many others just like them, is that Medicare patients are being denied access to beneficial therapies. I am pleased that HCFA is attempting to address the problems associated with its process for making national coverage decisions  for new technologies. However, unless the shortcomings in the coding and payment systems are corrected, HCFA will not fully achieve its ultimate goal of  improving Medicare’s health care delivery system. Several  distinct  issues  dressed: Medicare’s system for creating and assigning procedure codes to medical technologies is cumbersome and slow. Medicare’s methods of updating Medicare payment  levels and payment groups  to accommodate changes in medical technology increase the risk that Medicare will lag behind new advances in medical technology. Medicare’s refusal to use data that are developed  outside  of  the Medicare  program blinds the program to useful insights about the costs, charges and outcomes of medical technologies. To address these issues, ‘‘The Patient Access  to Medical Technology Act of 1999’’ would: 1. Adjust Medicare payment levels and payment categories at  least annually  to  reflect changes in medical practice and technology. 2. Use valid external sources of information to update payment categories  if Medicare’s data are limited or not yet available. More specifically, the bill directs HCFA to use a valid, statistically representative sample and also to draw on external sources of data when its own dataset is inadequate. It directs HCFA to consider  statistically  representative  data  from such sources as private insurers, manufacturers, suppliers and other non-Medicare entities. 3.  Update  national  procedure  codes (HCPCs Level  II) more  frequently  to reduce delays and  timelags. Without an accurate identifying code, technologies and procedures cannot be reimbursed appropriately by Medicare. It can take HCFA up to 18 months to approve a new code because of  the way  the agency structures its calendar for making such changes. This bill would make  the process more efficient by eliminating the single annual deadline for applications and permitting such be  ad",1999
340,House,106,-0.38,3,1999-06-17,Mr. WYNN.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about gun safety and to pose the question, What policy will make us safer? Today in Congress we will debate the issue of gun safety and, most importantly, closing the loophole with respect to gun shows. The issue will be this: Should we be allowed to do a 3-day background check on people who buy guns or should we have a watered-down version that only allows 24 hours? Law enforcement officials such as the FBI say they need 3 days because sometimes there are thousands of Johnsons and Smiths  that  they have  to  run through their computers. What will make us safer: Taking the 3 days to do a thorough background check so a felon or someone with mental instability does not get a gun, or rushing through for the sake of convenience and letting literally thousands of felons get guns? These gun shows do not occur at neighborhood  arenas  or  fairgrounds. Oftentimes it is somebody in a pickup truck who shows his guns at a small community. There  is nothing wrong with that, but they should have adequate background checks. We have an opportunity to do it today. Madam Speaker, I urge us to vote for sound, fair, sensible gun control. f LET US FOLLOW NOBLE ASPIRATIONS (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I ask this Congress this morning, What do we tell the mothers and fathers of murdered children? What do we tell those who have seen 13 children die every day? This Congress has an opportunity, as was our prayer this morning, to follow noble aspirations and not follow our political aspirations. Four hundred thousand, 400,000 people were prevented from getting guns under the Brady bill. Two-thirds of them were felons. To the Republicans who voted for the Brady bill, it is time now to follow noble aspirations and not political aspirations. It is time to join commonsense  children’s  safety  and  protect them against guns. Today I will go and talk to constituents who have called me, one who said they will use every penny to defeat me if I vote for gun safety. I ask my colleagues to stand against intimidation, stand  for the saving of the  lives of those who will go on after us. Tell the mothers and fathers of murdered children that we have the courage to follow our noble aspirations and stand up against the death of children in America. Vote for gun safety today. Vote for gun safety. f GOP: GUNS OVER PEOPLE (Mr. GUTIERREZ  asked  and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",1999

344,House,106,0.256,24,1999-06-17,Mr. CAMPBELL.," I thank my good friend for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, the difference between this label and the label on potato chips is that this label has the government judging expressive content, not MSG content—expressive content and ideas. Those are protected under the First Amendment in ways that MSG content are not. The way this bill was drafted is very dangerous. It says that the FTC is supposed to determine a system appropriate for the nature, context, and intensity of the depictions of violence. Regarding context, consider that Full Metal Jacket and Apocolypse Now were violent  films about Vietnam. Saving Private Ryan was a violent film about the Second World War. The Federal trade Commission is asked to comment about violence in context. If we support the war, perhaps the violence is appropriate. If we do not, perhaps the violence is inappropriate. We see why the First Amendment deals with expressive content differently than MSG content. Lastly, there is a drafting error. The bill has no maximum to the minimum age; let me repeat, no maximum to the minimum age. Turn to page 7 of the bill. A person ‘‘may not sell, in commerce * * * product to an individual whose age in years is less than the age specified as the minimum age * * * for a purchaser * * * of the product * * * under the  labeling system * * * prescribed by the Federal trade Commission under subsection (d).’’ There  is  nothing  in  (d)  saying ‘‘minor’’ or ‘‘minority.’’ There is a reference to ‘‘minor’’ in A, the findings section, but that only applies to when the  industry does  its own  labeling. There is thus a huge loophole in this bill of an unconstitutional nature— adult access can be limited. Let me simply conclude that the bill was poorly drafted, and infringes the First Amendment.

346,House,106,-0.165,24,1999-06-17,Mr. ROEMER.," Mr. Chairman, this is a complicated debate, and I know technology is complicated to the Members in this body. But what we are in effect debating today is that we tell our families across America the sodium content in a bag of pretzels, and we will label that. Why should we not label a video game called Sin that teaches, that rewards, that glorifies, showing our children hour after hour after hour on the computer  how  to  destroy  people; minute after minute, hour after hour, week after week? This is Sin. I have played it. I have pulled it down and looked at it. The more people you kill and shoot, the better one’s score. Mr. Chairman, I understand the argument of the gentleman from California (Mr. CAMPBELL) about movies. Movies may desensitize us to violence, and I think that, quite frankly, the amendment of the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. WAMP) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. STUPAK) needs to be improved in that area. But video games do not desensitize us to it, they glorify it. They reward it. They teach our young people, shoot them again and I will give you 150 more points. And if you shoot their head off, I will give you more points. This is something that our parents and our families simply need a label on. We are not telling them, have the government take the industry over. We are telling Members  in this amendment, try to work together to come up with a voluntary labeling warning for our families. Some of our parents do not know too much about these games yet. These are new. This industry now on the Internet is a $300 billion industry and growing, and we want to promote the Internet. The Internet has valuable education, resource, and teaching tools, but  it also has some dangers.

348,House,106,-0.513,45,1999-06-17,Mrs. MINK of Hawaii.," Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. This legislation, which has been offered by the Chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce,  the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. GOODLING), is a reconstruction,  redraft of  the Juvenile Crime Control Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. b1500 It is a comprehensive document, 100 pages of great effort on the part of both sides, the majority and the minority, in the Committee on Education and the Workforce. I want to concur with all the statements that have been made thus far, and compliment the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. GREENWOOD) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) for their tireless efforts in putting together a bipartisan product. It is not often, particularly from our committee, where the two sides can come together and have such a substantial agreement on an  important piece of legislation dealing with our young people and dealing specifically with the issue of prevention of delinquency. This is not a matter that has come up since Littleton and school violence, this is a matter that has been under the jurisdiction of this committee for 25 years. These  two gentlemen,  the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr. GREENWOOD) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) have been laboring for years to put together a piece of legislation that will adapt  from the previous enactment and try to comprehend  the  current  circumstances that our young people are living under, the kinds of pressures that they must endure, and the need for a preventative system  to be  incorporated  into our laws. It is regrettable, Mr. Chairman, that this magnificent piece of work was snatched away from the Committee on Education  and  the WorkForce  and pulled away from the bill that is under consideration  for  the  last  24 hours, child safety and protection. There is no way that this Congress or this Nation can view the matter of child safety and protection only from the punitive aspects. It has to be dealt with from the preventative aspects, of how do we deal with problems before the child has to come into the justice system. That is what this amendment does that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. GOODLING) has offered for our consideration. I am here today to rise in very  strong  support, and urge  this House to add this very, very important title II to the bill that is under consideration. If we fail to enact this title II and agree to the Goodling amendment, we will have left out a significant portion of what this country expects this Congress to do in dealing with child safety and protection. That is, what can we do as a society to prevent our children from coming into harm’s way, and how to deal with potential juvenile crime issues. The Goodling amendment represents responsible, bipartisan legislation that has been carefully worked out by our committee. It passed the subcommittee unanimously. It was about to be reported out to the floor when now we are faced with these circumstances of asking that this entire 100 pages be added to the pending legislation, because without it, we do not have substantial preventative measures. The goal of this amendment is to reduce crime, but primarily it is the prevention elements of  this  legislation that are so important. It contains a block grant program that allows States to carry out projects designed to prevent  juvenile delinquency,  including educational  projects,  mentoring projects,  community-based  projects, and many other strong prevention programs. It maintains the core focus of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, prevention over punishment. We do not need punishment if we can prevent the crime in the first place, and prevent our young people from coming into the system. If we want to address the real problems of juvenile offenders, we need to put serious efforts into our prevention programs. I wanted to offer an amendment and went to the Committee on Rules, but I was not given that privilege, to talk about the importance of school counselors. But I am pleased today that this main amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. GOODLING) will help in this direction. The Goodling amendment is an excellent start. It focuses on early intervention, helping our youth before they get into trouble. The Goodling amendment creates a juvenile delinquency prevention block grant program which will allow monies  to  be  allocated  for projects in mental health, as we heard our colleague, the gentlewoman from New Jersey  (Mrs. ROUKEMA) explain, and the gentleman from California (Mr. MILLER) concur. It has  educational  projects, mentoring projects, literacy social service programs, substance abuse, substance abuse,  educational  scholarships,  job training, after-school programs, and a whole other group of programs which the States can pick from in order to deal with their own individualized programs. I call upon this House to give unanimous consent to the Goodling amendment, because without  it  the Child Safety and Protection Act of 1999 will not address  the  significant ways  in which this Congress and this country must deal with  juvenile crime, and that is to have substantial prevention programs.

There are experts on both sides of this issue. I want to just point out this business about the definition that they are complaining about,  the  definition  of  a weapon. Members  really  should  have  voted against that in 1997 if they did not like that definition.

Let me just tell my colleagues what is at stake. The ACLU is sending out information trying to get Members to vote against this legislation, just the same kind of thing they did when they opposed the Child On-Line Protection Act, which passed unanimously in this body just less than a year ago. Let me tell my colleagues about the ACLU and what they are telling us about children’s exposure to graphic content.

352,House,106,-0.487,80,1999-06-17,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support  of  Congresswoman  amendment  that simply states our entertainment  industry does not act  responsibly  towards our children. I support this amendment because  it  is  true. By  the  time a child has reached  their majority,  they  have  seen 200,000 acts of violence on  television and 16,000 of these acts are murders. It appears the  industry believes  that sex and violence sells, and they abandoned all restraint. Even, in light of current events, the entertainment industry  refuses  to accept  they might have some responsibility  towards  the communities they serve in America. As a society we recognize that children are susceptible to their environment and that they learn from what they are exposed to. This is true  in Hollywood and on Chicago’s West Side. Children  learn what  they see as  they grow up. Now we have video games where the sole purpose is to murder and kill other people. We have movies that depict only violence. We have music  that vividly describes crime and murder. Our children are being exposed to this from an early age. I believe the entertainment industry has been derelict in its duty to provide more enriching entertainment. I believe we, as Members of Congress, must raise this issue with the entertainment industry and challenge them to do better! Today I rise to  challenge  the entertainment  industry  to produce a better product, a better movie, a better record. A product that enables us, as parents, to navigate the difficult task of raising our children more effectively. I am not laying the blame for our nation’s problems at the feet of the entertainment industry, but I challenge them to do better. ",1999

354,House,106,-0.317,108,1999-06-17,Mr. BLAGOJEVICH.," Mr. Chairman, law-abiding  citizens  in  the United States have nothing to fear from applying the Brady background checks to gun shows. If one is a member of the NRA  and  one  is  law-abiding,  the McCarthy gun show bill does nothing to threaten one’s rights. However, if one is a criminal and one wants to buy a gun,  that  is  the purpose of  the McCarthy amendment. The focus is on the criminals. There were 5,200 gun shows last year; 54,000 guns came and were confiscated  in crimes that came from gun shows. We have a gaping loophole that we are trying to close, and there are three measures that might achieve that: the Hyde amendment,  the Dingell amendment and the McCarthy amendment. Three great Members, one good measure. Under  the Hyde amendment,  9,000 criminals  could  get  guns within  6 months at gun shows. Under the Dingell amendment, 17,000 could get guns at gun shows. This according to the Department of Justice. If it is about keeping criminals from getting guns,  support  the McCarthy amendment. ",1999
355,House,106,0.425,108,1999-06-17,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the  chairman  of  the  Subcommittee on Crime for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, later on tonight we will be considering the Dingell amendment, which I strongly support. I know that to many people, restrictions on the use and sale of weapons seem like common sense. Those who live in urban areas, particularly the inner cities, seldom hear of a gun used for hunting or for sport. Instead, to them, guns are almost always associated with crime and violence. Others know that guns are used safely for sport, to shoot game and to protect one’s home. In fact, more guns are used each day in self-defense and to prevent crime than are actually used to commit crimes. Clearly, there is a difference of perspective based on individual’s own life experiences. The clash of opinions comes when new gun control restrictions are perceived as punishing  law-abiding citizens rather than the criminals themselves. To me, the need is not for more gun control legislation on the books, but better enforcement of the laws we already have. b2200 We all know that under this administration there have been very, very few prosecutions of crimes involving guns. For  example,  thousands  of  felons were identified as attempting to illegally buy weapons under the Brady law, yet this administration chose not to prosecute a single person. We also know that we would not be here today if the Littleton tragedy had not occurred. Yet none of the proposed restrictions we will consider later tonight would  have  prevented  those deaths. What certainly would have prevented the killings would have been the enforcement of the dozen gun laws that were broken during the course of the acquisition, possession, and use of the guns involved.

360,House,106,-0.488,129,1999-06-17,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr.  Chairman,  I thank  the  gentlewoman  from New York for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, all of the materials we are looking at this evening, the underlying bill, H.R. 2122, the Dingell amendment, the McCarthy amendment, all collectively apparently have some sort of broad support for the prospect that we need a background check and a waiting period. What we are arguing about here is time, the amount of time for that. We all apparently agree on the purpose of that, is to keep guns out of the hands of  the wrong people, because 17,000 of those wrong people presumably would have gotten their hands on guns if we in fact had the Dingell resolution as law, because that is what the statistics and the facts tell us, that that many people, with the Dingell provision  in effect, still would have been felons, the wrong kind of people, who would have gotten guns. We can presume that if they went in under the Dingell provision and bought that gun on a Saturday or Friday night,  the  background  check  of  24 hours would not have been effective, and they would have been out there with their gun causing damage. In 1996, 4,643 young people were injured and 2,866 were murdered. We can presume that some of them might have been  in  that  circumstance, and we ought to not worry about a little inconvenience, we ought to worry about the comments this brave women and the other people in America are saying, protect our children. Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. MCDERMOTT). (Mr. MCDERMOTT asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. McDERMOTT.

363,Senate,106,-0.362,192,1999-06-17,Mr. DURBIN.," Every one of us as individuals and businesses can be held accountable for our actions. That is understandable. You go out and drink too much, drive a car, get in an accident, and you might be sued. There are two groups, though, that are spared this: foreign diplomats and health insurance companies. Why in the world would we carve out this kind of protection from liability for this group of health insurance companies? If they make the wrong decision on coverage, and it is your child who ends up not getting adequate care, or getting a bad medical result, who should be held responsible—the doctor, the hospital, or the insurance company that made the basic decision? I think the insurance company should. Frankly, if they are held accountable, they will think twice about making the wrong decision. They will make certain that children have access to specialists they need, that people can go to emergency rooms close to home, and when there is a medical necessity there is a continuity of care. If your employer  changes  health  insurance, you have an opportunity to keep that doctor who is so important to you. One of the most humbling experiences in my life—in the life of virtually anyone—is to sit in a waiting room in a hospital waiting to hear about the surgery on your child. Senator KENhas been through that. I have been through that. It is something I will never forget. You realize that everything you hold dear and close is in the hands of people you have to trust to be the very best specialists, welltrained medical technicians trying to save or improve the life of someone you love so very much. I think at those moments in our life when we are so vulnerable and pray that we have the very best and brightest helping our children and helping members of  the  family we  love  so much, to do the job and do the right thing and bring them home, we need to have the confidence that we have a system that works. Over  100 million Americans  today question whether this system works. They  question whether  that  doctor they want to trust can tell them everything they need to know. They question whether that hospital making a decision can make that decision without worrying about  some  insurance clerk in some faraway city. If we do nothing else in the 106th Congress,  shouldn’t we address  this basic gut issue that American families worry about on a day-to-day basis? The 105th Congress came and went with a record no one remembers. This Congress has a chance to act. We may debate a lot of things on the floor of the Senate, but if we don’t take up this very fundamental issue, we are missing our responsibility. This Congress should not be toiling in an atmosphere of partisanship. It shouldn’t  be  afraid  to  face  tough issues. It should come forward and vote for the Patients’ Bill of Rights, as Senator KENNEDYand Senator BOXERhave said,  to make  sure  families across America receive the protection they deserve. ",1999
364,,106,0.6,241,1999-06-17,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Speaker, today, I introduced legislation which will amend the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974. I  think  that everyone will agree  that reimbursement of training costs under the Trade Readjustment Act (TRA)  is of critical  importance to those individuals who have been negatively impacted by the North American Free Trade Act  (NAFTA).  I have seen  firsthand companies relocating and jobs being lost because of this Act. Currently, an  individual  cannot be  reimbursed by TRA  funds  for any  training costs which have been incurred prior to the approval of the training program under the TRA. In fact, an individual in my District encountered this problem. My constituent was laid off due to job relocation and started school just days prior to the certification of the TRA petition. Since the TRA makes no provisions to retroactively approve  training,  the  individual did not  receive a  reimbursement. His only other choice would have been  to deny his training an entire semester which would have meant he would be out of work even longer. The legislation I introduced today would prevent this from occurring again by providing a retroactive 30-day period, preceding the date the Secretary approves the TRA petition, during which someone could be reimbursed for training expenses under the act. This is the only way for individuals who try to plan ahead and then find themselves in this type of situation  to  take advantage of  the funds allocated under TRA. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this modest proposal. f GAY AND LESBIAN DEMOCRATIC CLUB TWENTY-FIVE YEAR FIGHT FOR GAY RIGHTS HON. CAROLYN B.

I submit the letter for the RECORD. HOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEEONAGRICULTURE, Washington, DC, May 24, 1999. Hon. TOMBLILEY, Chairman, House Commerce Committee, House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC DEARMR. CHAIRMAN: I want to take this opportunity to offer my congratulations on your bill, H.R. 1400, the Bond Price Competition Improvement Act of 1999. This important legislation will improve transparency in the bond market that will be beneficial to those purchasing these important financial instruments. In reading the bill’s report language, I note in section 3 that the bill’s proposed changes ‘‘are to affect only debt securities.’’ The report  language  states  further  that  these ‘‘changes are not intended to affect the exemption from registration requirements enjoyed by securities  issued by government sponsored enterprises, or to impose any requirements on government sponsored enterprises.’’ As  chairman of  the House Agriculture credit subcommittee, I am extremely sensitive to proposals affecting the providers of credit to farmers and ranchers across our nation. The Farm Credit System, a government sponsored enterprise whose authorities fall solely within the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee, is an important provider of  credit  to production agriculture. The 500,000 farmers who use Farm Credit System institutions for their credit needs are facing terrific challenges brought about by bad weather, low commodity prices and lost export markets. Any change in registration requirements and  the cost associated with such a change would be unwelcome, particularly at a time of such stress in the agricultural economy. Again, I note your bill in no way contemplates changes relative to securities issues by the Farm Credit System and therefore I am pleased to support H.R. 1400. I appreciate all the work you have done on this legislation, and I look forward to working with you on issues of mutual concern in the future. Sincerely, BILLBARRETT, Chairman, Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities, Resource Conservation and Credit. f HONORING THE OAKLAND HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL TEAM HON.

367,,106,-0.376,248,1999-06-17,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, just a few days ago, the President of Hungary, His Excellency Arpad Goncz, paid an official visit  to  the United States. President Goncz stands with Vaclav Havel, President of  the Czech Republic, as one of the pivotal leaders of post-Communist Central Europe—a man of  integrity, a man of character who has provided a moral anchor as Hungary has sought to find its way in establishing a democratic society and a free market economy. Arpad Goncz graduated with a Doctor of Law degree  in 1944. After  the  liberation of Hungary, he was active in non-Communist political groups. When  the Communist Party came to power in Hungary, he was forced to earn his living as a welder and pipe fitter and later as an agricultural engineer. He supported the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and  in 1957 he was tried and sentenced to life imprisonment  for his efforts  in  the attempt  to overthrow the communist regime. His time in prison was well-spent, because that is where he learned English. After serving 6 years in prison, Arpad Goncz was released under terms of a general amnesty. He then began a career as a literary translator and free-lance writer. He translated the works of more  than a hundred writers, mostly American and English authors including James Baldwin, E.L. Doctorow, William Faulkner, William Golding, Ernest Hemingway, William Styron, Susan Sontag,  John Updike, Edith Wharton, President Goncz  is also a playwright and novelist in his own right. When Hungary moved from a communist to a democratic government, Arpad Goncz was elected a member of the democratically elected parliament in the spring of 1990. He was chosen Speaker of Parliament on May 2, 1990, and  in  this position served as  Interim President of the Repubic of Hungary. On August 3, 1993, Arpad Goncz was elected President of the Republic of Hungary, and on June 19, 1995, he was reelected to a five-year term as President. Mr. Speaker, as a moral  influence and a voice of integrity, President Arpad Goncz has been a pivotal figure in the democratic transformation of Hungary.  It  is most appropriate that he was highly honored during his recent visit to the United States. Mr. Speaker,  I submit  the speech at  the State Dinner honoring President Goncz by President Clinton and the response of President Goncz to be placed in the RECORD. TOASTOFPRESIDENTCLINTON The President of the United States: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the White House. And a special welcome to President and Mrs. Goncz and members of the Hungarian delegation. Exactly 150 years ago, in 1849, a young congressman from Illinois, serving his first and only term in the U.S. House of Representatives, offered a resolution supporting the Hungarian people’s struggle  for  independence and democracy. At that time, the leader of  the Hungarian  freedom movement, of course, was Lajos Kossuth. The congressman was Abraham Lincoln. The bonds between our citizens, based not only on the large number of distinguished Hungarian Americans in our country, but also on our shared aspirations for freedom and democracy, have very deep roots. I would  like to say a special word of thanks to Congressman Tom and Annette Lantos, and others who have helped them, because they are responsible for the fact that a bust of Kossuth now stands in the Rotunda of our Capitol. Ralph Waldo Emerson called him  ‘‘the angel of freedom.’’ He was only the second non-American—Lafayette being the first—to address both Houses of Congress. Crowds greeted him wherever he went. He was a true American hero. Mr. President, like Kossuth, you taught yourself English while you were in prison— at a time when you had just escaped a death sentence and faced a life term, because you stood for liberty. Later, you translated the works of many great writers: Edith Wharton, Thomas Wolfe, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Arthur Miller, James Baldwin, John Updike, Alice Walker. And at least two I think are here tonight—William Styron and Susan Sontag. These translations offered Hungarians a window on the West and earned you many admirers at home. This work is just one part, but it is a vital part, of your contribution to ending the division of Europe. I even noted in preparing for this evening that you translated into Hungarian President Bush’s 1988 campaign biography, ‘‘Looking Forward.’’ Now by the time Al Gore and I  published  our  book,  ‘‘Putting People First,’’ in 1992, you were already President of Hungary and, unfortunately,  too busy  to translate this profoundly important work. At least I choose to believe that is the reason you did not choose to translate it. In this decade your own works have been translated and published  in English, your plays performed in the United States. They are a brave set of explorations of political conflict and war, freedom and betrayal, the struggle for daily survival and dignity in the face of adversity. Americans have absorbed these works as we have watched you lead your nation, deepening freedom there, and promoting human rights and ethnic tolerance around the world, and especially  in your own region. The only Hungarian head of state to make an official visit to Romania in this century, you told the  joint session of Parliament there that ethnic minorities enrich their nations and ‘‘form a valuable connective link in strengthening relations’’ between nations. Your vision of people living together and nations living together, resolving differences peacefully, drawing strength from their diversity, treating all people with equal dignity—this will form the basis of a better future for Europe and the world. It is at the heart of what we have been trying to do in our efforts to reverse ethnic cleansing  in Kosovo, and to build a Southeastern Europe in which all people can live together in dignity and freedom. Now, Mr. President, normally when I propose a toast to a visiting head of state, I say something like,  ‘‘cheers.’’ I have been advised by the State Department that the Hungarian word for ‘‘cheers’’ is—and I want to quote from the memo I got—‘‘practically impossible to pronounce correctly.’’ I have accepted their considered  judgment. So,  instead, I would like to salute you and Mrs. Goncz with the words that greeted Kossuth on streamers all across New York City on the day he arrived in America—Isten Hozta. ‘‘Welcome.’’ I ask all of you to join me in a toast to President and Mrs. Goncz, and to the people of Hungary. Thank you very much. TOASTOFPRESIDENTGONCZ The President of Hungary: Mr. President, Mrs. Clinton, dear friends. Back home in my own country I have the privilege of speaking in my own native language. It would be becoming to speak English here, but there is one thing I learned when I was a writer—that lesson I learned, that if you cannot express yourself in an adequate way in that language, then you’d rather not deliver speeches in that language. I do apologize for not speaking English, because eventually I might end up as Kossuth did when he was here. As it was mentioned, he learned English also in prison, as I did. And he had excellent rhetoric abilities. And after one of the enlightening speeches he made here in America, two listeners started to whisper between each other,  ‘‘I never thought that English was so close to Hungarian.’’ Now, this time, I would like to spare you that experience. My  friend  speaks better English than I do. Mr. President mentioned something about my past as a translator. I learned English in the prison through the works of Kennedy. First, I translated the speeches of Kennedy. This was something like lawful—translated for the higher authorities in the party. It was strictly confidential. I am terribly sorry that President Kennedy  never  had  the chance to see himself how authentic the Hungarian translation was. But I’d like to come back on the events of today. Officially, I was in the White House in an official capacity in April 1993. At that time I met the President, and there were some other heads of state also here. And then when I looked around, I had the wind of youthfulness, optimism, and an air of determination. Today, I experienced the same: a determined leadership that decides the fate of the world; responsibility and profound humanity. We have had long discussions today. It is a God-given gift that my visit that had been prepared for months was realized today—all of these days going to be decisive. This is a crucial day when the Kosovo crisis is raising its beak and it’s going to come to completion. We have had a long discussion with Mr. President, not only the two of us. But if I were to characterize the meeting, I would say that it was not negotiations, diplomatic negotiations, but  thinking  together. And this was the first time I really felt, genuinely, that the two countries are allies, and a real alliance is characterized by identical values and also that you approach the problems to be solved from the same angle. Even during the air campaign we tried to find the man, a human being in that. And we fully agreed that the peace of Europe is unthinkable without the peace in the Balkans. And without the understanding and the cooperation of the people in the Balkans, it is inconceivable to have peace in that region. The discussions we have had today will have a very significant imprint not only because of the political implications, but also because I made a great acquaintance of a genuine, real man. During my presidency we have met about four or five times, but we never had a chance before to think together about the course of the world. We did that today. And we also found that it is the human being that is the common denominator: the man in Kosovo, the Serbian man; let me tell you, also the Hungarian man, who has got responsibility for the Serbs, as well, after having lived together with them for hundreds and hundreds of years.

371,House,106,0.24,55,1999-06-23,Mr. JONES of North Carolina.," Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Joint Resolution 33, and I commend the gentleman  from California for bringing this forward. Madam Speaker, it was on June 14, 1777,  that  the Continental Congress passed the first Flag Act, calling for the symbol of the United States of America to bear its Stars and Stripes. Over the years, the flag has grown to become a symbol of  freedom and a faithful tribute to those, living and deceased, who have fought to protect and preserve peace both here and abroad. Madam Speaker, we stand and pledge our allegiance to the flag every day, but it is our United States soldiers who salute and serve beneath the flag who truly bear the burden of ultimate allegiance. They sacrifice their  lives to protect our freedom and our liberty. Madam Speaker, I want to share with Members a poem by Father Denis Edward O’Brien, United States Marine Corps, that shows the special relationship our soldiers have with the flag of the United States.  I  quote Father O’Brien: It is the soldier, not the reporter, who has given us freedom of the press. It is the soldier, not the poet, who has given us freedom of speech. It is the soldier, not the campus organizer, who has given us  the  freedom  to demonstrate. It is the soldier who salutes the flag, who serves beneath the flag, and whose coffin is draped by the flag who allows the protester to burn the flag. Madam Speaker, when we allow our flag, the very essence of our country, to be destroyed, in my opinion we dishonor the men and women who gave their lives serving under that flag so that every one of us could live free. I know, Madam Speaker, that many of my colleagues will raise important constitutional questions about adding an amendment to protect the flag. But when it comes down to it as a representative of the people, I believe that we have the support from the majority of the American people on this issue. Madam Speaker,  I have had  the honor of serving the citizens of the Third District of North Carolina for 5 years. I can say with absolute honesty that I have never personally spoken with any citizen on this issue who did not express support for congressional action to protect and preserve the integrity of the United States flag. With many of our United States veterans and a majority of the American people backing this measure, it has my full and absolute support. Madam Speaker, I hope this House will support House Joint Resolution 33. ",1999
372,House,106,0.366,55,1999-06-23,Mr. KNOLLENBERG.,"  I  thank  the gentleman for yielding me this time. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the constitutional amendment to protect the American flag. I want to commend  the gentleman  from California (Mr. CUNNINGHAM) for bringing this forward. His leadership is important in this because of his background. But I also want to relate to the American people how I feel that they feel about why Congress should be called upon to enact a flag protection amendment. They have done this ever since 1989 when the Supreme Court did the decision-making as to burning or desecrating the flag. The storm of protest coming from the American people since that time, I think, has been consistent. While public opinion on most issues tends to be volatile, every reliable survey, every single one that they have conducted on this issue over the last 10 years indicates, shows clearly, that 75 percent or better of the American people believe it should be illegal to burn, trample or destroy Old Glory. They tell me it is illegal to burn trash, but we can burn the flag. It is illegal to destroy Federal property, even a mailbox. But it is okay to destroy the flag. This indicates that while Americans hold their first amendment rights dear to their hearts, they also understand that our flag should be honored and protected against senseless acts of vandalism. People can still express their views without resorting to vandalism. Madam Speaker, the American flag is not just a piece of cloth. It is a symbol that reflects the values, the struggles and the storied history of our great country. I urge my colleagues, those that oppose this amendment, to rethink exactly what the flag means to the American people, those who protest what has taken place, what took place in 1989. I would urge everyone to defend the principles that it embodies by voting for this very important amendment to the Constitution. ",1999
373,House,106,0.29,62,1999-06-23,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to support our American Flag and as an original cosponsor of House Joint Resolution 33 which will protect our most cherished national symbol. The American Flag  is probably  the most recognizable symbol in the world. Wherever it stands,  it  represents  freedom. Millions  of Americans who served our nation in war have carried that flag into battle. They have been killed or injured just for wearing it on their uniform because  it represents  the most  feared power known  to  tyranny and  that  is  liberty. Where there is liberty there is hope. And hope extinguishes the darkness of hatred, fear and oppression. America is not a perfect nation, but to the world our  flag represents  that which  is right and  to Americans  it  represents what Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes referred to as our ‘‘national unity, our national endeavor, our national aspiration.’’  It  is a remembrance of past struggles in which we have persevered to remain as one nation under God, indivisible, with  liberty and  justice  for all. Those who would desecrate our flag and all it represents have no  respect  for  the brave men and women for whom the ideals and honor of this nation were dearer than life. Madam Speaker, this bill will not make individuals who desecrate our flag love our nation and those who sacrificed to secure the freedoms we have today. But it will give Americans a unified voice  in decrying  these reprehensible acts. ",1999
374,House,106,0.471,62,1999-06-23,Mr. WELDON of Florida.," Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 33, the Flag Desecration Constitutional Amendment. Our nation’s flag is a sacred symbol of our country’s liberty that so many men and women in uniform have fought and died to defend. As the symbol of that liberty, the flag deserves, better yet, demands our greatest respect. Additionally,  the  flag of  the United States of America is a symbol of the perseverance of American values. It is greatly disturbing that it is sometimes burned or otherwise desecrated as an act of protest. It is disgraceful that some individuals would desecrate the flag that our nation’s veterans have fought so valiantly to defend. It is also disheartening that we would even have to debate this issue on the floor of the House of Representatives. Madam Speaker, as we draw near  to  the new millennium, it is important that we finally enact protections  for our  flag.  I believe  that this Congress  is committed  to doing everything we can to ensure the flag that signifies the very liberties and responsibilities that we hold dear. ",1999
375,House,106,0.433,62,1999-06-23,Mr. RILEY.," Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  this amendment. Our  flag represents the best qualities America has to offer—freedom, equal opportunity, and  religious  tolerance. Furthermore,  it serves as a symbol of  the blood, sweat, hard work and sacrifices many before us have made. We owe so much of what we have and who we are to those who have fought to protect our country. It disturbs me every time I hear of attacks on our Nation’s symbol of freedom. An attack on the flag is an attack on our heritage and everything our ancestors  fought  for. Thousands of people have lost their lives protecting our flag and the liberties we enjoy today. Madam Speaker, we should not tolerate flag desecration and  I urge your support of  this very important amendment. ",1999
376,House,106,-0.565,62,1999-06-23,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to House Joint Resolution 33. I firmly believe that passing this bill would abandon the very values and principles upon which this country was founded. Make no mistake, I deplore the desecration of the flag. The flag is a symbol of our country and a reminder of our great heritage; and I find  it  unfortunate  that  a  few  individuals choose  to desecrate  that which we hold so dear. However, it is because of my love for the  flag and  the country  for which  it stands that, unfortunately, I have no choice but to oppose this well-intentioned yet misguided legislation. Our country was  founded on certain principles. Chief among these principles are freedom of speech and expression. These  freedoms were included in the Bill of Rights because  the Founding Fathers  took deliberate steps to avoid creating a country in which individuals’ civil liberties could be abridged by the government. Yet  that  is exactly what  this amendment would do. It begins a dangerous trend  in which  the government can decide which ideas are legal and which must be suppressed. I believe that the true test of a nation’s commitment  to  freedom of expression  is shown through its willingness to protect ideas which are unpopular, such as  flag desecration. As Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in 1929, it is an imperative principle of our Constitution that it protects not just freedom  for  thought and expression we agree with, but ‘‘freedom for the thoughts we hate.’’ Ultimately, we must remember that it is not the flag we honor, but rather, the principles it embodies. To restrict peoples’ means of expression would do nothing but abandon those principles—and  to destroy  these principles would be a far greater travesty than to destroy its symbol. Indeed, it would render the symbol meaningless. As  I  said,  I admire  the well-intentioned thoughts of those who support the flag desecration amendment, however,  I believe  their efforts are misdirected. It is essential that we maintain our country’s ideals including those which allow for differences of opinion, at whatever the cost; and I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill that violates the ideals and principles of our country.

393,,106,0.311,174,1999-06-23,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to address an issue that is central to our nation’s economy,  the  tourism  industry. As co-chairman of the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, I believe this issue is worth bringing to the attention of the American public. The issue I wish to discuss is the vital role which the cruise industry plays in relation to our nation’s economy and tourism industry. In  regard  to our nation’s economy,  the cruise industry has made significant contributions. With more than five million annual passengers, the industry is a major contributor to the overall U.S. economy. In 1997 in my home state of Florida,  the cruise  industry was responsible  for direct spending of $2.1 Billion dollars and generated almost 59,000 jobs. Companies such as  those outlined below are but a few examples of domestic U.S. companies that depend on the cruise industry as a steady and important source of income: Tourism support services such as provided by Amadeus, Strategic Cruise Line Services, and Image Photo Services; Purchases of ship equipments, and supplies from vendors such as General Hotel and Restaurant, Harbour Marine Systems, International Paint, Mobil Aviation and Marine Sales and Ecolab; Corporate Services provided by companies such as Maritime Telecommunications Services,  the Berkely Group, Howard Snoweiss Design Group and J. Walter Thompson; Ship  repair and maintenance provided by companies across the country such as Atlantic Marine of Mobile, AL., Todd Pacific shipyards of Seattle, WA., Cascade General of Portland, OR., Unitour Ship Services of Long Beach, CA., and United States Marine Repair which owns San Diego Shipyard, San Francisco Drydock and Norshipco in Norfolk, VA. Food and beverage purchases are made in a number of states from such familiar sources as Coca-Cola, Kraft, Heinz, Nabisco,  J.R. Simplot, Fresh Point, Sysco, Ernest & Julio Gallo, and Anheuser Busch. Every week, just one cruise ship will purchase approximately 25,000 pounds of food from U.S. suppliers— everything from beef, pork, chicken, seafood, cheese and other dairy products,  to vegetables and fruit. The cruise industry provides employment for thousands of U.S. citizens aboard its ships, in shoreside corporate jobs, and with its extensive network of suppliers. Cruise  lines and their direct suppliers are the largest employer of U.S. citizens in the maritime sector of the United States. Furthermore, the cruise industry also plays a significant role in our domestic transportation and  lodging  industry. The cruise  industry  is America’s  largest private-sector purchaser of U.S. airline tickets, accounting for more than four million  tickets purchased annually. Preand post-cruise packages  include  lodging at some of the nation’s largest hotel chains including: Hyatt, Intercontinental, Wyndham and Sheraton. In view of the cruise industry’s contributions, I am proud to highlight some of the benefits which  the  tourism  industry provides  to our economy. It is with this thought in mind that I continue to advocate the importance of both the cruise and tourism industries. Support for the cruise and tourism industries will generate jobs and additional revenues  for  the United States. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I wish to introduce several statistics for the record generated by a recent Price Waterhouse Cooper’s economic analysis. I thank you for this time. 1997 CRUISE INDUSTRY ECONOMIC IMPACTS DIRECTU.S. EXPENDITURESBYINDUSTRY—RESULTING FROM THEPASSENGERCRUISE DUSTRY INAir Travel ....................................

394,,106,0.632,174,1999-06-23,Mr. BARR of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I urge those in Washington who believe government is  the solution  to every problem  to visit  the Murphy-Harpst-Vashti (MHV) campuses in the state of Georgia. Located across our state, the MHV programs are making a positive difference in the lives of young people. MHV focuses its efforts on at-risk children. In other words, they help to turn the lives of endangered children around, and help them to become productive members of society. Each of the MHV agencies reaches out to the communities where  they are  located,  identifies children who may become problems  in  their homes, schools, and neighborhoods, and extend a helping hand to them. In an era when many social workers, teachers, and parents respond to troubled children by handing them prescription drugs and sending them on their way, the comprehensive approach to troubled children taken by the Murphy-Harpst-Vashti campuses provides a welcome change. I commend them for their work. f COMMUNITY RENEWAL THROUGH COMMUNITY- AND FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS SPEECHOF HON. DEBBIE STABENOW OFMICHIGAN INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 22, 1999 ",1999

396,,106,-0.132,139,1999-07-12,Mr. CRAMER.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the life and  legacy of Rev. Lindsay G. Fields of Huntsville, Alabama, an extraordinary man whose one hundred and seven years were marked by a true sense of compassion and a dedication of God and his family. Rev. L.G. Fields was born  in Harris, Alabama on February 6, 1892 and spent over fifty years  in  the United Methodist ministry. He spent sixteen years in Gadsden as pastor of Sweet Home Methodist Church and then led Village view Methodist Church in Athens until his retirement. The long and blessed life of Rev. Fields included a passion for education. He attended the American School of Correspondence  in Chicago and then Gammon Theological Seminary in Atlanta. He continued his love of education by serving on the board of trustees for Clark and Rust Colleges. For Rev. Fields, community service was a way of life. He worked with the Madison County Council on Aging, the Mental Health Centers, the Madison County Senior Center and the Model Cities Program. I believe this tribute is only fitting for one who has given so much of himself for others. I commend the perseverance of Rev. Fields is the raising and educating of his twelve children with the late Rosa Perry Fields. With 24 grandchildren  and  22  great-grandchildren, Rev. Fields has left a proud and beloved legacy. I offer my sympathy to the Fields family On behalf of the people of Alabama’s fifth Congressional District, I join them in celbrating the extraordinary life and honoring the memory of a man who filled his one hundred and seven years with a love of God, country and family. f CONGRATULATING DEE ARNTZ HON. JAY INSLEE OFWASHINGTON INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Monday, July 12, 1999 ",1999
397,,106,-0.33,139,1999-07-12,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to announce  that one of my constituents, Ms. Dee Arntz,  recently won  the 1999 National Wetlands Award. In 1990, Ms. Arntz co-founded  the Washington Wetlands  Network  (Wetnet).  The Wetnet organization connects citizens,  local government officials,  federal  representatives, and others into a centralized network of people concerned about wetland protection and preservation. As a result, this important network approach gives small organizations information and links to larger state and national efforts. Through Ms. Arntz’s efforts, citizens have joined together to protect thousands of wetland acres throughout Washington State. In the process of building Wetnet, Ms. Arntz worked as a community development program administrator for King County and other Puget Sound local governments. Her experience also includes serving on the boards of the Seattle Audubon Society, the Nisqually Delta Association, and the Washington Environmental Council. In addition, Ms. Arntz earned a Certificate in Wetlands Science and Management  from the University of Washington in 1995. I would  like  to congratulate Ms. Arntz  for winning  the 1999 National Wetlands Award. Her dedication to wetland protection has led to major environmental accomplishments at both the state and national level. Ms. Arntz is an example of the enormous impact one citizen can have on the environment. This award is very well-deserved. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. KENNY C.

399,,106,-0.121,139,1999-07-12,Mr. HILL of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2280, the Veterans’ Benefits Improvement Act of 1999. I believe that this bill makes some important changes to the benefits available to veterans. I am a cosponsor of this bill. It increases rates of disability compensation and indemnity compensation to veterans. It enhances the quality assurance program at  the Veterans Benefits Administration. It also provides permanent eligibility for housing loans for members of the Selected Reserve. And it reauthorizes important programs for homeless veterans. I wanted to be sure to mention this bill because another of its provisions helps get construction of the World War II Memorial underway. This past Memorial Day,  I attended a wonderful ceremony back  in Versailles,  Indiana. At  that ceremony  the American Legion Post in Versailles presented me with a check for one  thousand dollars  to  forward  to  the American Battle Monuments Commission  to help build  the World War  II Memorial. That struck me as uncommon generosity from men and women who have already given so much. I salute  them and all  the people who are making this monument possible. The more we work toward building this memorial, the more World War II veterans will be able to see this proud symbol of what our ‘‘Greatest Generation’’ accomplished. I ask my  fellow members of Congress  to support  the Veterans’ Benefits  Improvement Act because it honors our veterans and helps to provide the benefits that they have earned. Since taking office in January I have been talking to the House leadership about ways I could become more  involved  in Veterans’ issues. Last week, I’m proud to say that I received a seat on the Veterans’ Committee. I know that we owe a lot to those who currently serve our country and also to those who have served  in  the past. With  this appointment  I hope I can make a real difference for all our veterans. This year, one of our nation’s oldest and most distinguished service organizations, the Veterans  of Foreign Wars  of  the United States, celebrates its 100-year anniversary. I was  first  reminded by constituents  that  this year marked that important anniversary. The  first bill  I  sponsored and  the  first speech I made in the United States House of Representatives was to celebrate and recognize the Veterans of Foreign Wars by requesting that the U.S. Postal Service issue a stamp ",1999
400,House,106,0.496,3,1999-07-22,Mr. ARCHER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. ENGLISH), another  respected member of the Committee on Ways and Means. ",1999
401,House,106,-0.416,3,1999-07-22,Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts.," Mr. Speaker, Members on both sides of the aisle have said that the tax bill reported by the Committee on Ways and Means is a bill that makes budget priorities clear. These Members are right. This is a debate about Social Security and Medicare and paying down the Federal budget debt. Our priority on the Democratic side is clear. It is saving Social Security first, fixing Medicare, and making sure the Federal deficits from the last era do not return under an unreasonable tax  bill  offered  by  the Republican Party. As we all know, the 1981 tax bill was the  leading cause of deficits we  incurred during the past 15 years, but the Republican slogan today is clear. Extremism in the pursuit of a tax cut is no vice. This priority is a reckless tax bill based upon uncertain economic projections and based on unlikely assumptions about Draconian cuts in the future of government spending: programs like law enforcement, farm aid, education, veterans programs,  to name just a few. They almost could not even get this tax bill to the floor because the moderates in their own party are suspicious of where this legislation will take us. On the Democratic side, we are not saying we are against tax cuts. We are simply saying, fix Social Security and Medicare first. Leave enough of a reserve to pay down the Federal debt and then talk about a modest tax cut initiative aimed at working class Americans, not the wealthiest among us who are not even clamoring for a tax cut at this time. Social Security is the Nation’s premier  program.  It  is  the  greatest achievement legislatively of this century. It has been crucial to the way elderly Americans have lived during the last 60-plus years and we have a chance now to protect it. Reject this bill. It is irresponsible and reckless. ",1999
402,House,106,0.418,3,1999-07-22,Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky.," Mr. Speaker, today I think the question in this debate boils down to one thing: Who do we trust? I arrived here in 1994, at the end of the 40-year period of Democrat rule of this House of Representatives. They were  running  200-plus billion dollar deficits and created a $5 trillion debt. Government was growing at an exponential rate. They were ready and willing to place upon this country a government  program  that would  have taken us over the line, a government program  called  socialized medicine. There was not enough money for them to spend. They just kept taking it out of Social Security and Medicare, wherever they could get the money to create larger government all the time. To hear them talk about debt reduction is amusing. Talk about revisionist history. We listened to it last night. When I came here, I signed a contract, the Contract with America, that would balance the budget, that would cut taxes, that would reform welfare, that would reduce the size of government and allow people to keep more of their money. They fought it every inch of the way. Yes, there was a government shutdown. Know why? Because the President would  not  sign  the Balanced Budget Act that he is so wonderfully willing to take credit for today. The question is, who do we trust? They did not get the title ‘‘tax-andspend’’ liberals for nothing. I think it is a very appropriate title and it still sticks with them today. The question is who do we trust? It is like if we believe them, it would be like asking Jessie James to guard the bank vault for a little while. I do not think we want to do that. I do not think we want to go back to 40 years of tax-andspend liberals. ",1999
403,House,106,-0.328,3,1999-07-22,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker, I was listening to my friend. I believe in the ",1999
404,House,106,-0.278,10,1999-07-22,Mr. DAVIS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2488, the Financial Freedom Act of 1999 and  in support of  the Democratic alternative which will provide targeted  tax relief but will ensure at  the same time that we pay down our national debt and address the solvency of Social Security and Medicare first. The Republican tax package ignores the fiscal discipline which as brought  the  federal budget from record deficits into balance and projected surpluses in the coming years. By abandoning PAYGO  rules and  relying completely on projected surpluses as offsets, this package threatens to undo all of the gains we have made over the past six years. If in fact these surplus projections are not accurate, we will be faced with either massive cuts to keep the budget balanced or deficits reminiscent of the 1980’s. Rather than passing this tax package, I believe we should be focusing first on the solvency of Social Security and Medicare. During this  time of economic growth and positive budget forecasts, Congress should take strong steps to shore up these two vital programs. We have a narrow window of opportunity to prepare these programs for the demographic changes coming with  the  retirement of  the baby boomers.  If we squander  this opportunity,  future generations with  look back on this Congress as one more concerned with short-term political pandering  than  long-term responsibilities. Furthermore, H.R. 2488 would consume virtually all of the projected on-budget surpluses and devote virtually none to debt retirement. Currently,  the publicly held debt  is  roughly $3.7 trillion and our interest payments alone on that debt consume 11% of the overall federal budget. This debt and corresponding debt service crowd out private investment and put pressure on all of our national budget priorities. Since  coming  to Congress,  I  have strongly advocated devoting the lion’s share of these surpluses to debt retirement. As Former Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin has pointed out, debt reduction creates a cyclical benefit of  lower  interest  rates, greater economic growth, higher budget surpluses, and further debt reduction. In my view, retiring a significant portion of the  federal debt  is  the most  fiscally responsible course of action and will lead to tangible benefits for all Americans. Consider, for example, what would happen if, as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has testified is likely, long-term interest rates were to drop another two points as a result of debt reduction. For  citizens  in my district of Hillsborough County, Florida with a $115,000 home, monthly mortgage payments would be reduced by $155. That is real savings and real money in the pockets of Americans. The Democratic alternative offered today will dedicate  the vast majority of  the surplus  to ",1999
405,House,106,-0.53,17,1999-07-22,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition  to  the $792 billion  tax cut being considered in the House today. This legislation spends  the entire projected budget surplus, leaving nothing to reduce the national debt or extend the solvency of Social Security and Medicare. For the first time in forty years, the federal government will achieve a budget  surplus without relying on  the surplus  from  the earmarked Social Security  taxes. This achievement  results  from difficult budget decisions that have been made over the past decade. Today we are experiencing greater productivity,  low  inflation,  low unemployment and broad based growth in real wages because we have  focused on  reducing deficits, paying down our debt, lowering interest rates and investing in our people. This legislation seeks to undermine  the  fiscal discipline  that has created our current economy. Today’s  tax-cut  legislation uses projected budget surpluses which may not materialize and could force further cuts in domestic discretionary spending. It is appalling that in this era of economic prosperity, instead of a congressional debate about needed long term investments to strengthen our domestic security, we are focusing on financing a tax give-away through budget cuts in programs that educate children, feed the hungry, provide health care and child care, and keep our drinking water safe. As a nation, we cannot continue to tolerate the  fact  that  in America, 43 million people have no health insurance. Sharing our nation’s strength and good fortune through investments that work is far wiser and will pay for greater dividends  than spiraling  tax breaks  for  the most affluent Americans. ",1999
406,House,106,-0.383,38,1999-07-22,Ms. RIVERS.," Mr. Speaker, I will not be voting for any of the proposals that we are going to be considering today. Why? Because they all spend money we do not yet have. If one  follows the headlines of the last few weeks, they will find the surplus repeatedly being referred to as ephemeral, shaky, a castle in the sky, a mirage, an illusion. Why? Well, according to the Washington Post in their article, The Surplus Illusion, the reason is to make the numbers come out even when they passed the Balanced Budget Act in 1997, Congress agreed to cut in the future, without ever specifying how, a large category of Federal spending that would have to be cut by 22 percent in real terms, 20 percent in real terms. As I read this and thought about it, it seemed familiar to me somehow. So I went back through my books, and I found what I was looking for. I found a quote that said, ‘‘there was not a hint, not one scintilla, about what this fabulous giving actually meant, that tens of millions of Social Security recipients,  students,  farmers,  government pensioners and other beneficiaries of Federal largesse watching that night received no warning that their benefits would have to be deeply and suddenly slashed  in order to keep the budget equation whole.’’ 1981 all over again. Do not repeat the past mistakes. ",1999

408,House,106,0.315,59,1999-07-22,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2561,  the Department Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000. This bill carefully balances scarce  resources by maintaining readiness, providing a much deserved pay raise for our troops and ensuring that our military continues  its  technological dominance over potential enemies. I urge support for this bill. Mr. Chairman, this Administration has been dramatically and consistently underfunding our military, while at the same time, asking it to do more with less. Our troops have been committed to more operations in the last ten years than at any time since World War II. This has created a situation whereby we have excessive wear and tear on equipment and facilities. In addition, our soldiers, sailors and airmen are having to spend extraordinary time away from their homes and their families. While our troops have performed admirably, the time has come where they can no longer do more with less. The defense budget presented by the President fell far short of the needs that our military had requested. For instance, in my bill, Military Construction, there was not one request for a new unit of family housing in the Continental United States (CONUS) made by either  the Army or the Navy. With a housing backlog that stretches for over ten years, and a real property maintenance backlog of almost a billion dollars, the needs of the services are real. In fact, in hearings before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee,  the services provided us with an unfunded priority list of over $11 billion for this year alone, and over $150 billion during  the next  five years. While  remaining within the budget caps, this Defense Appropriations  bill  begins  to  address  this shortfall by providing an extra $2.8 billion above what the Administration felt would have been adequate. Highlights of the bill include: $300 million above the budget request for pilot bonuses; $854 million above  the budget request for Quality of Life enhancements; $103 ",1999
409,House,106,0.632,66,1999-07-22,Mr. BARR of Georgia.," Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from California and I and others have had numerous conversations concerning the importance of this program of air superiority of the United States.  It  is my understanding  the  chairman  of  the  subcommittee, as well as members of the upcoming conference committee, will closely look at the F–22 program in light of the fact the other body, that is the Senate, included full funding for this project in its appropriations bill. ",1999
410,House,106,-0.4,66,1999-07-22,Mr. LARSON.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of the amendment. I am here to address what is a very serious issue of national security raised by cutting the F–22 and the virtual elimination of the number one priority of the United States Air Force. Let me first acknowledge and thank the  leadership of the Committee on Armed Services and the fine job that the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. SPENCE) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SKELTON) have done. I commend them for their mark on the F–22. I am proud to be a member of this committee. The issue of cost associated with this program  is one  the  committee addressed and requires the Secretary of the Air Force  to  report  their continuing  efforts  to meet mandated spending caps. I am heartened as well by  the actions of  the Senate Committee on National Security, the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Defense Department, and the Clinton administration, all who support the F–22 for the strategic importance, air superiority, and dominance it supplies our troops  who  most  recently  demonstrated their brave actions and won the war for us in Kosovo. Let me also acknowledge the great respect that I have for the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MURTHA) and the gentleman  from California  (Mr. LEWIS),  the  gentleman  from Washington (Mr. DICKS), the gentleman from California (Mr. CUNNINGHAM, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOUNG), our chairman of the full committee, and the gentleman  from Wisconsin  (Mr. OBEY), and other members of the Subcommittee on Defense who have felt this program was too costly to continue because of budgetary constraints and cost overruns. I rise this afternoon without malice and ask these fine appropriators who are headed to conference to hear the concerns not only of legislators, but from the guys in the front lines, the men and women who put their lives on the line, the ones who we ask to fly in harm’s way. Their first concern is the Nation they protect and the comrades they fly with. They know little of politics, of budget caps, and conference committees. They only know they have a job to perform. They are given orders, and they execute, and  in Kosovo, that was over 30,000 sorties without a single life lost. They are the heroes. They are this Nation’s Jedi warriors. And in gratitude to their service, we are preparing today to cut the only program that guarantees their air dominance. While trying to persuade them that retrofitting the F–15 is the answer for the future. I visited several of these pilots at Langley Air Force base. I told them how proud I and all of the Members of Congress were of  their effort. They asked them why we are cutting the F– 22 and stressed their dismay at how counterproductive it is to try to bolt on technology to the F–15. To quote Major Jay Tim, we would get only onethird the capability of the F–22 at 90 percent of the cost it will take to retrofit the F–15. Another young warrior said, rather painfully, how many of us  coming home in coffins will it take for Congress to understand how important tactical superiority and advanced avionics are to the pilots who carry out these missions. b1545 Their classified presentations were even more vivid, and it seems incomprehensible to them and  frankly, to me, that knowing our enemy’s capability we will place our  troops  in harm’s  way  of  enemy-constructed death zones of the 21st Century with 20th Century technology. We talked all year long about morale and retention. Our pilots are the best trained fighters in the world, and they would fly anything into battle for their country, now to come home only to find cuts in their top priority in Congress, turning congressional commitment into a hollow promise for them. For them, this is not some frill. This is not some back bench item. This is their very future. Our great leader, the gentleman from Missouri  (Mr. GEPHARDT),  has  eloquently referred to issues that impact everyday  people  as  kitchen  table issues. Across kitchen tables of our Air Force pilots, spouses wonder why, with our  surplus, why  given  their  outstanding valor, we place their husbands and wives at risk. Across the kitchen tables in my own hometown, for the people who work at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, who wonder why, with the largest defense budget in recent memory, why they will be laid off after competing for and winning an engine contract that the Air Force assured them would be built, why is the House cutting what the Air Force assured would be their top priority. In so many ways, Mr. Chairman, this is a great defense budget, and it has done much for our troops and it has done much more the defense of this Nation. Members are going to bring home much to their districts, but for me over the break I will be sitting down across kitchen tables, on shop floors, in living rooms, trying to explain to people I grew up with, my neighbors, that their fate lies in the hands of a conference committee. It is my sincere hope that this end story will be one we can be proud of, but I cannot, in good conscience, vote for this bill. Mr. Chairman, I rise to address a very serious  issue of national security raised by  the cutting of the F–22 and virtual elimination of the number one priority of the U.S. Air Force. Let me  first acknowledge and  thank  the leadership of the Armed Services Committee and  the  fine  job  that Mr. SPENCE and Mr. SKELTONhave done and I commend them for the mark on the F–22. The issue of cost associated with the program is one the committee ",1999
411,House,106,0.384,73,1999-07-22,Mr. METCALF.," Mr.  Chairman,  I thank the chairman  for yielding me the time. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the continuation of the procurement of the F–22 because it is vital to the continued air dominance for the United States. Mr. Chairman, air superiority has become the essential piece of military action, and the F–22 will guarantee our success into the next century. This program must remain on schedule to ensure that the U.S. forces responsible to keep this country’s vital interests safe have the absolute best technology available. The proliferation of advanced surface-to-air weapons, systems as seen in Kosovo, serve to underscore the need for the F–22 now. At a time when we are uniquely aware of the challenges and demands placed on our military, we must go forward with this program. I ask my colleagues to support the F– 22. ",1999
412,House,106,0.36,143,1999-07-22,Mr. EHRLICH.," Mr. Speaker, over the last 24 hours we have sure heard it all from the floor of this House. The usual class warfare, us  versus  them;  the usual class envy rhetoric concerning the rich. And how many folks watching the national TV right this second making $40,000 a year with a couple of kids know that they are rich, or making $50,000 a year with four children and believe they are rich? Very few, I suspect. We have seen revisionist history, Mr. Speaker,  in how we got to a, what seemed to be just a few years ago, permanent deficit situation in this country as the minority party controlled this House for 40 years. What we saw most of all, Mr. Speaker, however, was a great sense of frustration because the Speaker and this majority have moved a bill to return money to the people, to the pockets of the people, a comprehensive package that rewards married couples, senior citizens, working families, the self-employed schools, and distressed neighborhoods. The Republican tax relief plan improves the lives, Mr. Speaker, of all Americans. One of the most unfair provisions in our present tax code, Mr. Speaker, is its treatment of married couples. They pay more in taxes simply because they choose to get married. The Republican plan ends this unfair so-called marriage penalty. It allows married couples to claim a standard deduction for a single taxpayer to the benefit of 42 million taxpayers. Families with single people also benefit. The Republican tax plan provides for a phased in 10 percent deduction in individual rates over the next 10 years. Taxpayers know best how  to  spend their own money. Washington needs to get out of the way and let taxpayers control their own money. That thought is why many of us were sent to Washington in the first place. The cost of education continues to rise. The Republican  plan  provides meaningful tax relief. First, our legislation increases from $500 to $2,000 the contribution limit for education savings accounts. Second, the bill permits private universities to offer prepaid tuition plans and exempts the earnings from all prepaid plans  from Federal taxation, a real good idea. Third, the plan eliminates the 60month limitation on the student loan interest  deduction. The Republican plan also addresses the basic brick and mortar issues associated with quality education. Unlike the President’s bad idea to take general fund revenue and build public schools, our public school construction initiative makes permanent statutory changes so that State and local governments issuing public school construction bonds can more easily  comply with  the appropriate rules. Similar  to education,  the cost of health care keeps rising. The Republican plan makes health care and longterm care more affordable and accessible to all Americans. Of particular significance, our plan allows a 100 percent deduction  for health care premiums and long-term care insurance premiums. It is about time. ",1999

425,Senate,106,0.361,199,1999-07-22,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. President, I thank  my  friend  from Wyoming. I doubt I  need 3 minutes.  When  this accounting  system was  adopted in the telecommunications industry way back in 1935, and it evolved  through the years, we did not foresee  the advances of technology and the  need to change equipment would happen in that area as fast as it is happening now. New technology is coming  on  line. If there  is a holdup  in the  buildout of this technology, of maybe  some of our locally owned companies—  and some of our cooperatives as cooperatives, I doubt, will be affected by  this —it is so we can get rid of some of  this old equipment we carry on the  books because it is not all depreciated  out. It has not kept pace with the technology.  There was, a couple of years ago—it  was more than that, 5 or 6 years ago,  with then-Senator Brown  from ColoOFFICER. Who  rado—offered an amendment to standardize accounting clear  through  the  Government. We did not get that done.  But nonetheless here is an old accounting system that is very important to  the high-tech area when it comes to  buildout in the rural area, so broad-  band technologies can be deployed and  get rid of some of the old equipment  still on the books.  This  amendment needs  passing.  I  yield the floor and thank my friend  from Wyoming.  The  PRESIDING  yields time?  ",1999
426,Senate,106,-0.241,206,1999-07-22,Mr. BRYAN.,"  I thank the managers of the bill for  their willingness to accept this.  What this amendment would do is restore the funding for the Edward Byrne  Memorial Grant Program to the fiscal  year 1999 level. In the bill before us, the  Byrne grant was cut by $100 million  from the fiscal year 1999 level; I might  point out, on a bipartisan basis. This  was cut first by the President. It was  kept in as the bill came to the floor.  I am grateful  they accepted  this  amendment because these grants go directly to local and State law enforcement. For fiscal year 1999, $552 million  was distributed to State and local law  enforcement agencies  through Byrne  grants. But  for  fiscal year 2000, the  Byrne grant was cut by  the White  House and by the initial actions before  we got to the floor by more than 18 percent. This amendment would restore  the fiscal year 1999 funding level for  the Byrne program.  The Byrne program  is one of the  most successful Federal anticrime programs ever. It pays for drug enforcement task  forces, more cops on the  streets,  improved  technology,  and  countless other valuable antidrug and  anticrime efforts in local communities.  Restoring the Byrne funds is a top  priority of law enforcement groups who  know the impact the program has had  on crime and drugs. The National Association of Police Organizations, the National Sheriffs’ Association, and the  International Association  of Police  Chiefs have all contacted me, urging  full funding of this program.  I have received dozens of letters from  Iowa police chiefs and sheriffs describing the kinds of setbacks they would  suffer if these cuts go through. The  Byrne grant provides critical staff and  resources for Iowa’s 24 drug enforcement task forces working to stem the  methamphetamine epidemic in the region.  Iowa and  the Midwest have made  great strides in reducing methamphetamine production and supply over the  last few years. The proposed cuts to  the Byrne program would only  set  them back in their uphill battle.  Sgt. Tom Andrew, head of the Southeast  Iowa  Inter-Agency Drug Task  Force that covers six rural counties,  wrote me saying that his task force  was made possible through the Byrne  grant. Without it, most of the small  agencies in that region would lack the  manpower, funds, training, and technology necessary to combat the methamphetamine problem. Sergeant Andrew said:  A  funding cut of this magnitude would  have a detrimental effect on our program  and would, in all probability, result in the  elimination of the task force.  I have heard this story over and over  again from my contacts in Iowa. These  drug task forces are funded primarily  by the Byrne grants, and they are desperately needed to  fight our State’s  battles against methamphetamine use.  I know this is the case in most States  across the country.  We just cannot afford to have an 18-  percent cut in the Byrne grants in our  States next year. It makes no sense to  cut such a successful program that directly benefits our local communities.  I thank the managers for accepting  this amendment, and I trust we will  keep the Byrne memorial grants at  least at the same level next year as  they were this year.  Again, I thank my colleague  from  Kansas also for his strong support of  this program. I yield the floor.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  HAGEL). The Senator from Kansas.  ",1999
427,Senate,106,-0.318,220,1999-07-22,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr.  President,  the  amendment  seeks  to  deter  violent  crime borne out of prejudice and hatred. Since  1991, almost  50,000 hate  crimes have been voluntarily reported  to the FBI. More than 8,000 were reported in l997 alone, and many more  probably occurred.  I am of the view that violent hate  crimes stain our national greatness.  This amendment cannot erase the stain  entirely, but it is a step toward removing  the  immunity  from prosecution  that perpetrators have enjoyed for too  long.  The amendment will close the loopholes  in current  federal hate crimes  law  and  remove  the  straightjacket  from local law enforcement so they can  get federal help when they need it.  The amendment does three things:  First, it would remove restrictions  on the types of situations in which the  Justice Department can prosecute defendants for violent crimes based on  race, color, religion or national origin.  Second, it would assure that crimes  targeted against victims because of  disability, gender or sexual orientation  that cause death or bodily injury can  be prosecuted if there is a sufficient  connection to interstate commerce.  Third, it would require the Attorney  General to certify in writing that she  had consulted with State and local law  enforcement and that they had asked  for federal help, or did not have jurisdiction or, as in current law, that federal prosecution is necessary to secure  substantial justice in eradicating hate-  based crimes.  Under current law, the Justice Department can prosecute crimes motivated by race, religion and ethnicity  only if two tests are satisfied. First,  DoJ must prove bias was the motive.  Second, DoJ must prove  the perpetrator  intended to prevent the  individual  from doing  certain  federally  protected things, such as serving on a  jury, enrolling or attending a public  school, or applying for or enjoying employment.  Motive for the crime is a matter for  the jury to determine. And, as is the  case for every element of a criminal offense, DoJ would have to prove motive  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt. Motive  plays the same rule under federal and  state anti-discrimination  laws as  it  does under the current  federal hate  crimes law. My amendment does not  affect this.  It is the second test which has prevented the  law  from reaching many  cases where individuals kill or injure  others because of racial or religious hatred. In 1994, a jury acquitted 3 white  supremacists who had assaulted 3 African-Americans. Jurors revealed after  the trial that they felt racial animus  had been established but not that the  defendants intended to prevent the victims from participating in a federally  protected activity. My amendment addresses this limitation.  Under my amendment, DoJ would  still have to satisfy the first test and  prove beyond a reasonable doubt that  bias was  involved. But  in cases of  crimes motivated by race, religion and  ethnicity, DoJ would no longer be limited to those situations where the victim was engaged in or enjoying a federally protected activity.  In 1996, 88 current members of the  Senate voted to support a similar provision in the Church Arson Prevention  Act.  Under my amendment,  federal  involvement in prosecuting crimes based  on  sexual  orientation,  disability  or  gender AND where bodily  injury or  death result would be limited to those  instances where the violent crime has a  sufficient connection with  interstate  commerce.  This provision is critical for the 28  states that have no authority to prosecute bias-motivated crimes based on  disability or sexual orientation, and for  the 29 states that have no authority to  prosecute bias-motivated crimes based  on gender, like the Son of Sam serial  killings in New York.  The amendment would provide two  levels of penalties in all cases of hate  crimes:  1. Imprisonment up to 10 years for  persons who cause bodily  injury, or  through the use of fire, firearms or explosives, attempts to cause bodily injury; and  2. Imprisonment up to life if death results or  if the offense  includes kidnaping, aggravated sexual abuse or an  attempt to commit aggravated sexual  abuse, or an attempt to kill.  Some believe that every crime is a  hate crime. Every crime is tragic, but  not all crime is based on hate. A hate  crime occurs when the perpetrator intentionally chooses the victim because  of who the victim is. A hate crime affects not only the victim but an entire  community or group of people.  Some believe this amendment would  provide special protection to certain  groups. But it is perpetrators who intentionally single out victims because  of who they are in an attempt to send  a chilling message to society or others  in that group of people.  Some argue that hate crimes laws  threaten free speech. Hate crimes laws  punish  violent  acts, not  beliefs  or  thoughts, no matter how violent those  thoughts or beliefs might be. Nothing  in this amendment would prohibit or  deny  the  lawful expression of one’s  deeply held religious beliefs.

428,Senate,106,0.552,248,1999-07-22,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to rise today to lend my support for the inclusion of $15,000,000 million for the Oklahoma City National  Memorial Institute for the Prevention  of Terrorism. This important funding  brings to completion the creation of  the Oklahoma City National Memorial  Trust as specified by PL. 104–58.  During the 104th Congress, we created the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust  to  commemorate  the  bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The  Oklahoma City National Memorial will  consist of three components: the actual  Memorial, an interactive learning museum, and the Memorial Institute now  funded in this legislation.  Fundraising for the symbolic Memorial and the Memorial Center is nearly  complete and construction for the symbolic Memorial is complete. With the  funding provided  in  this  legislation,  the Memorial Institute is one step closer to a reality. Already, an implementation plan for the Memorial Institute  is complete and work has begun to prepare for the construction.  In preparation, the Oklahoma City  National Memorial Foundation and the  Oklahoma City Memorial Trust have  entered  into a partnership with the  Oklahoma Alliance for Public Policy  Research to establish an operational  relationship  for the Memorial  Institute. The Alliance consists of all of  Oklahoma’s  research  universities  (Oklahoma State, University of Oklahoma, and Tulsa University), while the  University  of  Oklahoma  Health  Sciences Center will perform the administrative and functional duties as  directed by  the  Institute’s management team.  The Alliance meets the joint public-  private partnership arrangement provided for in the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust Act. This joint  partnership is both prudent and necessary as Oklahoma and the nation begins to consider the broader implications of domestic terrorism.  The Memorial Institute will be the  only institute of its kind in the nation  dedicated to understanding, deterring,  and mitigating against terrorism. Naturally, it is only fitting that such a  center is located in Oklahoma given  our close, personal relationship with  domestic terrorism. Yet this Memorial  Institute will go beyond being just another reminder of the tragic event that  struck Oklahoma and the nation early  in the morning of April 19, 1995.  The Memorial Institute will also provide a collaboration and exchange of  knowledge between public and private,  Federal and state, and military and civilian efforts to counter terrorism. Another important issue that will be researched at the Memorial Institute is  how to better coordinate and integrate  health care and medical efforts associated with our response to terrorism.  This collaborative research on emerging  counter-terrorism  projects will  lend key insights to ensuring that the  events of April 19 never occur again.  Mr. President, I thank the Chairman,  Senator GREGG, and the Ranking Member, Senator HOLLINGS, for efforts to  secure this important funding for the  Memorial Institute. Their efforts will  long be remembered by the researchers  who spend time at the Memorial Institute and  the American public who  stand to gain countless benefits from  their research. Oklahoma and the Nation thank them.  f  COMMENDING A NAVAL AVIATOR  ",1999

430,,106,-0.658,353,1999-07-22,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my good friend and distinguished colleague, Congressman George Brown of California’s 42nd Congressional District. I worked alongside of Representative Brown  for 33 years and will remember his service to Congress as one dedicated to improving the quality of life not only for his constituents but for all of us. George Brown started off his illustrious career not as the public servant we remember him by, but as a young student in the 1930’s. It was on the campus of the University of California at Los Angeles where he began his crusade for a better nation by organizing the first integrated campus housing. Being  the great leader he was, George was the first to integrate UCLA’s housing by taking on an AfricanAmerican  roommate. Later  in his  life Representative Brown was proud to continue his push for civil rights when he voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A picture of George, President Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. hung on his wall as a constant reminder to the signing of that act into law. Upon graduating from UCLA with a degree in Industrial Physics, Brown put his degree to good use with the City of Los Angeles. It was there that he helped organize the city’s workers and its veteran’s housing projects. Then in 1954 George Brown won his first election as a member of the city council in Monterey Park, CA. One year later in 1955 he became mayor of the same city. The dedication he held for the issues dearest to him kept Brown moving as he was elected to the California State Assembly in 1958. As a member of the state assembly Brown introduced an environmentally friendly piece of  legislation  that called  for a ban on lead in gasoline, the first ever of its kind. What we later learned is that this was only  the beginning of George’s  fight  for a cleaner, safer environment. In 1962 George Brown ran for the 29th district in California. He won the House seat easily that year beating his opponent by an 11 percentage  point margin. Serving  on  the House Committee  on Science  and Aeronautics, Brown was a staunch supporter of the advancement of the space program and the pursuit of technology that would improve all of our  lives. George believed  that  technology should be  included  in  the education of our children and worked hard to accomplish this goal  throughout his career.  In more  recent years Congressman Brown was  found supporting international scientific cooperation and attempting  to establish  joint  research programs between the United States, Russia and Mexico. During the 1960’s and into the 1970’s, Congressman Brown was a strong voice in protest to the Vietnam War. He argued that the no matter how  long we  fought and how many troops we sent over to Vietnam, we could not find world peace from a war that was slaughtering peasants. Throughout the war, he tried time and again to get the attention of the nation. One  such  time  found Representative Brown outside on  the steps of  the Capitol Building demanding  that  if  the police were going to arrest 13 peaceful war protesters for disturbing the peace, then they should arrest him too. When I think back to this time I’m reminded of the group that Bob Kastenmeier from Wisconsin, Don Edwards from California, George, myself and several others formed to stop the war effort. After the release of the Pentagon Papers our efforts in the group intensified to bring an end to the war, perhaps the hardest worker of all of us being George. As hard as he fought the Vietnam War, perhaps the issue closest to the Honorable Congressman’s heart was the environment. It was Representative Brown who  first  spoke out against the dangers of burning fossil fuel. It was George Brown teaching the nation about the harmful effects of freon in the ozone layer. It was Brown again telling us that we had better keep an eye on the global climate change for our sake and the sake of our children. And then it was Congress, following his lead, enacting provisions  in  the Clean Air Act  that would help  the nation monitor  the  levels of these pollutants in our air and keep a watchful eye on the ever-changing world climate. One of  Representative  Brown’s most  notable achievements was  the work he put  into  the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. Through this agency we can rest assured, knowing the policies of the fine Congressman from California will be followed through as he would want them. In looking back at George Brown’s life, we look back at a life dedicated to promoting the beliefs of a man that was committed to making the world a better, cleaner, more peaceful place  for us  to  live. His hard work on  the tough issues will be missed, but most of all we will simply miss  the strong-willed,  intelligent, caring man that George Brown was. f CELEBRATING THE REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENTS  OF WOMEN  IN SPORTS AND THE SUCCESS OF TITLE XI HON.

431,,106,-0.31,360,1999-07-22,Mr. KLINK.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  in order to honor my longtime friend, Mr. Joseph E. Beasley. On June 30th, Mr. Beasley retired from the International Union of Operating Engineers, bringing  to a close a career  that spanned five decades. After serving his country in the military, Mr. Beasley  joined  the work  force  in Pittsburgh. Soon after, he  joined  the Union and began what would become a 49 year association with the Operating Engineers. Mr. Beasley served in a wide variety of capacities during this tenure, distinguishing himself through dedication and hard work. Mr. Beasley’s career began with his election to the position of Financial Secretary for the Local Union in 1972. He held this position until his 1981 election to Business Manager, a seat he held until his retirement.  In addition, Mr. Beasley served as Vice-President of the Pittsburgh Building Trades Counsel and Chairman of the Local 66 Pension and Annuity and Welfare Funds. In addition to his work on the local level, Mr. Beasley also served as an International Trustee and the eleventh General Vice President of the  International Union of Operating Engineers. Most recently, he served as the VicePresident of the Pennsylvania AFL–CIO and as Secretary Treasurer of  the Northeastern States Conference of Operating engineers. Mr. Beasley’s accomplishments  throughout his career have gained him the respect and admiration of his colleagues. He has proven himself a great asset to not only the state of Pennsylvania but also hard working men and women across this country. Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  thank Mr. Beasley for all his efforts throughout his nearly fifty year career.  I wish him  the best  in his much deserved retirement. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON.

JIM SAXTON OFNEWJERSEY INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Thursday, July 22, 1999 ",1999
432,,106,0.238,360,1999-07-22,Mr. SAXTON.," Mr. Speaker, we know  that today our armed  forces are  facing serious shortfalls in recruitment. Already, these shortfalls are having a dangerous  impact on our Nation’s military readiness. We will have all the best tools, and no one to fight the war. In part, the problem may be caused by a blessing: America’s  flourishing  economy, which leads our young people  to enter a booming job market rather  than  the rigors of military service. Therefore, it is essential for our national security  that our government do all  it can to support our armed forces in effectively communicating to young people of recruitment age the advantages and benefits of service. Honor, patriotism, and the desire for adventure  still  engage  and motivate America’s young men and women. America’s armed forces offer the opportunity to be part of something meaningful,  to  learn self-discipline and sacrifice. For many  idealistic young people, that offers  them an experience unmatchable elsewhere. So we have to get the message out about what service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines means  to  their country, and what opportunities such service entails. And we must recognize that in today’s world, we are competing with some of the most effective marketing and recruitment techniques ever devised by U.S. companies, which quite reasonably want to catch as many of the best and the brightest as they can for themselves. Therefore,  it  is esssential  that we convey our message by  the most effective means possible, employing language and images engaging  to  young Americans of  recruitment age. Programming messages by  the U.S. Navy have scored significant  recruiting success in recent months, partially reversing the downward  trend of Navy  recruitment. Programming directed  toward high school students  for post-graduation enlistment can be particularly well targeted and unusually effective means of  increasing awareness of  the military service option and positive attitudes towards it. As a result of this exposure, students in the Channel One schools are more likely to consider enlisting. Mr. Speaker, the use of innovative methods to educate and encourage young people about the benefits of service to their country is essential  in  today’s marketplace. Our national security demands such an effort. At the same time, service in the United States military truly provides young Americans with an opportunity to gain by giving to their country. I intend to work hard to ensure that our government expands its support for our armed forces’ efforts in this direction. f CONGRATULATING THE SULPHUR ALL STAR BASEBALL TEAM HON.

State laws governing alcohol shipping and distribution must be followed and enforced. This bill ensures that States have the tools needed to fully  enforce  their  laws,  especially those governing the distribution of alcohol to minors. This bill will ensure that States have legal recourse against alcohol distributors who deliberately seek to violate State laws. Any vintner, retailer, or ",1999

American workers should not have to wait for OSHA to proceed with its ergonomic standards. In fact, 16 years ago while an MBA student, we as future employees and employers were studying ergonomic standards and what to do in the work area. This is not new. Scientists and researchers have documented over and over again that musculoskeletal disorders, or MSDs, are related to workplace risk factors. These disorders affect people of all types of occupations, laborers, nurses, accountants, and many of us here know about the injuries personally. For example, my  first  job  in high school was scooping ice cream 20 hours a week, 6 years. That job involved the same motion over and over and over again 20 hours a week. I still have problems with one of my wrists today. It is estimated that every year, over 600,000 workers  suffer  from work-related MSDs. For many workers, these injuries are debilitating, causing constant and intense pain. It is estimated that these work-related injuries cost employers between $15 and $20 billion a year in workers’ compensation. We need to allow OSHA to proceed with  its ergonomic standards.  I ask that my colleagues vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. ",1999

The amendment would cut off  funding  for the World Heritage Convention and the Man in the Biosphere program. I think this would be a mistake.  It could set back  important programs  for protection of  internationally-important cultural, historical, and environmental resources. It’s claimed that these programs are a threat to Congress’ authority over federal lands, but in fact they don’t lessen that authority. They also don’t affect any other part of the Constitution, or any private property rights. Let me repeat—these programs don’t have an effect on those rights. But the amendment would have an effect. It would undermine America’s international leadership  in environmental conservation and  in the protection of historical and cultural  resources. So, I think this amendment is bad for our country—and I know it’s bad for Colorado. In Colorado, we have several Biosphere Reserves—areas that are part of the Man in the Biosphere program. One  is  the Niwot Ridge Research area. Another  is Rocky Mountain National Park. This amendment could  terminate their participation in the program. Earlier this year, I asked Professor William Bowman,  the Director of  the University of Colorado’s Mountain Research Station, about the significance of Niwot Ridge’s participation in the program. He explained that having Niwot Ridge in the Biosphere Reserve System had provided a framework for international cooperation in important research efforts, including work with a Biosphere Reserve in the Czech Republic to address air pollution problems—a matter of great importance to Colorado as well as to the Czechs. He also told me that the Biosphere Reserve program had been helpful  to  the people at Niwot Ridge as they worked with the Forest Service  to develop a  land-management plan that would promote multiple use by minimizing conflicts between recreational, scientific, and other uses—again, a matter of great  importance  to Colorado  and  other  public  land states. I also contacted the National Park Service, to find out what it meant to have Rocky Mountain National Park  included as a Biosphere Reserve. They told me that it not only meant more research activities occurred in the park, but also that it meant a significant increase in park visitation—tourism that not only provides important educational benefits for the visitors but also provides important economic benefits to Colorado.

452,,106,-0.513,205,1999-08-03,Mrs. MINK of Hawaii.," Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my support for the Moakley amendment to H.R. 2606, Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2000. The Moakley  amendment would  prohibit funding for the United States Army School of the Americas (SOA) located in Fort Benning, GA—a school which has produced some of the most notorious human rights violators in Latin America. Currently $20 million of  the U.S. taxpayers money goes to train approximately 2,000 Latin American soldiers in military techniques, ostensibly to advance respect for civil authority and human rights. Supporters of the SOA claim this school is a key foreign policy tool for the U.S. in Latin America and the Caribbean, helping to shape the region’s  leadership  in ways  favorable  to American  interests.  They  assert  that  the school has played a constructive role in promoting democracy in Latin America over the last decade; in reducing the flow of illicit drugs to the United States; and in emphasizing respect for human rights and civilian control of the military through their academic curriculum. In fact, the SOA has repeatedly proven its disregard for human rights and democratic values. In a school professing  to advance democratic values and human rights, only 15 percent of  the courses offered  relate  to  these subjects. Less than 10 percent of the student body enroll in these courses. Only 8 percent of  students enroll  in  the  counter-narcotics course  in any given year. Dozens of  those who have taken this course have been tied to drug trafficking. With the help of courses such as ‘‘Methods of Torture’’ and ‘‘Murder 101,’’ the SOA has produced apt pupils. When six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her daughter were murdered on November 16, 1989  in El Salvador, 19 of the 26 implicated in the murders were graduates of the SOA. Two of the three officers  responsible  for  the assassination of pacifist Archbishop Romero went to the SOA. The officer who commanded the massacre of 30 defenseless peasants in the Colombian village of Mapiripan graduated from the SOA. Panamanian  dictator  and  drug  kingpin Manuel Antonio Noriega is one of the SOA’s distinguished alumni. These atrocious examples of terror and violence exhibit the extent to which the SOA has violated human rights and undermined democratic values  throughout  the Western hemisphere. Clearly, officers who attended SOA ",1999

Ms. Crawford is to be commended for her accomplishment and is, in my opinion, very deserving of this honor. Ms. Crawford is sixteen years old and is a senior at Woodlawn High School  in Baton Rouge. She sets the example for many of her classmates by being involved in both the Student  Government  Association  and  the Woodlawn High School track team. Not only has Ms. Crawford been a positive example  to her peers at Woodlawn High School as a scholar, a student leader, and an athlete, she is also a shining example to her community. Ms. Crawford, in her spare time, is an active member of St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, the Louisiana National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the African American Christian Youth Organization, and the Baton Rouge Area Girl Scouts of America. In addition to her involvement with these community organizations, Ms. Crawford also volunteers her time with the Volunteens as well as  teaching  the proper handling of horses at a local camp, Camp Marydale. Mr. Speaker, Ms. Crawford represents everything that is right with our youth in America. At a time when the news regarding our young people is so disturbing, and quite frankly depressing, it is refreshing to take the time to look at young women like Ms. Crawford who not only recognize the need to excel in their studies, but also recognize  the need  to become involved in society at large. I am proud to know that she is a constituent in Louisiana’s Sixth Congressional District and I am proud to have  this  opportunity  to  recognize  her achievements. Mr. Speaker, I know that you and all of my colleagues  in  the House of Representatives join  in congratulating Ms. Tammara Deane’ Crawford upon her selection as a 1999 Debutante of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. I know that she has made her parents, Eddie and Myra, and her sister and brother, Taylor and Timothy very proud. f WILLIE  MORRIS,  FAMED  MISSISSIPPI WRITER PASSES AWAY HON. RONNIE SHOWS OFMISSISSIPPI INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, August 3, 1999 ",1999
454,,106,-0.092,212,1999-08-03,Mr. SHOWS.," Mr. Speaker,  this morning  I stand before you, my colleagues and  the American people with sad news. One of our nation’s greatest artists has passed away. Yesterday, Willie Morris died. Willie lived in my district down in Jackson. Willie will always live, Mr. Speaker,  in  the  hearts  of  thousands around our planet who have read his words discovering a world of penetrating wit, warm memories, and prose that can bring the angels to earth and soothe our longings to connect with our broader world. Willie Morris grew up  in Yazoo City. We know about small town America in the 1950’s because Willie  told us about  it. He  told us about childhood friends like Bubba and Henjie. And he let us remember the loving wags and pants of childhood pets like his beloved dog Skip. We remember an America that only children can recall; an America of simple dreams poised to enter the turbulent period we call the sixties. Willie’s memories were our memories—Christmas with Uncle Percy in Jackson, the smell of turkey and talk of baseball, high school  football on cool autumn nights, and those first dates with sweaty palms and nervous laughs. How can we thank Willie Morris enough for putting our memories on paper? Willie gave us the sixties as a student at the University of Texas and a Rhodes Scholar in England. We came of age with Willie as he recalled campus ramblings and long road trips. Willie Morris told us about the reality of America and being a young person finding his place in the greater American family. We see ourselves seeking  to understand and  find our places in the words of Willie. When Willie Morris became editor of Harper’s Magazine, he was the youngest to do so in their history. He led Harper’s through the late 1960’s and early 1970’s with courage and honesty. He addressed the tough issues of the day and refused to cave in to conventionality for the sake of getting along. We met Truman Capote, Bill Styron,  and  so many  others through Willie’s essays.  In broadening his world, ours was enlarged as well. Following his years in New York, Willie became Writer-in-Residence at Ole Miss and finished his years in Jackson. His commitment in encouraging and bringing out the best of Mississippi’s collective nature was impactful and profound. He mentored and gave us new Southern writers like Donna Tartt. Willie made us laugh at ourselves. He brought us together as one. I  think Willie Morris  let us embrace our Southernness in the context of being a member of the entire American family. In his prose, Willie was honest about himself and his culture. Yet while embracing  the  truth, Willie made us proud of our accomplishments, our potential and ourselves. He was a visionary who could make the past alive and relevant while caring for the people and events of the present. We will always remember and have Willie Morris at our side. We will read the pages of North Toward Home, The Courtship of Marcus Dupree, My Dog Skip, and his many other books and essays with a reverence and realization of our place in the world. Willie Morris was our bridge between past and present, and our voice for the better angels in us all. He always will be. ",1999
455,House,106,-0.438,3,1999-09-08,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the community development block grant program. This program has put local development decision in the hands of those who know best, those who live and work in the community. This  long-term commitment to responsible flexibility has paid off leveraging $2.31 for every Federal dollar  spent. Unfortunately, Republicans have chosen to commemorate 25 years of job creation and increased affordable housing by stripping the block grant program of $250 million in the Fiscal Year 2000 VA HUD appropriations bill. In Lorain, Ohio, a community struggling with loss of industry and experiencing rents as much as 50 percent of income these cuts instantly translate into a loss of jobs, jobs that would have been created next year through mutually  beneficial  community  improvement and construction projects. It defies common sense to deny people in Lorain, Ohio and across the country the chance to support their families and improve their communities just so Republicans can afford to give more tax breaks to the rich. I encourage my colleagues to vote against this legislation. f THE CRISIS IN EAST TIMOR (Mr. UNDERWOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

The most important decision Congress and the President can make is to send our young men and women to war. An all-volunteer military sometimes makes it easier for the President to use the military forces liberally. The draft and Selective Service ensure that we should only go to war when it is of vital concern to our national security. At a time when our military services are failing to meet recruiting and retention goals, it is foolhardy and risky to eliminate the Selective Service System—a proven means of providing personnel to the Armed Forces during times of emergency. The men and women of our allvolunteer armed  forces have performed superbly since  its  inception. The all-volunteer force is a strong force, but it is also a fragile force. It relies on recruiting and retaining quality people. Our armed forces have been reduced to the point where the military struggles to meet all the commitments we place on it. It should be noted that during the recent air war in Kosovo, the Air Force announced a ‘‘stop ",1999

462,House,106,0.339,73,1999-09-08,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon.," Mr. Speaker, last weekend I had the great fortune of visiting with the ranchers and individual citizens who  live on and around Steens Mountain  in Harney County. I traveled many miles over a majestic loop road that takes in the magnificent views of the vistas overlooking the Kiger Gorge and the Alvord Desert and the Little Blitzen Gorge. I also flew over these breathtaking areas and actually got on a horse and rode to the ridgetops of the Roaring Springs Ranch to look at the Steens Mountains. Many  individuals who  live on and around the mountain accompanied me as we looked at the management and multiple  uses  occurring  on  Steens Mountain. These  farmers,  ranchers, guides and others are the ones whose livelihoods would be significantly affected by actions of  those who are thousands of miles away, those who perhaps have never seen the Steens or set foot on its soil. Let me tell my colleagues like Steve Hammond, who is the latest generation in his family to ranch and raise his family on the Steens or Fred Otley, who works early mornings and  late nights on his  family’s ranch taking care of the cattle while handling the politics of the mountain, all the while seeking new and improved range management techniques or Dan Nichols, a rancher and county commissioner who is  involved  in  the  tourist  industry through his family’s bed and breakfast and an excellent one I must say, while still trying to manage the affairs of the county; Stacey Davies, a young ranch manager who with his wife Elaine is ",1999

471,,106,0.351,234,1999-09-08,Mr. KOLBE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise with pride to support the conference report on H.R. 2488, which provides a sizable tax cut for the American taxpayers. I am proud to give taxpayers back  their money  the  federal  government doesn’t need. That’s right; the federal government doesn’t need  it. Surplus means  the amount in excess of what we spend. And the federal government has and will have all  it needs plus enough to reform Social Security and Medicare and start paying down the debt, and still leave a small amount to return to the folks who are sending their hard-earned dollars to Washington, DC. Within hours of  the announcement of  the conference agreement, my office began  receiving letters from groups opposing this tax cut. And what are they saying? Don’t give the money back; spend more money on my program. The Minority  Leader  suggests  that  the amount we’re giving back is too much; that we have to save the surplus so we have money available for entitlement reform. Didn’t he hear that we’re using $3 to save Social Security and Medicare,  to  fund programs and to pay down the debt, for each $1 we are giving back to the taxpayers? President Clinton says he’ll talk about giving a tax cut after we provide for Medicare, debt reduction and federal spending. Didn’t he hear? This bill gives $3 of the surplus to Social Security, Medicare, government programs, and debt reduction for every $1 of the surplus  that  it  leaves with  the  taxpayer. Makes one worry about what he has in mind for federal spending. Is he thinking about more and bigger government programs? Mr.  Speaker,  American  taxpayers  have been paying and paying and paying. The typical American family pays more in taxes than on food, clothing and shelter combined. Our tax burden from all government is the highest since we were  financing a world war  in  the 40s. In fact, without this tax relief bill, the average American household will pay $5,307 more in taxes over the next 10 years than the government needs to operate. We have a good economy; unemployment is at record lows. We don’t need more government. We do need to scrutinize programs and divert dollars from ineffective and wasteful programs to areas that need additional funding. But we don’t need to increase the size of government. Individuals have the right to choose how to spend their money. They can choose to tutor their kids, or replace a furnace or air conditioner, or help an elderly parent, or support a favorite charity, or even save it for their own retirement. They shouldn’t have it taken from their paycheck before they even see it so that government can use it to fund yet another program. One administration official called these taxpayers selfish. I call the groups who want to spend more of the taxpayers’ money selfish. I urge my colleagues  to vote  for  this bill. Let’s return a small share of the surplus to the taxpayers. It belongs to them. f THE NATIONWIDE GUN BUYBACK ACT OF 1999 HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON OFTHEDISTRICTOFCOLUMBIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, September 8, 1999 ",1999

This statement  was made in reference to S. 1364, the  Promoting Responsible Fatherhood Act  of 1999.  The statement follows.  REMARKS BY THE HONORABLE PEDRO  ROSSELLO´, GOVERNOROFPUERTORICOAND  CO-LEADGOVERNORONFATHERHOOD INTHE  NATIONALGOVERNORS’ ASSOCIATION, DELIVEREDATAMEETINGOFTHECOMMITTEEON  HUMANRESOURCESOFTHENATIONALGOVERNORS’ ASSOCIATION, SAINT LOUIS, MISSOURI, AUGUST8, 1999  Thank you, Mister Chairman.  Governor Tom Ridge and I are extremely  enthusiastic about the duties we have been  discharging as the N–G–A’s Lead Governors  on Fatherhood.  And in that regard, I certainly want to acknowledge the superb collaboration that we  have received from the colleagues who serve  with us as fellow members of the Governors’  Task Force on Fatherhood Promotion.  As has been documented by the N–G–A  Center for Best Practices, the efforts we’ve  been undertaking have yielded a rich harvest.  That harvest encompasses: An intensification of public awareness campaigns—in nearly all of the states and territories—to promote positive father involvement; a sharper  focus for programs, throughout the nation,  that are aimed at developing the parenting  skills of new fathers; and better targeted  support services for disadvantaged or non-  custodial fathers, so that they can learn how  to  improve their relationships with their  children.  During this past year, our Task Force also  expanded its outreach, while joining with the  National Fatherhood Initiative, as a co-sponsor of the 1999 National Summit on Supporting Urban Fathers.  At the event 2 months ago, we helped  spearhead the creation of a brand new Mayors’ Task Force on Fatherhood Promotion.  As a result, Governors and Mayors are now  pooling their resources and putting their  heads together on multi-sectoral approaches  that can meet the challenge of promoting responsible fatherhood in those urban communities where absenteeism and neglect place  very large numbers of children at risk.  We Governors can take considerable satisfaction in the progress we have made since  we last gathered to discuss the need for an  aggressive campaign to foster conscientious  fatherhood.  Nevertheless,  it remains a  fact that we  still have a long way to go in this important  quest to  improve the home environments  and—by  extension—the  learning  environments of countless thousands of girls and  boys and teenagers . . .all across America.  And with that  in mind, I strongly recommend that this Committee renew its support for N–G–A Policy H–R 28, on the subject  of Paternal Involvement in Child-Rearing.  However, I would also submit that we must  go further.  In addition to re-committing ourselves to a  policy statement which underscores our collective determination to enter the new millennium with stronger families and a brighter future for the nation’s young people, we  must likewise re-commit ourselves to a partnership with other  elected officials who  share those indispensable aspirations.  So it is that I hope each and every one of  us will emphatically endorse Congressional  enactment of the Responsible Fatherhood  Act of 1999.  This bill, introduced less than a month ago  by Senators EVANBAYHand PETEDOMENICI,  will empower states and communities with  new tools to encourage the formation—and  the maintenance—of two-parent households,  as well as the acceptance by absent fathers  of personal responsibility for their children.  This  bipartisan  legislation will  provide  states and communities with flexible funding  to promote responsible fatherhood, through  alliances with news media, charities, community-based organizations and religious institutions.  The bill will also amend the  ‘‘high-performance bonus’’ that was created by the  1996 Federal welfare  reform  statute;  the  amendment will establish that the formation  and maintenance  of  two-parent  families  shall henceforward be taken into account as  one of the factors considered when granting  bonuses to states that are successful in obtaining private-sector jobs for welfare recipients.  These and other provisions of the Responsible Fatherhood Act of 1999 will lend tangible support to our own pioneering efforts  on behalf of fatherhood promotion.  And I am confident that the initiatives  contemplated under this bill can be put into  effect without jeopardizing any of the existing appropriations that mean so much to our  states and communities.  In summary, then, I invite your attention  and your allegiance to both the renewal of  our N–G–A Policy-Plank, H–R 28, and to this  very  promising  new  Federal  legislation  measure.  That concludes what I hope we can agree  has been a report that was at once brief and  to the point.  Thank you very much, ",1999
474,Senate,106,-0.419,100,1999-09-16,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President, I am a  cosponsor of S. Con. Res. 53, a sense of  Congress resolution relating to the recent allegations of espionage and illegal  campaign  financing  that  have  brought into question the loyalty of individuals of Asian Pacific ancestry.  Mr. President, I am concerned about  the negative impact that the recent investigation of Wen Ho Lee, a scientist  at Los Alamos, New Mexico, is having  on the Chinese American community.  Certain recent media coverage of this  investigation has chosen  to portray  Chinese and Chinese Americans with a  broad brush, using loaded words that  are offensive and implying that certain  people should be treated with suspicion  solely because of their ethnicity or national origin. Cartoons exaggerate and  poke fun at physical appearances of individuals by depicting slanted eyes and  buck teeth.  In one particularly offensive example, a recent editorial in a Santa Fe,  New Mexico, newspaper made  fun of  Asian accents, unnecessarily referred  to the  ‘‘Fu Manchu’’ character, and  tried to link the allegations of stolen  nuclear secrets and the bombing of the  Chinese embassy in Belgrade.  Mr. President, Asian Pacific Americans are an important part of our body  politic. They have made  significant  contributions to politics, business, industry, science, sports, education, and  the arts. Men and women like the late  Senator Sparky Matsunaga, Olympic  Champion Kristi Yamaguchi, Architect  I.M. Pei, Maxine Hong Kingston, Ellison Onizuka, and many others have enhanced and invigorated the life of this  nation.  Asian Americans have played a fundamental part in making this country  what  it  is today. Asian  immigrants  helped build the great transcontinental  railroads of the 19th century. They labored on the sugar plantations of Hawaii, on the vegetable and fruit farms  of California, and in the gold mines of  the West. They were at the forefront of  the agricultural labor movement, especially  in  the  sugarcane  and  grape  fields, and were instrumental in developing the fishing and salmon canning  industries of  the Pacific Northwest.  They were importers, merchants, grocers,  clerks,  tailors, and gardeners.  They manned the assembly lines during America’s  Industrial Revolution.  They  opened  laundries,  restaurants,  and  vegetable markets.  They  also  served our nation in war: the famed all-  Nisei 100th/442nd combat team of World  War II remains the most decorated unit  in U.S. military history.

475,House,106,-0.324,3,1999-09-29,Mr. GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, the Republican leadership has unveiled yet another proposal they hope will derail the efforts for meaningful HMO reform. Just when a bipartisan majority has reached a consensus on real HMO reform with the Norwood-Dingell bill, the Republican leadership is once again proposing harmful provisions for Americans’ health. The American people want HMO reform. Instead of figuring out how to solve this, they just add poison pills to their proposed legislation. For months, we have been hearing from the Republicans that a Patients’ Bill of Rights will increase costs and open employers to lawsuits. Well, in my home State of Texas, we passed many of these patient protections; and we have not had any lawsuits against employers. In fact, the only increase that we have seen is the increase in prescription medication  that  other States have had to do. In fact, there has been no exodus of employers from providing healthcare  in Texas under Texas law. What Texas residents have is health care protection and provisions that should be included in a national law. They eliminate gag clauses, open access to specialists for women and children, a timely appeals process, coverage for emergency care, and accountability for those decision makers in healthcare. It is time to stop stonewalling and support a real Patients’ Bill of rights. f b1015 FISCAL DISCIPLINE IS FORGOTTEN WHENEVER  DEMOCRATS  HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE SPENDING (Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",1999
476,House,106,0.493,3,1999-09-29,Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland.," Mr. Speaker, why is it the Democrats want to bust  the budget caps  that  they themselves agreed to while at the same time they are opposed to giving tax relief to the taxpayers? On the one hand, they argue that we must relax our fiscal discipline and expand government. On the other hand, they argue that we must maintain  fiscal discipline and therefore cannot have tax relief. Leaving aside the many good arguments for tax fairness that the Republican tax relief proposal contains, let us consider what the Democrats are saying. New Washington spending, fine. Tax relief for the taxpayers, no way. Fiscal discipline is forgotten whenever Democrats have an opportunity to increase spending, but they are fiscal discipline’s best friend whenever tax relief is on the table. What is wrong with this picture? It is very simple. It is known as liberalism; never known, it must be said, for the rigor of its logic. Is there a liberal in the House that will step forward and defend their position? ject is guaranteeing a patients’ bill of rights with real teeth in it. We have a bipartisan agreement. We have  the Dingell-Norwood  bill  that makes sense. We are having a good discussion. Do not change the subject. Let us  stick with  the patients’ bill of rights. Let us pass a clean bill. Their ideas are not paid for. They should not be brought up in the context of this issue. Let us protect patients first, and then we will deal with some of these other issues. f WE MUST PROTECT THE SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUS (Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) ",1999
477,,106,0.458,10,1999-09-29,Mr. COMBEST.," Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman,  today we  consider H.R. 2559, the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 1999. This important legislation was approved by a voice vote in the subcommittee and the  full committee  and  enjoys  broad  bipartisan support  from colleagues representing farmers and ranchers from all regions of the country. Equally important, I am pleased to report that this bill fully complies within the budget resolution approved by the Congress earlier this year. As my colleagues know, this country’s farmers and ranchers are not experiencing the prosperity that other Americans enjoy today. Confronted by adverse weather and low prices, they are facing a second year of extreme economic crisis. Mr. Chairman, there are two ways a farmer or  rancher can  lose money. That is where a strong farm safety net is needed. The culprits are low prices and lost production, and, sadly, both of these culprits are at work again this year. On the price side of the equation, just as examples, cotton is expected to receive  the  lowest price  in  13 years; wheat the lowest in 22 years; and soybeans the lowest in a quarter century. Fortunately, in an effort to avert a financial disaster in farm country, the House and Senate are working together to provide an emergency farm relief package. Mr. Chairman, I believe the shortterm assistance provided in the fiscal year 2000 agricultural appropriations bill is urgently needed and will bring our Nation’s farmers and ranchers at least some peace of mind. But make no mistake, ad hoc relief of any kind will not bring about a long-term solution to chronic problems. That is why I have announced the committee’s intention to convene a series of hearings early next year to evaluate current and future American  farm policy. By providing our farmers and ranchers an opportunity to fully participate in this process, we will steer clear of the kind of fixes in farm policy that are made in haste and ultimately do more harm than good. On the other side of the equation, there  is something Congress can do now about severe crop losses that each year rob farmers and ranchers of their livelihood. After more than 8 months of input from farmers and ranchers on the problems with crop insurance, Congress is in a position to act. The Federal crop insurance program was created in 1938, but it was not a case where the government intruded on the private sector thinking it could do better.  Instead,  the  program  came about because countless private sector attempts at crop insurance had failed miserably. Without a Federal commitment, the widespread losses associated with natural  disasters would make something as fundamental as insurance protection simply unavailable to our farmers. Unfortunately, during its 61 years of existence,  this critical program has been both underfunded and seriously undermined by ad hoc disaster. This dual policy has fueled a vicious cycle that has not saved taxpayers money but cost them countless billions. By underfunding the crop insurance program, farmer-paid premiums have been unaffordable,  leading to a Nation of underinsured farmers at best and uninsured farmers at worst. For years, the practical effect of this policy has been that farmers who do not buy crop insurance or buy too little leave Congress little choice but to enact ad hoc disaster bills; and in the following year,  farmers who had  insured their crops the year before decide not to, trusting that Congress will once again come through. This vicious cycle has seriously undermined the crop insurance program. It has eroded program participation and  fueled the need  for Congress to ",1999
478,House,106,-0.103,17,1999-09-29,Mr. CONDIT.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2559, The Agricultural Risk Protection Act. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the chairman and ranking minority member of  the committee and my subcommittee chairman, Mr. EWING for  their efforts in developing this important bill. H.R. 2559 serves  the  interests of  farmers and ranchers by providing more choices and the tools needed to manage the risk inherent in farming. This is especially important to my constituents in the central valley of California, who rely on little Federal support or programs. Instead,  these producers  rely on other  risk management tools, such as diversified farming, irrigation, and responding to market signals to make their decisions. However, even these practices may not be enough for producers to protect themselves from factors beyond their control. New challenges are being faced  in  light of  the growing global marketplace and the increasing regulatory and social pressures to reduce farming inputs. I would like to point out there are currently over 300 specialty crop producers who do not have the choice to purchase insurance products—there are simply none available. Even worse, current specialty crop  insurance policies are either unusable or too costly because of high  input and sales value of specialty crops. While ad hoc disaster relief seems inevitable  this year  to assist U.S. Agriculture, Congress cannot continue  to use  taxpayer money and break budgetary caps. At  the same time, Congress cannot turn its back on those producers who are not eligible for Federal crop insurance and have had to rely on other forms of disaster relief protection. Not only is there a need to develop more risk management  tools,  farmers need  to be aware which financial, marketing, and production tools are available, both on and off the farm.  I believe  that H.R. 2559 provides  the necessary  resources and direction. This bill makes more management options available to underserved  commodities  in  the  following ways: increasing premium subsidies, increasing research and education funds, expedited product approval, expanded pilot program authority, producer and  industry-wide  input on policies,  allowing  farmers  to  join  together through their cooperatives and associations to obtain crop insurance. In these ways, the Risk Management Agency along with public and private  inputs can better address the unique challenges associated with the planting, growing, and harvesting of specialty crops. I thank Chairman COMBESTand his staff for all of their efforts to bring this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage. ",1999

Deputy Sheriff Eric Andrew Thach died Friday  in  the  line of duty  for his Riverside County community. We send our condolences and prayers to his family, neighbors and the community. Eric Thach was 34 years of age and employed with the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department  for  three years, since September 1996. He leaves behind his young wife, Evelyn, and daughter, Shana. He also leaves behind neighbors and a community that will miss his constant self-sacrifice, generosity and quiet demeanor. And, now  those  left behind must pull together to support and strengthen each other during the coming months and years as they heal. ‘‘Deputy Sheriff Eric Thach lived his life with strength and courage. He was a good man, taken from us too soon . . . He will live on in our memory and in the many respects paid to him  by  the  community,’’  stated Riverside County Sheriff Larry D. Smith. Eric Thach’s sacrifice will be further remembered as his name  is engraved next  to  the names of three fellow officers, also felled in the line of duty. The marker sits outside the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department as a reminder to us all of the selfless duty for law enforcement officers assume as they protect the people or Riverside County—a sacrifice  that we often take for granted. As Madam de Stael once said, ‘‘We understand death for the first time when he puts his hand upon  the one whom we love.’’ The National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial, though, says it the best, that ‘‘it is not how these officers died that made them heroes, it is how they lived.’’ Many of us can not truly understand the latent danger associated with the day to day routines of our law enforcement officers. They put themselves in the line of danger everyday as they stop a vehicle, respond  to an  incident or a suspicious circumstances—like Deputy Thach. The danger and violence they face day in and day out is very real and it is times like these—sadly— that make us stop and honor our law enforcement officers. We hope  that  they be given such honor, respect and thanks always—not only when  life’s  fragile nature  is  revealed. Deputy Eric Thach lived his life with this constantly in the forefront and his memory can be best served by us all doing the same. Mr. Speaker, we ask that you and our colleagues join us today to remember this fine deputy. On behalf of the residents of Riverside County, we extend our prayers and most heartfelt sympathy  to his  family and  loved ones. f BIPARTISAN  CONSENSUS  MANAGED CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999 SPEECHOF HON.

Collins Army Reserve Training Center, currently under construction at the old Sacramento Army Depot. Because of this great honor, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in acknowledgment of this event. This twenty million-dollar facility will provide training for 1,200–1,400 soldiers each month. These men and women will receive training in field medical surgical hospital techniques, field mess preparations, high tech communications, and other basic or advanced military occupational specialty training. The  lobby of  this new  training center will house the B.T. Collins Museum. This will provide a permanent home for many of the historical photographs, letters, uniforms, and other paraphernalia that B.T. Collins had collected throughout his Army and political careers. His sisters and friends will donate much of the collection. They will also work closely with  the military and the builders to insure that the museum will reflect B.T. Collins’ love of country, family and community service. On this extraordinary day, perhaps the most notable event will be the dedication of a bust of B.T. Collins to be placed at the entrance of this important facility. The artist, Garr Ugalde has been commissioned  to create  the bust, and he has presented a preliminary wax model of his work  that amazingly captures B.T. Collins in his green beret. This bust will be donated by his family and friends. B.T. Collins’  friends and  family made a promise that they would not allow his memory, patriotism, ideals, and contribution to his country to be forgotten. This memorial is one way to make good on that promise. It is their sincere hope that this museum will inspire soldiers  to emulate  the  ideals  that B.T. Collins espoused. Mr. Speaker, as  the  friends and  family of B.T. Collins gather to celebrate this landmark event, I am honored to pay tribute to one of Sacramento’s most outstanding citizens. B.T. Collins’ contributions to his community, state, and country are commendable. I am sincerely pleased that this museum and monument to this great man will preserve his memory for generations. I ask all of my colleagues to join with me in wishing B.T. Collins and his family continued success in all their endeavors. f CONGRATULATIONS ON THE FIRST ANNUAL NATIONAL RAISE THE ROOF DAY HON. NANCY PELOSI OFCALIFORNIA INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES Monday, October 25, 1999 ",1999
489,,106,-0.491,92,1999-10-25,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday President Clinton signed  the HUD–VA appropriations bill into law providing housing assistance to many  impoverished Americans. Unfortunately, while this bill is an improvement over the  initial House passed spending  levels,  it does not go far enough to address the needs of homeless individuals, tenants living in expiring Section 8 properties or distressed public housing, and  impoverished communities. To ensure that our government has the political will to invest adequately in housing assistance, we need to raise public consciousness about the unmet housing and community development needs and educate the public about the existing and proven programmatic and policy solutions that address these needs. One recent step to educate, organize, and mobilize Americans in this direction took place last Saturday, October 16th, when more than 10,000 volunteers in 150 cities joined together for the first ever National Raise the Roof Day. Under Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Andrew Cuomo’s  leadership,  they spent the day repairing and building homes. But they were also building something much bigger—a national awareness of one of  the most pressing problems facing our nation, the need for safe, decent and affordable housing. I would like to commend everyone who participated  in  this  landmark event.  In Washington, D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams, actress Sarah Jessica Parker, home improvement expert Bob Vila,  and  community  volunteers joined Secretary Cuomo  to repair homes  in the Columbia Heights community. In my home state of California, more than 1,800 volunteers repaired or built new homes for families in fifteen cities and counties. Similar events took place  throughout  the nation—led by  the nation’s mayors, national non-profits, local community and  faith based organizations, businesses, and impoverished Americans—themselves in need of affordable housing. Secretary Cuomo convened this Raise the Roof Day for three simple but important reasons. First, while we live at a time of record economic strength, a record number of people are  facing an affordable housing or home ownership crisis. There are still a record 5.3 million households with worst case housing needs, and two million units in need of major repairs. Despite a  record home ownership rate, home ownership for minorities and in cities still lags behind. Raise  the Roof Day also showed us  that there is something that we can do about this crisis. We are not helpless. We are not powerless, either as a nation, or as a community in confronting this challenge. Don’t listen to those who say that nothing works. There are many programs that are making a difference. HUD’s FHA  is expanding home ownership with a record 1.3 million  loans  insured  this year. HOPE VI grants are replacing the worst public housing with  livable communities. Americans can take action to organize and mobilize for adequate investments in affordable housing. And last year, in partnership with Congress, HUD won its best budget in a decade. And this year we’ve done  it again—a significant budget increase for HUD, that includes 60,000 new  affordable  housing  vouchers,  more money  for  the homeless, and  increases  in funds for Fair Housing and public housing. Finally, Raise the Roof Day celebrates the spirit of voluntarism—the spirit of community— that we need as a nation to tackle our toughest challenges. Government must provide the funds and the resources, but that’s only part of the solution. It’s when people come together to help  their neighbors  that we can  really make a difference. That’s how  this country was built, and that’s how we must take on this challenge as well. Mr. Speaker, Raise  the Roof Day was a rousing success. Americans need to become more  involved  in  these events. This  is an issue where we  can  really make  a  difference—and a cause that truly deserves our time and our energy. I look forward to similar events in the future. VerDate 12<OCT>99 04:00 Oct 26, 1999 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A25OC8.021 pfrm04 PsN: E25PT1 ",1999

491,House,106,-0.483,41,1999-11-04,Mrs. MEEK of Florida.," Madam Speaker, I am sure that those of my colleagues who have come to the floor and applauded this bill have tunnel vision, and their vision is directed toward the  large banking  institutions. Because their blindness does not  let them see to the right and left of them, they do not really see the people that are being affected by this bill most. I am opposed to this bill, that this bill brings in a strong element of discrimination, particularly in fair housing. Fair housing  is an area I have fought for since the 1960s. We finally got a bit of fair housing. Now, they come in and say to these big conglomerates they are going to let the insurance companies come in now; and they can do redlining, and they do not care, because it is not within the big prospectus of the bill. But now it is going to be even harder for people to get a house. If one cannot get insurance, I repeat, one cannot get a house. So what is that other than discrimination? The CRA language in this bill may have been worked on to some extent. But my colleagues were not able to see the forest through the trees.

492,House,106,-0.389,55,1999-11-04,Mrs. CAPPS.," Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this conference report. The laws governing our banking insurance and securities industries are woefully out of date. Congress has tried for years to update them and that goal is finally now being achieved with this legislation. This bill will ensure that America remains the world’s leader in financial  services and, more  importantly, it will bring consumers more choices at lower prices. We all know, though, that a major issue in this bill has been consumer privacy. The legislation before us takes a step forward, but many challenges remain. I am pleased that the conference report does not include the so-called medical privacy provisions that were in the House-passed bill. But  the conference report remains deficient in protections for consumers’ financial privacy. As the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. DINGELL) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MARKEY) have pointed out, the bill still does not allow consumers control over who has access to their financial information. Therefore, Congress must revisit privacy protections. However, overall the conference report remains a positive step forward for our economy, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

493,House,106,-0.303,62,1999-11-04,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Madam Speaker, I rise to support and speak about the financial services modernization conference report pending before us. In general, because  the  financial services industry  is undergoing sweeping changes— driven in part by domestic market forces, international  competition,  regulatory  judgments, and technological advances—we need to update our federal laws. The compromise legislation  that we are considering  represents a reasoned, middle ground  that strikes an appropriate balance by treating all segments of the financial services industry—banking, securities,  and  insurance—fairly  and  equitably. Among other things, this bill should increase competition, promote  innovation,  lower consumer costs, and allow the United States to maintain  its world  leadership  in  the  financial services  industry. From my perspective,  this legislation also benefits consumers and protects  them pragmatically, although not perfectly. The bill that we are voting on today contains a number of  important elements  that should be enacted into law. First, the legislation takes prudent steps to prevent  the  indiscriminate mixing of banking and commerce. As a result, we will prevent the development of the cozy relationships between financial firms and commercial companies that helped lead to the disruption of the Japanese banking system earlier this decade. Additionally, the legislation preserves the viability of the national bank charter and the role of the Treasury Department in regulating our financial system. The  bill  further  establishes  functional lines of financial regulation. As a result, regulators who know the  financial activities best will oversee them. Consumers will also receive new protections for their financial privacy as a result of this bill. For the first time, all financial institutions will have an ‘‘affirmative and continuing obligation’’ to respect the privacy of their customers, and the security and confidentiality of their personal  information. Additionally, when a customer first opens an account—and at least annually thereafter— financial institutions must clearly and conspicuously disclose their privacy policies and practices. The bill additionally protects and  improves our community development  laws. The  legislation  specifically  states  that ‘‘[n]othing in this Act shall be construed to repeal any provision of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.’’ Moreover, as a result of this soon-to-be law, banks will only be able to enter into new activities or merge if they are well capitalized, well managed, and in compliance with CRA. Finally, the legislation includes a number of other  important  consumer protections such as prohibitions against coercive sales practices, and mandatory disclosures abut the potential risks and the uninsured status of investment products and insurance policies. Banks must also make full disclosures of ATM fees. Each of these changes to current law is important, and Congress should pass this legislation to enact them. FEDERALHOMELOANBANKSYSTEMREFORM During the deliberations over this legislation, I also sought to ensure that every community shared in the rewards of financial modernization. As a result, this bill helps to guarantee that community banks will not be crowded out of the financial marketplace of tomorrow. The report before us grants community banks the same powers and rights that larger financial institutions have accumulated  through  regulatory orders, and allows them to organize in a manner  that best  fits an  institution’s business plans. Additionally, I assiduously worked to ensure that this legislation would not place small financial institutions at a competitive disadvantage. Another way that the bill helps small banks to compete and small communities to thrive is found in Title VI. I am especially pleased that this compromise agreement makes significant strides  in updating  the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHL.Bank) system. The bill ensures a vibrant system able to meet the challenges of the next century with modern rules and stateof-the-art financial products. America’s homebuyers, small business owners, small farmers, and small communities will benefit from a reinvigorated FHL.Bank system. Specifically,  the  legislation establishes voluntary membership on equal terms and conditions for all eligible institutions. The bill also expands access  to FHL.Bank advances  for community  financial  institutions, which  are banks and thrifts with less than $500 million in assets. The changes in allowable collateral for FHL.Bank advances  for community  financial institutions pave  the way  for enhanced  targeted economic development lending. There was much need for this reform. Even though Congress authorized economic development lending in 1989 and the Federal Housing Finance Board (Finance Board) wrote permissive  rules  to encourage  it,  the system’s collateral laws severely restricted such effects. It was as if we were simultaneously saying, ‘‘go make these loans, but they are illegal to use as collateral.’’ Now, as a result of this bill, a framework is in place for community financial institutions to offer safe, sound, and fully collateralized economic development loans.

494,,106,0.3,265,1999-11-04,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to honor and pay  tribute  to  the Miami-Dade County Fire and Rescue team for their efforts and contributions in international disaster responses. The team was created in 1985 to respond with search and rescue efforts  following  the earthquake  that  rocked Mexico City. Since then, the team has been called upon for disaster assistance throughout the world including Armenia, the Philippines, and El Salvador. They have also  responded  to emergencies closer to home including the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City, Hurricane George, and Hurricane Mitch. Most recently the Miami-Dade County Fire  and Rescue Team has assisted in earthquake disaster relief in Turkey and in Taipei, Taiwan. The Miami-Dade County Fire and Rescue Team has specialized equipment and K–9 units  trained  to  find people  trapped  in collapsed  buildings. Their  technical  response team members are experts  in vehicle extrication, confined space rescue, and rope rescue. Additionally, their department maintains a mass casualty bus and mobile command vehicle for large scale incident response. The contributions of  the Miami-Dade Fire and Rescue Team to the humanitarian relief community are invaluable. I know the House will  join me  in paying  tribute  to  this outstanding team of people and wish them continued success in their endeavors. f NATIONAL SECURITY SEALIFT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1999 HON.

495,,106,0.56,12,1999-11-11,Mrs. MYRICK.," Mr. Speaker, on the eve of Veterans Day, I rise to bring to the attention of  the House  the extraordinary accomplishments of Mack Drake. Mr. Drake, a recipient of the Silver Star, deserves recognition for his valiant bravery on behalf of the American people while a member of our Armed Forces. I am proud to represent Mr. Drake in Congress. Mack Drake, now 74, was a soldier defending freedom in the Pacific during World War II. One night during the invasion of Guam, the Japanese military engaged in a counterattack that wounded Mr. Drake and others, and left many killed. Despite his face and arm injuries, Mr. Drake refused to evacuate the area and stood his ground on behalf of  the United States. Mack Drake continued to fire until his ammunition was depleted, all  the while protecting  the  right  flank of his platoon. Even upon the realization that he had no bullets left, Mr. Drake continued  the  fight by using grenades to defend his troop. Because of Mack Drake’s unflappable bravery, lives were saved and a massacre was averted. Mr. Mack Drake is an outstanding and inspirational  individual. His bravery and courage during this operation and throughout his service to our country is admirable and should be commended. f TRIBUTE TO JOHN B. MCLENDON HON. JAMES E.

496,,106,-0.465,12,1999-11-11,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a basketball pioneer and a leading force in desegregating collegiate and professional athletics. I rise today to pay tribute to the extraordinary John B. McLendon. Although Coach Mac, as he was affectionately known, was diminutive in stature, his influence was gigantic  in  the game of giants. For most, 40 years in coaching with a career record of 523–165 is an outstanding achievement. For Coach Mac, it is only the beginning of the story. On the court, he led the men’s basketball programs at North Carolina Central, Hampton, Tennessee State and Kentucky State. During that  time he became  the  first coach  to win three straight NAIA Championships. He also amassed  four  conference and  two district championships. But it was his moves off the court that demonstrate Coach Mac’s  true grit. When he began his career as a basketball coach, the game was strictly segregated,  including national championship competitions. In 1950, he initiated and planned the mechanics for integrating black colleges into the NIAIA national tournament. During the first integrated national tournament  in 1953, his Tennessee State team won the first NAIA District 29 Championship. In 1954, the same team became the first NBCU  to participate  in a National  Invitation Tournament. Just 3 years later, his team won its first NAIA Championship. The success of his team and other HBCUs forced the NCAA to desegregate its national tournament. As a pioneer, Coach Mac blazed a trail of ‘‘firsts’’  that are unrivaled. Among  those accomplishments are his distinctions as: the first black to coach a professional basketball team, the first black to coach a predominantly white collegiate team, the first black coach on the Olympic coaching staff, and  the  first black coach to author a book on basketball. He also escorted Earl and Harold Hunter  to  tryouts with  the professional Washington Caps  in 1950, and they became the first black players to sign NBA contracts. Up until  the day of his death, October 9, 1999, Coach Mac was pursuing his  latest achievement, the establishment of the HBCU Heritage Museum and Hall of Fame. Just this year, Durham, NC was chosen as the site for this facility. He certainly will be one of its first inductees. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in honoring John B. McLendon. A towering figure in a profession of giants. f IN RECOGNITION OF THE DELEGATION FROM  CALIFORNIA’S  9TH CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT’S PARTICIPATION  IN THE VOICES AGAINST VIOLENCE YOUTH CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON, DC HON.

497,,106,0.339,19,1999-11-11,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the dedication of the new Klamath County Courthouse  in  the City of Klamath Falls, Oregon. The dedication of this building is much more than a celebration of an assemblage of bricks and mortar, it is a celebration of people who would not quit and who would not accept anything less than the best for their community. In 1993  the historic courthouse was  rendered useless by two earthquakes less than three months apart. Within a week after the second quake, all of  the employees were moved to a variety of venues and the work of the county and  the  justice system went  forward with great difficulty. People literally didn’t know how to determine where court was being held or where building permits were being issued. With no funds and no plans, the leaders and citizens of Klamath County  rolled up  their sleeves and got to work. In 1996 the Klamath County voters passed a bond issue to rebuild the  courthouse and build  the Government Center that opened in 1998. With the assistance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Klamath County was able  to repay $1.7 million worth of bonds. The journey of quickly moving out of the destroyed structure  to a variety of  temporary quarters  to  the new courthouse was a  long and arduous one. It goes without saying that the system kept working only because of the dedication of employees of the county and the justice system and  the elected officials who would not be deterred from their mission. Today three hard working county commissioners, Steve West, Bill Garrard, and Al Switzer are justifiably proud of the new courthouse, which features many new innovations such as video arraignment and video hearings. The architecture of  the building  is  remarkable in its aesthetic appeal. It is an impressive modern structure that remains loyal to its historic roots and the spirit of this resourceful western city. With grace and dignity, the Klamath County Courthouse declares that this is a community with high standards. As the house of justice in Klamath County, the courthouse has been dedicated to those who have paid a very dear price to preserve out system of laws and freedom, our veterans and fallen police officers. Proudly flying in the courthouse square are the  illuminated  flags of each branch of  the military as well as the POW/MIA flag. Seeing these flags flying brightly in the clear Klamath County breeze is an inspiration. A special area is dedicated to the memory of  fallen  law enforcement officers who have given their lives in the line of duty. Mr. Speaker, my enthusiasm for what Klamath County has achieved must be tempered with  the sobering  thought  that  the death of these fallen officers is a grim reminder that the price of justice and security is often very dear. To honor those fallen heroes, I would like to pause for a moment and ask that they each be remembered in a special way. John E. Lambert, Oregon State Police; Ernest M. Brown, Lakeview Police Department; David R. Sanchez, Lake County Sheriff’s Office; Richard C. Swan, Jr., Klamath Falls Police Department; Bret R. Clodfelter, Oregon State Police; Scott A. Lyons, Oregon State Police; and James D. Rector, Oregon State Police. The citizens of Klamath County will not forget the ultimate sacrifice offered by these fallen officers and neither should any of us in this revered body. It is truly fitting that the seat of justice in Klamath County proclaims every day that justice, freedom, and security are not to be taken for granted. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I salute the leaders and residents of Klamath County whose efforts to make this courthouse a reality have borne such remarkable fruit. This building will stand for a long time as a testimony to the rock-solid,  iron-willed  resolve of one of  the great communities of the West. I am proud of what the citizens of Klamath County have accomplished and proud  to have  the honor of serving them in Congress.

498,,106,-0.25,26,1999-11-11,Mr. SANDLIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a great American, a great Texan, and a great  friend. Thomas D.  ‘‘Tommy’’ Wells,  the  long-time County  Attorney  for Lamar County, Texas, died on October 15, 1999, will be sorely missed. Tommy served Lamar County as County Attorney for twenty years and will always be remembered as an exemplary public servant. But  I will remember Tommy as a  friend—a man dedicated to his family, committed to always doing the right thing. My friend Tommy was an inspiration to the people of East Texas. He graduated  from Paris High School and received his bachelor’s degree  from Baylor University. After graduating from law school at St. Mary’s University, he returned to Paris to practice law. Subsequently, Tommy won five consecutive elections to the County Attorney post. He was elected president of  the Texas County and District Attorney’s Association and also served on  the State Bar of Texas Grievance Committee.

499,,106,-0.182,33,1999-11-11,Mr. TANNER.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise and have spread on the pages of the CONGRESSIONALRECORD, an article on Mr. Lloyd Collier of Dyersburg, Tennessee. The article adequately describes Mr. Collier’s work at the Social Security Administration, as well as his outstanding service to his community. Over the years, Mr. Collier has been of tremendous service to our office. His vast knowledge, and his willingness to share it with our staff, has been a valuable asset to the residents of  the Eighth Congressional District. Just yesterday, he was instrumental in helping a constituent, who is stricken with cancer, obtain the benefits that are rightfully his. This is just one of the thousands of examples of the dedicated service he has aptly demonstrated during his 38 years of public service. So, it is with appreciation for his service that I include the text of an article published in the Dyersburg State-Gazette under the headline, ‘‘He’s making a difference.’’ [From the Dyersburg State-Gazette, Oct. 17, 1999] HE’SMAKINGADIFFERENCE At 60, most people are thinking about retirement and how big their Social Security checks might be. Not Lloyd Collier. He’s more interested in making sure other people get all of the Social Security benefits they’re entitled to receive. It’s a job he’s loved for more than 38 years. Working first as a claims representative and now as the Northwest Tennessee district manager with the Social Security Administration, Collier said he’s had countless opportunities to help people. One of his most memorable  cases happened  33 years  ago while he was a field representative in Florence, Ala. ‘‘I’ll never forget taking a survivor claim from a 13-year-old widow with one child less than 1 year of age,’’ he said. The girl had become pregnant when she was 11, married at 12 and a widow at 13. Her 22-year-old husband, who had no life insurance, was killed in a motorcycle wreck. ‘‘Social Security played a big part in the financial picture of that family,’’ he said ‘‘It’s something that you don’t forget. It’s a rare case, but things like this happen all over the nation.’’ Ironically, Collier will never receive the same benefits he has helped to disburse over the years. A long-time federal employee, Collier is covered by a civil service retirement plan instead of Social Security. Still, he’s earnestly trying to help in his characteristically quiet way. ‘‘I categorize him as being a quiet, dynamic person,’’  friend Wendell West said, ‘‘He’s not a  flamboyant  toastmaster-type person. (But) when you need a job to be done, he’s going to do it efficiently and without a drum roll.’’ That description applies not only to Collier’s job but also to the volunteer work he does with the Boy Scouts, the Civitan Club and his church. Collier, who was hired by the Social Security Administration the day before his 22nd birthday, looks at his career as a wonderful birthday present. ‘‘It’s been a good opportunity, and I like working with people, trying to help them resolve problems,’’ Collier said.  ‘‘I  love my job.’’ The career was happenstance. Collier—a man with a mechanical mind, a knack for math and a sharp attention to details—originally wanted to be a civil engineer. Unfortunately, he couldn’t afford to go to an engineering college. Instead, he pursued a bachelor’s degree at his hometown college: Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, where he majored in math and minored in physics. Although his college advisor encouraged him to get a teaching certificate, Collier wasn’t too excited about being a teacher. He also opted to take the civil service exam. The Social Security Administration called him in September 1961, just a few months after he graduated. Even with  the government  job, Collier couldn’t escape teaching. When he served as the assistant district manager in Dyersburg (a job he held from 1972–87), he was responsible for training new and promoted employees. ‘‘He has always gotten strong, rave reviews on his ability to teach,’’ said Bill McClure, deputy regional commissioner for the Social Security Administration’s office in Atlanta. Collier’s students reported being ‘‘very impressed with his overall knowledge of the program and his ability to communicate and effectively transfer that knowledge.’’ Collier also received high marks for his willingness to assist students on an  individual basis, McClure said. Collier was asked to teach classes not only in Dyersburg but in other cities, as well. It was Collier’s attention to detail that helped make him a good teacher, an alert claims  representative  and  now  an  outstanding district manager. ‘‘That’s a lot of what makes him so successful, because so much of the  (Social Security)  law  is detailed.’’ McClure said. Collier’s cordial, gentle manner also has contributed to his success. McClure said Collier often shares information with fellow Social Security managers in Memphis, Jackson and Nashville and he works closely with other retirement-related agencies, such as a railroad retirement system. ‘‘He is very professional in his approach to the public and he represents us very effectively in the community,’’ McClure said. Collier puts his teaching skills to work on a regular basis as a volunteer with the Boy Scouts. ‘‘He’s just as tolerant and patient of the boys as you can get.’’ Troop 87 assistant scoutmaster Franklin Robertson said. ‘‘One of the major things is at the times you prepare meals. He assists, directs and encourages the Scouts to prepare their meals. I’ve never seen anything but patience. ‘‘He works with the Scouts until they develop the skills they need.’’ Edgar Shults, also a leader in the local Boy Scout program agreed with Robertson. He said Collier is ‘‘real good with the boys. If he weren’t, he wouldn’t be in it. He’s a good, easy-going person and he enjoys working with people.’’ While Collier still attends Troop 87’s weekly meetings and joins them on camping trips, he also shares his knowledge with Scouts from all over West Tennessee. Collier holds knot-tying classes each year during the Cub Scout day camp at Dyersburg State Community College and started the sailing program at Camp Mack Morris, a residential Scout camp near Kentucky Lake. For one week each summer between 1989 and 1995, Collier introduced young boys to the thrills and quiet pleasures of sailing. Using his own 17-foot O’Day Sailor II, Collier taught the boys to hoist sails, to maneuver the boat and to turn the boat right-side-up if it ever turned over. The last lesson proved quite important one summer. A crosswind caught the boat’s sails and tipped it over. Collier said he and the five Scouts on board knew what they needed to do. They crawled on top of the keel and pulled.  Ideally, the sailors’ weight would push the keel down into the water while they pulled the mast back up. They had one small problem. ‘‘It’s just that the six of us didn’t weigh enough to get the job done,’’ Collier said. A road crew working on the lake shore saw the struggling Scouts and called a nearby marina for help. The sailboat was towed into shallow water, where it was easier for the Scouts to right the boat. Today, Camp Mack Morris has a fleet of six sailboats. The instructors are graduates of Collier’s first sailing course. Instead of attending Camp Mack Morris for the last four summers, Collier and his wife have traveled to Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico and participated in training programs for adult leaders. Collier has served as a Webelos leader, a cubmaster, an assistant scoutmaster and district commissioner in the past.

500,,106,0.54,40,1999-11-11,Mr. COX.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of a great man who has achieved a great milestone: the Honorable J. Jerome Plunkett, who will celebrate his 75th birthday tomorrow, November 11. A distinguished jurist, a decorated soldier, a patron of education, and a devoted husband and  father of eight children, Judge Plunkett has throughout his life been a leader for his nation, his state, his community, and his family. Born in St. Paul, Minnesota, one of five children of James P. and Anne Plunkett,  the young boy’s early experiences helped shape his extraordinary life. For his eighth birthday he traveled to Washington, D.C.—by train, for James P. was  the Solicitor General  for  the Great Northern Railroad—to watch his father argue a case before the nine Justices of the United States Supreme Court. Barely beginning third grade, Jerry Plunkett could not have known  then  that a quarter century  later he would begin his own career as a judge. But without doubt that lasting memory was one of several  influences  that propelled him  to  the law and the bench. That autumn Washington day  in 1932, as every one of Jerry Plunkett’s 75 birthdays, was Armistice Day. On the first Armistice Day, November 11, 1918, Americans had  celebrated the end of World War I, which officially concluded when the armistice was signed on the 11th hour of  the 11th day of  the 11th month. But the ‘‘war to end all wars’’ had done no such  thing. Just months after graduating from St. Thomas Military Academy in St. Paul, Jerry—then 18 years old—entered the United States Army, as  the storm clouds of World War II cast their dark shadow on America. He enrolled  in  the  Infantry Officers Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia, and rapidly rose through the ranks. By 1944, he was a First Lieutenant with the Second Infantry Division, destined to participate in the Allied invasion of France to liberate Europe. Lt. Plunkett, the infantryman, was wounded during  the monumental  struggle with Nazi forces at Normandy, code-named ‘‘Operation Overlord,’’  and  commanded  by  General Dwight D. Eisenhower. He would  later be decorated not only with a Purple Heart but the Bronze Star, but in June 1944 he continued to punch inland, securing safe landing zones for reinforcements,  and waged  the  campaign through France and into Germany. The German  failure  to successfully defend  the Normandy area from the Allied liberation forces in essence doomed Hitler’s dream of  ‘‘Fortress Europe,’’ and marked the beginning of the end for the Nazis. While Jerry survived the war, one of his two brothers, James F. Plunkett, did not. He was killed in action in France in 1944. With victory came peace, and Jerry Plunkett returned home like so many other veterans to start a new life, and begin a career. He chose the law. When he earned his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Minnesota, he went to work as a legal editor for the West Publishing Company, even  then a  long-established  firm (founded  in 1876) and  the  leading national provider of case law and statutes for all U.S. jurisdictions. His  interest  in  the  law was matched, however, by his  interest  in people and solving real-world problems, and barely two years later he had landed his first job in public policy, as the Assistant City Attorney for the City of St. Paul. As  barrister  for  the  state  capital,  Jerry Plunkett  earned  experience  in  prosecuting criminals and managing civil cases  in  the courtroom. By 1954, he was presiding over those same cases as the Honorable Jerome Plunkett, appointed by  the Municipal Court bench by then-Minnesota Governor C. Elmer Anderson. His progress and accomplishments on the bench were as swift and commendable as they had been on  the battlefield. He was made Chief Administrator of the court system.
